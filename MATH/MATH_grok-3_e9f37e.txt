Let’s solve the math problem step by step using the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories. The problem involves two quadratic functions, \( y = 3(x-h)^2 + j \) and \( y = 2(x-h)^2 + k \), with given y-intercepts and the condition that each has two positive integer x-intercepts. We need to find the value of \( h \).

### Problem Restatement
Find the value of \( h \) for the quadratic functions \( y = 3(x-h)^2 + j \) and \( y = 2(x-h)^2 + k \), where:
- The y-intercept of \( y = 3(x-h)^2 + j \) is 2013.
- The y-intercept of \( y = 2(x-h)^2 + k \) is 2014.
- Each function has two positive integer x-intercepts.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
1. Determine the y-intercepts of both functions in terms of \( h \), \( j \), and \( k \), and set them equal to 2013 and 2014, respectively.  
2. Express the x-intercepts of both functions by solving for when \( y = 0 \), ensuring they are positive integers.  
3. Use the condition that both functions share the same \( h \) to find relationships between the x-intercepts and solve for \( h \).  
4. Verify that the x-intercepts are positive integers and that all conditions are satisfied.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Goal**: Find the y-intercepts of both functions and express them using the given values.  
**How to Achieve**: Evaluate each function at \( x = 0 \) to find the y-intercept and set up equations based on the given y-intercept values (2013 and 2014).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the y-intercepts, substitute \( x = 0 \) into each function.  
For the first function, \( y = 3(x-h)^2 + j \):  
\[ y = 3(0-h)^2 + j = 3h^2 + j \]  
Given the y-intercept is 2013:  
\[ 3h^2 + j = 2013 \quad (1) \]

For the second function, \( y = 2(x-h)^2 + k \):  
\[ y = 2(0-h)^2 + k = 2h^2 + k \]  
Given the y-intercept is 2014:  
\[ 2h^2 + k = 2014 \quad (2) \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Goal**: Find the x-intercepts of both functions and ensure they are positive integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Set each function equal to zero and solve for \( x \). Since the x-intercepts are positive integers, express them in terms of \( h \), \( j \), and \( k \), and use the y-intercept equations to substitute for \( j \) and \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the x-intercepts, set \( y = 0 \).  
For the first function, \( y = 3(x-h)^2 + j = 0 \):  
\[ 3(x-h)^2 + j = 0 \]  
\[ (x-h)^2 = -\frac{j}{3} \]  
\[ x-h = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{j}{3}} \]  
\[ x = h \pm \sqrt{-\frac{j}{3}} \]  
From equation (1), \( j = 2013 - 3h^2 \), so:  
\[ (x-h)^2 = -\frac{2013 - 3h^2}{3} = \frac{3h^2 - 2013}{3} \]  
For the x-intercepts to be real, \( 3h^2 - 2013 \geq 0 \), so:  
\[ h^2 \geq \frac{2013}{3} = 671 \]  
\[ h \geq \sqrt{671} \approx 25.9 \]  
Since \( h \) is likely an integer (as x-intercepts are integers), test \( h \geq 26 \). The x-intercepts are:  
\[ x = h \pm \sqrt{\frac{3h^2 - 2013}{3}} \]  
For integer x-intercepts, \( \frac{3h^2 - 2013}{3} = h^2 - \frac{2013}{3} = h^2 - 671 \) must be a perfect square, say \( m^2 \):  
\[ h^2 - 671 = m^2 \]  
\[ h^2 - m^2 = 671 \]  
\[ (h - m)(h + m) = 671 \]  
Since 671 is prime (divisors: 1, 671), possible pairs for \( (h - m, h + m) \) are (1, 671) or (-1, -671). For positive \( h \):  
\[ h - m = 1, \quad h + m = 671 \]  
\[ 2h = 672 \implies h = 336 \]  
\[ m = 671 - h = 671 - 336 = 335 \]  
Check: \( h^2 - m^2 = 336^2 - 335^2 = (336 - 335)(336 + 335) = 1 \cdot 671 = 671 \).  
Then:  
\[ h^2 - 671 = 335^2 \]  
\[ \frac{3h^2 - 2013}{3} = h^2 - 671 = 335^2 \]  
\[ x = h \pm 335 = 336 \pm 335 \]  
\[ x = 671 \text{ or } x = 1 \]  
Both are positive integers.

For the second function, \( y = 2(x-h)^2 + k = 0 \):  
\[ 2(x-h)^2 + k = 0 \]  
\[ (x-h)^2 = -\frac{k}{2} \]  
From equation (2), \( k = 2014 - 2h^2 \):  
\[ (x-h)^2 = -\frac{2014 - 2h^2}{2} = \frac{2h^2 - 2014}{2} = h^2 - 1007 \]  
For real roots, \( h^2 - 1007 \geq 0 \):  
\[ h^2 \geq 1007 \approx 31.7^2 \implies h \geq 32 \]  
Let \( h^2 - 1007 = n^2 \):  
\[ h^2 - n^2 = 1007 \]  
\[ (h - n)(h + n) = 1007 \]  
Factorize 1007: \( 1007 = 19 \cdot 53 \). Possible pairs: (1, 1007), (19, 53). For positive \( h \):  
- \( h - n = 19, h + n = 53 \):  
\[ 2h = 72 \implies h = 36 \]  
\[ n = 53 - h = 53 - 36 = 17 \]  
Check: \( h^2 - n^2 = 36^2 - 17^2 = 1296 - 289 = 1007 \).  
\[ h^2 - 1007 = 17^2 \]  
\[ x = h \pm 17 = 36 \pm 17 \]  
\[ x = 53 \text{ or } x = 19 \]  
Both are positive integers.  
- Pair (1, 1007) gives \( h = 504 \), which we’ll test later if needed.

Since both functions share \( h \), test \( h = 336 \) for the second function:  
\[ h^2 - 1007 = 336^2 - 1007 = 112896 - 1007 = 111889 \]  
Check if 111889 is a perfect square: \( 334^2 = 111556 \), \( 335^2 = 112225 \). Since \( 111889 \) is not a perfect square, \( h = 336 \) doesn’t work for the second function. Try \( h = 36 \) for the first:  
\[ h^2 - 671 = 36^2 - 671 = 1296 - 671 = 625 = 25^2 \]  
\[ x = 36 \pm 25 = 61 \text{ or } 11 \]  
Both are positive integers.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( h \) such that both quadratic functions have y-intercepts 2013 and 2014 and two positive integer x-intercepts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine y-intercepts: \( 3h^2 + j = 2013 \), \( 2h^2 + k = 2014 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find x-intercepts by solving \( 3(x-h)^2 + j = 0 \) and \( 2(x-h)^2 + k = 0 \), ensuring positive integers.  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( h \) such that x-intercepts are integers for both functions.  
**Current Goal**: Verify if \( h = 36 \) satisfies all conditions for both functions, and check other possible \( h \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Goal**: Verify if \( h = 36 \) satisfies all conditions, and check if other values of \( h \) are needed.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( h = 36 \) into the y-intercept equations to find \( j \) and \( k \), confirm x-intercepts are positive integers, and test other possible \( h \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( h = 36 \):  
- First function:  
\[ j = 2013 - 3 \cdot 36^2 = 2013 - 3 \cdot 1296 = 2013 - 3888 = -1875 \]  
\[ y = 3(x-36)^2 - 1875 \]  
X-intercepts:  
\[ 3(x-36)^2 - 1875 = 0 \]  
\[ (x-36)^2 = \frac{1875}{3} = 625 = 25^2 \]  
\[ x-36 = \pm 25 \]  
\[ x = 36 + 25 = 61, \quad x = 36 - 25 = 11 \]  
Both 61 and 11 are positive integers.  
- Second function:  
\[ k = 2014 - 2 \cdot 36^2 = 2014 - 2 \cdot 1296 = 2014 - 2592 = -578 \]  
\[ y = 2(x-36)^2 - 578 \]  
X-intercepts:  
\[ 2(x-36)^2 - 578 = 0 \]  
\[ (x-36)^2 = \frac{578}{2} = 289 = 17^2 \]  
\[ x-36 = \pm 17 \]  
\[ x = 36 + 17 = 53, \quad x = 36 - 17 = 19 \]  
Both 53 and 19 are positive integers.  

Since \( h = 36 \) satisfies all conditions (y-intercepts and positive integer x-intercepts for both functions), it’s a candidate. Test \( h = 336 \) again for completeness:  
- Second function:  
\[ k = 2014 - 2 \cdot 336^2 = 2014 - 2 \cdot 112896 = 2014 - 225792 = -223778 \]  
\[ (x-336)^2 = \frac{-k}{2} = \frac{223778}{2} = 111889 \]  
Not a perfect square, so \( h = 336 \) fails. Other \( h \) values (e.g., from 1007 factors) yield non-integer or negative x-intercepts when tested similarly.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( h \) for the given quadratic functions.  
  - Subgoal 1: Y-intercepts: \( 3h^2 + j = 2013 \), \( 2h^2 + k = 2014 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: X-intercepts are positive integers. (Completed for \( h = 36 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( h \). (Candidate \( h = 36 \))

### Step 7: Reach Goal

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Goal**: Finalize the solution by stating the value of \( h \).  
**How to Achieve**: Summarize that \( h = 36 \) satisfies all conditions, and other values do not.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The value \( h = 36 \) satisfies all conditions:  
- Y-intercepts: \( 3 \cdot 36^2 - 1875 = 2013 \), \( 2 \cdot 36^2 - 578 = 2014 \).  
- X-intercepts: First function gives \( x = 61, 11 \); second function gives \( x = 53, 19 \), all positive integers.  
Other tested values (e.g., \( h = 336 \)) fail to produce integer x-intercepts for both functions. Thus, \( h = 36 \).
