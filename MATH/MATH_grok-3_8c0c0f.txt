### Problem Statement
We need to find the remainder when the product \( ab \) is divided by a positive integer \( n \), given that \( a \) and \( b \) are invertible integers modulo \( n \) and \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \). This means \( a \) is the modular inverse of \( b \), so \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). Our goal is to determine the remainder of \( ab \) when divided by \( n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve the problem systematically.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the given condition \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \) and clarify what it means for \( a \) and \( b \) to be invertible modulo \( n \).  
- Subgoal 2: Use the definition of modular inverse to express the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \).  
- Subgoal 3: Compute the product \( ab \) modulo \( n \) using the given condition.  
- Subgoal 4: Determine the remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the condition \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \) and the meaning of invertible integers modulo \( n \). To achieve this, we will define what it means for \( a \) and \( b \) to be invertible and interpret the modular inverse condition.

[IMP]  
An integer \( a \) is invertible modulo \( n \) if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( ax \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). This \( x \) is the modular inverse of \( a \), denoted \( a^{-1} \). Similarly, \( b \) is invertible if there exists a \( y \) such that \( by \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \), so \( y = b^{-1} \). The given condition \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \) means \( a \) is congruent to the modular inverse of \( b \). Thus, \( ab \equiv b \cdot b^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \), since the product of an integer and its modular inverse equals 1 modulo \( n \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the conclusion that \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). We will check if this follows directly from the given condition and definitions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \), we have \( a \) as the modular inverse of \( b \). By definition, if \( x = b^{-1} \), then \( bx \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). Substituting \( x = a \) (since \( a \equiv b^{-1} \)), we get \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). This confirms that the product \( ab \) is congruent to 1 modulo \( n \). The reasoning is consistent with the definition of modular inverse and the given condition.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \). Since \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \), we will use this to find the remainder.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The condition \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \) means there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( ab = kn + 1 \). When \( ab \) is divided by \( n \), the quotient is \( k \), and the remainder is 1, because \( ab = kn + 1 \). Thus, the remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \) is 1.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the condition \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \) and invertible integers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the relationship using modular inverse (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( ab \) modulo \( n \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the remainder (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align. The main goal has been addressed, as we concluded the remainder is 1.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the remainder is 1. We will retrieve and summarize information from previous steps related to the computation of \( ab \mod n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From Step 2, we established that \( a \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{n} \) means \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \), as \( a \) is the modular inverse of \( b \). In Step 3, we validated this by confirming \( ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \). In Step 4, we computed that \( ab = kn + 1 \), so the remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \) is 1. All steps consistently point to the remainder being 1.

### Final Answer
The remainder when \( ab \) is divided by \( n \) is 1.
