**Problem Statement:** Find the value of \(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{8}\).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem of adding the fractions \(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{8}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the denominators of the fractions.  
2. Find a common denominator.  
3. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator.  
4. Add the numerators and simplify the resulting fraction if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the denominators of the fractions.  
**How to Achieve:** Examine the given fractions \(\frac{1}{4}\) and \(\frac{3}{8}\) to determine their denominators.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The fraction \(\frac{1}{4}\) has a denominator of 4, and the fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\) has a denominator of 8.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find a common denominator for 4 and 8.  
**How to Achieve:** Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 8 using the prime factorization method or by checking multiples.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\), and the prime factorization of 8 is \(2^3\). The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime: \(2^3 = 8\). Thus, the common denominator is 8.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 8.  
**How to Achieve:** Convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a fraction with denominator 8 by multiplying both numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor. The fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\) already has the correct denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(\frac{1}{4}\), multiply both numerator and denominator by 2:  
\(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 2}{4 \times 2} = \frac{2}{8}\).  
The fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\) remains \(\frac{3}{8}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions and write the sum over the common denominator.  
**How to Achieve:** Add the numerators of \(\frac{2}{8}\) and \(\frac{3}{8}\), keeping the denominator as 8.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\(\frac{2}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2 + 3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Check if the fraction \(\frac{5}{8}\) is in its simplest form and verify the addition.  
**How to Achieve:** Ensure the numerator and denominator of \(\frac{5}{8}\) have no common factors other than 1. Verify the addition by checking the steps or using an alternative method (e.g., decimal conversion).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The numerator 5 is a prime number, and the denominator 8 (\(2^3\)) has no common factors with 5 other than 1. Thus, \(\frac{5}{8}\) is in its simplest form.  
To verify, convert to decimals: \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\), \(\frac{3}{8} = 0.375\). Adding: \(0.25 + 0.375 = 0.625\). Since \(\frac{5}{8} = 0.625\), the calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]
