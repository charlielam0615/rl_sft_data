### Problem Statement
Convert the number \( 135_7 \), which is in base 7, to its equivalent integer in base 10.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of converting \( 135_7 \) to base 10 into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the structure of a base 7 number.  
2. Identify the place values for each digit in \( 135_7 \).  
3. Calculate the base 10 equivalent by multiplying each digit by its corresponding place value and summing the results.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the structure of a base 7 number. This involves recognizing that each digit in \( 135_7 \) represents a power of 7 based on its position, with the rightmost digit as \( 7^0 \), the next as \( 7^1 \), and so on.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A base 7 number like \( 135_7 \) is expressed as a sum of its digits multiplied by powers of 7. For \( 135_7 \), the digits are 1, 3, and 5, with place values:
- 1 is in the \( 7^2 \) place.
- 3 is in the \( 7^1 \) place.
- 5 is in the \( 7^0 \) place.
This can be written as: \( 1 \cdot 7^2 + 3 \cdot 7^1 + 5 \cdot 7^0 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the place values for each digit in \( 135_7 \). This involves assigning the correct power of 7 to each digit based on its position.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( 135_7 \):
- The digit 1 is in the third position (from the right, starting at 0), so its place value is \( 7^2 \).
- The digit 3 is in the second position, so its place value is \( 7^1 \).
- The digit 5 is in the first position, so its place value is \( 7^0 \).
Thus, the expression is: \( 1 \cdot 7^2 + 3 \cdot 7^1 + 5 \cdot 7^0 \).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the base 10 equivalent by multiplying each digit by its corresponding place value and summing the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the expression \( 1 \cdot 7^2 + 3 \cdot 7^1 + 5 \cdot 7^0 \):
- \( 7^2 = 49 \), so \( 1 \cdot 49 = 49 \).
- \( 7^1 = 7 \), so \( 3 \cdot 7 = 21 \).
- \( 7^0 = 1 \), so \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \).
Sum the results: \( 49 + 21 + 5 = 75 \).
Thus, \( 135_7 = 75_{10} \).

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the calculation by verifying the conversion process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, recompute the conversion:
- \( 135_7 = 1 \cdot 7^2 + 3 \cdot 7^1 + 5 \cdot 7^0 = 1 \cdot 49 + 3 \cdot 7 + 5 \cdot 1 = 49 + 21 + 5 = 75 \).
Alternatively, convert back from base 10 to base 7:
- Divide 75 by 7: \( 75 \div 7 = 10 \) remainder 5.
- Divide 10 by 7: \( 10 \div 7 = 1 \) remainder 3.
- Divide 1 by 7: \( 1 \div 7 = 0 \) remainder 1.
- Read remainders bottom-up: 135, which matches \( 135_7 \).
The calculation is consistent, confirming \( 135_7 = 75_{10} \).

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Convert \( 135_7 \) to a base 10 integer.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the structure of a base 7 number (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the place values for each digit in \( 135_7 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the base 10 equivalent (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed).
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.
The result is \( 135_7 = 75_{10} \).

### Final Answer
\( 135_7 = 75_{10} \)
