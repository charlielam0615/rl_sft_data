### Problem Statement
Find the quadratic polynomial \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) such that \( p(-3) = 10 \), \( p(0) = 1 \), and \( p(2) = 5 \).

I will solve this problem by selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the quadratic polynomial.  
1. Assume the quadratic polynomial has the form \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \).  
2. Use the given conditions \( p(-3) = 10 \), \( p(0) = 1 \), and \( p(2) = 5 \) to set up a system of equations.  
3. Solve the system to find coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
4. Verify the solution by checking all given conditions.  
5. State the final polynomial.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a system of equations using the given conditions \( p(-3) = 10 \), \( p(0) = 1 \), and \( p(2) = 5 \). This will be achieved by substituting each \( x \)-value into the quadratic \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) to form three equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute the given points into \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \):  
1. For \( p(-3) = 10 \):  
   \( p(-3) = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 9a - 3b + c = 10 \)  
2. For \( p(0) = 1 \):  
   \( p(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 1 \)  
3. For \( p(2) = 5 \):  
   \( p(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 4a + 2b + c = 5 \)  

The system of equations is:  
- \( 9a - 3b + c = 10 \)  
- \( c = 1 \)  
- \( 4a + 2b + c = 5 \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). This will be achieved by substituting \( c = 1 \) into the other equations and solving the resulting system for \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the second equation, \( c = 1 \). Substitute \( c = 1 \) into the other equations:  
- First equation: \( 9a - 3b + 1 = 10 \implies 9a - 3b = 9 \implies 3a - b = 3 \) (divide by 3).  
- Third equation: \( 4a + 2b + 1 = 5 \implies 4a + 2b = 4 \implies 2a + b = 2 \) (divide by 2).  

Now solve the system:  
- \( 3a - b = 3 \)  
- \( 2a + b = 2 \)  

Add the equations to eliminate \( b \):  
\( (3a - b) + (2a + b) = 3 + 2 \implies 5a = 5 \implies a = 1 \).  

Substitute \( a = 1 \) into \( 2a + b = 2 \):  
\( 2(1) + b = 2 \implies 2 + b = 2 \implies b = 0 \).  

Thus, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \).  
The polynomial is \( p(x) = x^2 + 0x + 1 = x^2 + 1 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( p(x) = x^2 + 1 \) satisfies all given conditions: \( p(-3) = 10 \), \( p(0) = 1 \), and \( p(2) = 5 \). This will be achieved by substituting each \( x \)-value into \( p(x) \) and checking the results.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check each condition:  
1. \( p(-3) = (-3)^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \). Satisfied.  
2. \( p(0) = (0)^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \). Satisfied.  
3. \( p(2) = (2)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \). Satisfied.  

The polynomial \( p(x) = x^2 + 1 \) satisfies all conditions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the quadratic polynomial \( p(x) \) such that \( p(-3) = 10 \), \( p(0) = 1 \), and \( p(2) = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Assume \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up a system of equations using the given conditions. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). (Completed: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution. (Completed: \( p(x) = x^2 + 1 \) satisfies all conditions)  
  - Subgoal 5: State the final polynomial. (Current goal)  

**Current Goal**: State the final polynomial.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to state the final quadratic polynomial based on the solved coefficients. This will be achieved by presenting the polynomial in standard form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The quadratic polynomial is \( p(x) = x^2 + 1 \).

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{p(x) = x^2 + 1} \]
