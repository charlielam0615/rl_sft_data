**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to determine the degree of the polynomial \(2f(x) + 4g(x)\), where \(f(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 3 and \(g(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 5.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. First, understand the properties of polynomial degrees. Then, analyze how the operations (multiplying by constants and adding polynomials) affect the degree. Finally, determine the degree of the resulting polynomial.

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Understand the effect of constants and addition on polynomial degrees.  
To achieve this, recall the definition of a polynomial's degree and the rules for scalar multiplication and polynomial addition. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \(x\) with a non-zero coefficient. Multiplying by a constant scales the coefficients but does not change the degree. When adding polynomials, the degree of the sum is generally the maximum of the degrees, unless leading terms cancel out.

A polynomial \(f(x)\) of degree 3 can be written as \(f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\), where \(a_3 \neq 0\). Similarly, \(g(x)\) of degree 5 is \(g(x) = b_5 x^5 + b_4 x^4 + b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0\), where \(b_5 \neq 0\).  
- Scalar multiplication: \(2f(x) = 2a_3 x^3 + 2a_2 x^2 + 2a_1 x + 2a_0\), still degree 3 since the highest power remains \(x^3\).  
- Scalar multiplication: \(4g(x) = 4b_5 x^5 + 4b_4 x^4 + 4b_3 x^3 + 4b_2 x^2 + 4b_1 x + 4b_0\), still degree 5 since the highest power remains \(x^5\).  
- Addition: For \(2f(x) + 4g(x)\), we combine like terms. The highest term in \(2f(x)\) is \(2a_3 x^3\), and in \(4g(x)\) is \(4b_5 x^5\). When adding, we get terms like \(4b_5 x^5 + \text{lower-degree terms}\), but we need to consider if the leading terms could cancel out. Since \(f(x)\) has no \(x^5\) term, the \(x^5\) term in the sum is simply \(4b_5 x^5\), and \(4b_5 \neq 0\) because \(b_5 \neq 0\). Thus, the degree is determined by the \(x^5\) term.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm the degree of the resulting polynomial.  
To achieve this, double-check the reasoning about the leading terms and consider edge cases, such as whether cancellation of the highest-degree term is possible.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The polynomial \(2f(x) + 4g(x)\) has the form:  
\(2f(x) + 4g(x) = (2a_3 x^3 + 2a_2 x^2 + 2a_1 x + 2a_0) + (4b_5 x^5 + 4b_4 x^4 + 4b_3 x^3 + 4b_2 x^2 + 4b_1 x + 4b_0)\).  
Combining like terms, the highest-degree term is \(4b_5 x^5\), where \(4b_5 \neq 0\) since \(b_5 \neq 0\). There is no \(x^5\) term in \(2f(x)\) to cancel it out. Thus, the degree of the sum is 5, as the \(x^5\) term dominates.  
Edge case: Cancellation of leading terms could reduce the degree, but here, \(f(x)\) has degree 3 and contributes no \(x^5\) term, so the \(4b_5 x^5\) term remains non-zero. Therefore, the degree of \(2f(x) + 4g(x)\) is 5.
