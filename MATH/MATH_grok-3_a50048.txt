**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((5 - 3i)(-4 + 3i)\), where \(i\) is the imaginary unit satisfying \(i^2 = -1\). The goal is to compute the product and express the result in the standard form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To simplify \((5 - 3i)(-4 + 3i)\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Multiply the complex numbers using the distributive property (FOIL method).  
2. Simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms and using \(i^2 = -1\).  
3. Express the final result in standard form \(a + bi\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the complex numbers \((5 - 3i)\) and \((-4 + 3i)\) using the distributive property. This involves applying the FOIL method to expand the product into terms, then simplifying using \(i^2 = -1\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply the distributive property (FOIL):  
\((5 - 3i)(-4 + 3i) = 5 \cdot (-4) + 5 \cdot 3i + (-3i) \cdot (-4) + (-3i) \cdot 3i\)  
Calculate each term:  
- \(5 \cdot (-4) = -20\)  
- \(5 \cdot 3i = 15i\)  
- \((-3i) \cdot (-4) = 12i\)  
- \((-3i) \cdot 3i = -9i^2\)  

Since \(i^2 = -1\), compute \(-9i^2 = -9 \cdot (-1) = 9\).  
Combine all terms:  
\(-20 + 15i + 12i + 9 = -20 + 9 + 15i + 12i = -11 + 27i\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the product \(-11 + 27i\). This involves rechecking the calculations and ensuring the expression is in standard form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate the product to validate:  
\((5 - 3i)(-4 + 3i) = 5 \cdot (-4) + 5 \cdot 3i + (-3i) \cdot (-4) + (-3i) \cdot 3i\)  
- First: \(5 \cdot (-4) = -20\)  
- Outer: \(5 \cdot 3i = 15i\)  
- Inner: \((-3i) \cdot (-4) = 12i\)  
- Last: \((-3i) \cdot 3i = -9i^2 = -9 \cdot (-1) = 9\)  

Combine: \(-20 + 15i + 12i + 9 = -20 + 9 + 27i = -11 + 27i\).  
The calculations match the previous result. The expression \(-11 + 27i\) is in standard form \(a + bi\), where \(a = -11\) and \(b = 27\).
