**Problem Statement:** Find the smallest positive value of \( x \) such that \( x + 5678 \) results in a number that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 1221, 5665).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the smallest positive \( x \) such that \( x + 5678 \) is a palindrome.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the properties of a palindrome and define what \( x + 5678 \) must satisfy.  
- Subgoal 2: Express \( x + 5678 \) mathematically and set up conditions for it to be a palindrome.  
- Subgoal 3: Develop a method to find the smallest positive \( x \) that satisfies these conditions.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution and ensure it is the smallest possible value.

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Understand the properties of a palindrome and define what \( x + 5678 \) must satisfy.  
- **How to Achieve:** A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. Since 5678 is a 4-digit number, \( x + 5678 \) will likely be a 4-digit or 5-digit number (or higher if \( x \) is large). We need \( x + 5678 = n \), where \( n \) is a palindrome. Start by assuming \( n \) is a 4-digit or 5-digit palindrome and express \( x = n - 5678 \).

A palindrome is a number that is identical when its digits are reversed. For example, if \( n = x + 5678 \), and \( n \) is a 4-digit palindrome like \( abba \), then \( n = 1000a + 100b + 10b + a = 1001a + 110b \). If \( n \) is a 5-digit palindrome like \( abcba \), then \( n = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10b + a = 10001a + 1010b + 100c \). Since \( x \) is positive, \( n \geq 5678 \). We will test palindromes starting from the smallest possible 4-digit palindrome greater than or equal to 5678 and compute \( x = n - 5678 \), ensuring \( x > 0 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Express \( x + 5678 \) mathematically and set up conditions for it to be a palindrome.  
- **How to Achieve:** Assume \( n = x + 5678 \) is a palindrome. Since 5678 is a 4-digit number, start by testing 4-digit palindromes \( n \geq 5678 \). Represent a 4-digit palindrome as \( abba \), compute \( x = n - 5678 \), and check if \( x \) is positive. If no 4-digit palindromes yield a positive \( x \), try 5-digit palindromes.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Letâ€™s try 4-digit palindromes of the form \( abba \), where \( a = 1 \) to \( 9 \), \( b = 0 \) to \( 9 \), so \( n = 1000a + 100b + 10b + a = 1001a + 110b \). Since \( n \geq 5678 \), we need \( 1001a + 110b \geq 5678 \). Compute \( x = n - 5678 \).  
Start with the smallest 4-digit palindrome \( n \geq 5678 \):  
- For \( a = 5, b = 6 \), \( n = 1001 \cdot 5 + 110 \cdot 6 = 5005 + 660 = 5665 \).  
- Check: \( x = 5665 - 5678 = -13 \), which is not positive.  
Try the next palindrome:  
- For \( a = 5, b = 7 \), \( n = 1001 \cdot 5 + 110 \cdot 7 = 5005 + 770 = 5775 \).  
- Check: \( x = 5775 - 5678 = 97 \), which is positive.  
Verify \( n = 5775 \): Digits are 5,7,7,5, which is a palindrome.  
Check smaller palindromes (e.g., \( a = 5, b = 6 \)): \( 5665 \) gave a negative \( x \), so try others:  
- \( a = 6, b = 0 \), \( n = 1001 \cdot 6 + 110 \cdot 0 = 6006 \), \( x = 6006 - 5678 = 328 \).  
Since 97 < 328, try to confirm if 5775 is the smallest palindrome yielding a positive \( x \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate if \( x = 97 \) (with \( n = 5775 \)) is the smallest positive \( x \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Check all 4-digit palindromes between 5678 and 5775 to ensure no smaller palindrome yields a positive \( x \). If none exist, consider 5-digit palindromes to confirm minimality.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
List 4-digit palindromes \( n = 1001a + 110b \) where \( 5678 \leq n \leq 5775 \):  
- \( a = 5, b = 6 \): \( n = 5665 \), \( x = 5665 - 5678 = -13 \) (not positive).  
- \( a = 5, b = 7 \): \( n = 5775 \), \( x = 5775 - 5678 = 97 \) (positive).  
Check intermediate palindromes:  
- No \( b = 7, 8, \ldots, 9 \) with \( a = 5 \) gives \( 5665 < n < 5775 \).  
- Try \( a = 6, b = 0 \): \( n = 6006 \), which is > 5775.  
Since no 4-digit palindrome between 5665 and 5775 exists (as \( b \) increments by 1, the next palindrome after 5665 is 5775), try the next smallest palindrome after 5665:  
- \( a = 5, b = 7 \): Already checked (5775).  
Now consider 5-digit palindromes (form \( abcba \), \( n = 10001a + 1010b + 100c \)):  
- Smallest 5-digit palindrome: \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \), \( n = 10001 \cdot 1 = 10001 \).  
- \( x = 10001 - 5678 = 4323 \), which is > 97.  
Since no 4-digit palindrome between 5665 and 5775 yields a positive \( x \), and the smallest 5-digit palindrome gives a larger \( x \), \( x = 97 \) appears to be the smallest.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify if \( x = 97 \) is the smallest positive \( x \).  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to palindromes tested and their corresponding \( x \) values.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
From previous steps:  
- Tested 4-digit palindrome \( n = 5665 \): \( x = -13 \) (not positive).  
- Tested 4-digit palindrome \( n = 5775 \): \( x = 97 \) (positive).  
- Tested 4-digit palindrome \( n = 6006 \): \( x = 328 \) (positive).  
- Tested 5-digit palindrome \( n = 10001 \): \( x = 4323 \) (positive).  
- No 4-digit palindromes between 5665 and 5775 exist due to the discrete nature of \( n = 1001a + 110b \).  
The smallest positive \( x \) found is 97, corresponding to \( n = 5775 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Finalize the solution by confirming \( x = 97 \) and verifying \( n = 5775 \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute \( x + 5678 \) for \( x = 97 \), confirm it is a palindrome, and restate the minimality based on previous checks.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute: \( x = 97 \), so \( n = 97 + 5678 = 5775 \).  
Check if 5775 is a palindrome: Digits are 5,7,7,5, which reads the same forwards and backwards.  
From Step 5 and Step 6, no 4-digit palindrome less than 5775 yields a positive \( x \), and the smallest 5-digit palindrome gives \( x = 4323 \), which is larger than 97. Thus, \( x = 97 \) is the smallest positive value.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**  
The smallest positive value of \( x \) such that \( x + 5678 \) is a palindrome is \( \boxed{97} \).
