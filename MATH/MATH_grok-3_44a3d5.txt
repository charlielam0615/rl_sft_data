[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve this optimization problem, we need to break it down into intermediate subgoals that guide us toward finding the minimum value of the expression under the given constraint. The subgoals are:  
1. Understand the objective function and constraint.  
2. Formulate the problem mathematically, considering whether to use calculus (e.g., Lagrange multipliers) or algebraic methods (e.g., symmetry or inequalities).  
3. Explore possible configurations of \( a, b, c, d \) that minimize the sum of squares while satisfying \( a + b + c + d = 1 \).  
4. Verify the solution by checking critical points or boundary conditions.  
5. Confirm the minimum by comparing values at different configurations.

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal**: Find the minimum value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) subject to \( a + b + c + d = 1 \), with \( a, b, c, d \geq 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the objective function and constraint.  
  - Subgoal 2: Formulate the problem mathematically (e.g., using calculus or algebraic methods).  
  - Subgoal 3: Explore configurations of \( a, b, c, d \) to minimize the sum.

  - Subgoal 5: Confirm the minimum by comparing values.  

**Current Goal**: Understand the objective function and constraint (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the objective function and constraint.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the expression \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) and the constraint \( a + b + c + d = 1 \). Recognize that this is a minimization problem with a linear constraint and nonnegative variables, suggesting optimization techniques like Lagrange multipliers or testing symmetric/boundary cases.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The objective function \( f(a, b, c, d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) is the sum of squares, which measures the "spread" of the variables. Since \( a^2 \geq 0 \), the function is minimized when the variables are as small as possible while satisfying \( a + b + c + d = 1 \) and \( a, b, c, d \geq 0 \). Intuitively, distributing the sum equally (e.g., \( a = b = c = d \)) or concentrating it in fewer variables (e.g., one variable is 1, others are 0) are potential candidates for the minimum, as the square function penalizes larger values more heavily.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To proceed, refine the approach by focusing on mathematical formulation and testing configurations:  
1. Test the symmetric case where \( a = b = c = d \), as equal distribution often minimizes sums of squares due to symmetry.  
2. Consider boundary cases where some variables are zero (e.g., \( a = 1, b = c = d = 0 \)) to check if the minimum occurs at the edges.  
3. Apply an optimization technique, such as Lagrange multipliers, to find critical points in the interior.  
4. Compare the values from these cases to identify the minimum.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Test the symmetric case where \( a = b = c = d \).  
**How to Achieve**: Set \( a = b = c = d \), use the constraint to find their values, and compute the objective function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume \( a = b = c = d = k \). The constraint gives:  
\[ a + b + c + d = 4k = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{4} \].  
Then, the objective function is:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \].  
So, when \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \), the sum of squares is \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Test boundary cases where some variables are zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Set one variable to 1 and the others to 0, and compute the objective function to compare with the symmetric case.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider \( a = 1, b = c = d = 0 \). The constraint holds:  
\[ 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \].  
The objective function is:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 \].  
Similarly, setting any one variable to 1 (e.g., \( b = 1, a = c = d = 0 \)) yields the same result. Now try two variables, e.g., \( a = b = \frac{1}{2}, c = d = 0 \):  
\[ a + b + c + d = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 0 + 0 = 1 \].  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \].  
The boundary case with one variable at 1 gives a larger value (1) than the symmetric case (\( \frac{1}{4} \)), but two variables at \( \frac{1}{2} \) give \( \frac{1}{2} \), which is still larger than \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the objective function values computed for different configurations to assess which is the smallest.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Compare objective function values.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Symmetric case (\( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \)): \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).  
- Boundary case (\( a = 1, b = c = d = 0 \)): \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 \).  
- Boundary case (\( a = b = \frac{1}{2}, c = d = 0 \)): \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).  
The symmetric case yields the smallest value so far (\( \frac{1}{4} \)).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The symmetric case gives a promising result (\( \frac{1}{4} \)), but we need to ensure itâ€™s the minimum by considering the interior of the domain using an optimization technique like Lagrange multipliers. Adjust subgoals to:  
1. Apply Lagrange multipliers to find critical points in the interior (\( a, b, c, d > 0 \)).  
2. Verify if the symmetric case is indeed the minimum by comparing with other critical points or boundaries.  
3. Conclude with the minimum value and corresponding variables.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Apply Lagrange multipliers to find critical points in the interior.  
**How to Achieve**: Define the Lagrangian with the objective function and constraint, compute partial derivatives, and solve the resulting system.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define the Lagrangian:  
\[ \mathcal{L}(a, b, c, d, \lambda) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + \lambda (1 - a - b - c - d) \].  
Take partial derivatives:  
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a} = 2a - \lambda = 0 \implies a = \frac{\lambda}{2}, \]  
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} = 2b - \lambda = 0 \implies b = \frac{\lambda}{2}, \]  
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c} = 2c - \lambda = 0 \implies c = \frac{\lambda}{2}, \]  
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d} = 2d - \lambda = 0 \implies d = \frac{\lambda}{2}, \]  
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = 1 - a - b - c - d = 0 \implies a + b + c + d = 1. \]  
From the first four equations, \( a = b = c = d = \frac{\lambda}{2} \). Substitute into the constraint:  
\[ 4 \cdot \frac{\lambda}{2} = 1 \implies 2\lambda = 1 \implies \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \].  
Thus, \( a = b = c = d = \frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \). Compute the objective function:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \].  
This matches the symmetric case.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify if \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \) is the minimum by checking the nature of the critical point and boundaries.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the second derivative test for the Lagrangian or compare with boundary values to confirm the minimum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The objective function \( f(a, b, c, d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) is convex (since the Hessian has positive eigenvalues: the second derivatives are \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial a^2} = 2 \), etc., and cross derivatives are 0). For a convex function with a linear constraint, any critical point is a global minimum in the interior. Since \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \) is a critical point, and boundary cases (e.g., \( a = 1, b = c = d = 0 \rightarrow 1 \); \( a = b = \frac{1}{2}, c = d = 0 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \)) yield larger values, this suggests \( \frac{1}{4} \) is the minimum.  
To further confirm, consider the inequality:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \geq \frac{(a + b + c + d)^2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}, \]  
by the QM-AM inequality, with equality when \( a = b = c = d \). Since \( a + b + c + d = 1 \), equality holds at \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \), confirming this is the minimum.

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Conclude with the minimum value and corresponding variables.  
**How to Achieve**: Summarize the findings, state the minimum value, and specify the values of \( a, b, c, d \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The minimum value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), achieved when \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \). This is confirmed by:  
- The symmetric case computation (\( \frac{1}{4} \)).  
- Boundary case comparisons (all yielding \( \geq \frac{1}{4} \)).  
- Lagrange multipliers identifying the critical point at \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \).  
- The QM-AM inequality, where equality holds at \( a = b = c = d \).  
Thus, the minimum value is \( \frac{1}{4} \), attained when \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The minimum value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) subject to \( a + b + c + d = 1 \) and \( a, b, c, d \geq 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), achieved when \( a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{4} \).
