**Problem Statement**: Solve the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
3x - 5y &= -1.5, \\
7x + 2y &= 4.7,
\end{align*}
and express the solution as an ordered pair \((x, y)\) in decimal form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving the system of equations into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Choose a method to solve the system (e.g., substitution, elimination, or matrices).  
2. Apply the chosen method to find values for \(x\) and \(y\).  
3. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equations.  
4. Express the solution as an ordered pair in decimal form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to choose a method to solve the system of equations. I will use the elimination method because the coefficients of the variables suggest it can efficiently eliminate one variable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The elimination method involves manipulating the equations to cancel out one variable. Examining the system:
\begin{align*}
3x - 5y &= -1.5, \\
7x + 2y &= 4.7,
\end{align*}
the coefficients of \(y\) (-5 and 2) can be made equal in magnitude by multiplying the second equation by 2.5. This will allow us to eliminate \(y\) by adding the equations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the elimination method to solve for one variable. I will multiply the second equation by 2.5 to make the \(y\)-coefficients opposites, then add the equations to eliminate \(y\) and solve for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Multiply the second equation \(7x + 2y = 4.7\) by 2.5:  
\[ 2.5 \cdot (7x + 2y) = 2.5 \cdot 4.7 \]  
\[ 17.5x + 5y = 11.75. \]  
Now, the system is:  
\begin{align*}
3x - 5y &= -1.5, \\
17.5x + 5y &= 11.75.
\end{align*}  
Add the equations to eliminate \(y\):  
\[ (3x - 5y) + (17.5x + 5y) = -1.5 + 11.75, \]  
\[ 20.5x = 10.25. \]  
Solve for \(x\):  
\[ x = \frac{10.25}{20.5} = 0.5. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \(y\) using the value of \(x = 0.5\). I will substitute \(x = 0.5\) into the second original equation to find \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 0.5\) into \(7x + 2y = 4.7\):  
\[ 7(0.5) + 2y = 4.7, \]  
\[ 3.5 + 2y = 4.7, \]  
\[ 2y = 4.7 - 3.5 = 1.2, \]  
\[ y = \frac{1.2}{2} = 0.6. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(x = 0.5\), \(y = 0.6\) by substituting into both original equations to ensure they hold true.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the first equation \(3x - 5y = -1.5\):  
\[ 3(0.5) - 5(0.6) = 1.5 - 3 = -1.5. \]  
This satisfies the equation.  
Check the second equation \(7x + 2y = 4.7\):  
\[ 7(0.5) + 2(0.6) = 3.5 + 1.2 = 4.7. \]  
This also satisfies the equation. The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve the system of equations and express the solution as an ordered pair in decimal form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Choose a method (completed: chose elimination).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the method to find \(x\) and \(y\) (completed: found \(x = 0.5\), \(y = 0.6\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: solution verified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the solution as an ordered pair (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution as an ordered pair in decimal form.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the solution \(x = 0.5\), \(y = 0.6\) as an ordered pair in decimal form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The solution to the system of equations is \(x = 0.5\), \(y = 0.6\). Expressed as an ordered pair: \((0.5, 0.6)\).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The solution to the system of equations is \((0.5, 0.6)\).
