### Problem Statement
The task is to find the product of the fractions \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the operation required to find the product of two fractions.  
2. Multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions.  
3. Simplify the resulting fraction, if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the fractions \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\). To achieve this, multiply the numerators (1 × 3) to get the new numerator and the denominators (5 × 7) to get the new denominator, forming the product as a single fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the product of \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\):  
- Multiply the numerators: \(1 \times 3 = 3\).  
- Multiply the denominators: \(5 \times 7 = 35\).  
- The product is \(\frac{3}{35}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the product \(\frac{3}{35}\). Check if the multiplication was performed correctly and if the result can be simplified.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Verify the multiplication: \(\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{3}{7} = \frac{1 \times 3}{5 \times 7} = \frac{3}{35}\). The calculation is correct.  
- Check for simplification: The numerator (3) is a prime number, and the denominator (35 = 5 × 7) has no common factors with 3 other than 1. Thus, \(\frac{3}{35}\) is in its simplest form.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the product of \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the operation (multiply fractions) — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply numerators and denominators — Completed (\(\frac{3}{35}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the result, if necessary — Completed (result is already simplified).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the completed subgoals.  
The product \(\frac{3}{35}\) has been calculated and validated as correct and simplified.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The product of \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\) is \(\frac{3}{35}\).
