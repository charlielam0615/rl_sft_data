### Problem Restatement

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation to make it easier to analyze.  
**How to Achieve**: Manipulate the equation \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc\) algebraically to derive an equivalent form that reveals constraints or patterns for \(a, b, c\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc \]  
Rearrange all terms to one side:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0 \]  
Rewrite the equation by grouping terms. Notice that it resembles a sum of squared differences. Let’s try to express it in a more structured form:  
\[ a^2 - ab - ac + b^2 - bc + c^2 = 0 \]  
This can be rewritten as:  
\[ (a^2 - ab - ac + bc) + (b^2 - bc) + c^2 = 0 \]  
Factorize the first group:  
\[ a^2 - ab - ac + bc = a(a - b) - c(a - b) = (a - b)(a - c) \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ (a - b)(a - c) + (b^2 - bc) + c^2 = 0 \]  
Now factorize the second group:  
\[ b^2 - bc = b(b - c) \]  
So the equation is:  
\[ (a - b)(a - c) + b(b - c) + c^2 = 0 \]  
This form is still complex. Let’s try another approach by completing the square or testing symmetry. Alternatively, consider the equation as a quadratic in one variable. Let’s test with specific values to gain insight, but first, let’s try to rewrite the original equation differently:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0 \]  
Multiply both sides by 2 to facilitate completing the square:  
\[ 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc = 0 \]  
Rearrange:  
\[ (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + (a^2 - 2ac + c^2) + (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \]  
Since:  
\[ a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2, \quad a^2 - 2ac + c^2 = (a - c)^2, \quad b^2 - 2bc + c^2 = (b - c)^2 \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ (a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \]  
Substitute \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc\) into the right-hand side:  
\[ (a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2 = ab + ac + bc \]  
This form suggests a relationship between the pairwise differences and the original sum. Let’s explore this further in the next step.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify if the transformed equation provides insight into possible solutions and check its validity.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute specific values for \(a, b, c\) within the constraints \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 100\) into both the original and transformed equations to confirm equivalence and identify patterns.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test the original equation \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc\) with specific values:  
- Case 1: \(a = b = c = 1\)  
  Left: \(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\)  
  Right: \(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\)  
  Holds true.  
- Case 2: \(a = b = c = k\) (generalize)  
  Left: \(k^2 + k^2 + k^2 = 3k^2\)  
  Right: \(k \cdot k + k \cdot k + k \cdot k = k^2 + k^2 + k^2 = 3k^2\)  
  This holds for any positive integer \(k\). Since \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), triples like \((k, k, k)\) are solutions.  
- Case 3: \(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3\)  
  Left: \(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14\)  
  Right: \(1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3 = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11\)  
  Does not hold.  
Now test the transformed equation \((a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2 = ab + ac + bc\):  
- For \(a = b = c = 1\):  
  Left: \((1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\)  
  Right: \(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3\)  
  This does not hold, indicating a possible error in the transformation. Let’s correct our approach by reverting to the original equation and trying a different manipulation.  
Instead, rewrite the original equation:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0 \]  
Consider it as a quadratic in \(a\):  
\[ a^2 - (b + c)a + (b^2 + c^2 - bc) = 0 \]  
The discriminant for \(a\) must be a perfect square for \(a\) to be an integer:  
\[ \Delta = (b + c)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (b^2 + c^2 - bc) = b^2 + 2bc + c^2 - 4b^2 - 4c^2 + 4bc = 6bc - 3b^2 - 3c^2 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ \Delta = -3(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc) = -3(b - c)^2 \]  
Since the discriminant must be non-negative and a perfect square, and \((b - c)^2 \geq 0\), we have:  
\[ -3(b - c)^2 \geq 0 \implies (b - c)^2 = 0 \implies b = c \]  
If \(b = c\), substitute into the original equation:  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + b^2 = ab + ab + b \cdot b \]  
\[ a^2 + 2b^2 = 2ab + b^2 \]  
\[ a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 0 \]  
\[ (a - b)^2 = 0 \implies a = b \]  
Thus, \(a = b = c\). This suggests triples of the form \((k, k, k)\). Let’s confirm by testing other cases in the next step.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 100\) and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation to identify constraints.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify possible values for \(a, b, c\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count all valid triples.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.  
**Current Goal**: Identify possible values for \(a, b, c\) that satisfy the equation, building on the insight that \(a = b = c\) is a solution.  
**Updates**: The equation simplification suggests \(a = b = c\). We need to confirm if other solutions exist where \(a, b, c\) are not all equal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine all possible triples \((a, b, c)\) by exploring cases where \(a, b, c\) are not all equal and count valid triples.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the constraint \(b = c\) from the discriminant analysis and test cases where \(a \neq b\) or revisit the equation to check for other solutions. Then count solutions within \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 100\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 3, we found that \(b = c\) leads to \(a = b\), implying \(a = b = c\). Let’s test if solutions exist where \(a, b, c\) are not all equal. Try the original equation with \(b = c\) but \(a \neq b\):  
\[ a^2 + b^2 + b^2 = ab + ab + b \cdot b \]  
\[ a^2 + 2b^2 = 2ab + b^2 \]  
\[ a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = 0 \]  
\[ (a - b)^2 = 0 \implies a = b \]  
This confirms \(a = b = c\). Now, test cases where \(b \neq c\):  
Rewrite the equation as a quadratic in \(a\):  
\[ a^2 - (b + c)a + (b^2 + c^2 - bc) = 0 \]  
For \(a\) to be an integer, the discriminant \(\Delta = -3(b - c)^2\) must be a perfect square. Since it’s negative unless \(b = c\), no other integer solutions arise unless \(b = c\).  
Alternatively, test numerically for cases where \(a, b, c\) differ:  
- Try \(a = 2, b = 3, c = 4\):  
  Left: \(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29\)  
  Right: \(2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 4 = 6 + 8 + 12 = 26\)  
  Does not hold.  
Since algebraic manipulation consistently points to \(a = b = c\), and numerical tests for unequal values fail, the solutions are likely only \((k, k, k)\). For \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), there are 100 such triples: \((1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), \ldots, (100, 100, 100)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that only triples of the form \((k, k, k)\) satisfy the equation and count them.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the equation for cases where at least two variables differ and ensure no other solutions exist. Then finalize the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To ensure no other solutions, consider the equation symmetrically for \(b\) or \(c\). From Step 3, the discriminant analysis for \(a\) required \(b = c\). By symmetry, treating the equation as a quadratic in \(b\):  
\[ b^2 - (a + c)b + (a^2 + c^2 - ac) = 0 \]  
Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = (a + c)^2 - 4(a^2 + c^2 - ac) = -3(a - c)^2 \]  
Requires \(a = c\). Similarly, for \(c\), we get \(a = b\). Thus, any two variables being equal forces the third to be equal, leading to \(a = b = c\).  
Numerical check for distinct values (e.g., \(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3\)) already failed. Permutations of \((k, k, k)\) are the same triple since \((a, b, c) = (k, k, k)\). Thus, solutions are:  
\[ \{(k, k, k) \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}, 1 \leq k \leq 100\} \]  
Count: 100 triples.

  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify possible values (completed: only \(a = b = c\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count all valid triples (100 triples found).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the count and ensuring all cases are covered.  
**Updates**: All evidence points to triples \((k, k, k)\) for \(k = 1\) to 100, totaling 100 triples.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 100\) and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc\) is **100**.  
These triples are \((k, k, k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 100\).
