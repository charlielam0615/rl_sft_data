### Problem Statement
We need to evaluate the expression \(\left(c^c - c(c-1)^c\right)^c\) when \(c = 3\). The goal is to compute the numerical value of this expression by substituting \(c = 3\) and simplifying step by step, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression. The expression is \(\left(c^c - c(c-1)^c\right)^c\) with \(c = 3\). Subgoals include:  
1. Substitute \(c = 3\) into the expression.  
2. Compute the inner terms \(c^c\) and \(c(c-1)^c\).  
3. Evaluate the subtraction inside the parentheses.  
4. Raise the result to the power of \(c\).  
5. Simplify to obtain the final numerical value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \(c = 3\) into the expression \(\left(c^c - c(c-1)^c\right)^c\) and compute the inner terms \(c^c\) and \(c(c-1)^c\). This will be achieved by calculating \(3^3\) and \(3 \cdot (3-1)^3\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(c = 3\) into the expression:  
- Compute \(c^c = 3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27\).  
- Compute \(c-1 = 3-1 = 2\), so \((c-1)^c = 2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8\).  
- Compute \(c \cdot (c-1)^c = 3 \cdot 2^3 = 3 \cdot 8 = 24\).  
Thus, the inner expression becomes \(c^c - c(c-1)^c = 27 - 24\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate the subtraction inside the parentheses, \(27 - 24\), and then raise the result to the power of \(c = 3\). This will be achieved by performing the subtraction and then computing the exponentiation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Compute the subtraction: \(27 - 24 = 3\).  
- The expression is now \(3^c = 3^3\).  
- Compute \(3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27\).  
Thus, the expression \(\left(3^3 - 3 \cdot 2^3\right)^3 = 3^3 = 27\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation by checking each step of the evaluation process to ensure correctness. This will be achieved by recomputing each part of the expression and verifying consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the calculations:  
- Recompute \(c^c = 3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27\). Correct.  
- Recompute \((c-1)^c = 2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8\). Correct.  
- Recompute \(c \cdot (c-1)^c = 3 \cdot 8 = 24\). Correct.  
- Recompute the inner expression: \(27 - 24 = 3\). Correct.  
- Recompute the final exponentiation: \(3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27\). Correct.  
All steps are consistent, confirming the result is \(27\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\left(c^c - c(c-1)^c\right)^c\) when \(c = 3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \(c = 3\) into the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute inner terms \(3^3\) and \(3 \cdot 2^3\) (completed: \(27\) and \(24\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Evaluate the subtraction \(27 - 24\) (completed: \(3\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final exponentiation \(3^3\) (completed: \(27\)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the computation (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming the result and ensuring all subgoals are met. The computed value is \(27\), and validation confirms correctness.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of the expression \(\left(c^c - c(c-1)^c\right)^c\) when \(c = 3\) is \(27\).
