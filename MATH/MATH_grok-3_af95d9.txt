**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to determine the number of trailing zeros in the product \( 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \), which is the factorial \( 25! \).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the number of trailing zeros in \( 25! \), we break it down into subgoals:  
1. Understand that trailing zeros in a number result from factors of 10 in its prime factorization.  
2. Since 10 = 2 × 5, count the number of times 2 and 5 appear as factors in \( 25! \).  
3. The number of trailing zeros is limited by the scarcer factor (either 2 or 5).  
4. Compute the counts of factors 2 and 5 in \( 25! \).  
5. Take the minimum of these counts to find the number of trailing zeros.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of factors of 5 in \( 25! \).  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the exponent of a prime \( p \) in \( n! \):  
\[ \text{Exponenent of } p = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor \]  
We’ll compute this for \( p = 5 \) and \( n = 25 \).

For \( p = 5 \), calculate:  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 5 \right\rfloor = 5 \)  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1 \)  
- For \( k \geq 3 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5^k} \right\rfloor = 0 \) (since \( 5^3 = 125 > 25 \))  
Total factors of 5: \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of factors of 2 in \( 25! \).  
How to Achieve: Apply the same formula for the exponent of a prime, now for \( p = 2 \) and \( n = 25 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( p = 2 \), calculate:  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 12.5 \right\rfloor = 12 \)  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 6.25 \right\rfloor = 6 \)  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{8} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 3.125 \right\rfloor = 3 \)  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{16} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.5625 \right\rfloor = 1 \)  
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{32} \right\rfloor = 0 \) (since \( 32 > 25 \))  
Total factors of 2: \( 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22 \).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of trailing zeros in \( 25! \).  
How to Achieve: The number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of factors of 2 and 5 in \( 25! \), as each trailing zero requires one factor of 2 and one factor of 5 to form a 10.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have:  
- Factors of 5: 6  
- Factors of 2: 22  
The number of trailing zeros is limited by the scarcer factor:  
\[ \text{Number of trailing zeros} = \min(22, 6) = 6 \]  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of trailing zeros in \( 25! \).  
How to Achieve: Double-check the factor counts for 2 and 5, and ensure the minimum is correctly applied. Consider the logic: trailing zeros depend on pairs of 2 and 5, and our method (using the formula for prime exponents in factorials) is standard and reliable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck:  
- Factors of 5: \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{25}{25} \right\rfloor = 5 + 1 = 6 \), correct.  
- Factors of 2: \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{25}{8} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{25}{16} \right\rfloor = 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22 \), correct.  
- Trailing zeros: \( \min(22, 6) = 6 \), correct.  
The logic is sound: each factor of 10 (formed by a 2 and a 5) contributes one trailing zero, and 5 is the limiting factor.
