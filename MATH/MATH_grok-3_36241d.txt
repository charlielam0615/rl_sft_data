**Problem Statement**: Find the number of positive integers \( x \) less than 100 that satisfy the congruence \( x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the congruence and determine the number of solutions.  
1. Simplify the congruence \( x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34} \) to isolate \( x \).  
2. Determine the general form of solutions for \( x \).  
3. Apply the constraint that \( x \) is a positive integer less than 100.  
4. Count the number of valid solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the congruence \( x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34} \) to find \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract 13 from both sides of the congruence to isolate \( x \), ensuring the result is taken modulo 34.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the congruence:  
\[ x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34} \]  
Subtract 13 from both sides:  
\[ x \equiv 55 - 13 \pmod{34} \]  
\[ x \equiv 42 \pmod{34} \]  
Since \( 42 > 34 \), reduce 42 modulo 34:  
\[ 42 - 34 = 8 \]  
\[ 42 \equiv 8 \pmod{34} \]  
Thus, the congruence simplifies to:  
\[ x \equiv 8 \pmod{34} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the general form of solutions for \( x \) from \( x \equiv 8 \pmod{34} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Express all solutions using the modular equation’s periodicity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The congruence \( x \equiv 8 \pmod{34} \) implies:  
\[ x = 8 + 34k \]  
where \( k \) is an integer. This represents all solutions to the congruence.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Apply the constraint that \( x \) is a positive integer less than 100.  
**How to Achieve**: Find all values of \( k \) such that \( x = 8 + 34k \) is a positive integer less than 100.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We need \( x = 8 + 34k \) where \( x \) is a positive integer and \( 0 < x < 100 \).  
Solve the inequality:  
\[ 0 < 8 + 34k < 100 \]  
Subtract 8:  
\[ -8 < 34k < 92 \]  
Divide by 34:  
\[ -\frac{8}{34} < k < \frac{92}{34} \]  
\[ -0.235 < k < 2.706 \]  
Since \( k \) is an integer, \( k \) can be 0, 1, or 2.  
Compute \( x \) for each:  
- \( k = 0 \): \( x = 8 + 34 \cdot 0 = 8 \)  
- \( k = 1 \): \( x = 8 + 34 \cdot 1 = 8 + 34 = 42 \)  
- \( k = 2 \): \( x = 8 + 34 \cdot 2 = 8 + 68 = 76 \)  
Check \( k = 3 \):  
\[ x = 8 + 34 \cdot 3 = 8 + 102 = 110 \]  
Since \( 110 \geq 100 \), it’s not a valid solution.  
Thus, the solutions are \( x = 8, 42, 76 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 8, 42, 76 \) satisfy the original congruence and the constraint \( x < 100 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution into \( x + 13 \equiv 55 \pmod{34} \) and confirm they are positive integers less than 100.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check each solution:  
- For \( x = 8 \):  
  \[ 8 + 13 = 21 \]  
  \[ 21 \pmod{34} = 21 \]  
  \[ 55 \pmod{34} = 55 - 34 = 21 \]  
  \[ 21 \equiv 21 \pmod{34} \] (True)  
  \( x = 8 \) is positive and \( 8 < 100 \).  
- For \( x = 42 \):  
  \[ 42 + 13 = 55 \]  
  \[ 55 \pmod{34} = 21 \]  
  \[ 21 \equiv 21 \pmod{34} \] (True)  
  \( x = 42 \) is positive and \( 42 < 100 \).  
- For \( x = 76 \):  
  \[ 76 + 13 = 89 \]  
  \[ 89 - 34 \cdot 2 = 89 - 68 = 21 \]  
  \[ 89 \equiv 21 \pmod{34} \]  
  \[ 21 \equiv 21 \pmod{34} \] (True)  
  \( x = 76 \) is positive and \( 76 < 100 \).  
All solutions satisfy the congruence and constraints.
