**Problem Statement:** Compute the sum of the geometric series \(-1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729\).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the geometric series:  
1. Identify the type of series and its properties (e.g., first term, common ratio, number of terms).  
2. Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
3. Compute the sum using the identified parameters.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the type of series and its properties.  
**How to Achieve:** Analyze the given series \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\) to determine if it’s geometric, find the first term, common ratio, and number of terms by examining the pattern.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The series is \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\). To confirm it’s geometric, calculate the ratio between consecutive terms:  
- \(-3 / -1 = 3\)  
- \(-9 / -3 = 3\)  
- \(-27 / -9 = 3\)  
- \(-81 / -27 = 3\)  
- \(-243 / -81 = 3\)  
- \(-729 / -243 = 3\)  
The common ratio is \(r = 3\). The first term is \(a = -1\). Count the terms: \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\) gives \(n = 7\) terms.  
The series is geometric with \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Check the validity of the identified series parameters.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify the first term, common ratio, and number of terms by rechecking the series and ensuring the pattern holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the series \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\):  
- First term: \(-1\).  
- Common ratio: Compute \(-3 / -1 = 3\), \(-9 / -3 = 3\), ..., up to \(-729 / -243 = 3\). All ratios are consistent at \(r = 3\).  
- Number of terms: List the terms: \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\). There are exactly 7 terms, so \(n = 7\).  
The parameters \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\) are correct.

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Compute the sum of the geometric series \(-1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of series and its properties (completed: \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), \(n = 7\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the geometric series sum formula (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the sum using the identified parameters (pending).  
**Current Goal:** Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the geometric series sum formula \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\) for \(r \neq 1\), with \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The geometric series sum formula is:  
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]  
Given \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), \(n = 7\), substitute:  
\[ S_7 = (-1) \frac{1 - 3^7}{1 - 3} \]  
Calculate \(3^7\):  
\[ 3^1 = 3, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 3^3 = 27, \quad 3^4 = 81, \quad 3^5 = 243, \quad 3^6 = 729, \quad 3^7 = 729 \times 3 = 2187 \]  
So, \(3^7 = 2187\).  
Numerator: \(1 - 2187 = -2186\).  
Denominator: \(1 - 3 = -2\).  
\[ S_7 = (-1) \frac{-2186}{-2} = (-1) \times 1093 = -1093 \]  
The sum is \(-1093\).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify the computed sum.  
**How to Achieve:** Compute the sum manually by adding the terms \(-1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729\) and compare with the formula result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the sum manually:  
\[ -1 - 3 = -4 \]  
\[ -4 - 9 = -13 \]  
\[ -13 - 27 = -40 \]  
\[ -40 - 81 = -121 \]  
\[ -121 - 243 = -364 \]  
\[ -364 - 729 = -1093 \]  
The manual sum is \(-1093\), which matches the formula result \(-1093\).  
Alternatively, verify the formula:  
\[ S_7 = (-1) \frac{1 - 3^7}{1 - 3} = (-1) \frac{1 - 2187}{1 - 3} = (-1) \frac{-2186}{-2} = -1093 \]  
The calculation is consistent.
