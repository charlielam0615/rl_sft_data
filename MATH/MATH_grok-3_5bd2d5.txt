### Problem Statement
We need to find the product of the squares of the solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\). This means if the solutions to the equation are \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), we must compute \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2\).

I will solve this problem step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list (Planning, Implementation, or Review) and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the product of the squares of the solutions to \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the solutions \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) to the quadratic equation.  
2. Square each solution to obtain \((x_1)^2\) and \((x_2)^2\).  
3. Compute the product \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the solutions \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = 13\), and \(c = 6\), to compute the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\), identify the coefficients: \(a = 2\), \(b = 13\), \(c = 6\). Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 13^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 6 = 169 - 48 = 121 \]  
Compute the roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-13 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-13 \pm 11}{4} \]  
\[ x_1 = \frac{-13 + 11}{4} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2} \]  
\[ x_2 = \frac{-13 - 11}{4} = \frac{-24}{4} = -6 \]  
The solutions are \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x_2 = -6\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x_2 = -6\) are correct for \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution back into the original equation to check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\):  
\[ 2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 13 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 6 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - \frac{13}{2} + 6 = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{13}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{13}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = \frac{1 - 13 + 12}{2} = \frac{0}{2} = 0 \]  
The equation holds for \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\).  

Substitute \(x_2 = -6\):  
\[ 2 (-6)^2 + 13 (-6) + 6 = 2 \cdot 36 - 78 + 6 = 72 - 78 + 6 = 72 - 72 = 0 \]  
The equation holds for \(x_2 = -6\).  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute the product of the squares of the solutions to \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the solutions \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) (completed: \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\), \(x_2 = -6\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Square each solution to obtain \((x_1)^2\) and \((x_2)^2\) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the product \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2\) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Square each solution to obtain \((x_1)^2\) and \((x_2)^2\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Square each solution to obtain \((x_1)^2\) and \((x_2)^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the square of \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x_2 = -6\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\):  
\[ (x_1)^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \]  
For \(x_2 = -6\):  
\[ (x_2)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36 \]  
So, \((x_1)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) and \((x_2)^2 = 36\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the product \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply \((x_1)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) by \((x_2)^2 = 36\). Alternatively, explore if the product can be computed directly using properties of quadratic equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute directly:  
\[ (x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 36 = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]  

Alternatively, note that \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2 = (x_1 \cdot x_2)^2\). For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the product of the roots is \(x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{c}{a}\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(c = 6\), so:  
\[ x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]  
Thus:  
\[ (x_1 \cdot x_2)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]  
Both methods yield the same result: \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2 = 9\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the product \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2 = 9\).  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the calculation using both the direct computation and the quadratic formula approach.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Direct computation: \((x_1)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), \((x_2)^2 = 36\), so \(\frac{1}{4} \cdot 36 = 9\).  
Quadratic formula approach: \(x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\), so \((x_1 \cdot x_2)^2 = 3^2 = 9\).  
Both methods are consistent, confirming the product is 9.  
[/IMP]

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 2: Square each solution to obtain \((x_1)^2\) and \((x_2)^2\) (completed: \((x_1)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), \((x_2)^2 = 36\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the product \((x_1)^2 \cdot (x_2)^2\) (completed: 9).  
**Current Goal**: No further subgoals; the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

The product of the squares of the solutions to \(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\) is \(9\).
