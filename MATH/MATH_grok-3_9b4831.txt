**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to find the total number of four-digit palindromes. A four-digit palindrome is a number between 1000 and 9999 that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 1331). The first digit cannot be zero.

**Action:** Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand the structure of a four-digit palindrome.  
2. Determine constraints for each digit, especially the first digit.  
3. Calculate the number of valid choices for each digit.  
4. Compute the total number of four-digit palindromes.

[PLANNING]  
**Action:** Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to understand the structure of a four-digit palindrome. A four-digit number can be represented as ABBA, where A is the first and last digit, and B is the second and third digit. We need to define the constraints and choices for A and B.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A four-digit palindrome has the form ABBA:  
- A is the first digit, so A cannot be 0. Thus, A can be any digit from 1 to 9.  
- B is the second digit, and since there are no restrictions on the second and third digits, B can be any digit from 0 to 9.  
- The third digit is B, and the fourth digit is A, due to the palindrome property.  
Thus, we have:  
- A: 1 to 9 (9 choices)  
- B: 0 to 9 (10 choices)  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action:** Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the total number of four-digit palindromes. Multiply the number of choices for each independent digit (A and B) to find the total combinations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the total number of four-digit palindromes:  
- Choices for A: 9 (digits 1 to 9)  
- Choices for B: 10 (digits 0 to 9)  
- The third and fourth digits are determined by B and A, respectively.  
Thus, the total number of four-digit palindromes is:  
9 × 10 = 90  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action:** Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the calculation of the total number of four-digit palindromes. Check if the logic accounts for all constraints and if the multiplication is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let’s validate:  
- A four-digit palindrome must be of the form ABBA.  
- A cannot be 0, so A has 9 choices (1 to 9).  
- B has no restrictions, so B has 10 choices (0 to 9).  
- The calculation 9 × 10 = 90 correctly accounts for all possibilities.  
- Example: For A = 1, B = 0, we get 1001; for A = 2, B = 3, we get 2332. This fits the palindrome definition.  
The calculation is valid.
