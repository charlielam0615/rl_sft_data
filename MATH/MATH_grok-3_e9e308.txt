### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many times the polar graphs \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \) intersect. In polar coordinates, two curves intersect when they share the same point \((r, \theta)\) for some angle \(\theta\), or when their coordinates represent the same point in the Cartesian plane, accounting for the periodicity and possible multiple representations of points in polar coordinates (e.g., \((r, \theta) = (-r, \theta + \pi)\)).

I will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the number of intersections, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the equations and their geometric representations.  
2. Set up the condition for intersection by equating the polar equations.  
3. Solve for \(\theta\) to find potential intersection points.  
4. Check for intersections at the pole (origin), as polar curves may intersect there without having equal \(r\) values.  
5. Verify all solutions in Cartesian coordinates to ensure they are distinct points and account for polar coordinate ambiguities.  
6. Count the total number of unique intersection points.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the equations and their geometric representations. Achieve this by analyzing the given polar equations \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \) to understand their shapes and properties in polar coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) represents a circle in polar coordinates. To confirm, convert to Cartesian coordinates:  
Since \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( x = r \cos \theta \), and \( y = r \sin \theta \), we have \( r = 4 \cos \theta \). Multiply both sides by \( r \):  
\[ r^2 = 4 r \cos \theta \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 4 x \]  
\[ x^2 - 4x + y^2 = 0 \]  
Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 - 4x = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]  
This is a circle centered at \((2, 0)\) with radius 2.

For \( r = 8 \sin \theta \):  
\[ r^2 = 8 r \sin \theta \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 8 y \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 0 \]  
Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 - 8y = (y - 4)^2 - 16 \]  
\[ x^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
This is a circle centered at \((0, 4)\) with radius 4.

Thus, \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) is a circle of radius 2 centered at \((2, 0)\), and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \) is a circle of radius 4 centered at \((0, 4)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the condition for intersection by equating the polar equations \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \). Achieve this by setting the equations equal to find values of \(\theta\) where the curves have the same \( r \)-value at the same angle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the curves to intersect at a point \((r, \theta)\), their \( r \)-values must be equal for some \(\theta\):  
\[ 4 \cos \theta = 8 \sin \theta \]  
Simplify:  
\[ \cos \theta = 2 \sin \theta \]  
\[ \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = 2 \]  
\[ \tan \theta = \frac{1}{2} \]  
Solve for \(\theta\):  
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \]  
Since \(\tan \theta\) has a period of \(\pi\), the general solutions are:  
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z} \]  
Compute \(\arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 0.4636\) radians (approximately 26.57°). In the interval \([0, 2\pi)\), consider:  
- \( n = 0 \): \(\theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 0.4636\)  
- \( n = 1 \): \(\theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \pi \approx 0.4636 + 3.1416 = 3.6052\)  

For \( n \geq 2 \), \(\theta\) exceeds \(2\pi\), and for \( n < 0 \), \(\theta\) becomes negative, but we’ll check if these yield distinct points later.  
At \(\theta_1 \approx 0.4636\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos(0.4636) \approx 4 \cdot 0.8944 = 3.5776 \]  
Check the second equation:  
\[ r = 8 \sin(0.4636) \approx 8 \cdot 0.4472 = 3.5776 \]  
The \( r \)-values match, confirming a potential intersection.  
At \(\theta_2 \approx 3.6052\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos(3.6052) \approx 4 \cdot (-0.8944) = -3.5776 \]  
\[ r = 8 \sin(3.6052) \approx 8 \cdot (-0.4472) = -3.5776 \]  
Since \( r \) must be non-negative in standard polar coordinates, we interpret negative \( r \):  
If \( r = -a \), the point \((-a, \theta)\) is equivalent to \((a, \theta + \pi)\). Thus:  
\[ (-3.5776, 3.6052) \equiv (3.5776, 3.6052 + \pi \approx 6.7468) \]  
But since \( 6.7468 - 2\pi \approx 0.4636 \), this corresponds to the point at \(\theta_1\), suggesting these may not be distinct. We’ll verify in Cartesian coordinates later.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check for intersections at the pole (origin), as polar curves may intersect there even if \( r \)-values differ. Achieve this by determining when each curve reaches the pole (\( r = 0 \)) and checking if the other curve can be at the pole for the same Cartesian point.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The pole occurs when \( r = 0 \).  
For \( r = 4 \cos \theta \):  
\[ 4 \cos \theta = 0 \]  
\[ \cos \theta = 0 \]  
\[ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z} \]  
In \([0, 2\pi)\):  
- \( n = 0 \): \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\)  
- \( n = 1 \): \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\)  
Check if the second curve is at the pole:  
\[ r = 8 \sin \theta \]  
At \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\):  
\[ r = 8 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 8 \cdot 1 = 8 \neq 0 \]  
At \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\):  
\[ r = 8 \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = 8 \cdot (-1) = -8 \neq 0 \]  
For \( r = 8 \sin \theta \):  
\[ 8 \sin \theta = 0 \]  
\[ \sin \theta = 0 \]  
\[ \theta = n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z} \]  
In \([0, 2\pi)\):  
- \( n = 0 \): \(\theta = 0\)  
- \( n = 1 \): \(\theta = \pi\)  
Check the first curve:  
At \(\theta = 0\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos 0 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \neq 0 \]  
At \(\theta = \pi\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos \pi = 4 \cdot (-1) = -4 \neq 0 \]  
Since neither curve is at the pole when the other is, there are no intersections at the pole unless alternative representations (e.g., \((-r, \theta + \pi)\)) align, which we’ll check in the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify all potential intersection points in Cartesian coordinates to ensure they are distinct and account for polar coordinate ambiguities. Achieve this by converting the points found at \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\) and checking for pole intersections using Cartesian coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(\theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 0.4636\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos(0.4636) \approx 3.5776 \]  
Convert to Cartesian:  
\[ x = r \cos \theta \approx 3.5776 \cdot 0.8944 \approx 3.2 \]  
\[ y = r \sin \theta \approx 3.5776 \cdot 0.4472 \approx 1.6 \]  
Point 1: \((3.2, 1.6)\).  
Check the second curve:  
\[ r = 8 \sin(0.4636) \approx 3.5776 \]  
\[ x = 3.5776 \cdot 0.8944 \approx 3.2 \]  
\[ y = 3.5776 \cdot 0.4472 \approx 1.6 \]  
Coordinates match, confirming an intersection at \((3.2, 1.6)\).

For \(\theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \pi \approx 3.6052\):  
\[ r = 4 \cos(3.6052) \approx -3.5776 \]  
\[ (-3.5776, 3.6052) \equiv (3.5776, 3.6052 + \pi \approx 6.7468) \]  
Since \( 6.7468 - 2\pi \approx 0.4636 \), recompute at \((3.5776, 0.4636)\):  
\[ x = 3.5776 \cdot 0.8944 \approx 3.2 \]  
\[ y = 3.5776 \cdot 0.4472 \approx 1.6 \]  
This is the same as the first point, suggesting \(\theta_2\) may not yield a new intersection.

To confirm pole intersections, note that polar points \((0, \theta)\) all represent the origin \((0, 0)\). We need to check if both curves reach \((0, 0)\). From Step 4, the first curve is at the pole at \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}\), and the second at \(\theta = 0, \pi\). Convert to Cartesian:  
- At \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\): First curve: \( r = 0 \), so \((x, y) = (0, 0)\). Second curve: \( r = 8 \), not at origin.  
- At \(\theta = 0\): Second curve: \( r = 0 \), so \((0, 0)\). First curve: \( r = 4 \), not at origin.  
No simultaneous pole intersections occur.

Alternatively, solve in Cartesian:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]  
\[ x^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
Substitute \( y^2 = 4 - (x - 2)^2 \) into the second:  
\[ x^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ y = 4 \pm \sqrt{16 - x^2} \]  
\[ y^2 = (4 \pm \sqrt{16 - x^2})^2 \]  
\[ 4 - (x - 2)^2 = (4 \pm \sqrt{16 - x^2})^2 \]  
This is complex, so test the origin:  
\[ (0 - 2)^2 + 0^2 = 4 \] (satisfies first).  
\[ 0^2 + (0 - 4)^2 = 16 \] (satisfies second).  
Thus, \((0, 0)\) is an intersection point.  
For non-origin points, use the polar solution \((3.2, 1.6)\).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of intersections between \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the equations as circles (completed: circle at \((2, 0)\), radius 2; circle at \((0, 4)\), radius 4).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate polar equations to find intersections (completed: found \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + n\pi\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Check pole intersections (completed: no simultaneous pole intersections).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify intersections in Cartesian coordinates (completed: points \((3.2, 1.6)\) and \((0, 0)\)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Count unique intersections (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Count the total number of unique intersection points.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the total number of unique intersection points. Achieve this by summarizing the distinct Cartesian points found and ensuring no intersections are missed due to polar coordinate ambiguities.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From previous steps:  
- Intersection at \(\theta \approx 0.4636\): Cartesian point \((3.2, 1.6)\).  
- Intersection at \(\theta \approx 3.6052\): Equivalent to \((3.2, 1.6)\) due to polar coordinate periodicity.  
- Intersection at the pole: Cartesian point \((0, 0)\).  

The distinct Cartesian points are \((3.2, 1.6)\) and \((0, 0)\). To ensure completeness, note that both curves are circles, and two circles can intersect at most at two points (unless identical or tangent). The distance between centers \((2, 0)\) and \((0, 4)\):  
\[ \sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (0-4)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472 \]  
Since radius sum \( 2 + 4 = 6 > 4.472 \) and radius difference \( |4 - 2| = 2 < 4.472 \), the circles intersect at exactly two points, consistent with our findings.  
Thus, the graphs intersect **2 times**.

### Final Answer
The graphs \( r = 4 \cos \theta \) and \( r = 8 \sin \theta \) intersect **2 times**.
