**Problem Statement:** Solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2\) for \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
1. Simplify the given equation by eliminating the cube roots.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation and is valid in the domain.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to simplify the equation \(\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2\) by eliminating the cube roots. This can be achieved by cubing both sides of the equation to remove the cube roots and then solving the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2
\]
Since \(\sqrt[3]{a} = a^{1/3}\), rewrite the equation:  
\[
\frac{(2x-4)^{1/3}}{(x+4)^{1/3}} = 2
\]
This can be expressed as:  
\[
\left( \frac{2x-4}{x+4} \right)^{1/3} = 2
\]
To eliminate the cube root, cube both sides:  
\[
\left( \left( \frac{2x-4}{x+4} \right)^{1/3} \right)^3 = 2^3
\]
\[
\frac{2x-4}{x+4} = 8
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to solve the equation \(\frac{2x-4}{x+4} = 8\) for \(x\). This can be done by multiplying both sides by the denominator and solving the resulting linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[
\frac{2x-4}{x+4} = 8
\]
Multiply both sides by \(x+4\):  
\[
2x-4 = 8(x+4)
\]
Distribute on the right:  
\[
2x-4 = 8x + 32
\]
Rearrange all terms to one side:  
\[
2x - 4 - 8x - 32 = 0
\]
\[
-6x - 36 = 0
\]
\[
-6x = 36
\]
\[
x = -6
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that \(x = -6\) is a valid solution by substituting it back into the original equation and checking the domain of the cube roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -6\) into the original equation:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{2(-6)-4}}{\sqrt[3]{-6+4}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{-12-4}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{-16}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}}
\]
Simplify:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{-16} = \sqrt[3]{(-8) \cdot 2} = \sqrt[3]{-8} \cdot \sqrt[:The cube root function is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is not restricted. Compute:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{-16}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{-8 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{-8} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}}
\]
Since \(\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2\), this becomes:  
\[
\frac{-2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}}
\]
Note that \(\sqrt[3]{-2} = -\sqrt[3]{2}\), so:  
\[
\frac{-2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}}{-\sqrt[3]{2}} = \frac{-2}{-1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{2}}{\sqrt[3]{2}} = 2
\]
The left-hand side equals 2, matching the right-hand side.  
Check the domain: The cube roots \(\sqrt[3]{2x-4}\) and \(\sqrt[3]{x+4}\) are defined for all real \(x\), so \(x = -6\) is valid.
