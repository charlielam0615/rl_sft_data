### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the largest possible number of additional bicycle license plates that can be made in Flatville by adding two new letters to the existing sets. Each license plate consists of three letters: the first chosen from the set {C, H, L, P, R} (5 letters), the second from {A, I, O} (3 letters), and the third from {D, M, N, T} (4 letters). The two new letters can either both be added to one set or one letter can be added to one set and one to another set. We need to calculate the maximum number of additional license plates that can be created.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the maximum number of additional license plates.  
1. Calculate the original number of possible license plates.  
2. Identify the possible ways to add two new letters: either both to one set or one to each of two different sets.  
3. For each configuration, compute the new total number of license plates and subtract the original number to find the additional plates.  
4. Compare the results to determine the maximum number of additional plates.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the original number of possible license plates. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of choices for each position in the license plate (first, second, and third letters).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The original sets are:  
- First letter: {C, H, L, P, R} → 5 choices  
- Second letter: {A, I, O} → 3 choices  
- Third letter: {D, M, N, T} → 4 choices  

The total number of original license plates is:  
\[ 5 \times 3 \times 4 = 60 \]  
So, there are 60 possible license plates initially.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to explore the configurations for adding two new letters:  
1. **Case 1**: Add both letters to the first set (increasing it from 5 to 7 letters).  
2. **Case 2**: Add both letters to the second set (increasing it from 3 to 5 letters).  
3. **Case 3**: Add both letters to the third set (increasing it from 4 to 6 letters).  
4. **Case 4**: Add one letter to the first set and one to the second set (5 to 6, 3 to 4).  
5. **Case 5**: Add one letter to the first set and one to the third set (5 to 6, 4 to 5).  
6. **Case 6**: Add one letter to the second set and one to the third set (3 to 4, 4 to 5).  
For each case, calculate the new total number of license plates and subtract the original 60 to find the additional plates.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 1 (add both letters to the first set, increasing it from 5 to 7 letters). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 1:  
- First letter: 7 choices  
- Second letter: 3 choices  
- Third letter: 4 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 7 \times 3 \times 4 = 84 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 84 - 60 = 24 \]  
So, Case 1 yields 24 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 2 (add both letters to the second set, increasing it from 3 to 5 letters). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 2:  
- First letter: 5 choices  
- Second letter: 5 choices  
- Third letter: 4 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 5 \times 5 \times 4 = 100 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]  
So, Case 2 yields 40 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 3 (add both letters to the third set, increasing it from 4 to 6 letters). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 3:  
- First letter: 5 choices  
- Second letter: 3 choices  
- Third letter: 6 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 5 \times 3 \times 6 = 90 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \]  
So, Case 3 yields 30 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 4 (add one letter to the first set and one to the second set, increasing them from 5 to 6 and 3 to 4). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 4:  
- First letter: 6 choices  
- Second letter: 4 choices  
- Third letter: 4 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 6 \times 4 \times 4 = 96 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 96 - 60 = 36 \]  
So, Case 4 yields 36 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 5 (add one letter to the first set and one to the third set, increasing them from 5 to 6 and 4 to 5). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 5:  
- First letter: 6 choices  
- Second letter: 3 choices  
- Third letter: 5 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 6 \times 3 \times 5 = 90 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \]  
So, Case 5 yields 30 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of additional license plates for Case 6 (add one letter to the second set and one to the third set, increasing them from 3 to 4 and 4 to 5). Compute the new total and subtract the original number of plates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
New sets for Case 6:  
- First letter: 5 choices  
- Second letter: 4 choices  
- Third letter: 5 choices  

New total number of license plates:  
\[ 5 \times 4 \times 5 = 100 \]  

Additional plates:  
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]  
So, Case 6 yields 40 additional license plates.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the maximum number of additional license plates by comparing the results from all cases (24, 40, 30, 36, 30, 40). Identify the highest value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The number of additional license plates for each case:  
- Case 1: 24  
- Case 2: 40  
- Case 3: 30  
- Case 4: 36  
- Case 5: 30  
- Case 6: 40  

The maximum number of additional plates is 40, achieved in Case 2 (both letters added to the second set) and Case 6 (one letter added to the second set and one to the third set).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations for Case 2 and Case 6 to ensure the maximum number of additional plates (40) is correct. Recalculate the totals and differences for these cases.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Case 2 (both letters to second set)**:  
- Sets: 5 (first), 5 (second), 4 (third)  
- Total plates: \( 5 \times 5 \times 4 = 100 \)  
- Additional plates: \( 100 - 60 = 40 \)  

**Case 6 (one letter to second set, one to third set)**:  
- Sets: 5 (first), 4 (second), 5 (third)  
- Total plates: \( 5 \times 4 \times 5 = 100 \)  
- Additional plates: \( 100 - 60 = 40 \)  

Both calculations confirm 40 additional plates, validating the result.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters is 40. This is achieved by either adding both letters to the second set or adding one letter to the second set and one to the third set.  
\[ \boxed{40} \]
