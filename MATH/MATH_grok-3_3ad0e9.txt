**Problem Statement:**
Find the equation of the plane passing through the points \((-1, 1, 1)\) and \((1, -1, 1)\), and which is perpendicular to the plane \(x + 2y + 3z = 5 PLEASE[IMP]5[/IMP]\). The equation should be in the form \(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\), where \(A, B, C, D\) are integers, \(A > 0\), and \(\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the plane’s equation:
1. Find a vector in the plane using the given points.
2. Find the normal vector of the given plane \(x + 2y + 3z = 5\).
3. Use the perpendicularity condition to find the normal vector of the desired plane.
4. Use a point and the normal vector to determine the plane’s equation.
5. Ensure the coefficients are integers, \(A > 0\), and \(\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal:** Find a vector in the plane using the points \((-1, 1, 1)\) and \((1, -1, 1)\).

**Plan:** Compute the vector by subtracting the coordinates of the points.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The vector in the plane is:

\[
(1, -1, 1) - (-1, 1, 1) = (1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (2, -2, 0)
\]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal:** Find the normal vector of the plane \(x + 2y + 3z = 5\).

**Plan:** The normal vector is derived from the coefficients of the plane’s equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the plane \(x + 2y + 3z = 5\), the normal vector is:

\[
(1, 2, 3)
\]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal:** Find the normal vector of the desired plane using the perpendicularity condition.

**Plan:** Since the planes are perpendicular, their normal vectors are perpendicular (dot product is zero). Use the vector \((2, -2, 0)\) in the plane and the normal vector \((1, 2, 3)\) of the given plane to find the normal vector of the desired plane via the cross product.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the normal vector of the desired plane be \(\vec{n} = (A, B, C)\).

1. **Perpendicularity condition**: The dot product of \(\vec{n}\) with the given plane’s normal \((1, 2, 3)\) is zero:

\[
A \cdot 1 + B \cdot 2 + C \cdot 3 = A + 2B + 3C = 0
\]

2. **Vector in the plane**: The vector \((2, -2, 0)\) lies in the plane, so the dot product with \(\vec{n}\) is zero:

\[
A \cdot 2 + B \cdot (-2) + C \cdot 0 = 2A - 2B = 0 \implies A = B
\]

From \(A = B\), substitute into the first equation:

\[
A + 2A + 3C = 3A + 3C = 0 \implies A = -C
\]

Thus, if \(A = B\) and \(A = -C\), let’s try integer values. Set \(A = k\), then \(B = k\), \(C = -k\). The normal vector is:

\[
\vec{n} = (k, k, -k)
\]

To ensure integers and \(\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\), choose \(k = 1\):

\[
\vec{n} = (1, 1, -1)
\]

Verify the gcd condition later after finding \(D\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal:** Determine the plane’s equation using the normal vector \((1, 1, -1)\) and a point, e.g., \((-1, 1, 1)\).

**Plan:** Use the point-normal form of the plane equation: \(\vec{n} \cdot (x - x_0, y - y_0, z - z_0) = 0\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the normal vector \((1, 1, -1)\) and point \((-1, 1, 1)\):

\[
1 \cdot (x - (-1)) + 1 \cdot (y - 1) + (-1) \cdot (z - 1) = 0
\]

\[
(x + 1) + (y - 1) - (z - 1) = 0
\]

\[
x + 1 + y - 1 - z + 1 = 0
\]

\[
x + y - z + 1 = 0
\]

The equation is:

\[
x + y - z + 1 = 0
\]

**Check coefficients**: \(A = 1\), \(B = 1\), \(C = -1\), \(D = 1\).

- \(A > 0\): \(1 > 0\), satisfied.
- \(\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = \gcd(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1\), satisfied.
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal:** Verify the plane’s equation by checking if it passes through both points and is perpendicular to the given plane.

**Plan:** Substitute both points into the equation and compute the dot product of the normal vectors.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
1. **Check point \((-1, 1, 1)\)**:

\[
(-1) + (1) - (1) + 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 0
\]

The point satisfies the equation.

2. **Check point \((1, -1, 1)\)**:

\[
(1) + (-1) - (1) + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0
\]

The point satisfies the equation.

3. **Perpendicularity**: The normal vector of the desired plane is \((1, 1, -1)\), and the normal vector of the given plane is \((1, 2, 3)\). Compute the dot product:

\[
(1 \cdot 1) + (1 \cdot 2) + (-1 \cdot 3) = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0
\]

The planes are perpendicular.

The equation \(x + y - z + 1 = 0\) is correct.
[/IMP]
