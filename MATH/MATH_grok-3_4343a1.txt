**Problem Restatement:**
We need to determine the least number of pounds of sugar Betty could buy, given that the amount of flour (F) she buys satisfies two conditions: (1) F is at least 6 pounds more than half the amount of sugar (S), and (2) F is no more than twice the amount of sugar. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
- F ≥ (S/2) + 6
- F ≤ 2S
We aim to find the smallest possible value of S (in pounds).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**
To solve for the least number of pounds of sugar (S), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Translate the given conditions into a system of inequalities.
2. Determine the constraints on S based on the inequalities.
3. Find the minimum value of S that satisfies all constraints.
4. Ensure the solution is realistic (e.g., S is a positive number, as it represents pounds of sugar).
Proceed to the first subgoal: translate the conditions into inequalities.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to translate the problem's conditions into mathematical inequalities. This involves expressing the relationships between flour (F) and sugar (S) as given in the problem statement.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem states:
- The amount of flour (F) is at least 6 pounds more than half the amount of sugar (S). This translates to:
  F ≥ (S/2) + 6
- The amount of flour is no more than twice the amount of sugar. This translates to:
  F ≤ 2S
Thus, the inequalities are:
- F ≥ (S/2) + 6
- F ≤ 2S

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the constraints on S by analyzing the inequalities F ≥ (S/2) + 6 and F ≤ 2S. Since F must satisfy both inequalities, find the range of S that allows a feasible F.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For there to be a valid amount of flour (F), the value of F must lie in the range where the inequalities overlap:
- F ≥ (S/2) + 6
- F ≤ 2S
Set the inequalities to intersect by finding where:
(S/2) + 6 ≤ F ≤ 2S
This implies:
(S/2) + 6 ≤ 2S
Solve for S:
(S/2) + 6 ≤ 2S
Subtract (S/2) from both sides:
6 ≤ 2S - (S/2)
Simplify:
6 ≤ (4S/2) - (S/2) = (3S/2)
Multiply both sides by 2/3:
6 * (2/3) ≤ S
4 ≤ S
Thus, S ≥ 4. This means the amount of sugar must be at least 4 pounds for there to be a valid F satisfying both inequalities.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the minimum value of S that satisfies S ≥ 4. Since we need the least number of pounds of sugar, test the boundary value S = 4 and verify if it allows a valid F.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 4, we have S ≥ 4. The smallest possible S is 4 pounds. Verify if S = 4 allows a valid F:
- Lower bound: F ≥ (S/2) + 6 = (4/2) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
- Upper bound: F ≤ 2S = 2 * 4 = 8
Thus, F must satisfy 8 ≤ F ≤ 8, which means F = 8. This is a valid solution, as there exists an F (exactly 8 pounds) when S = 4.
To confirm minimality, test if S < 4 is possible:
Suppose S = 3:
- F ≥ (3/2) + 6 = 1.5 + 6 = 7.5
- F ≤ 2 * 3 = 6
Since 7.5 > 6, there is no F that satisfies both inequalities (F cannot be both ≥ 7.5 and ≤ 6). Thus, S < 4 is not feasible.
Therefore, the smallest S is 4 pounds.

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution S = 4 pounds by ensuring it satisfies all conditions and is the smallest possible value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the constraints with S = 4:
- F ≥ (4/2) + 6 = 8
- F ≤ 2 * 4 = 8
This gives F = 8, which is valid.
Check if a smaller S (e.g., S = 3.9) works:
- F ≥ (3.9/2) + 6 = 1.95 + 6 = 7.95
- F ≤ 2 * 3.9 = 7.8
Since 7.95 > 7.8, no F satisfies both inequalities. This confirms S = 4 is the smallest possible value, as any S < 4 results in the lower bound of F exceeding the upper bound.
