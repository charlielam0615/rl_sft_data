### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the expected winnings from one flip of an unfair coin, where the coin lands on heads with probability \(\frac{3}{5}\), tails with probability \(\frac{1}{5}\), and on its edge with probability \(\frac{1}{5}\). The winnings are:
- Heads: Win $4.
- Tails: Lose $1 (i.e., winnings of -$1).
- Edge: Lose $10 (i.e., winnings of -$10).
The expected winnings should be expressed as a dollar value, rounded to the nearest cent.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the expected winnings:  
1. Verify that the probabilities sum to 1 to ensure a valid probability distribution.  
2. Identify the formula for expected value in a discrete probability scenario.  
3. Compute the expected winnings using the formula.  
4. Round the result to the nearest cent.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the probabilities sum to 1 to ensure the probability distribution is valid. This will be achieved by adding the given probabilities for heads, tails, and edge.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probabilities are:  
- Heads: \(\frac{3}{5}\)  
- Tails: \(\frac{1}{5}\)  
- Edge: \(\frac{1}{5}\)  

Sum of probabilities:  
\(\frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3 + 1 + 1}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1\)  

The probabilities sum to 1, confirming a valid probability distribution.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the expected winnings. Retrieve the formula for the expected value of a discrete random variable to apply it to the problem.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The expected value \(E[X]\) for a discrete random variable \(X\) with outcomes \(x_i\) and probabilities \(p_i\) is given by:  
\[ E[X] = \sum x_i \cdot p_i \]  
This formula will be used to calculate the expected winnings by multiplying each outcome’s dollar value by its probability and summing the results.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the expected winnings using the expected value formula. This will be achieved by multiplying each outcome’s dollar value by its probability, summing the results, and expressing the answer as a dollar value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the expected value formula \(E[X] = \sum x_i \cdot p_i\):  
- Outcomes and probabilities:  
  - Heads: \(x_1 = 4\), \(p_1 = \frac{3}{5}\)  
  - Tails: \(x_2 = -1\), \(p_2 = \frac{1}{5}\)  
  - Edge: \(x_3 = -10\), \(p_3 = \frac{1}{5}\)  

Calculate each term:  
- Heads: \(4 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4\)  
- Tails: \((-1) \cdot \frac{1}{5} = -\frac{1}{5} = -0.2\)  
- Edge: \((-10) \cdot \frac{1}{5} = -\frac{10}{5} = -2\)  

Sum:  
\[ E[X] = 2.4 + (-0.2) + (-2) = 2.4 - 0.2 - 2 = 0.2 \]  

The expected winnings are $0.2.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to round the expected winnings to the nearest cent, as required by the problem. This will be achieved by expressing 0.2 in dollar format and ensuring it is rounded appropriately.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expected winnings are $0.2, which is equivalent to $0.20. Since 0.20 is already expressed to two decimal places (cents), no further rounding is needed. The final answer is $0.20.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
List all goals in a nested format, integrating the most recent updates, and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the expected winnings from one flip of the unfair coin, rounded to the nearest cent.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify that the probabilities sum to 1 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the expected value formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the expected winnings (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Round the result to the nearest cent (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, which has been computed as $0.20. This completes the main goal.

### Final Answer
The expected winnings from one flip of the coin are $0.20.
