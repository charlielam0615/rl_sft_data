**Problem Restatement:**
Carlos has 12 distinct CDs: 4 rap, 5 country, and 3 heavy metal. He randomly selects 5 CDs. We need to find the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories (rap, country, and heavy metal) and express the answer as a common fraction.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break the problem into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs from 12.
2. Determine the number of favorable outcomes where at least one CD from each category (rap, country, heavy metal) is selected.
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
4. Express the result as a common fraction.
Next step: Compute the total number of possible selections.

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs from 12.
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total items and k is the number to choose. Here, n = 12 and k = 5.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs from 12:
C(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * (12 - 5)!) = 12! / (5! * 7!)
= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
= 95,040 / 120
= 792
Total possible outcomes = 792.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Refine subgoals for favorable outcomes:
1. Define favorable cases as selecting at least 1 rap, 1 country, and 1 heavy metal CD within the 5 selections.
2. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (PIE) to find cases with at least one of each:
   - Compute total ways to choose 5 CDs (done: 792).
   - Subtract cases missing at least one category (no rap, no country, or no heavy metal).
3. Calculate each exclusion case and combine using PIE.
Next step: Compute cases missing at least one category.

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap CDs.
How to Achieve: If no rap CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 12 - 4 = 8 CDs (5 country + 3 heavy metal). Use the combination formula C(8, 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 8 (no rap):
C(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * (8 - 5)!) = 8! / (5! * 3!)
= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)
= 336 / 6
= 56
Cases with no rap CDs = 56.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no country CDs.
How to Achieve: If no country CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 12 - 5 = 7 CDs (4 rap + 3 heavy metal). Use the combination formula C(7, 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 7 (no country):
C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * (7 - 5)!) = 7! / (5! * 2!)
= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)
= 42 / 2
= 21
Cases with no country CDs = 21.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no heavy metal CDs.
How to Achieve: If no heavy metal CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 12 - 3 = 9 CDs (4 rap + 5 country). Use the combination formula C(9, 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 9 (no heavy metal):
C(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * (9 - 5)!) = 9! / (5! * 4!)
= (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
= 3,024 / 24
= 126
Cases with no heavy metal CDs = 126.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap and no country CDs.
How to Achieve: If no rap and no country CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 3 heavy metal CDs. Use the combination formula C(3, 5), but note this is impossible since 5 > 3.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 3 (no rap, no country):
C(3, 5) is impossible because we cannot choose 5 CDs from only 3 heavy metal CDs.
Cases with no rap and no country = 0.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap and no heavy metal CDs.
How to Achieve: If no rap and no heavy metal CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 5 country CDs. Use the combination formula C(5, 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 5 (no rap, no heavy metal):
C(5, 5) = 5! / (5! * (5 - 5)!) = 5! / (5! * 0!)
= 1
Cases with no rap and no heavy metal = 1.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no country and no heavy metal CDs.
How to Achieve: If no country and no heavy metal CDs are selected, choose 5 CDs from the remaining 4 rap CDs. Use the combination formula C(4, 5), but note this is impossible since 5 > 4.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 4 (no country, no heavy metal):
C(4, 5) is impossible because we cannot choose 5 CDs from only 4 rap CDs.
Cases with no country and no heavy metal = 0.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap, no country, and no heavy metal CDs.
How to Achieve: If no CDs from any category are selected, we have 0 CDs to choose from, which is impossible for choosing 5. Use the combination formula C(0, 5), but this is invalid.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Compute ways to choose 5 CDs from 0 (no rap, no country, no heavy metal):
C(0, 5) is impossible because we cannot choose 5 CDs from 0 CDs.
Cases with no rap, no country, and no heavy metal = 0.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find cases with at least one CD from each category.
How to Achieve: Use PIE: Total ways - (no rap + no country + no heavy metal) + (no rap and no country + no rap and no heavy metal + no country and no heavy metal) - (no rap, no country, and no heavy metal). Then, compute the probability.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Apply PIE to find favorable outcomes (at least one of each category):
- Total ways to choose 5 CDs = 792
- Cases missing at least one category:
  - No rap = 56
  - No country = 21
  - No heavy metal = 126
  - No rap and no country = 0
  - No rap and no heavy metal = 1
  - No country and no heavy metal = 0
  - No rap, no country, and no heavy metal = 0
- PIE formula: Favorable = Total - (no rap + no country + no heavy metal) + (no rap and no country + no rap and no heavy metal + no country and no heavy metal) - (no rap, no country, and no heavy metal)
= 792 - (56 + 21 + 126) + (0 + 1 + 0) - 0
= 792 - 203 + 1
= 590
Favorable outcomes = 590.
Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 590 / 792.
Simplify the fraction:
590 รท 2 = 295, 792 รท 2 = 396
Thus, probability = 295 / 396.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations and the simplified fraction.
How to Achieve: Check each combination calculation, the PIE application, and the fraction simplification for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Verify calculations:
- Total ways: C(12, 5) = 792, correct.
- No rap: C(8, 5) = 56, correct.
- No country: C(7, 5) = 21, correct.
- No heavy metal: C(9, 5) = 126, correct.
- No rap and no country: C(3, 5) = 0, correct (impossible).
- No rap and no heavy metal: C(5, 5) = 1, correct.
- No country and no heavy metal: C(4, 5) = 0, correct (impossible).
- No rap, no country, no heavy metal: C(0, 5) = 0, correct (impossible).
- PIE: 792 - (56 + 21 + 126) + (0 + 1 + 0) - 0 = 792 - 203 + 1 = 590, correct.
- Probability: 590 / 792, simplified to 295 / 396.
- Check simplification: 590 รท 2 = 295, 792 รท 2 = 396, correct. No further common factors.
Final answer is 295 / 396.
