### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many pairs of consecutive integers in the set {1000, 1001, 1002, ..., 2000} require no carrying when added together. "No carrying" means that when adding the digits of the two consecutive integers (e.g., \( n \) and \( n+1 \)), the sum of the digits in each position is less than 10, so no carry-over to the next digit position is needed.

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Understand the condition for "no carrying" in the addition of two consecutive integers.  
2. Identify the constraints of the set {1000, 1001, ..., 2000} and how consecutive integers relate (i.e., \( n \) and \( n+1 \)).  
3. Develop a method to check for no carrying in the addition of two four-digit numbers.  
4. Count the number of pairs \( (n, n+1) \) where \( n \in \{1000, 1001, ..., 1999\} \) (since \( n+1 \leq 2000 \)) that satisfy the no-carrying condition.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the condition for "no carrying" when adding two consecutive integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the addition of two consecutive integers \( n \) and \( n+1 \), focusing on their digit sums. For no carrying, the sum of digits in each position must be less than 10. Since \( n+1 \) is one more than \( n \), examine how the digits differ and how addition behaves at each digit position.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider two consecutive integers \( n \) and \( n+1 \), where \( n = abcd \) (a four-digit number with digits \( a, b, c, d \)) and \( n+1 \) is its successor. Since \( n+1 = n + 1 \), we need to understand how the digits of \( n+1 \) are formed from \( n \). Letâ€™s express \( n \) as:

\[ n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]

where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits (0 to 9), and \( a \geq 1 \) since \( n \geq 1000 \). The number \( n+1 \) depends on the value of \( d \):

- **Case 1: If \( d < 9 \)**, then \( n+1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \). The digits of \( n+1 \) are \( a, b, c, d+1 \). Adding the digits position-wise:
  - Units: \( d + (d+1) = 2d + 1 \). For no carrying, \( 2d + 1 < 10 \), so \( d < 4.5 \), i.e., \( d \leq 4 \).
  - Tens: \( c + c = 2c \). For no carrying, \( 2c < 10 \), so \( c \leq 4 \).
  - Hundreds: \( b + b = 2b \). For no carrying, \( 2b < 10 \), so \( b \leq 4 \).
  - Thousands: \( a + a = 2a \). For no carrying, \( 2a < 10 \), so \( a \leq 4 \). Since \( n \geq 1000 \), \( a \geq 1 \), so \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

- **Case 2: If \( d = 9 \)**, then adding 1 causes a carry:
  - Units: \( d = 9 \), so \( 9 + 1 = 10 \), producing a sum digit of 0 and a carry of 1 to the tens place.
  - Tens: \( c + c + 1 = 2c + 1 \). For no carrying to the hundreds place, \( 2c + 1 < 10 \), so \( c \leq 4 \).
  - Hundreds: \( b + b = 2b \). For no carrying, \( 2b < 10 \), so \( b \leq 4 \).
  - Thousands: \( a + a = 2a \). For no carrying, \( 2a < 10 \), so \( a \leq 4 \), and \( a \geq 1 \).

Thus, for no carrying:
- If \( d \leq 8 \), each digit position \( (a + a, b + b, c + c, d + (d+1)) \) must have a sum less than 10.
- If \( d = 9 \), the units place produces a carry, so we check \( 2c + 1 < 10 \), \( 2b < 10 \), and \( 2a < 10 \).

- **Main Goal**: Count the number of pairs of consecutive integers in {1000, 1001, ..., 2000} where no carrying is required when added.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the no-carrying condition (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the constraints of the set {1000, 1001, ..., 2000} (partially addressed; \( n \) from 1000 to 1999 to ensure \( n+1 \leq 2000 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Develop a method to check for no carrying (partially developed in Step 2; need to formalize for all cases).
  - Subgoal 4: Count the valid pairs (not yet addressed).

**Current Goal**: Develop a method to check for no carrying across all cases and apply it to count valid pairs.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Develop a method to check for no carrying in the addition of \( n \) and \( n+1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Formalize the conditions for no carrying based on the digit analysis from Step 2, considering both cases (\( d \leq 8 \) and \( d = 9 \)), and ensure the method accounts for the constraints of the set (e.g., \( a \geq 1 \)).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, we derived the conditions for no carrying:

- **Case 1: \( d \leq 8 \)**  
  - Thousands: \( a + a = 2a < 10 \), so \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).
  - Hundreds: \( b + b = 2b < 10 \), so \( b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).
  - Tens: \( c + c = 2c < 10 \), so \( c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).
  - Units: \( d + (d+1) = 2d + 1 < 10 \), so \( d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

- **Case 2: \( d = 9 \)**  
  - Units: \( 9 + 1 = 10 \), sum digit is 0, carry of 1 to tens.
  - Tens: \( c + c + 1 = 2c + 1 < 10 \), so \( c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).
  - Hundreds: \( b + b = 2b < 10 \), so \( b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).
  - Thousands: \( a + a = 2a < 10 \), so \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

The conditions are:
- \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) (4 choices).
- \( b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) (5 choices).
- \( c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) (5 choices).
- \( d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 \) (6 choices, since \( d = 9 \) is valid with the carry condition).

Thus, for each position, we have a set of valid digits that ensure no carrying (or, for \( d = 9 \), no carrying beyond the tens place).

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the subgoals to focus on counting the valid pairs:  
1. Confirm the range of \( n \) (1000 to 1999) to ensure \( n+1 \leq 2000 \).  
2. Calculate the number of valid pairs based on the digit conditions derived.  
3. Verify the solution by checking a few examples to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of valid pairs \( (n, n+1) \) where \( n \in \{1000, 1001, ..., 1999\} \) based on the digit conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the digit constraints (\( a \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}, c \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}, d \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\} \)) to compute the total number of valid \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of valid \( n \) is the product of the number of choices for each digit:
- \( a \): 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 4).
- \( b \): 5 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- \( c \): 5 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- \( d \): 6 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9).

Total number of valid pairs:

\[ 4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 6 = 600 \]

This represents the number of \( n \) from 1000 to 1999 where \( (n, n+1) \) requires no carrying (or only a carry from units to tens for \( d = 9 \)).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking a few example pairs to ensure the no-carrying condition holds.  
**How to Achieve**: Select sample numbers within the constraints and perform addition to confirm no carrying occurs, and check a counterexample to ensure completeness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Example 1: \( n = 1234 \)**  
- Digits: \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 \) (all satisfy constraints).
- \( n+1 = 1235 \).
- Addition:
  - Units: \( 4 + 5 = 9 < 10 \).
  - Tens: \( 3 + 3 = 6 < 10 \).
  - Hundreds: \( 2 + 2 = 4 < 10 \).
  - Thousands: \( 1 + 1 = 2 < 10 \).
- No carrying. Valid pair.

**Example 2: \( n = 1239 \)**  
- Digits: \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 9 \).
- \( n+1 = 1240 \).
- Addition:
  - Units: \( 9 + 1 = 10 \), sum digit 0, carry 1 to tens.
  - Tens: \( 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 < 10 \).
  - Hundreds: \( 2 + 2 = 4 < 10 \).
  - Thousands: \( 1 + 1 = 2 < 10 \).
- Carry from units to tens only. Valid pair.

**Counterexample: \( n = 1255 \)**  
- Digits: \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 5, d = 5 \).
- \( c = 5 \) violates \( c \leq 4 \).
- \( n+1 = 1256 \).
- Addition:
  - Units: \( 5 + 6 = 11 \), requires carry to tens.
- Invalid pair, as expected.

The conditions correctly identify valid pairs.
