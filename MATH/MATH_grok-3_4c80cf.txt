**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the distance between two points, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.  
2. Recall the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.  
3. Apply the formula by substituting the coordinates.  
4. Simplify the resulting expression to its simplest radical form.

**Step 2: Recall Info**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review)  
Meta-data: Retrieve the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, as it is essential for computing the distance between \((-3, -4)\) and \((4, -5)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a coordinate plane is:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  
This formula will be used to calculate the distance between the given points.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to apply the distance formula to find the distance between \((-3, -4)\) and \((4, -5)\). This will be achieved by substituting the coordinates into the distance formula and computing the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given points \((-3, -4)\) and \((4, -5)\), assign \((x_1, y_1) = (-3, -4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (4, -5)\).  
Substitute into the distance formula:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4 - (-3))^2 + (-5 - (-4))^2}
\]  
Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:  
\[
4 - (-3) = 4 + 3 = 7, \quad -5 - (-4) = -5 + 4 = -1
\]  
So, the formula becomes:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 1} = \sqrt{50}
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to simplify \(\sqrt{50}\) into its simplest radical form. This will be achieved by factoring the number under the radical and extracting perfect squares.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{50}\):  
\[
\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{25} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]  
The expression \(5\sqrt{2}\) is in simplest radical form, as 2 has no perfect square factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that the distance calculation and simplification are correct. This will be achieved by rechecking the coordinate substitutions and the simplification of \(\sqrt{50}\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the distance formula to confirm:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4 - (-3))^2 + (-5 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 1} = \sqrt{50}
\]  
Verify simplification:  
\[
\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]  
The calculations are consistent, and \(5\sqrt{2}\) is in simplest radical form, as 2 is not a perfect square.
