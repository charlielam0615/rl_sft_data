### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( g(3) \), where the functions are defined as \( f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \) and \( g(x) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(x) + 1} \). To solve this, we must compute \( g(3) \), which requires finding \( f^{-1}(x) \), evaluating \( f^{-1}(3) \), and then substituting into the expression for \( g(x) \).

I will solve this problem step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided list: Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R). Each step will follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( g(3) \), we need to break down the problem into manageable subgoals. The function \( g(x) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(x) + 1} \) depends on \( f^{-1}(x) \), the inverse of \( f(x) \). Therefore, the subgoals are:  
1. Find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \).  
2. Evaluate \( f^{-1}(3) \).  
3. Substitute \( f^{-1}(3) \) into \( g(x) \) to compute \( g(3) \).  
4. Simplify the resulting expression to find the final value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \).  
**How to Achieve**: To find the inverse, set \( y = f(x) \), solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \), and then swap variables to express the inverse as a function of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with \( y = f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \).  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ y = \frac{x + 5}{3} \]  
Multiply both sides by 3:  
\[ 3y = x + 5 \]  
Subtract 5:  
\[ x = 3y - 5 \]  
Swap variables to get the inverse:  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \]  
Thus, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \)**:  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \]  
\[ f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(3x - 5) = \frac{(3x - 5) + 5}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} = x \]  
This holds.  

**Check \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \)**:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \]  
\[ f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}\left( \frac{x + 5}{3} \right) = 3 \cdot \frac{x + 5}{3} - 5 = (x + 5) - 5 = x \]  
This also holds.  

The inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate \( f^{-1}(3) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \]  
\[ f^{-1}(3) = 3 \cdot 3 - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \]  
So, \( f^{-1}(3) = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( g(3) \) using \( g(x) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(x) + 1} \) and \( f^{-1}(3) = 4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( f^{-1}(3) = 4 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \) at \( x = 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ g(x) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(x) + 1} \]  
\[ g(3) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(3) + 1} = \frac{1}{4 + 1} = \frac{1}{5} \]  
So, \( g(3) = \frac{1}{5} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the computation of \( g(3) = \frac{1}{5} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute \( g(3) \) by retracing the steps and checking for consistency. Alternatively, verify by computing \( f^{-1}(3) \) using the original function and ensuring the result aligns.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
1. From Step 2, \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \).  
2. From Step 4, \( f^{-1}(3) = 3 \cdot 3 - 5 = 4 \).  
3. From Step 5, \( g(3) = \frac{1}{4 + 1} = \frac{1}{5} \).  

Alternative check: Ensure \( f^{-1}(3) \) is consistent by using the relationship \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \).  
\[ f(f^{-1}(3)) = f(4) = \frac{4 + 5}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]  
This confirms \( f^{-1}(3) = 4 \), as \( f(4) = 3 \).  
Then, recompute \( g(3) \):  
\[ g(3) = \frac{1}{4 + 1} = \frac{1}{5} \]  
The result is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( g(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3} \). (Completed in Step 2: \( f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 5 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate \( f^{-1}(3) \). (Completed in Step 4: \( f^{-1}(3) = 4 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( g(3) \) using \( g(x) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(x) + 1} \). (Completed in Step 5: \( g(3) = \frac{1}{5} \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution. (Completed in Step 6)  

**Current Goal**: The main goal of finding \( g(3) \) has been achieved, with the result \( g(3) = \frac{1}{5} \). No further subgoals are needed, as the solution has been computed and validated.

### Final Answer
The value of \( g(3) \) is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
