**Problem Restatement**: We need to find distinct real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that the determinant of the matrix \(\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4 & 9 \\ 3 & x & y \\ 3 & y & x \end{vmatrix} = 0\), and compute \( x + y \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix.
2. Set the determinant equal to zero to form an equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) and \( y \), ensuring they are distinct.
4. Compute \( x + y \) from the solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute the determinant of the matrix \(\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4 & 9 \\ 3 & x & y \\ 3 & y & x \end{vmatrix}\).

**How to Achieve**: Use the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix \(\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{vmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\), where the elements correspond to the matrix entries.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Letâ€™s compute the determinant of \(\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4 & 9 \\ 3 & x & y \\ 3 & y & x \end{vmatrix}\).

Assign the matrix elements:
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = 9 \)
- \( d = 3 \), \( e = x \), \( f = y \)
- \( g = 3 \), \( h = y \), \( i = x \)

The determinant is:
\[
\text{Det} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
\]
\[
= 1(x \cdot x - y \cdot y) - 4(3 \cdot x - y \cdot 3) + 9(3 \cdot y - x \cdot 3)
\]
\[
= 1(x^2 - y^2) - 4(3x - 3y) + 9(3y - 3x)
\]
\[
= (x^2 - y^2) - 12x + 12y + 27y - 27x
\]
\[
= x^2 - y^2 - 12x + 12y + 27y - 27x
\]
\[
= x^2 - y^2 - 39x + 39y
\]
\[
= x^2 - y^2 - 39(x - y)
\]
\[
= (x - y)(x + y) - 39(x - y)
\]
\[
= (x - y)(x + y - 39)
\]
So, the determinant is:
\[
(x - y)(x + y - 39)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Set the determinant equal to zero and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

**How to Achieve**: Since the determinant must be zero, solve \((x - y)(x + y - 39) = 0\), and find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation while ensuring they are distinct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The determinant is:
\[
(x - y)(x + y - 39) = 0
\]
This gives two cases:
1. \( x - y = 0 \), which implies \( x = y \).
2. \( x + y - 39 = 0 \), which implies \( x + y = 39 \).

Since the problem states that \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct, discard the case \( x = y \). Thus, we have:
\[
x + y = 39
\]
This equation represents all possible solutions where \( x \neq y \). Any pair \((x, y)\) satisfying \( x + y = 39 \) and \( x \neq y \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that the solution \( x + y = 39 \) satisfies the determinant condition and the requirement that \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct.

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = 39 - x \) into the determinant expression to confirm it equals zero, and check that \( x \neq y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( y = 39 - x \) into the determinant \((x - y)(x + y - 39)\):
\[
x - y = x - (39 - x) = x - 39 + x = 2x - 39
\]
\[
x + y - 39 = x + (39 - x) - 39 = 39 - 39 = 0
\]
So the determinant becomes:
\[
(x - y)(x + y - 39) = (2x - 39) \cdot 0 = 0
\]
This confirms the determinant is zero for any \( x \). Since \( y = 39 - x \), check if \( x \neq y \):
\[
x \neq 39 - x
\]
\[
2x \neq 39
\]
\[
x \neq \frac{39}{2} = 19.5
\]
Thus, \( x \neq 19.5 \) ensures \( x \neq y \). The solution \( x + y = 39 \) is valid for all real \( x \neq 19.5 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute \( x + y \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the solution from the determinant equation \( x + y = 39 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, the solution to the determinant being zero with \( x \neq y \) is:
\[
x + y = 39
\]
Thus, the value of \( x + y \) is 39.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find \( x + y \) such that the determinant of the matrix is zero and \( x \neq y \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute the determinant of the matrix. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Set the determinant equal to zero and solve for \( x \) and \( y \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct. (Completed)

**Current Goal**: Compute \( x + y \).

The current goal has been achieved: \( x + y = 39 \), with the condition that \( x \neq 19.5 \) to ensure \( x \neq y \).

### Final Answer
\[
x + y = 39
\]
