**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \(\cos A\).  
1. Express \(\tan A\) and \(\sec A\) in terms of \(\cos A\).  
2. Set up the equation \(\tan A + \sec A = 2\) using these expressions.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(\cos A\).  
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original condition.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Goal:** Express \(\tan A\) and \(\sec A\) in terms of \(\cos A\) and set up the equation.  
**How to achieve:** Use trigonometric identities: \(\sec A = \frac{1}{\cos A}\) and \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\), where \(\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A}\) or \(\sin A = -\sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A}\). Substitute these into \(\tan A + \sec A = 2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \(x = \cos A\), so \(\sec A = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{x}\). Since \(\sin A = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}\), we have \(\tan A = \frac{\pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\). The given equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{\pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x} + \frac{1}{x} = 2
\]
Factor out \(\frac{1}{x}\):  
\[
\frac{\pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1}{x} = 2
\]
Thus:  
\[
\pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1 = 2x
\]
We will consider both the positive and negative cases for \(\sin A\).

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Goal:** Solve the equation \(\pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1 = 2x\) for \(x = \cos A\).  
**How to achieve:** Solve the equation for both the positive and negative cases, isolate the square root, square both sides to eliminate it, and solve the resulting quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Case 1: Positive square root (\(\sin A = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\))**  
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1 = 2x
\]
Isolate the square root:  
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x - 1
\]
Since the square root is non-negative, \(2x - 1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq \frac{1}{2}\). Square both sides:  
\[
1 - x^2 = (2x - 1)^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 = 4x^2 - 4x + 1
\]
\[
0 = 5x^2 - 4x = x(5x - 4)
\]
Solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{4}{5}\).  
Since \(x = \cos A\), and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} \geq 0\), check if \(x = 0\) is valid:  
If \(x = 0\), then \(\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1\), and \(2x - 1 = 2 \cdot 0 - 1 = -1\), but \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 1 \geq 0\), so \(x = 0\) is invalid.  
For \(x = \frac{4}{5}\), check: \(\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25}} = \frac{3}{5}\), and \(2 \cdot \frac{4}{5} - 1 = \frac{8}{5} - 1 = \frac{3}{5}\), which satisfies the equation.  

**Case 2: Negative square root (\(\sin A = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}\))**  
\[
-\sqrt{1 - x^2} + 1 = 2x
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 1 - 2x
\]
Since the square root is non-negative, \(1 - 2x \geq 0 \implies x \leq \frac{1}{2}\). Square both sides:  
\[
1 - x^2 = (1 - 2x)^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 = 1 - 4x + 4x^2
\]
\[
0 = 5x^2 - 4x = x(5x - 4)
\]
Solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{4}{5}\).  
Check \(x = 0\): \(\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1\), and \(1 - 2 \cdot 0 = 1\), which satisfies the equation.  
Check \(x = \frac{4}{5}\): \(\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{3}{5}\), and \(1 - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 1 - \frac{8}{5} = -\frac{3}{5}\), but \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} \geq 0\), so \(x = \frac{4}{5}\) is invalid here.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Goal:** Verify that the solutions \(x = \frac{4}{5}\) (from positive case) and \(x = 0\) (from negative case) satisfy the original equation \(\tan A + \sec A = 2\).  
**How to achieve:** Substitute \(x = \cos A\) back into the original equation using \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\) and \(\sec A = \frac{1}{\cos A}\), and check if the equation holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check \(x = \frac{4}{5}\):**  
If \(\cos A = \frac{4}{5}\), then \(\sec A = \frac{1}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{5}{4}\). Since \(\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{3}{5}\) (positive case), \(\tan A = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{3}{4}\).  
\[
\tan A + \sec A = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
\]
This satisfies the equation.  

**Check \(x = 0\):**  
If \(\cos A = 0\), then \(\sec A = \frac{1}{0}\), which is undefined. Thus, \(x = 0\) is not a valid solution for the original equation, as \(\sec A\) must be defined.
