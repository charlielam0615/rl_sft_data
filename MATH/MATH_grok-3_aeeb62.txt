**Problem Statement:**
We need to find the digit \( A \) such that the 7-digit number \( 353808A \) is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since \( A \) is a digit, it ranges from 0 to 9. The number must satisfy the divisibility rules for all given numbers.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the digit \( A \). Since the number must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, we can establish subgoals to apply each divisibility rule and find a digit \( A \) that satisfies all conditions. Subgoals include:
1. Apply the divisibility rule for 2.
2. Apply the divisibility rule for 5.
3. Apply the divisibility rule for 9.
4. Apply the divisibility rule for 4.
5. Apply the divisibility rule for 8.
6. Check if the resulting constraints are consistent and narrow down \( A \).
7. Verify divisibility by 3 and 6 (since 6 = 2 × 3, this may be covered by previous checks).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the divisibility rule for 2 to constrain possible values of \( A \). A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). We will check the last digit of \( 353808A \), which is \( A \), to ensure it is even.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The last digit of the number \( 353808A \) is \( A \). For the number to be divisible by 2, \( A \) must be an even digit. Thus, \( A \in \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the divisibility rule for 5 to further constrain \( A \). A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. We will check if \( A \) can be 0 or 5 while satisfying the previous constraint (\( A \) is even).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For divisibility by 5, the last digit \( A \) must be 0 or 5. From the previous step, \( A \in \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\} \). Intersecting with \{0, 5\}, we get \( A = 0 \). Thus, \( A = 0 \) is the only candidate that satisfies both divisibility by 2 and 5.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the divisibility rule for 9 to check if \( A = 0 \) satisfies this condition. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. We will compute the sum of the digits of \( 3538080 \) and check divisibility by 9.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number is \( 3538080 \). Sum of digits: \( 3 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 27 \). Since \( 27 \div 9 = 3 \), the sum is divisible by 9, so \( 3538080 \) is divisible by 9.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the divisibility rule for 4 to verify if \( A = 0 \) satisfies this condition. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. We will check the last two digits of \( 3538080 \), which are 80.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The last two digits of \( 3538080 \) are 80. Compute: \( 80 \div 4 = 20 \), which is an integer. Thus, \( 3538080 \) is divisible by 4.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the divisibility rule for 8 to verify if \( A = 0 \) satisfies this condition. A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8. We will check the last three digits of \( 3538080 \), which are 080.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The last three digits of \( 3538080 \) are 080 (i.e., 80). Compute: \( 80 \div 8 = 10 \), which is an integer. Thus, \( 3538080 \) is divisible by 8.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to check divisibility by 3 and 6. Since 6 = 2 × 3, and we already confirmed divisibility by 2, we only need to check divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. We will use the sum from Step 4 to confirm.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 4, the sum of the digits of \( 3538080 \) is 27. Since \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \), the number is divisible by 3. Since it is also divisible by 2 (from Step 2), it is divisible by 6.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Find digit \( A \) such that \( 353808A \) is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
  - Subgoal 1: Apply divisibility rule for 2 (\( A \) is even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply divisibility rule for 5 (\( A = 0 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Check divisibility by 9 for \( A = 0 \) (satisfied).
  - Subgoal 4: Check divisibility by 4 for \( A = 0 \) (satisfied).
  - Subgoal 5: Check divisibility by 8 for \( A = 0 \) (satisfied).
  - Subgoal 6: Check divisibility by 3 and 6 for \( A = 0 \) (satisfied).
- **Current Goal:** Confirm that \( A = 0 \) is the only solution by checking if other even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) satisfy all conditions, particularly divisibility by 5.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate if other even digits (\( A = 2, 4, 6, 8 \)) satisfy divisibility by 5, since \( A = 0 \) was the only digit satisfying both 2 and 5 previously. This ensures we haven’t missed any solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 3, divisibility by 5 requires \( A \in \{0, 5\} \). The even digits from Step 2 are \( \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\} \). Since 2, 4, 6, and 8 are not in \{0, 5\}, they fail the divisibility test for 5. Thus, \( A = 0 \) is the only candidate.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to confirm \( A = 0 \) satisfies all divisibility conditions. We will retrieve and summarize information from previous steps related to divisibility checks for \( A = 0 \).
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- Step 2: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 2 (last digit is even).
- Step 3: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 5 (last digit is 0).
- Step 4: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 9 (sum of digits = 27, divisible by 9).
- Step 5: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 4 (last two digits 80, divisible by 4).
- Step 6: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 8 (last three digits 080, divisible by 8).
- Step 7: \( A = 0 \) satisfies divisibility by 3 and 6 (sum of digits = 27, divisible by 3; already divisible by 2).
All conditions are satisfied for \( A = 0 \).
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer:**
The digit \( A \) that makes the 7-digit number \( 353808A \) divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is \( A = 0 \).

\[ \boxed{0} \]
