**Problem Statement:**
The store has a total of 15 candies, consisting of chocolate (C), vanilla (V), peppermint (P), and lemon (L) candies. The number of peppermint and lemon candies combined is twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies combined, i.e., P + L = 2(C + V). Additionally, there are 8 more peppermint candies than lemon candies, i.e., P = L + 8. We need to find the number of lemon candies (L).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the number of lemon candies.  
1. Define variables for the number of each type of candy: C (chocolate), V (vanilla), P (peppermint), L (lemon).  
2. Translate the problem conditions into mathematical equations based on the given information.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the value of L.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies all conditions.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Translate the problem conditions into mathematical equations.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the problem's constraints to form a system of equations based on the total number of candies, the relationship between peppermint/lemon and chocolate/vanilla, and the relationship between peppermint and lemon candies.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the problem:  
- Total candies: C + V + P + L = 15  
- Peppermint and lemon combined is twice chocolate and vanilla combined: P + L = 2(C + V)  
- Peppermint candies are 8 more than lemon candies: P = L + 8  

These equations represent the problem constraints:  
1. C + V + P + L = 15  
2. P + L = 2(C + V)  
3. P = L + 8  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Solve the system of equations to find the number of lemon candies (L).  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute P = L + 8 into the other equations to reduce the number of variables, then solve the resulting system for L.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equations:  
1. C + V + P + L = 15  
2. P + L = 2(C + V)  
3. P = L + 8  

Substitute P = L + 8 into equation 2:  
P + L = 2(C + V)  
(L + 8) + L = 2(C + V)  
2L + 8 = 2(C + V)  
L + 4 = C + V  

Now substitute C + V = L + 4 into equation 1:  
C + V + P + L = 15  
(L + 4) + (L + 8) + L = 15  
L + 4 + L + 8 + L = 15  
3L + 12 = 15  
3L = 3  
L = 1  

Thus, the number of lemon candies is L = 1.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that L = 1 satisfies all given conditions.  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute L = 1 into the equations to find P, C, and V, then check if all conditions hold and ensure the solution is realistic (non-negative integers for candy counts).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using L = 1:  
- From equation 3: P = L + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9  
- From equation 2: P + L = 2(C + V)  
  9 + 1 = 2(C + V)  
  10 = 2(C + V)  
  C + V = 5  
- From equation 1: C + V + P + L = 15  
  5 + 9 + 1 = 15  
  15 = 15 (satisfied)  

Check conditions:  
- Total candies: C + V + P + L = 5 + 9 + 1 = 15 (satisfied).  
- P + L = 9 + 1 = 10, and 2(C + V) = 2(5) = 10 (satisfied).  
- P = 9, L = 1, so P = L + 8 (9 = 1 + 8, satisfied).  

Since C + V = 5, C and V can be any non-negative integers summing to 5 (e.g., C = 2, V = 3). All counts (C, V, P = 9, L = 1) are non-negative integers, and all equations are satisfied.
