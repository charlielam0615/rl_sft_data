### Problem Statement
We need to find the number of distinct four-digit positive integers (from 1000 to 9999) whose digits have a product equal to 12. A four-digit number can be represented as \(ABCD\), where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are digits, \(A \neq 0\) (since it’s a four-digit number), and the product \(A \times B \times C \times D = 12\). The digits can be any integer from 0 to 9 unless specified otherwise (e.g., \(A \neq 0\)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Determine the possible digit combinations that multiply to 12.  
2. Account for the constraint that the first digit cannot be 0.  
3. Calculate the number of distinct four-digit numbers by considering all possible arrangements of the digits, including cases where digits repeat.  
4. Ensure all numbers are valid four-digit numbers (1000 to 9999).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find all sets of four digits \(\{A, B, C, D\}\) such that \(A \times B \times C \times D = 12\) and \(A \neq 0\). We will achieve this by finding the factorizations of 12 into four positive integers (since digits are typically non-zero when their product is specified, but we’ll consider the impact of including 0 later).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find sets of four digits \(\{A, B, C, D\}\) with product 12, where each digit is from 1 to 9 (since \(A \neq 0\), and we’ll initially assume all digits are non-zero to simplify), we factorize 12 into four positive integers:  
- Prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\).  
- We need four positive integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(a \times b \times c \times d = 12\), where each is a digit from 1 to 9.  
- Possible factorizations:  
  - \(1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 6 = 12\) (multiset: \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\)).  
  - \(1 \times 1 \times 3 \times 4 = 12\) (multiset: \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\)).  
  - \(1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12\) (multiset: \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\)).  
- Verify each set: All digits (\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6\)) are between 1 and 9, and their products equal 12.  
- We’ll consider the case of including 0 later, as it may affect the product unless balanced carefully.  
The multisets are:  
1. \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\)  
2. \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\)  
3. \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the identified multisets \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\), \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\), and \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\) are sufficient and whether we need to consider cases where some digits are 0. We will check if including 0 is feasible and ensure all multisets produce valid four-digit numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check for zero digits**: If any digit is 0, the product \(A \times B \times C \times D = 0\), which cannot equal 12. Thus, no valid four-digit number with a digit of 0 can have a digit product of 12. All digits must be from 1 to 9.  
- **Verify multisets**:  
  - For \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\): Product = \(1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 6 = 12\). All digits \(\geq 1\), and 6 is \(\leq 9\). Valid.  
  - For \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\): Product = \(1 \times 1 \times 3 \times 4 = 12\). All digits \(\leq 9\). Valid.  
  - For \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\): Product = \(1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12\). All digits \(\leq 9\). Valid.  
- **First digit constraint**: Since \(A \neq 0\), and all digits in the multisets are already \(\geq 1\), this constraint is satisfied.  
- No other factorizations of 12 into four digits (1 to 9) exist, as larger digits (e.g., 7, 8, 9) or different combinations (e.g., \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 1\)) are covered or produce products \(> 12\).  
The multisets are complete and valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of distinct four-digit numbers for each multiset by finding all possible permutations, ensuring the first digit is not 0 (already satisfied), and accounting for repeated digits.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each multiset, compute the number of distinct four-digit numbers by calculating permutations of the digits, considering repetitions:  
- **Multiset \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\)**:  
  - Digits: Two 1’s, one 2, one 6.  
  - Total permutations: \(\frac{4!}{2!1!1!} = \frac{24}{2 \times 1 \times 1} = 12\).  
  - All digits are \(\geq 1\), so all 12 numbers are valid four-digit numbers.  
- **Multiset \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\)**:  
  - Digits: Two 1’s, one 3, one 4.  
  - Total permutations: \(\frac{4!}{2!1!1!} = 12\).  
  - All digits are \(\geq 1\), so all 12 numbers are valid.  
- **Multiset \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\)**:  
  - Digits: One 1, two 2’s, one 3.  
  - Total permutations: \(\frac{4!}{1!2!1!} = \frac{24}{1 \times 2 \times 1} = 12\).  
  - All digits are \(\geq 1\), so all 12 numbers are valid.  
- Total distinct numbers: \(12 + 12 + 12 = 36\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, reflecting updates from previous steps, and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of distinct four-digit positive integers whose digits have a product of 12.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all sets of four digits whose product is 12 (completed: multisets \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\), \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\), \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate that no digits are 0 and all multisets are valid (completed: zeros are not possible; multisets are valid).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of distinct four-digit numbers for each multiset (completed: 12 per multiset, total 36).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution and consider any missed cases (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by ensuring all cases are covered and calculations are correct.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking for any missed factorizations, confirming permutation calculations, and ensuring all constraints (four-digit numbers, product = 12) are met.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check for missed factorizations**:  
  - We considered all ways to express 12 as a product of four digits from 1 to 9. Other combinations (e.g., using digits like 7, 8, 9) yield products much larger than 12 (e.g., \(1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 7 = 7\)). No other multisets are possible.  
  - Including 0 is not feasible, as confirmed in Step 3.  
- **Verify permutations**:  
  - For \(\{1, 1, 2, 6\}\): Permutations = \(\frac{4!}{2!1!1!} = 12\). Correct.  
  - For \(\{1, 1, 3, 4\}\): Permutations = 12. Correct.  
  - For \(\{1, 2, 2, 3\}\): Permutations = 12. Correct.  
  - Total = \(12 + 12 + 12 = 36\).  
- **Constraints**: All numbers are four-digit (since all permutations form numbers like 1126, 2311, etc.), and the first digit is always 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 (never 0).  
- **Cross-check**: The problem’s example (3214, product = \(3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 4 = 24\)) suggests digits are typically 1 to 9 when computing products, supporting our assumption.  
The solution is consistent and complete.

### Final Answer
The number of distinct four-digit positive integers whose digits have a product of 12 is **36**.
