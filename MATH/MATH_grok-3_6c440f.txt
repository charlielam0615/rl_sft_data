**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( a \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the properties of a geometric sequence.  
2. Set up the equation based on the geometric sequence condition.  
3. Solve the equation for \( a \).  
4. Verify that \( a \) is positive.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Understand the properties of a geometric sequence and set up the equation.  
**How to Achieve:** In a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. For terms \( 20, a, \frac{5}{4} \), the common ratio \( r \) satisfies \( \frac{a}{20} = \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{a} \). Set up this equation to find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In a geometric sequence, the ratio of consecutive terms is equal. Thus:  
\[ \frac{a}{20} = \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{a} \]  
Cross-multiplying:  
\[ a \cdot a = 20 \cdot \frac{5}{4} \]  
\[ a^2 = 20 \cdot \frac{5}{4} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Solve the equation \( a^2 = 25 \) for \( a \).  
**How to Achieve:** Take the square root of both sides, considering the positive solution since \( a \) is specified to be positive.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[ a^2 = 25 \]  
\[ a = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
Since \( a \) must be positive, we take \( a = 5 \).

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that \( a = 5 \) forms a geometric sequence with terms \( 20, a, \frac{5}{4} \).  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute \( a = 5 \) and check if the ratios \( \frac{a}{20} \) and \( \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{a} \) are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 5 \):  
- First ratio: \( \frac{a}{20} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4} \)  
- Second ratio: \( \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{a} = \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{5} = \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4} \)  
Since \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \), the terms \( 20, 5, \frac{5}{4} \) form a geometric sequence.
