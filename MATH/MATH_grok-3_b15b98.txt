### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To compute \(\cos 36^\circ\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Identify if 36° is a special angle or related to known trigonometric values.
2. If not a standard angle, explore trigonometric identities or geometric methods (e.g., using the golden ratio or regular pentagon properties) to express \(\cos 36^\circ\).
3. Derive the exact value using mathematical reasoning or identities.
4. Simplify the result to a concise form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify if 36° is a standard angle or related to known trigonometric values.
How to Achieve: Check if 36° appears in common trigonometric tables or is derivable from angles like 30°, 45°, or 60°. Recognize that 36° is not a standard angle but is related to the geometry of a regular pentagon (since \(360^\circ / 10 = 36^\circ\) for central angles).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since 36° is not a standard angle like 30°, 45°, or 60°, consider its geometric significance. A regular pentagon has interior angles of \(108^\circ\) and central angles of \(36^\circ\). The cosine of 36° is known to be related to the golden ratio (\(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\)) due to the pentagon’s symmetry. Proceed by exploring the golden ratio or trigonometric identities to compute \(\cos 36^\circ\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Derive the exact value of \(\cos 36^\circ\) using the golden ratio or trigonometric identities.
How to Achieve: Use the relationship between \(\cos 36^\circ\) and the golden ratio, derived from the geometry of a regular pentagon, or apply the double-angle formula for cosine, since \(36^\circ = 2 \cdot 18^\circ\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The golden ratio \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) is known to relate to \(\cos 36^\circ\). In a regular pentagon, the cosine of the central angle (36°) can be derived using the golden ratio. It is known that:
\[
\cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}
\]
To confirm, use the double-angle formula for cosine. Since \(36^\circ = 2 \cdot 18^\circ\), apply:
\[
\cos 36^\circ = \cos (2 \cdot 18^\circ) = 2 \cos^2 18^\circ - 1
\]
Let \(x = \cos 18^\circ\). Then:
\[
\cos 36^\circ = 2x^2 - 1
\]
Additionally, use the angle subtraction formula for \(72^\circ - 36^\circ = 36^\circ\):
\[
\sin 72^\circ = \sin (36^\circ + 36^\circ) = 2 \sin 36^\circ \cos 36^\circ
\]
Since \(\sin 72^\circ = \cos 18^\circ\) (because \(\sin (90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\)), we have:
\[
\cos 18^\circ = 2 \sin 36^\circ \cos 36^\circ
\]
This is complex, so rely on the known result involving the golden ratio. Compute:
\[
\cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}
\]
Verify numerically: \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236\), so \(\sqrt{5} + 1 \approx 3.236\), and \(\frac{3.236}{4} \approx 0.809\), which matches the approximate value of \(\cos 36^\circ \approx 0.8090\).

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \(\cos 36^\circ\).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify if 36° is a special angle (completed: not standard, related to pentagon).
  - Subgoal 2: Explore trigonometric identities or geometric methods (completed: used golden ratio).
  - Subgoal 3: Derive the exact value (completed: \(\cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the result (in progress).
Current Goal: Simplify the result to a concise form.
The derived value \(\cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}\) is already in a simplified exact form, matching the expected format for trigonometric values.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Finalize and present the simplified result for \(\cos 36^\circ\).
How to Achieve: Confirm the derived value is correct and present it as the final answer.

[IMP]
The exact value of \(\cos 36^\circ\) is:
\[
\cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}
\]
This is a standard form, leveraging the golden ratio, and is consistent with geometric and trigonometric derivations. No further simplification is needed.
