**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to find the measure, in degrees, of the smaller angle when two complementary angles are in a ratio of 3:2. Complementary angles sum to 90 degrees.

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Letâ€™s break down the problem into steps:  
1. Define the angles using the given ratio.  
2. Use the property of complementary angles to set up an equation.  
3. Solve the equation to find the measures of both angles.  
4. Identify the smaller angle.  
The first step is to define the angles based on the 3:2 ratio.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the angles using the 3:2 ratio.  
How to Achieve: Represent the angles as multiples of a common variable, say x, where one angle is 3x and the other is 2x, reflecting the 3:2 ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the smaller angle be 2x and the larger angle be 3x, since the ratio is 3:2. This means the smaller angle corresponds to 2 parts and the larger to 3 parts.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use the property of complementary angles to set up an equation.  
How to Achieve: Since complementary angles sum to 90 degrees, write the equation 3x + 2x = 90.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given that the angles are complementary, their sum is 90 degrees. Thus, we can write:  
3x + 2x = 90  
Simplify:  
5x = 90  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find the measures of both angles.  
How to Achieve: Solve for x by dividing both sides of 5x = 90 by 5, then compute the angles 2x and 3x.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
5x = 90  
x = 90 / 5  
x = 18  
Now, calculate the angles:  
- Smaller angle = 2x = 2 * 18 = 36 degrees  
- Larger angle = 3x = 3 * 18 = 54 degrees

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the smaller angle.  
How to Achieve: Compare the calculated angles (2x and 3x) and select the smaller one.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We calculated:  
- Smaller angle = 2x = 36 degrees  
- Larger angle = 3x = 54 degrees  
The smaller angle is 36 degrees.

**Final Answer:**  
The measure of the smaller angle is 36 degrees.
