**Problem Restatement:**
Henry starts at a tree and walks 9 meters due north, then 24 feet due east, and then 9 meters plus 32 feet due south. We need to determine how many feet Henry is from his starting point.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Convert all distances to a consistent unit (feet) since the final answer is requested in feet.
2. Determine Henry's final position relative to the starting point using a coordinate system.
3. Calculate the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position using the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Convert all distances to feet.
How to Achieve: Use the conversion factor 1 meter = 3.28084 feet to convert meter measurements to feet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Convert the distances:
- 9 meters north: \( 9 \times 3.28084 = 29.52756 \) feet.
- 24 feet east: Already in feet, so 24 feet.
- 9 meters south plus 32 feet: First, convert 9 meters to feet: \( 9 \times 3.28084 = 29.52756 \) feet. Then add 32 feet: \( 29.52756 + 32 = 61.52756 \) feet.
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine Henry's final position using a coordinate system.
How to Achieve: Assign the starting point (tree) as the origin (0,0). Track Henry's movements in the x-y plane, where north is positive y, east is positive x, south is negative y, and west is negative x.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Set the tree as (0,0).
- Move 9 meters (29.52756 feet) north: From (0,0) to (0, 29.52756).
- Move 24 feet east: From (0, 29.52756) to (24, 29.52756).
- Move 9 meters plus 32 feet (61.52756 feet) south: South is negative y, so subtract 61.52756 from the y-coordinate: \( 29.52756 - 61.52756 = -32 \). Final position is (24, -32).
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the coordinate calculations.
How to Achieve: Verify each movement by retracing the steps and ensuring the coordinate changes align with the directions and distances.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify:
- Start at (0,0).
- North 29.52756 feet: y increases to 29.52756, so (0, 29.52756).
- East 24 feet: x increases by 24, so (24, 29.52756).
- South 61.52756 feet: y decreases by 61.52756, so \( 29.52756 - 61.52756 = -32 \), resulting in (24, -32).
The calculations are consistent with the directions and distances provided.
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the straight-line distance from the starting point (0,0) to the final position (24, -32).
How to Achieve: Use the distance formula \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \) to find the distance in feet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distance from (0,0) to (24, -32):
\[ \sqrt{(24 - 0)^2 + (-32 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \sqrt{576 + 1024} = \sqrt{1600} = 40 \]
Henry is 40 feet from the starting point.
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find Henry's distance from the starting point in feet.
  - Subgoal 1: Convert all distances to feet (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine final position using a coordinate system (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the straight-line distance (completed in Step 5).
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved.
The solution is complete with the distance calculated as 40 feet.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**
Henry is 40 feet away from his original starting point.
