Let’s solve the problem of calculating \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\) and expressing the answer in simplest radical form in terms of \(x\). I’ll use the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Problem Restatement:**  
Calculate the product \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\) and express the result in simplest radical form in terms of \(x\).

---

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Combine the square roots using the property \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\).  
2. Simplify the resulting square root by factoring the radicand.  
3. Ensure the expression is in simplest radical form.  
4. Verify the domain of \(x\) to ensure the expression is defined.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Combine the square roots into a single square root.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the property \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} \cdot \sqrt{c} = \sqrt{a \cdot b \cdot c}\) to multiply the radicands.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\).  
Using the property of square roots:  
\[
\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x} = \sqrt{(75x) \cdot (2x) \cdot (14x)}.
\]  
Calculate the product of the radicands:  
\[
75x \cdot 2x \cdot 14x = 75 \cdot 2 \cdot 14 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x = 2100 \cdot x^3.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x} = \sqrt{2100 x^3}.
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Simplify the square root \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\) into simplest radical form.  
**How to Achieve:** Factor the numerical part and the variable part separately, extract perfect squares, and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\).  
Factor the numerical part:  
\[
2100 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 25 \cdot 21.
\]  
Factor the variable part:  
\[
x^3 = x^2 \cdot x.
\]  
So:  
\[
2100 x^3 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot x^2 \cdot x.
\]  
Rewrite the square root:  
\[
\sqrt{2100 x^3} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot x^2 \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} = \sqrt{(2 \cdot 5 \cdot x)^2 \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot x)}.
\]  
Using \(\sqrt{a^2 \cdot b} = a \sqrt{b}\):  
\[
\sqrt{(2 \cdot 5 \cdot x)^2 \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} = (2 \cdot 5 \cdot x) \sqrt{3 \cdot 7 \cdot x} = 10x \sqrt{21x}.
\]  
The expression \(10x \sqrt{21x}\) is in simplest radical form, as 21 has no perfect square factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that \(10x \sqrt{21x}\) is correct and in simplest form.  
**How to Achieve:** Check the simplification steps and ensure the radicand has no perfect square factors.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the product:  
\[
75 \cdot 2 \cdot 14 = 150 \cdot 14 = 2100, \quad x \cdot x \cdot x = x^3, \quad \text{so } 2100 x^3.
\]  
Factorization check:  
\[
2100 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7, \quad x^3 = x^2 \cdot x.
\]  
\[
\sqrt{2100 x^3} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot x^2 \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot x \sqrt{21x} = 10x \sqrt{21x}.
\]  
Check if \(\sqrt{21x}\) is simplified:  
- \(21 = 3 \cdot 7\), no perfect squares.  
- \(x\) cannot be simplified further under the square root.  
The expression is in simplest radical form.

**Step 5: Track Goals**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Calculate \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\) in simplest radical form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Combine square roots into \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\) to \(10x \sqrt{21x}\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Address the domain of \(x\) (pending).  
**Current Goal:** Address the domain of \(x\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 6: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Determine the domain of \(x\) to ensure the expression is defined.  
**How to Achieve:** Analyze the original expression to ensure the radicands are non-negative.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The original expression \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\) requires each radicand to be non-negative:  
- For \(\sqrt{75x}\), \(75x \geq 0\). Since 75 is positive, \(x \geq 0\).  
- For \(\sqrt{2x}\), \(2x \geq 0\). Since 2 is positive, \(x \geq 0\).  
- For \(\sqrt{14x}\), \(14x \geq 0\). Since 14 is positive, \(x \geq 0\).  
The combined expression \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\) requires \(2100 x^3 \geq 0\). Since 2100 is positive, \(x^3 \geq 0\), so \(x \geq 0\).  
Thus, the domain is \(x \geq 0\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Recall Info**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Retrieve information related to the simplification process and domain to confirm the solution’s correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the solution \(10x \sqrt{21x}\) with domain \(x \geq 0\).  
**Recalled Information:**  
- Step 2: Combined square roots to \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\).  
- Step 3: Simplified \(\sqrt{2100 x^3}\) by factoring \(2100 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7\) and \(x^3 = x^2 \cdot x\), yielding \(10x \sqrt{21x}\).  
- Step 4: Validated that \(21x\) has no perfect square factors.  
- Step 6: Determined the domain as \(x \geq 0\) based on non-negative radicands.  
The solution \(10x \sqrt{21x}\) with \(x \geq 0\) is consistent across steps.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer:**  
The product \(\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}\) simplifies to \(10x \sqrt{21x}\), with \(x \geq 0\), in simplest radical form.  

\[
\boxed{10x \sqrt{21x}}
\]  
(Domain: \(x \geq 0\))
