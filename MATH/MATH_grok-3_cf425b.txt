### Problem Statement
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \) into intermediate subgoals. To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable \( x \). Since the equation involves exponential terms with the same base (\( 2^x \)), the first subgoal is to simplify the equation by grouping like terms. The next subgoal will be to solve the resulting equation for \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \) by grouping terms involving \( 2^x \). This can be achieved by moving all terms with \( 2^x \) to one side and constants to the other side, then simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \]  
Subtract \( 2^x \) from both sides to group exponential terms:  
\[ 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 2^x - 26 \]  
Factor out \( 2^x \) on the right-hand side:  
\[ 6 = 2^x (3 - 1) - 26 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 6 = 2^x \cdot 2 - 26 \]  
Add 26 to both sides to isolate the term with \( 2^x \):  
\[ 6 + 26 = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  
\[ 32 = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ 16 = 2^x \]  
Rewrite 16 as a power of 2:  
\[ 2^4 = 2^x \]  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ x = 4 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 4 \) by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \):  
Left-hand side:  
\[ 2^4 + 6 = 16 + 6 = 22 \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ 3 \cdot 2^4 - 26 = 3 \cdot 16 - 26 = 48 - 26 = 22 \]  
Since \( 22 = 22 \), the solution \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( x \) in \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by grouping like terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified equation for \( x \) (completed in Step 2, result: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that all subgoals have been addressed and the solution is complete. Since the solution \( x = 4 \) has been derived and validated, the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \) is \( x = 4 \).
