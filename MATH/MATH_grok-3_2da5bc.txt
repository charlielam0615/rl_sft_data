### Problem Statement
We need to determine the value of \( y \) that is not attainable for the function \( y = \frac{x - 4}{5x - 10} \), where \( x \neq 2 \). The answer should be expressed as a common fraction. This typically involves finding a value of \( y \) that cannot be achieved by any real \( x \) (except possibly \( x = 2 \), where the function is undefined), often related to the range of the function.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the unattainable value of \( y \).  
1. Simplify the function to understand its structure.  
2. Determine the domain of the function.  
3. Analyze the range to identify any \( y \)-values that cannot be attained.  
4. Express the unattainable value as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the function \( y = \frac{x - 4}{5x - 10} \) to make it easier to analyze its properties. This can be achieved by algebraic simplification.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the function:  
\[ y = \frac{x - 4}{5x - 10} \]  
Notice that the denominator can be factored:  
\[ 5x - 10 = 5(x - 2) \]  
Thus, the function becomes:  
\[ y = \frac{x - 4}{5(x - 2)} \]  
The function is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., \( x - 2 = 0 \), so \( x = 2 \), which matches the given condition \( x \neq 2 \). No further simplification is possible since the numerator and denominator have no common factors.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the domain of the function to confirm where it is defined. This involves identifying values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The denominator of \( y = \frac{x - 4}{5(x - 2)} \) is \( 5(x - 2) \). Set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ 5(x - 2) = 0 \]  
\[ x - 2 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 2 \]  
Thus, the function is undefined at \( x = 2 \). The domain is all real numbers except \( x = 2 \), i.e., \( x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{2\} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the range of the function \( y = \frac{x - 4}{5(x - 2)} \) to identify any \( y \)-values that cannot be attained. This can be achieved by solving for \( x \) in terms of \( y \) and determining if any \( y \)-values are excluded.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the range, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):  
\[ y = \frac{x - 4}{5(x - 2)} \]  
Multiply both sides by the denominator \( 5(x - 2) \):  
\[ y \cdot 5(x - 2) = x - 4 \]  
\[ 5y (x - 2) = x - 4 \]  
Distribute:  
\[ 5yx - 10y = x - 4 \]  
Rearrange all terms involving \( x \):  
\[ 5yx - x = 10y - 4 \]  
Factor out \( x \):  
\[ x (5y - 1) = 10y - 4 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{10y - 4}{5y - 1} \]  
For \( x \) to be defined, the denominator must not be zero:  
\[ 5y - 1 \neq 0 \]  
\[ 5y \neq 1 \]  
\[ y \neq \frac{1}{5} \]  
This suggests that \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) may be an unattainable value, as it makes the denominator zero, preventing a real \( x \)-value from producing \( y = \frac{1}{5} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) is indeed unattainable by checking if any real \( x \neq 2 \) can produce \( y = \frac{1}{5} \). This involves substituting \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) into the original equation and checking for solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) into the simplified function:  
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{x - 4}{5(x - 2)} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 5(x - 2) \):  
\[ \frac{1}{5} \cdot 5(x - 2) = x - 4 \]  
\[ x - 2 = x - 4 \]  
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:  
\[ -2 = -4 \]  
This is a contradiction, indicating that no real \( x \) satisfies \( y = \frac{1}{5} \). Thus, \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) is not attainable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that all other \( y \)-values (except \( y = \frac{1}{5} \) ) are attainable by checking if the expression for \( x \) produces valid real numbers for other \( y \)-values, ensuring no other unattainable values exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 4, we have:  
\[ x = \frac{10y - 4}{5y - 1} \]  
The expression is defined for all \( y \neq \frac{1}{5} \). We need to ensure \( x \neq 2 \) (since \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain). Set \( x = 2 \) and solve for \( y \):  
\[ 2 = \frac{10y - 4}{5y - 1} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 5y - 1 \):  
\[ 2 (5y - 1) = 10y - 4 \]  
\[ 10y - 2 = 10y - 4 \]  
\[ -2 = -4 \]  
This is a contradiction, meaning \( x = 2 \) does not correspond to any real \( y \). Thus, for any \( y \neq \frac{1}{5} \), the expression \( x = \frac{10y - 4}{5y - 1} \) yields a real \( x \), and since \( x \neq 2 \), it is in the domain. This suggests all \( y \neq \frac{1}{5} \) are attainable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
