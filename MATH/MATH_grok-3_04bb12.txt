### Problem Statement
We need to find the number of members in a marching band, denoted as \( N \), where \( 100 < N < 200 \). The number \( N \) satisfies the following conditions:
- When divided by 4, there is 1 extra person (\( N \mod 4 = 1 \)).
- When divided by 5, there are 2 extra people (\( N \mod 5 = 2 \)).
- When divided by 7, there are 3 extra people (\( N \mod 7 = 3 \)).

We will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( N \).  
1. Translate the problem conditions into mathematical equations based on the modulo constraints.  
2. Solve the system of modular equations to find possible values of \( N \).  
3. Ensure \( N \) satisfies the constraint \( 100 < N < 200 \).  
4. Verify the solution meets all given conditions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to translate the problem conditions into mathematical equations. This will be achieved by expressing the conditions \( N \mod 4 = 1 \), \( N \mod 5 = 2 \), and \( N \mod 7 = 3 \) as a system of congruences.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The problem states:
- When the band lines up in rows of 4, there is 1 extra person, so \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- When lined up in rows of 5, there are 2 extra people, so \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- When lined up in rows of 7, there are 3 extra people, so \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \).

Thus, we have the system of congruences:
1. \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
2. \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)
3. \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)

Additionally, \( N \) must satisfy \( 100 < N < 200 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of congruences to find \( N \). Since the moduli 4, 5, and 7 are pairwise coprime (as 4 = 2Â², 5, and 7 are distinct primes), we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to find a unique solution modulo \( 4 \times 5 \times 7 = 140 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
We solve the system:
1. \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
2. \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)
3. \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)

The moduli are pairwise coprime, and the product of the moduli is \( 4 \times 5 \times 7 = 140 \). We solve step-by-step using CRT.

**Step 1: Solve for \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) and \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)**  
Let \( N = 7k + 3 \) to satisfy \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Substitute into the second congruence:
\[
7k + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}
\]
Simplify \( 7 \mod 5 \): since \( 7 \div 5 = 1 \) remainder 2, \( 7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). Thus:
\[
2k + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}
\]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
2k \equiv 2 - 3 \equiv -1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}
\]
Solve \( 2k \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). Divide both sides by 2 (noting the modular inverse of 2 modulo 5 is 3, since \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)):
\[
k \equiv 4 \times 3 \equiv 12 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}
\]
Thus, \( k = 5m + 2 \). Substitute back:
\[
N = 7(5m + 2) + 3 = 35m + 14 + 3 = 35m + 17
\]
So, \( N \equiv 17 \pmod{35} \) satisfies \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) and \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \).

**Step 2: Incorporate \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)**  
Substitute \( N = 35m + 17 \) into \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \):
\[
35m + 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}
\]
Simplify: \( 35 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), \( 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so:
\[
3m + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}
\]
\[
3m \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
\]
Since \( \gcd(3, 4) = 1 \), \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( m = 4p \). Thus:
\[
N = 35(4p) + 17 = 140p + 17
\]
So, \( N \equiv 17 \pmod{140} \).

**Step 3: Apply the constraint \( 100 < N < 200 \)**  
The general solution is \( N = 140p + 17 \). We need \( 100 < N < 200 \):
\[
100 < 140p + 17 < 200
\]
\[
83 < 140p < 183
\]
\[
0.592 < p < 1.307
\]
Since \( p \) is an integer, \( p = 1 \). Thus:
\[
N = 140 \times 1 + 17 = 157
\]

**Check other values**:
- If \( p = 0 \): \( N = 17 \), which is \( < 100 \).
- If \( p = 2 \): \( N = 140 \times 2 + 17 = 297 \), which is \( > 200 \).

So, \( N = 157 \) is the only candidate within \( 100 < N < 200 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( N = 157 \) satisfies all given conditions: \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), and \( 100 < N < 200 \). This will be achieved by checking each congruence and the range constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify \( N = 157 \):
- **Modulo 4**: \( 157 \div 4 = 39 \) remainder 1 (since \( 4 \times 39 = 156 \)), so \( 157 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). Satisfied.
- **Modulo 5**: \( 157 \div 5 = 31 \) remainder 2 (since \( 5 \times 31 = 155 \)), so \( 157 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). Satisfied.
- **Modulo 7**: \( 157 \div 7 = 22 \) remainder 3 (since \( 7 \times 22 = 154 \)), so \( 157 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Satisfied.
- **Range**: \( 100 < 157 < 200 \). Satisfied.

Since \( N = 157 \) satisfies all conditions, it is a valid solution.
