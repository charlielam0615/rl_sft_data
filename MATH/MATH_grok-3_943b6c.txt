**Problem Statement:**
We start with \(\frac{1}{2}\) scoop of ice cream. We add \(\frac{2}{7}\) scoops, then eat \(\frac{5}{8}\) scoops. We need to determine how many scoops of ice cream remain.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total scoops after adding \(\frac{2}{7}\) to the initial \(\frac{1}{2}\).  
2. Subtract \(\frac{5}{8}\) scoops from the total to find the remaining amount.  
3. Ensure all calculations use a common denominator and simplify the final result.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the total scoops after adding \(\frac{2}{7}\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\). This will be achieved by finding a common denominator, adding the fractions, and simplifying the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To add \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7}\):  
- The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 7 is 14.  
- Convert \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{14}\) (multiply numerator and denominator by 7).  
- Convert \(\frac{2}{7} = \frac{4}{14}\) (multiply numerator and denominator by 2).  
- Add: \(\frac{7}{14} + \frac{4}{14} = \frac{11}{14}\).  
The total scoops after adding is \(\frac{11}{14}\).

**Step 3: Validation (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the addition \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7} = \frac{11}{14}\). This will be achieved by checking the calculation using the common denominator and ensuring the result is correct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify: \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{14}\), \(\frac{2}{7} = \frac{4}{14}\).  
\(\frac{7}{14} + \frac{4}{14} = \frac{11}{14}\).  
The calculation is correct, as 7 + 4 = 11 and the denominator remains 14. The result \(\frac{11}{14}\) is in simplest form (11 and 14 have no common factors).
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to subtract \(\frac{5}{8}\) scoops from \(\frac{11}{14}\) to find the remaining scoops. This will be achieved by finding a common denominator, subtracting the fractions, and simplifying the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To subtract \(\frac{11}{14} - \frac{5}{8}\):  
- The LCD of 14 and 8 is 56.  
- Convert \(\frac{11}{14} = \frac{11 \cdot 4}{14 \cdot 4} = \frac{44}{56}\).  
- Convert \(\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5 \cdot 7}{8 \cdot 7} = \frac{35}{56}\).  
- Subtract: \(\frac{44}{56} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{44 - 35}{56} = \frac{9}{56}\).  
The result \(\frac{9}{56}\) is in simplest form (9 and 56 have no common factors).
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the subtraction \(\frac{11}{14} - \frac{5}{8} = \frac{9}{56}\). This will be achieved by checking the subtraction with the common denominator and confirming the result is simplified.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify: \(\frac{11}{14} = \frac{44}{56}\), \(\frac{5}{8} = \frac{35}{56}\).  
\(\frac{44}{56} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{9}{56}\).  
The calculation is correct (44 - 35 = 9). Check if \(\frac{9}{56}\) is simplified: 9 (3²) and 56 (2³ · 7) have no common factors. The result is valid.
