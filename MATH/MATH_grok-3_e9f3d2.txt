### Problem Statement
We are given the trigonometric identity:

\[
\frac{\cos^4 \alpha}{\cos^2 \beta} + \frac{\sin^4 \alpha}{\sin^2 \beta} = 1
\]

and need to find the sum of all possible values of the expression:

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}
\]

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the categories Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation \(\frac{\cos^4 \alpha}{\cos^2 \beta} + \frac{\sin^4 \alpha}{\sin^2 \beta} = 1\).  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the terms by expressing the fourth powers as squares of squares (e.g., \(\cos^4 \alpha = (\cos^2 \alpha)^2\)) and attempt to combine or transform the fractions to reveal the relationship between \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:

\[
\frac{\cos^4 \alpha}{\cos^2 \beta} + \frac{\sin^4 \alpha}{\sin^2 \beta} = 1
\]

Rewrite the fourth powers:

\[
\cos^4 \alpha = (\cos^2 \alpha)^2, \quad \sin^4 \alpha = (\sin^2 \alpha)^2
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{(\cos^2 \alpha)^2}{\cos^2 \beta} + \frac{(\sin^2 \alpha)^2}{\sin^2 \beta} = 1
\]

To combine the fractions, find a common denominator, which is \(\cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta\):

\[
\frac{(\cos^2 \alpha)^2 \sin^2 \beta + (\sin^2 \alpha)^2 \cos^2 \beta}{\cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta} = 1
\]

Multiply both sides by \(\cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta\):

\[
(\cos^2 \alpha)^2 \sin^2 \beta + (\sin^2 \alpha)^2 \cos^2 \beta = \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta
\]

Let’s denote \(x = \sin^2 \alpha\) and \(y = \cos^2 \alpha\), where \(x + y = \sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\). Also, let \(p = \sin^2 \beta\) and \(q = \cos^2 \beta\), where \(p + q = \sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = 1\). The equation becomes:

\[
y^2 p + x^2 q = p q
\]

Since \(x = 1 - y\) and \(p = 1 - q\), substitute \(x = 1 - y\) into the equation:

\[
y^2 (1 - q) + (1 - y)^2 q = q (1 - q)
\]

Expand \((1 - y)^2 = 1 - 2y + y^2\), so:

\[
y^2 (1 - q) + (1 - 2y + y^2) q = q (1 - q)
\]

\[
y^2 - y^2 q + q - 2y q + y^2 q = q - q^2
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
y^2 - y^2 q + y^2 q + q - 2y q = q - q^2
\]

\[
y^2 + q - 2y q = q - q^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
y^2 - 2y q + q^2 = 0
\]

\[
(y - q)^2 = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
y = q \implies \cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta
\]

This implies:

\[
\cos \alpha = \pm \cos \beta
\]

Since \(x = 1 - y\) and \(p = 1 - q\), we also have:

\[
\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - \cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \cos^2 \beta = \sin^2 \beta
\]

\[
\sin \alpha = \pm \sin \beta
\]

The solutions are:

1. \(\cos \alpha = \cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = \sin \beta\), suggesting \(\alpha = \beta + 2k\pi\) or \(\alpha = -\beta + 2k\pi\).
2. \(\cos \alpha = -\cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = -\sin \beta\), suggesting \(\alpha = \pi - \beta + 2k\pi\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all possible values of \(\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Manipulate the given equation to relate to the target expression (partially addressed).
  - Subgoal 3: Derive the target expression using the relationships found.
  - Subgoal 4: Identify all possible values of the target expression.

**Current Goal**: Derive the target expression using the relationships \(\cos \alpha = \pm \cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = \pm \sin \beta\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Derive the target expression \(\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}\) using the relationships from Step 2.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the relationships \(\cos \alpha = \pm \cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = \pm \sin \beta\) into the target expression and simplify to find its possible values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Evaluate the target expression:

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}
\]

**Case 1: \(\sin \alpha = \sin \beta\), \(\cos \alpha = \cos \beta\)**

\[
\sin^2 \alpha = \sin^2 \beta, \quad \cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} = \frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \beta} = \sin^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \beta} = \cos^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = 1
\]

**Case 2: \(\sin \alpha = -\sin \beta\), \(\cos \alpha = -\cos \beta\)**

\[
\sin^2 \alpha = (-\sin \beta)^2 = \sin^2 \beta, \quad \cos^2 \alpha = (-\cos \beta)^2 = \cos^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} = \frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \beta} = \sin^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \beta} = \cos^2 \beta
\]

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = 1
\]

In both cases, the expression evaluates to 1. Let’s verify other possible relationships. Suppose \(\cos \alpha = \cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = -\sin \beta\):

\[
\sin^2 \alpha = \sin^2 \beta, \quad \cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta
\]

This gives the same result as above. Testing other combinations (e.g., \(\cos \alpha = -\cos \beta\), \(\sin \alpha = \sin \beta\)) yields consistent results due to the squaring of terms. The expression consistently simplifies to:

\[
\sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = 1
\]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the target expression always equals 1 and check for other possible values.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the given equation and target expression using an alternative method (e.g., direct substitution or trigonometric identities) to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s try an alternative approach to confirm. Return to the simplified equation from Step 2:

\[
(\cos^2 \alpha)^2 \sin^2 \beta + (\sin^2 \alpha)^2 \cos^2 \beta = \cos^2 \beta \sin^2 \beta
\]

The target expression is:

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{(\sin^2 \beta)^2}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{(\cos^2 \beta)^2}{\cos^2 \alpha}
\]

Assume \(\sin^2 \alpha = \sin^2 \beta\) and \(\cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta\) from Step 2. This consistently yields:

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \beta} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \beta} = \sin^2 \beta + \cos^2 \beta = 1
\]

To explore other possibilities, test with specific values. Let \(\beta = \frac{\pi}{4}\):

\[
\sin^2 \beta = \cos^2 \beta = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{\cos^4 \alpha}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sin^4 \alpha}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1
\]

\[
2 \cos^4 \alpha + 2 \sin^4 \alpha = 1
\]

\[
\cos^4 \alpha + \sin^4 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since \(\cos^4 \alpha + \sin^4 \alpha = (\cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha)^2 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha\):

\[
1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
2 \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{1}{4}
\]

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \alpha = \pm \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\sin 2\alpha = \pm 1 \implies 2\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \implies \alpha = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
\]

Test \(\alpha = \frac{\pi}{4}\):

\[
\sin^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]

This confirms the expression equals 1. Testing other values (e.g., \(\beta = 0\)) leads to indeterminate forms (division by zero), suggesting the solution holds where defined.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of all possible values of the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the expression consistently evaluates to 1 for all valid cases, sum the possible values (here, only 1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression \(\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}\) equals 1 for all cases where \(\sin^2 \alpha = \sin^2 \beta\) and \(\cos^2 \alpha = \cos^2 \beta\), which covers all valid solutions to the given equation (where \(\sin^2 \beta \neq 0\), \(\cos^2 \beta \neq 0\)). No other values arise from the relationships derived. Thus, the only possible value is 1, and the sum of all possible values is:

\[
1
\]

[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of all possible values of \(\frac{\sin^4 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha} + \frac{\cos^4 \beta}{\cos^2 \alpha}\) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
