### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \(\sec(-300^\circ)\). The secant function is defined as \(\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}\), so we need to compute the cosine of \(-300^\circ\) and take its reciprocal.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \(\sec(-300^\circ)\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the definition of secant to express \(\sec(-300^\circ)\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos(-300^\circ)}\).  
2. Simplify the angle \(-300^\circ\) using the property of cosine for negative angles.  
3. Convert \(-300^\circ\) to a positive angle by finding its coterminal angle.  
4. Evaluate the cosine of the resulting angle using the unit circle or known values.  
5. Compute the secant by taking the reciprocal of the cosine.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the angle \(-300^\circ\) using the property of cosine for negative angles. Since \(\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta\), we can express \(\cos(-300^\circ) = \cos 300^\circ\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the property of the cosine function, \(\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta\), we have:  
\[
\cos(-300^\circ) = \cos 300^\circ
\]  
Thus, \(\sec(-300^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos(-300^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\cos 300^\circ}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert \(-300^\circ\) to a positive coterminal angle to evaluate \(\cos 300^\circ\). Angles coterminal with \(300^\circ\) can be found by adding or subtracting multiples of \(360^\circ\). We will compute \(300^\circ\) or its equivalent angle in the unit circle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find a coterminal angle, note that \(-300^\circ + 360^\circ = 60^\circ\). Thus, \(\cos 300^\circ = \cos (360^\circ - 60^\circ)\). Using the cosine angle subtraction identity, \(\cos (360^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\), we get:  
\[
\cos 300^\circ = \cos (360^\circ - 60^\circ) = \cos 60^\circ
\]  
From the unit circle, \(\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore:  
\[
\cos 300^\circ = \frac{1}{2}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(\cos 300^\circ\). We will confirm that \(\cos 300^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\) by checking the angleâ€™s position in the unit circle and using known trigonometric values.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The angle \(300^\circ\) lies in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. The reference angle for \(300^\circ\) is \(360^\circ - 300^\circ = 60^\circ\). Thus:  
\[
\cos 300^\circ = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}
\]  
This matches our previous result, confirming its correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\sec(-300^\circ)\) using the cosine value. Since \(\sec(-300^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos 300^\circ}\) and \(\cos 300^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\), we take the reciprocal to find the secant.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \(\cos 300^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\), we compute:  
\[
\sec(-300^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos 300^\circ} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2
\]  
[/IMP]
