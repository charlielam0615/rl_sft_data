**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\), given that \(a, b, c \neq 0\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To simplify the given expression, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Combine the fractions into a single fraction.
2. Simplify the resulting fraction by canceling common terms in the numerator and denominator.
3. Verify the simplified expression to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine the two fractions into a single fraction.
How to Achieve: Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together to form one fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To combine \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\), multiply the numerators (\(3a^2b \times 10c\)) and the denominators (\(5ac \times 6ab\)):
\[
\frac{3a^2b \times 10c}{5ac \times 6ab}
\]
Numerator: \(3 \times 10 \times a^2 \times b \times c = 30a^2bc\)
Denominator: \(5 \times 6 \times a \times c \times a \times b = 30a^2bc\)
So, the combined fraction is:
\[
\frac{30a^2bc}{30a^2bc}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the resulting fraction.
How to Achieve: Cancel common terms in the numerator and denominator, ensuring all variables are non-zero as given.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The fraction is \(\frac{30a^2bc}{30a^2bc}\). Since \(a, b, c \neq 0\), divide the numerator and denominator by the common factors:
- Numerical coefficient: \(30 \div 30 = 1\)
- Variables: \(\frac{a^2}{a^2} = 1\), \(\frac{b}{b} = 1\), \(\frac{c}{c} = 1\)
Thus:
\[
\frac{30a^2bc}{30a^2bc} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the simplified expression.
How to Achieve: Check the simplification process for errors and confirm the result by re-evaluating the original expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, recompute the simplification:
Original: \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\)
Alternatively, simplify before multiplying:
- First fraction: \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} = \frac{3a^2b}{5ac} = \frac{3ab}{5c}\) (cancel \(a\) from numerator and denominator).
- Second fraction: \(\frac{10c}{6ab} = \frac{10c}{6ab} = \frac{5c}{3ab}\) (divide numerator and denominator by 2).
Now multiply:
\[
\frac{3ab}{5c} \times \frac{5c}{3ab} = \frac{3ab \times 5c}{5c \times 3ab} = \frac{15abc}{15abc} = 1
\]
This matches the previous result, confirming the simplification is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Simplify \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\)
  - Subgoal 1: Combine the fractions into a single fraction (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting fraction (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the simplified expression (completed in Step 4).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.
The simplified expression is \(1\).
