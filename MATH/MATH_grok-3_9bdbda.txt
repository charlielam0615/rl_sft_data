**Problem Restatement:**  
Alice has the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. She must select a pair of distinct digits to form a two-digit number. We need to determine how many of these two-digit numbers are divisible by 3.

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, break the problem into steps:  
1. Identify all possible two-digit numbers using the given digits (2, 3, 5, 7, 9), ensuring the digits are distinct.  
2. Determine the divisibility rule for 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  
3. Calculate the sum of the digits for each two-digit number.  
4. Count how many of these sums are divisible by 3.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: List all possible two-digit numbers with distinct digits from the set {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}.  
How to Achieve: Use the given digits to form two-digit numbers, where the tens digit and units digit are different. Since order matters (e.g., 23 is different from 32), consider all permutations of distinct pairs.

Possible digits: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}  
We need two-digit numbers of the form AB, where A (tens digit) and B (units digit) are distinct.  
Total numbers = 5 choices for A × 4 choices for B (since A ≠ B) = 20 numbers.  
List of all possible two-digit numbers:  
23, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 37, 39, 52, 53, 57, 59, 72, 73, 75, 79, 92, 93, 95, 97

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine which of the two-digit numbers are divisible by 3.  
How to Achieve: For each number, calculate the sum of its digits. Check if the sum is divisible by 3, as per the divisibility rule for 3.

Divisibility rule: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  
Calculate the sum of digits for each number:  
- 23: 2 + 3 = 5  
- 25: 2 + 5 = 7  
- 27: 2 + 7 = 9 (divisible by 3)  
- 29: 2 + 9 = 11  
- 32: 3 + 2 = 5  
- 35: 3 + 5 = 8  
- 37: 3 + 7 = 10  
- 39: 3 + 9 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 52: 5 + 2 = 7  
- 53: 5 + 3 = 8  
- 57: 5 + 7 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 59: 5 + 9 = 14  
- 72: 7 + 2 = 9 (divisible by 3)  
- 73: 7 + 3 = 10  
- 75: 7 + 5 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 79: 7 + 9 = 16  
- 92: 9 + 2 = 11  
- 93: 9 + 3 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 95: 9 + 5 = 14  
- 97: 9 + 7 = 16  
Numbers divisible by 3: 27, 39, 57, 72, 75, 93

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many two-digit numbers formed by distinct digits from {2, 3, 5, 7, 9} are divisible by 3.  
  - Subgoal 1: List all possible two-digit numbers with distinct digits.  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of digits for each number.  
  - Subgoal 3: Check which sums are divisible by 3 and count them.  
Current Goal: Confirm the count of numbers divisible by 3.  
Result so far: 6 numbers (27, 39, 57, 72, 75, 93) are divisible by 3.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the count of two-digit numbers divisible by 3.  
How to Achieve: Re-check the sums of digits for accuracy and ensure no numbers were missed in the list.

Re-verify the list of numbers: 23, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 37, 39, 52, 53, 57, 59, 72, 73, 75, 79, 92, 93, 95, 97 (20 numbers, complete).  
Recheck sums for numbers identified as divisible by 3:  
- 27: 2 + 7 = 9 (divisible by 3)  
- 39: 3 + 9 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 57: 5 + 7 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 72: 7 + 2 = 9 (divisible by 3)  
- 75: 7 + 5 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
- 93: 9 + 3 = 12 (divisible by 3)  
All sums are correct. No additional numbers have sums divisible by 3.  
Final count: 6 numbers.
