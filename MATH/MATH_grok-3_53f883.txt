**Problem Statement**: Jeremiah is traveling in a car at 60 miles per hour. We need to determine how many minutes it will take him to travel 20 miles.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the time in hours to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour.
2. Convert the time from hours to minutes.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the time in hours to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour.
How to Achieve: Use the formula time = distance / speed.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the time in hours, divide the distance (20 miles) by the speed (60 miles per hour):
Time = 20 miles / 60 miles per hour = 1/3 hours.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Convert the time from hours to minutes.
How to Achieve: Multiply the time in hours (1/3 hours) by 60 to convert to minutes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Time in minutes = (1/3 hours) × 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation is correct.
How to Achieve: Check the calculation by ensuring the units cancel correctly and the result makes sense.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Verify: Distance = Speed × Time. Using time in hours: 60 miles/hour × (1/3) hour = 20 miles, which matches the given distance. Alternatively, in minutes: Speed = 60 miles/hour = 1 mile/minute (since 60 miles/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 1 mile/minute). Then, 1 mile/minute × 20 minutes = 20 miles, which is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many minutes it takes Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate time in hours (completed: 1/3 hours).
  - Subgoal 2: Convert time to minutes (completed: 20 minutes).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: calculation verified).
Current Goal: Completed all subgoals; solution is 20 minutes.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: It will take Jeremiah 20 minutes to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour.
