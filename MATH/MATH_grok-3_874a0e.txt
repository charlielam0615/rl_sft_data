### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) are not divisible by 5 or 7.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the number of three-digit numbers that are neither multiples of 5 nor 7.  
Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers.  
2. Find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 5.  
3. Find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 7.  
4. Find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (their least common multiple, 35).  
5. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7.  
6. Subtract the result from the total to get numbers divisible by neither.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers. This can be achieved by finding the range of three-digit numbers (100 to 999) and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999, inclusive.  
Total numbers = 999 − 100 + 1 = 900.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 5. This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 5 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100 (5 × 20).  
The largest three-digit multiple of 5 is 995 (5 × 199).  
Number of multiples: ⌊995 ÷ 5⌋ − ⌊100 ÷ 5⌋ + 1 = 199 − 20 + 1 = 180.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 7. This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 7 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105 (7 × 15).  
The largest three-digit multiple of 7 is 994 (7 × 142).  
Number of multiples: ⌊994 ÷ 7⌋ − ⌊105 ÷ 7⌋ + 1 = 142 − 15 + 1 = 128.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., by their least common multiple, 35). This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 35 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 5 × 7 = 35.  
The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105 (35 × 3).  
The largest three-digit multiple of 35 is 980 (35 × 28).  
Number of multiples: ⌊980 ÷ 35⌋ − ⌊105 ÷ 35⌋ + 1 = 28 − 3 + 1 = 26.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers (completed: 900).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find numbers divisible by 5 (completed: 180).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find numbers divisible by 7 (completed: 128).  
  - Subgoal 4: Find numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (completed: 26).  
  - Subgoal 5: Use inclusion-exclusion to find numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 6: Subtract from total to get numbers divisible by neither.  
**Current Goal**: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7. This can be achieved by combining the counts from previous steps: numbers divisible by 5, by 7, and by both.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using inclusion-exclusion:  
|Numbers divisible by 5 or 7| = |Divisible by 5| + |Divisible by 7| − |Divisible by both|.  
= 180 + 128 − 26 = 282.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers that are neither multiples of 5 nor 7. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total three-digit numbers = 900.  
Numbers divisible by 5 or 7 = 282.  
Numbers divisible by neither = 900 − 282 = 618.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking the calculations and ensuring the logic is sound. This can be achieved by reviewing the steps and performing an alternative calculation if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review calculations:  
- Total numbers: 999 − 100 + 1 = 900 (correct).  
- Multiples of 5: ⌊995 ÷ 5⌋ − ⌊100 ÷ 5⌋ + 1 = 199 − 20 + 1 = 180 (correct).  
- Multiples of 7: ⌊994 ÷ 7⌋ − ⌊105 ÷ 7⌋ + 1 = 142 − 15 + 1 = 128 (correct).  
- Multiples of 35: ⌊980 ÷ 35⌋ − ⌊105 ÷ 35⌋ + 1 = 28 − 3 + 1 = 26 (correct).  
- Inclusion-exclusion: 180 + 128 − 26 = 282 (correct).  
- Final result: 900 − 282 = 618 (correct).  
Alternative check: The proportion of numbers not divisible by 5 (4/5) and not divisible by 7 (6/7) is approximately (4/5) × (6/7) = 24/35. For 900 numbers, (24/35) × 900 ≈ 617.14, which rounds to 618, supporting the result.  
The calculations are consistent and logical.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is **618**.
