**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of possible outfits that can be made from 6 shirts, 4 ties, and 3 pairs of pants, where an outfit requires a shirt and pants, and may or may not include a tie.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total number of outfits.  
1. Identify the components of an outfit: a shirt (required), pants (required), and a tie (optional).  
2. Determine the number of choices for each component.  
3. Calculate the total number of outfits by combining these choices, accounting for the optionality of the tie.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of choices for each outfit component.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the number of options for shirts, pants, and ties, considering that a tie is optional (can choose a tie or no tie).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Shirts: There are 6 shirts, so there are 6 choices.  
- Pants: There are 3 pairs of pants, so there are 3 choices.  
- Ties: A tie is optional. For each outfit, we can either choose one of the 4 ties or choose not to wear a tie, giving 4 (ties) + 1 (no tie) = 5 choices.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of outfits.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the number of choices for shirts, pants, and ties (including the option of no tie) to find the total number of outfit combinations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of outfits is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:  
- Number of shirts: 6  
- Number of pants: 3  
- Number of tie options: 5 (4 ties + 1 no-tie option)  
Total outfits = 6 × 3 × 5 = 90 outfits.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the total number of outfits.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the logic of the multiplication rule and consider an alternative approach to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The multiplication rule applies because each choice (shirt, pants, tie/no-tie) is independent. To validate, consider an alternative approach:  
- Outfits with a tie: Choose 1 shirt (6 choices), 1 pair of pants (3 choices), and 1 tie (4 choices). Total = 6 × 3 × 4 = 72 outfits.  
- Outfits without a tie: Choose 1 shirt (6 choices), 1 pair of pants (3 choices), and no tie (1 choice). Total = 6 × 3 × 1 = 18 outfits.  
- Total outfits = 72 + 18 = 90 outfits.  
This matches the previous calculation, confirming the result.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of outfits.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify components of an outfit (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine choices for each component (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total outfits (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the problem is solved and validated.  
The total number of outfits is 90, and all subgoals have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The number of possible outfits is 90.
