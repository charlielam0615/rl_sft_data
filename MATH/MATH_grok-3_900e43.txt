**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable steps:  
1. Derive the equation of the curve by eliminating the parameter \( t \) from the given parametric equations \( x = \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \), \( y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \).  
2. Identify the type of curve by comparing the resulting equation to standard forms of conic sections or lines.  
3. Match the curve to one of the given options.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the equation of the curve by eliminating the parameter \( t \). This will be achieved by expressing \( t \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \), then substituting to find a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the parametric equations:  
\[ x = \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}, \quad y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \]

Solve for \( t \) using the expression for \( y \):  
\[ y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 1 + t^2 \):  
\[ y (1 + t^2) = 2t \]  
\[ t = \frac{y (1 + t^2)}{2} \]  

This is complex, so instead, express \( t \) directly:  
\[ y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \implies t = \frac{y (1 + t^2)}{2} \]  
This suggests a substitution approach. Instead, try to eliminate \( t \). From \( y \):  
\[ y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \implies t = \frac{y}{2} (1 + t^2) \] (not ideal).  

Alternatively, square both sides to relate terms:  
\[ y^2 = \left( \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 = \frac{4t^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} \]

For \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \]  
Notice that \( 1 - t^2 = (1 - t^2) \). Try to find \( t^2 \):  
From \( y \), solve for \( t \):  
\[ y (1 + t^2) = 2t \implies t^2 (y) = 2t - y \] (complex).  

Instead, try to find a relationship by computing \( x^2 + y^2 \):  
\[ x^2 = \left( \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} \]  
\[ y^2 = \left( \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 = \frac{4t^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} \]  
Add them:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} + \frac{4t^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2 + 4t^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} \]  
Numerator:  
\[ (1 - t^2)^2 + 4t^2 = (1 - 2t^2 + t^4) + 4t^2 = t^4 + 2t^2 + 1 = (t^2 + 1)^2 \]  
So:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = \frac{(t^2 + 1)^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} = 1 \]  
Thus:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]  
This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the derived equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) correctly represents the curve and confirm it matches the parametric equations for all \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \), \( y = \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \) into \( x^2 + y^2 \):  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2t}{1 + t^2} \right)^2 \]  
As computed:  
\[ = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2 + 4t^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} = \frac{(t^2 + 1)^2}{(1 + t^2)^2} = 1 \]  
This confirms the equation is satisfied. Check if all points on the circle are covered:  
- For \( t = 0 \): \( x = \frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 \), \( y = \frac{0}{1} = 0 \), point (1, 0).  
- For \( t = 1 \): \( x = \frac{1 - 1}{1 + 1} = 0 \), \( y = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \), point (0, 1).  
- For \( t = -1 \): \( x = \frac{1 - 1}{1 + 1} = 0 \), \( y = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \), point (0, -1).  
- As \( t \to \infty \): \( x \approx \frac{-t^2}{t^2} = -1 \), \( y \approx \frac{2t}{t^2} = 0 \), point (-1, 0).  
The points trace a circle. Check if itâ€™s the full circle: the parameterization resembles \( x = \cos \theta \), \( y = \sin \theta \), suggesting all points on \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) are covered as \( t \) varies over all real numbers.

- (A) Line: \( y = mx + b \) (linear equation, not \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)).  
- (B) Circle: \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) (matches).  
- (C) Parabola: \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) or \( x = ay^2 + by + c \) (not a quadratic in one variable).  
- (D) Ellipse: \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) (requires \( a \neq b \), but here \( a = b = 1 \), a circle).  
- (E) Hyperbola: \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) or similar (no subtraction).  
The curve is a circle, corresponding to option (B).
