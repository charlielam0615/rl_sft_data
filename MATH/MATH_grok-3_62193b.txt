### Problem Restatement
We need to find the perimeter of a right triangle with an area of 120 square units and one leg of length 24 units. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the perimeter of the right triangle:
1. Identify the known values: area = 120 square units, one leg = 24 units.
2. Use the area formula for a right triangle to find the other leg.
3. Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.
4. Compute the perimeter by summing the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the length of the other leg using the area formula.  
**How to Achieve**: The area of a right triangle is given by \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs. We know the area is 120 square units and one leg is 24 units. Solve for the other leg.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b = 120
\]
Given one leg \( a = 24 \), substitute:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 24 \cdot b = 120
\]
\[
12 \cdot b = 120
\]
\[
b = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]
The other leg is 10 units.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.  
**How to Achieve**: For a right triangle with legs \( a = 24 \) and \( b = 10 \), the hypotenuse \( c \) is found using \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
c = \sqrt{24^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{576 + 100} = \sqrt{676} = 26
\]
The hypotenuse is 26 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for the leg and hypotenuse.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the area using the calculated leg lengths and confirm the hypotenuse satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the area:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 24 \cdot 10 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 240 = 120
\]
The area matches the given 120 square units.

Verify the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
24^2 + 10^2 = 576 + 100 = 676
\]
\[
26^2 = 676
\]
Since \( 24^2 + 10^2 = 26^2 \), the hypotenuse is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the perimeter of the triangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Sum the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse: \( 24 + 10 + 26 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the perimeter:
\[
24 + 10 + 26 = 60
\]
The perimeter is 60 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
