### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of rectangles \( r \) and squares \( s \) formed by the nine horizontal and nine vertical lines on an \( 8 \times 8 \) checkerboard, compute the ratio \( s/r \), express it as a fraction \( m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers, and find \( m + n \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Calculate the total number of rectangles \( r \) formed by the nine horizontal and nine vertical lines.  
2. Determine the number of squares \( s \) among these rectangles.  
3. Compute the ratio \( s/r \) and simplify it to the form \( m/n \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime.  
4. Find \( m + n \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of rectangles \( r \) formed by nine horizontal and nine vertical lines.  
**How to Achieve**: A rectangle is formed by choosing 2 out of 9 horizontal lines and 2 out of 9 vertical lines. Use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) to compute the number of ways to choose these lines and multiply the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To form a rectangle, select 2 horizontal lines from 9 and 2 vertical lines from 9. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 9 is:

\[
\binom{9}{2} = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2 \cdot 1} = 36
\]

Thus, the total number of rectangles is:

\[
r = \binom{9}{2} \times \binom{9}{2} = 36 \times 36 = 1296
\]

So, \( r = 1296 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the total number of rectangles \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the combination formula was applied correctly and check the arithmetic. Alternatively, consider a smaller case (e.g., a 2x2 grid) to ensure the method is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute for accuracy:

\[
\binom{9}{2} = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2} = 36
\]

\[
r = 36 \times 36 = 1296
\]

For a smaller case, consider a 2x2 checkerboard with 3 horizontal and 3 vertical lines (forming a 2x2 grid of squares):

\[
\binom{3}{2} = 3
\]

\[
r = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

A 2x2 checkerboard has 9 rectangles (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, and 2x2 configurations), which matches known results, confirming the method. Thus, \( r = 1296 \) is correct for the 8x8 case.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the number of squares \( s \) among the rectangles.  
**How to Achieve**: A square requires equal horizontal and vertical spans. For each possible square size \( k \) (from 1 to 8), count the number of \( k \times k \) squares by determining how many positions are possible in the 8x8 grid, summing over all sizes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A square of size \( k \times k \) (where \( k \) is the number of unit squares spanned) requires choosing \( k + 1 \) horizontal lines and \( k + 1 \) vertical lines, with the same starting position for both. In an 8x8 grid, there are \( 9 - k \) possible starting positions for the top-left corner of a \( k \times k \) square in both directions. Thus, the number of \( k \times k \) squares is:

\[
(9 - k) \times (9 - k) = (9 - k)^2
\]

Sum over all possible square sizes (\( k = 1 \) to \( k = 8 \)):

\[
s = \sum_{k=1}^{8} (9 - k)^2
\]

Calculate each term:

- \( k = 1 \): \( (9 - 1)^2 = 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( k = 2 \): \( (9 - 2)^2 = 7^2 = 49 \)
- \( k = 3 \): \( (9 - 3)^2 = 6^2 = 36 \)
- \( k = 4 \): \( (9 - 4)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( k = 5 \): \( (9 - 5)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
- \( k = 6 \): \( (9 - 6)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( k = 7 \): \( (9 - 7)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( k = 8 \): \( (9 - 8)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \)

\[
s = 64 + 49 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 204
\]

Alternatively, use the formula for the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers. Since \( 9 - k \) ranges from 8 to 1:

\[
s = \sum_{m=1}^{8} m^2 = \frac{8 \cdot 9 \cdot 17}{6} = \frac{1224}{6} = 204
\]

Thus, \( s = 204 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the number of squares \( s \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the arithmetic of the sum and test the method on a smaller grid (e.g., 2x2) to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the sum:

\[
64 + 49 = 113, \quad 113 + 36 = 149, \quad 149 + 25 = 174, \quad 174 + 16 = 190, \quad 190 + 9 = 199, \quad 199 + 4 = 203, \quad 203 + 1 = 204
\]

For a 2x2 grid (3 horizontal and 3 vertical lines):

\[
s = (3 - 1)^2 + (3 - 2)^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

A 2x2 grid has 4 unit squares and 1 larger 2x2 square, totaling 5 squares, which matches. The calculation \( s = 204 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the ratio \( s/r \), simplify it to \( m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime, and find \( m + n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use \( s = 204 \) and \( r = 1296 \), compute \( s/r \), simplify the fraction, and sum the numerator and denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\frac{s}{r} = \frac{204}{1296}
\]

Simplify by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). Divide numerator and denominator by 12:

\[
204 \div 12 = 17, \quad 1296 \div 12 = 108
\]

\[
\frac{204}{1296} = \frac{17}{108}
\]

Check if 17 and 108 are relatively prime. Since 17 is prime and does not divide 108 (\( 108 \div 17 \approx 6.35 \)), the GCD is 1. Thus, \( m = 17 \), \( n = 108 \).

\[
m + n = 17 + 108 = 125
\]

[/IMP]
