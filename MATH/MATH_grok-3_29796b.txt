### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert 5 cubic yards to cubic feet, as the cost is given per cubic foot.  
2. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert 5 cubic yards to cubic feet. To achieve this, use the conversion factor that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Convert 5 cubic yards to cubic feet:  
1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet.  
So, 5 cubic yards = 5 × 27 = 135 cubic feet.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total cost of 135 cubic feet of topsoil. To achieve this, multiply the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot, which is $6.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the total cost:  
135 cubic feet × $6 per cubic foot = 135 × 6 = 810 dollars.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the cost of 5 cubic yards of topsoil.  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert 5 cubic yards to cubic feet (completed: 135 cubic feet).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total cost by multiplying cubic feet by cost per cubic foot (completed: $810).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to verify the completion of the main goal, which has been achieved.  
The final answer is $810.
