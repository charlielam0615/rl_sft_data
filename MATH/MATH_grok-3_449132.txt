### Problem Statement
We need to find all integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2
\]

where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Our goal is to determine all integers \( n \) (positive, negative, or zero) that make this equation true, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the equation, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the floor function components: Compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\).  
2. Express the equation in terms of integer variables to simplify the floor functions.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for integer \( n \).  
4. Verify solutions for both positive and negative integers, including zero.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) in terms of an integer variable to simplify the equation. Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), we can define an integer \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \), and express \( n \) in terms of \( k \). Then, substitute into the equation to compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \), where \( k \) is an integer. This implies:

\[
k \leq \frac{n}{2} < k + 1
\]

Multiplying through by 2:

\[
2k \leq n < 2k + 2
\]

Since \( n \) is an integer, possible values of \( n \) are \( n = 2k \) (even) or \( n = 2k + 1 \) (odd). Substitute these into the original equation:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - k^2 = 2
\]

**Case 1: \( n = 2k \)** (even)  
\[
\frac{n^2}{4} = \frac{(2k)^2}{4} = k^2
\]
Since \( k^2 \) is an integer, \(\left\lfloor k^2 \right\rfloor = k^2\). The equation becomes:

\[
k^2 - k^2 = 0 \neq 2
\]

This case yields no solutions.

**Case 2: \( n = 2k + 1 \)** (odd)  
\[
n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
\]
\[
\frac{n^2}{4} = \frac{4k^2 + 4k + 1}{4} = k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\), we have:

\[
k^2 + k \leq k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4} < k^2 + k + 1
\]
Thus:

\[
\left\lfloor k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = k^2 + k
\]
The equation becomes:

\[
k^2 + k - k^2 = k = 2
\]
So:

\[
k = 2
\]
Then, \( n = 2k + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \( n = 5 \) satisfies the original equation and check if other values of \( k \) yield valid integer solutions. We will substitute \( n = 5 \) into the equation and test other \( k \) values in the odd case, as well as consider negative \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Verify \( n = 5 \)**:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.5 \right\rfloor = 2
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{5^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 6.25 \right\rfloor = 6
\]
\[
6 - 2^2 = 6 - 4 = 2
\]
This satisfies the equation, so \( n = 5 \) is a solution.

**Test other \( k \) values in the odd case (\( n = 2k + 1 \))**:  
From Step 2, we derived \( k = 2 \). Let’s try other integers for \( k \):

- For \( k = 1 \):

\[
n = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.5 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{3^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{9}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.25 \right\rfloor = 2
\]
\[
2 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \neq 2
\]

- For \( k = 3 \):

\[
n = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 3.5 \right\rfloor = 3
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{7^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{49}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 12.25 \right\rfloor = 12
\]
\[
12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3 \neq 2
\]

- For \( k = 0 \):

\[
n = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.5 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.25 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
\[
0 - 0^2 = 0 \neq 2
\]

**Negative \( n \)**: Since \( n^2 \) is the same for \( -n \), try \( n = -5 \) (\( k = \left\lfloor \frac{-5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -2.5 \right\rfloor = -3 \)):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{(-5)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = 6
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{-5}{2} \right\rfloor = -3
\]
\[
6 - (-3)^2 = 6 - 9 = -3 \neq 2
\]

Try the odd case with negative \( k \), e.g., \( k = -3 \):

\[
n = 2(-3) + 1 = -5
\]
Already tested, yields no solution. Other negative \( k \) yield similar results (e.g., \( k = -1 \), \( n = -1 \)):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{(-1)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = 0
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{-1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -0.5 \right\rfloor = -1
\]
\[
0 - (-1)^2 = 0 - 1 = -1 \neq 2
\]

**Zero case**: \( n = 0 \):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor = 0
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{0^2}{4} \right\rfloor = 0
\]
\[
0 - 0^2 = 0 \neq 2
\]

Only \( n = 5 \) satisfies the equation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find all integer \( n \) such that \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) as an integer \( k \) and derive \( n \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute into the equation and solve for \( k \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions and check all integer cases (positive, negative, zero).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm that all possible solutions have been found by reviewing the cases.  

The even case (\( n = 2k \)) yielded no solutions. The odd case (\( n = 2k + 1 \)) gave \( k = 2 \), so \( n = 5 \), which was verified. Other \( k \) values and negative \( n \) were tested and did not satisfy the equation. Zero was also checked.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all relevant cases have been considered by recalling information about the equation’s behavior for different \( n \). Focus on the floor function’s effect and the derived equation \( k = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The equation involves floor functions, which depend on whether \( n \) is even or odd due to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\). In Step 2, we derived that only the odd case (\( n = 2k + 1 \)) leads to \( k = 2 \), giving \( n = 5 \). Step 3 tested other \( k \) values and negative/zero cases, confirming no other solutions. The floor function \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\) for odd \( n = 2k + 1 \) consistently produces \( k^2 + k \), and only \( k = 2 \) satisfies \( k = 2 \). Negative \( n \) produce the same \( n^2 \), but \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) changes sign, leading to negative results.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The only integer value of \( n \) that satisfies the equation \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2\) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
