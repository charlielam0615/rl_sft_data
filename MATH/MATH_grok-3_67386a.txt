**Problem Statement:** Given the cubic polynomial \(2x^3 - 7x^2 - 6 = 0\), where \(r\), \(s\), and \(t\) are the roots, find the value of the product \(rst\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \(rst\). For a cubic polynomial of the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the product of the roots \(rst\) can be determined using Vieta's formulas. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify the coefficients of the polynomial.  
2. Apply Vieta's formula to find the product of the roots.  
3. Verify the result if necessary.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the coefficients of the polynomial \(2x^3 - 7x^2 - 6 = 0\) and apply Vieta's formula to find \(rst\). This can be achieved by comparing the polynomial to the standard form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) and using the formula for the product of the roots, which is \(-d/a\).

[IMP]  
The polynomial is \(2x^3 - 7x^2 + 0x - 6 = 0\). Comparing with \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), we have:  
- \(a = 2\) (coefficient of \(x^3\)),  
- \(b = -7\) (coefficient of \(x^2\)),  
- \(c = 0\) (coefficient of \(x\)),  
- \(d = -6\) (constant term).  

By Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the product of the roots \(rst = -d/a\).  
Thus, \(rst = -(-6)/2 = 6/2 = 3\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the result \(rst = 3\). This can be achieved by checking the polynomial’s structure and confirming the application of Vieta's formula, or by considering alternative methods like finding the roots (if feasible) to compute \(rst\) directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, recheck Vieta's formula: The polynomial is \(2x^3 - 7x^2 + 0x - 6 = 0\), with \(a = 2\), \(d = -6\). The product of the roots is \(rst = -d/a = -(-6)/2 = 3\), which matches the previous result.  

As an additional check, consider the sum of the roots (\(r + s + t = -b/a = -(-7)/2 = 7/2\)) and the sum of pairwise products (\(rs + rt + st = c/a = 0/2 = 0\)). While these are not directly needed for \(rst\), they confirm the polynomial’s consistency. Solving for the roots explicitly is unnecessary since Vieta's formula is reliable for the product. Thus, \(rst = 3\) is consistent.

### Final Answer
The product of the roots \(rst = 3\).
