### Problem Restatement
Given a table showing the days (Monday to Friday) when Anna, Bill, and Carl marked an "X" to indicate they cannot attend a meeting, determine which day allows the most people to attend. An "X" in a cell means the person is unavailable on that day, and an empty cell means they are available.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
1. Interpret the table to identify each person's availability.  
2. Count the number of people available on each day.  
3. Identify the day with the maximum number of available people.  
4. Verify the result to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to interpret the table to determine each person's availability. This will be achieved by analyzing the table, noting that an "X" indicates unavailability and an empty cell indicates availability, and summarizing the availability for each person across all days.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the table:  
- **Anna**: X on Monday and Wednesday (unavailable), available on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  
- **Bill**: X on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (unavailable), available on Monday and Wednesday.  
- **Carl**: X on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (unavailable), available on Wednesday.  
Summarized availability:  
- **Monday**: Anna (X), Bill (available), Carl (X) → Bill available.  
- **Tuesday**: Anna (available), Bill (X), Carl (X) → Anna available.  
- **Wednesday**: Anna (X), Bill (available), Carl (available) → Bill and Carl available.  
- **Thursday**: Anna (available), Bill (X), Carl (X) → Anna available.  
- **Friday**: Anna (available), Bill (X), Carl (X) → Anna available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the number of people available on each day. This will be achieved by tallying the available people for each day based on the availability determined in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the availability from Step 2:  
- **Monday**: Bill → 1 person available.  
- **Tuesday**: Anna → 1 person available.  
- **Wednesday**: Bill, Carl → 2 people available.  
- **Thursday**: Anna → 1 person available.  
- **Friday**: Anna → 1 person available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the day with the maximum number of available people. This will be achieved by comparing the counts from the previous step to find the day with the highest number of available people.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the counts in Step 3:  
- Monday: 1 person  
- Tuesday: 1 person  
- Wednesday: 2 people  
- Thursday: 1 person  
- Friday: 1 person  
The maximum number of people available is 2, which occurs on **Wednesday**.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the result by checking the availability data and counts for accuracy. This will be achieved by re-examining the table and recalculating the availability for Wednesday to confirm that it has the most attendees.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-check the table for Wednesday:  
- Anna: X (unavailable).  
- Bill: No X (available).  
- Carl: No X (available).  
Wednesday has 2 people available (Bill and Carl).  
Compare with other days:  
- Monday: Only Bill (1 person).  
- Tuesday: Only Anna (1 person).  
- Thursday: Only Anna (1 person).  
- Friday: Only Anna (1 person).  
The calculation confirms that Wednesday, with 2 people, has the most attendees.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the day when the most people can attend the meeting.  
  - Subgoal 1: Interpret the table to identify each person's availability (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Count the number of people available on each day (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the day with the maximum number of available people (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result for accuracy (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
**Conclusion**: The day with the most people available is **Wednesday**, with 2 people (Bill and Carl) able to attend.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The day when the most people can attend the meeting is **Wednesday**.
