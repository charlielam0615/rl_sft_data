### Step 2: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Express the terms of both arithmetic sequences mathematically.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( d \) is the common difference, and \( n \) is the term number (starting from 1).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the first sequence:  
- First term \( a_1 = 1 \), common difference \( d = 6 \).  
- The nth term is:  
  \[
  a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 6 = 6n - 5
  \]  
  where \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \).  

For the second sequence:  
- First term \( a_1 = 4 \), common difference \( d = 7 \).  
- The nth term is:  
  \[
  b_m = 4 + (m-1) \cdot 7 = 7m - 3
  \]  
  where \( m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the common terms by finding numbers that appear in both sequences.  
- **How to Achieve:** Set the expressions for the terms of both sequences equal to each other (\( 6n - 5 = 7m - 3 \)) and solve for integer solutions of \( n \) and \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find common terms, solve:  
\[
6n - 5 = 7m - 3
\]  
Rearrange:  
\[
6n - 7m = 2
\]  
This is a linear Diophantine equation. We need integer solutions for \( n \) and \( m \). Since \( n \) and \( m \) represent term positions, they must be positive integers (\( n, m \geq 1 \)).  

Solve for \( n \):  
\[
6n = 7m + 2 \implies n = \frac{7m + 2}{6}
\]  
For \( n \) to be an integer, \( 7m + 2 \) must be divisible by 6. Thus:  
\[
7m + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}
\]  
Since \( 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), we have:  
\[
7m \equiv m \pmod{6} \implies m + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{6} \implies m \equiv -2 \pmod{6}
\]  
Since \( -2 \equiv 4 \pmod{6} \), we need:  
\[
m \equiv 4 \pmod{6}
\]  
Thus, \( m = 6k + 4 \), where \( k \geq 0 \) (to ensure \( m \geq 1 \)). Substitute into the equation:  
\[
n = \frac{7(6k + 4) + 2}{6} = \frac{42k + 28 + 2}{6} = \frac{42k + 30}{6} = 7k + 5
\]  
So, the solutions are:  
- \( m = 6k + 4 \)  
- \( n = 7k + 5 \)  
where \( k \geq 0 \). The common terms are:  
\[
6n - 5 = 6(7k + 5) - 5 = 42k + 30 - 5 = 42k + 25
\]  
or equivalently:  
\[
7m - 3 = 7(6k + 4) - 3 = 42k + 28 - 3 = 42k + 25
\]  
Thus, the common terms are:  
\[
42k + 25, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine which common terms are within the range of 1 to 100.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute the common terms \( 42k + 25 \) for integer \( k \geq 0 \) and check which values satisfy \( 1 \leq 42k + 25 \leq 100 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The common terms are:  
\[
42k + 25
\]  
We need:  
\[
1 \leq 42k + 25 \leq 100
\]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[
42k + 25 \leq 100 \implies 42k \leq 75 \implies k \leq \frac{75}{42} \approx 1.7857
\]  
Since \( k \) is an integer, try \( k = 0, 1 \):  
- For \( k = 0 \): \( 42 \cdot 0 + 25 = 25 \)  
- For \( k = 1 \): \( 42 \cdot 1 + 25 = 67 \)  
- For \( k = 2 \): \( 42 \cdot 2 + 25 = 109 > 100 \) (outside the range)  

Thus, the common terms within 1 to 100 are 25 and 67.

### Step 5: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find the largest common term within the range of 1 to 100.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the common terms identified (25 and 67) and select the largest one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The common terms within 1 to 100 are 25 and 67. The largest is:  
\[
67
\]  
[/IMP]  

---

### Step 6: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that 67 is a term in both sequences and that no larger common term exists within 1 to 100.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check if 67 satisfies the formulas for both sequences and confirm no other terms \( 42k + 25 \leq 100 \) exist for \( k > 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if 67 is in the first sequence (\( 6n - 5 \)):  
\[
6n - 5 = 67 \implies 6n = 72 \implies n = 12
\]  
Since \( n = 12 \) is a positive integer, 67 is the 12th term of the first sequence.  

Check if 67 is in the second sequence (\( 7m - 3 \)):  
\[
7m - 3 = 67 \implies 7m = 70 \implies m = 10
\]  
Since \( m = 10 \) is a positive integer, 67 is the 10th term of the second sequence.  

Confirm no larger terms: From Step 4, the next term (\( k = 2 \)) is \( 42 \cdot 2 + 25 = 109 \), which exceeds 100. Thus, 67 is the largest common term.
