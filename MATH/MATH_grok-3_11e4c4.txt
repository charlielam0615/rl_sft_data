### Problem Statement
We need to find the smallest real number \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x \rfloor^2 = 17\), where \(\lfloor y \rfloor\) denotes the floor function, giving the greatest integer less than or equal to \( y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into manageable subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the equation by expressing \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor\) and \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) in terms of \( x \).  
- Subgoal 2: Set up the equation using the definition of the floor function.  
- Subgoal 3: Identify possible values for \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) and solve for \( x \).  
- Subgoal 4: Find all solutions and determine the smallest one.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the equation using the floor function definitions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), where \( n \) is an integer. Then, express \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor\) in terms of \( x \), and rewrite the given equation to form a condition that can be solved.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), where \( n \) is an integer. This means \( n \leq x < n + 1 \). Squaring the inequality, we get:
\[ n^2 \leq x^2 < (n + 1)^2. \]
Thus, \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x^2 \), and we need:
\[ \lfloor x^2 \rfloor - n^2 = 17 \implies \lfloor x^2 \rfloor = n^2 + 17. \]
Since \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor\) is the floor of \( x^2 \), we have:
\[ n^2 + 17 \leq x^2 < n^2 + 18. \]
Taking the square root:
\[ \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq |x| < \sqrt{n^2 + 18}. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we consider both positive and negative \( x \):
- If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( x \geq \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \), and since \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), we need \( n \leq x < n + 1 \).
- If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so \(-x \geq \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \implies x \leq -\sqrt{n^2 + 17}\), and \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n \implies n \leq x < n + 1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve for \( x \) by testing possible integer values of \( n \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Test integer values of \( n \) (positive and negative) to find \( x \) that satisfies both \( n \leq x < n + 1 \) and \( \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq |x| < \sqrt{n^2 + 18} \), then verify solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We need \( x \) to satisfy:
1. \( n \leq x < n + 1 \),
2. \( \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq |x| < \sqrt{n^2 + 18} \).

**Case 1: \( x \geq 0 \)**  
Then \( |x| = x \), so:
\[ \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq x < \sqrt{n^2 + 18}, \]
and:
\[ n \leq x < n + 1. \]
The solution exists if the intervals overlap, i.e., \([n, n+1) \cap [\sqrt{n^2 + 17}, \sqrt{n^2 + 18})\) is non-empty. Thus:
\[ \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq x < \min(n + 1, \sqrt{n^2 + 18}). \]
We need \(\sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq n + 1\). Squaring both sides:
\[ n^2 + 17 \leq (n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 \implies 17 \leq 2n + 1 \implies 16 \leq 2n \implies n \geq 8. \]

**Case 2: \( x < 0 \)**  
Then \( |x| = -x \), so:
\[ \sqrt{n^2 + 17} \leq -x < \sqrt{n^2 + 18} \implies -\sqrt{n^2 + 18} < x \leq -\sqrt{n^2 + 17}, \]
and:
\[ n \leq x < n + 1. \]
We need \([n, n+1) \cap (-\sqrt{n^2 + 18}, -\sqrt{n^2 + 17}]\) to be non-empty. Thus:
\[ n \leq x \leq -\sqrt{n^2 + 17}. \]
This requires \( n \leq -\sqrt{n^2 + 17} \). Since \(-\sqrt{n^2 + 17} < 0\), we need \( n < 0 \) and:
\[ n \leq -\sqrt{n^2 + 17}. \]
Squaring (noting both sides are negative):
\[ n^2 \geq n^2 + 17 \implies 0 \geq 17, \]
which is impossible. Thus, no solutions exist for \( x < 0 \).

**Testing Positive \( n \)** (since \( n \geq 8 \)):
- For \( n = 8 \):
  \[ \sqrt{8^2 + 17} = \sqrt{64 + 17} = \sqrt{81} = 9, \quad \sqrt{8^2 + 18} = \sqrt{82} \approx 9.055. \]
  Interval: \([9, \sqrt{82})\). But \( x \in [8, 9)\), so no overlap (\( 9 \geq 9 \)).
- For \( n = 9 \):
  \[ \sqrt{9^2 + 17} = \sqrt{81 + 17} = \sqrt{98} \approx 9.899, \quad \sqrt{9^2 + 18} = \sqrt{99} \approx 9.950. \]
  Interval: \([\sqrt{98}, \sqrt{99})\). Also, \( x \in [9, 10)\). Overlap: \([\sqrt{98}, 10)\).
  Check: If \( x \in [\sqrt{98}, 10) \), then \(\lfloor x \rfloor = 9\), and:
  \[ x^2 \in [98, 100) \implies \lfloor x^2 \rfloor = 98. \]
  Then: \( 98 - 9^2 = 98 - 81 = 17 \), which satisfies the equation.
- For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ \sqrt{100 + 17} = \sqrt{117} \approx 10.816, \quad \sqrt{118} \approx 10.863. \]
  Interval: \([\sqrt{117}, \sqrt{118})\). But \( x \in [10, 11) \), so no overlap (\(\sqrt{117} > 10\)).
- Higher \( n \): Since \(\sqrt{n^2 + 17} \approx n + \frac{17}{2n}\), for \( n > 9 \), \(\sqrt{n^2 + 17} > n + 1\), so no solutions.

Thus, solutions are \( x \in [\sqrt{98}, 10) \approx [9.899, 10) \).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest solution to \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x \rfloor^2 = 17\).
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the equation by expressing \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor\) and \(\lfloor x \rfloor\). (Completed)

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the smallest solution from \( x \in [\sqrt{98}, 10) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since the solution is an interval, the smallest \( x \) is the lower bound, \(\sqrt{98}\). Verify this value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solution interval is \( x \in [\sqrt{98}, 10) \), where \(\sqrt{98} \approx 9.899\). The smallest \( x \) is \( x = \sqrt{98} \). Verify:
- If \( x = \sqrt{98} \):
  - \(\lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor \sqrt{98} \rfloor = 9\) (since \( 9 \leq \sqrt{98} < 10 \)).
  - \( x^2 = 98 \), so \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor = \lfloor 98 \rfloor = 98\).
  - Check: \( 98 - 9^2 = 98 - 81 = 17 \), which satisfies the equation.

Thus, \( x = \sqrt{98} \) is a solution. Since it’s the lower bound of the interval, it’s the smallest possible \( x \).

### Final Answer
The smallest solution to the equation \(\lfloor x^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x \rfloor^2 = 17\) is \( x = \sqrt{98} \).

\[ \boxed{\sqrt{98}} \]
