### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the mean of the numbers 6, 9, and 18.  
2. Set up an equation where the mean of 12 and \( y \) equals the mean from step 1.  
3. Solve the equation to find the value of \( y \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the mean of the numbers 6, 9, and 18.  
- **How to Achieve:** Sum the numbers 6, 9, and 18, then divide by the number of terms (3).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the mean of 6, 9, and 18:  
- Sum: \( 6 + 9 + 18 = 33 \).  
- Number of terms: 3.  
- Mean: \( \frac{33}{3} = 11 \).  
The mean of 6, 9, and 18 is 11.

### Step 3: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Set up an equation where the mean of 12 and \( y \) equals the mean from step 2 (11).  
- **How to Achieve:** Write the mean of 12 and \( y \) as \( \frac{12 + y}{2} \), set it equal to 11, and solve for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The mean of 12 and \( y \) is \( \frac{12 + y}{2} \).  
Given that this equals the mean from step 2 (11), set up the equation:  
\[ \frac{12 + y}{2} = 11 \]  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
\[ 12 + y = 22 \]  
Subtract 12 from both sides:  
\[ y = 22 - 12 = 10 \]  
So, \( y = 10 \).

### Step 4: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the mean of 12 and \( y = 10 \) equals the mean of 6, 9, and 18 (11).  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute the mean of 12 and 10, and check if it equals 11.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the mean of 12 and 10:  
- Sum: \( 12 + 10 = 22 \).  
- Number of terms: 2.  
- Mean: \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).  
This matches the mean of 6, 9, and 18 (11), confirming the solution is correct.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( y \) such that the mean of 6, 9, and 18 equals the mean of 12 and \( y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the mean of 6, 9, and 18 (completed: mean = 11).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve an equation for the mean of 12 and \( y \) (completed: \( y = 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: mean of 12 and 10 = 11).  

**Current Goal:** The main goal is complete, as \( y = 10 \) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
The value of \( y \) is 10.
