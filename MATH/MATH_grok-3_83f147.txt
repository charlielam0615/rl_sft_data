**Problem Statement:** Determine the number of diagonals that can be drawn in a hexagon.

A hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides (and thus 6 vertices). A diagonal is a line segment connecting any two non-adjacent vertices of the polygon. To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of diagonals possible in a hexagon.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the number of diagonals in a hexagon into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the definition of a diagonal in a polygon.  
2. Identify the formula or method to calculate the number of diagonals for a polygon with n sides.  
3. Apply the method to a hexagon (n = 6).  
4. Verify the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides. This will be achieved by recalling the standard formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon and understanding its derivation.

A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices in a polygon. For a polygon with n vertices, the total number of line segments (including sides and diagonals) is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices, given by the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). However, this includes the n sides of the polygon. To find only the diagonals, subtract the number of sides (n) and divide by 2 to avoid double-counting (since each diagonal is counted twice in the combinations). Thus, the formula for the number of diagonals is:  
\[ \text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n \div 2 = \frac{n(n-1) - 2n}{2} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \]  
Alternatively, the standard formula for the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is:  
\[ \text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \]  
This formula will be used in the next step to compute the number of diagonals for a hexagon.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the formula for the number of diagonals to a hexagon (n = 6). This will be achieved by substituting n = 6 into the formula \(\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\) and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a hexagon, \( n = 6 \). Using the formula for the number of diagonals:  
\[ \text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = \frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 3}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]  
Therefore, a hexagon has 9 diagonals.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculation that a hexagon has 9 diagonals. This will be achieved by considering an alternative method, such as manually counting the diagonals from each vertex, and checking consistency with the formula’s result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, consider a hexagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. Each vertex can form diagonals to non-adjacent vertices:  
- From A: Diagonals to C, D, E (3 diagonals).  
- From B: Diagonals to D, E, F (3 diagonals).  
- From C: Diagonals to E, F, A (3 diagonals).  
- From D: Diagonals to F, A, B (3 diagonals).  
- From E: Diagonals to A, B, C (3 diagonals).  
- From F: Diagonals to B, C, D (3 diagonals).  
Since diagonals are undirected (e.g., A-C is the same as C-A), we’ve double-counted each diagonal. Total diagonals counted: \( 3 \cdot 6 = 18 \). Dividing by 2: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \).  
This matches the formula’s result of 9 diagonals, confirming the calculation.
