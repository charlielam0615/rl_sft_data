### Problem Statement
Simplify the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}}\).

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of simplifying \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression inside the numerator's square root (\(40 \cdot 9\)).  
2. Apply properties of square roots to the fraction.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to its simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression inside the numerator's square root (\(40 \cdot 9\)). This will be achieved by calculating \(40 \cdot 9\) and factoring the result to identify perfect squares.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \(40 \cdot 9\):  
\(40 \cdot 9 = 360\).  
Thus, the numerator becomes \(\sqrt{360}\).  
Factorize 360 to identify perfect squares:  
\(360 = 36 \cdot 10 = 6^2 \cdot 10\).  
So, \(\sqrt{360} = \sqrt{6^2 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{6^2} \cdot \sqrt{10} = 6\sqrt{10}\).  
The denominator is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\).  
The expression is now \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply properties of square roots to simplify the fraction \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}}\). Use the property \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}\) (for \(b \neq 0\)) to combine the square roots, and verify if further simplification is possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the property of square roots:  
\(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{\sqrt{360}}{\sqrt{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{360}{49}}\).  
Calculate \(\frac{360}{49}\):  
\(360 \div 49 \approx 7.346\), not a perfect square, so simplify directly:  
From Step 2, we have \(\sqrt{360} = 6\sqrt{10}\), so:  
\(\frac{\sqrt{360}}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  
Alternatively, compute \(\sqrt{\frac{360}{49}}\):  
\(\frac{360}{49} = \frac{360 \div 7}{49 \div 7} = \frac{360 \div 7}{7}\).  
Since \(360 \div 7 \approx 51.4286\), this confirms \(\sqrt{\frac{360}{49}}\) may not simplify easily, so we stick with \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  
Check if \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\) can be simplified further:  
- The numerator \(6\sqrt{10}\) has no common factors with the denominator 7 (since 6 and 7 are coprime, and \(\sqrt{10}\) is irrational).  
- The expression is in its simplest form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the simplification \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\). This will be achieved by checking the numerical value of the original and simplified expressions to ensure equivalence and confirming no further simplification is possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify numerically:  
Original: \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{\sqrt{360}}{7}\).  
\(\sqrt{360} \approx 18.9737\), so \(\frac{18.9737}{7} \approx 2.7105\).  
Simplified: \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  
\(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623\), so \(6 \cdot 3.1623 = 18.9738\), and \(\frac{18.9738}{7} \approx 2.7105\).  
The values match closely (minor differences due to rounding).  
Check for further simplification:  
- Numerator: \(6\sqrt{10}\), denominator: 7.  
- No common factors exist (6 = 2 \cdot 3, 7 is prime, \(\sqrt{10} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 5}\)).  
The expression \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\) is fully simplified.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the numerator’s square root (\(40 \cdot 9 = 360\)) → Completed (Result: \(\sqrt{360} = 6\sqrt{10}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply square root properties to the fraction → Completed (Result: \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the simplified expression → Completed (Numerical check and simplification confirmed).  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the solution is complete and correct (achieved).  
The simplified expression is \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The simplified form of \(\frac{\sqrt{40 \cdot 9}}{\sqrt{49}}\) is \(\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\).  

This expression is in its simplest form, as verified through numerical comparison and checking for common factors.
