### Problem Restatement
We need to find all positive integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) is an integer, and then compute the sum of those \( n \). For \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) to be an integer, the denominator \( n \) must divide the numerator \( n+6 \) evenly, meaning \( n+6 \) must be a multiple of \( n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the positive integers \( n \) that make \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) an integer and sum them. Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) to understand the condition for it to be an integer.  
2. Solve for \( n \) by setting up an equation based on the integer condition.  
3. Identify all positive integer solutions for \( n \).  
4. Sum the valid \( n \) values.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) and determine the condition for it to be an integer. Achieve this by rewriting the expression and analyzing when the result is an integer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( \frac{n+6}{n} \):  
\[ \frac{n+6}{n} = \frac{n}{n} + \frac{6}{n} = 1 + \frac{6}{n} \]  
For \( 1 + \frac{6}{n} \) to be an integer, \( \frac{6}{n} \) must be an integer, say \( k \). Thus, we need:  
\[ \frac{6}{n} = k \]  
where \( k \) is an integer. This implies:  
\[ n = \frac{6}{k} \]  
Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, \( k \) must be a positive integer that divides 6 evenly.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find all positive integer values of \( n \) such that \( \frac{6}{n} \) is an integer. Achieve this by finding all positive divisors of 6.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( n = \frac{6}{k} \), where \( k \) is a positive integer and \( n \) must be a positive integer, we find the positive divisors of 6:  
The divisors of 6 are \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \).  
Thus, possible values of \( n \) are:  
\[ n = \frac{6}{1} = 6, \quad n = \frac{6}{2} = 3, \quad n = \frac{6}{3} = 2, \quad n = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \]  
So, the positive integer values of \( n \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the values \( n = 1, 2, 3, 6 \) make \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) an integer. Achieve this by substituting each \( n \) into the expression and checking the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each value:  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( \frac{1+6}{1} = \frac{7}{1} = 7 \), an integer.  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( \frac{2+6}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \), an integer.  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( \frac{3+6}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \), an integer.  
- For \( n = 6 \): \( \frac{6+6}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \), an integer.  
All values satisfy the condition.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all positive integers \( n \) for which \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) is an integer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( n \) where \( \frac{6}{n} \) is an integer (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solutions (completed in Step 4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the valid \( n \) values (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the valid \( n \) values: \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the valid \( n \) values: \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \). Achieve this by adding these numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the values:  
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the sum is correct. Achieve this by rechecking the addition and ensuring all valid \( n \) were included.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \), \( 3 + 3 = 6 \), \( 6 + 6 = 12 \). The sum is 12.  
Confirm all \( n \): The divisors of 6 are \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \), and no other positive integers satisfy \( \frac{6}{n} \) being an integer (e.g., \( n = 4 \): \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \), not an integer). All valid \( n \) are included.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The sum of all positive integer values of \( n \) for which \( \frac{n+6}{n} \) is an integer is \( 12 \).
