### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many integers \( n \) from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) result in a terminating decimal when computing \( \frac{n}{1400} \). A decimal representation of a fraction terminates if, after simplification, the denominator (in lowest terms) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Understand the condition for a fraction \( \frac{n}{1400} \) to have a terminating decimal.
2. Express 1400 in terms of its prime factors to analyze the denominator.
3. Determine the condition on \( n \) such that \( \frac{n}{1400} \) in lowest terms has a denominator with only prime factors 2 and 5.
4. Count the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 1000 that satisfy this condition.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Understand the condition for a fraction to have a terminating decimal.

**How to Achieve**: A fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \) (in lowest terms) has a terminating decimal if the denominator \( b \) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. For \( \frac{n}{1400} \), after simplifying by the greatest common divisor \( \gcd(n, 1400) \), the denominator must be a power of 2 times a power of 5 (i.e., of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The decimal representation of \( \frac{n}{1400} \) terminates if, after simplification, the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5. This means that after dividing numerator and denominator by \( \gcd(n, 1400) \), the resulting denominator must divide \( 1400 \) and have only prime factors 2 and 5.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Factorize 1400 to understand its prime composition.

**How to Achieve**: Compute the prime factorization of 1400 to identify its prime factors and their powers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factorize 1400:
- \( 1400 \div 2 = 700 \)
- \( 700 \div 2 = 350 \)
- \( 350 \div 2 = 175 \)
- \( 175 \div 5 = 35 \)
- \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)
- \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)

Thus, \( 1400 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the condition on \( n \) for \( \frac{n}{1400} \) to have a terminating decimal.

**How to Achieve**: For \( \frac{n}{1400} \) to terminate, after simplification by \( \gcd(n, 1400) \), the denominator must be of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \). Since the original denominator is \( 1400 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1 \), the simplified denominator must not include the prime factor 7, meaning \( \gcd(n, 1400) \) must include the factor \( 7^1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( d = \gcd(n, 1400) \). The fraction becomes \( \frac{n/d}{1400/d} \). The denominator is:
\[ \frac{1400}{d} = \frac{2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1}{d}. \]
For the fraction to terminate, \( \frac{1400}{d} \) must be of the form \( 2^a \cdot 5^b \), so \( d \) must include \( 7^1 \). Write:
\[ n = 2^{e_2} \cdot 5^{e_5} \cdot 7^{e_7} \cdot k, \]
where \( k \) is coprime to 1400. Then:
\[ d = \gcd(n, 1400) = 2^{\min(e_2, 3)} \cdot 5^{\min(e_5, 2)} \cdot 7^{\min(e_7, 1)}. \]
The denominator after simplification is:
\[ \frac{1400}{d} = 2^{3 - \min(e_2, 3)} \cdot 5^{2 - \min(e_5, 2)} \cdot 7^{1 - \min(e_7, 1)}. \]
For no 7 in the denominator, \( \min(e_7, 1) = 1 \), so \( e_7 \geq 1 \). Thus, \( n \) must be divisible by 7.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the condition that \( n \) must be divisible by 7.

**How to Achieve**: Check if the condition \( e_7 \geq 1 \) ensures a terminating decimal and confirm no other constraints are needed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \( e_7 \geq 1 \), then \( \min(e_7, 1) = 1 \), so the denominator becomes:
\[ 2^{3 - \min(e_2, 3)} \cdot 5^{2 - \min(e_5, 2)} \cdot 7^{1 - 1} = 2^{3 - \min(e_2, 3)} \cdot 5^{2 - \min(e_5, 2)}, \]
which has only prime factors 2 and 5, ensuring a terminating decimal. If \( e_7 = 0 \), the denominator includes \( 7^{1 - 0} = 7 \), and the decimal does not terminate. Thus, \( n \) must be divisible by 7, and no additional constraints on powers of 2 or 5 are necessary, as any \( e_2, e_5 \geq 0 \) work.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Count integers \( n \) from 1 to 1000 divisible by 7.

**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for counting multiples of a number in a range: the number of integers from 1 to \( m \) divisible by \( k \) is \( \lfloor m/k \rfloor \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Count multiples of 7 from 1 to 1000:
\[ \lfloor 1000 / 7 \rfloor = \lfloor 142.857 \rfloor = 142. \]
Thus, there are 142 integers divisible by 7.

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Count integers \( n \) from 1 to 1000 such that \( \frac{n}{1400} \) has a terminating decimal.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand terminating decimal condition (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Factorize 1400 (completed: \( 1400 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Determine condition on \( n \) (completed: \( n \) must be divisible by 7).
  - Subgoal 4: Count valid \( n \) (completed: 142 integers).

**Current Goal**: Verify the final answer and ensure all steps align.

The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the steps and final count.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Validate the final count of 142.

**How to Achieve**: Recheck the divisibility condition and count, and consider edge cases (e.g., \( n = 7, 14, \ldots, 994 \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recompute: Multiples of 7 up to 1000 are \( 7, 14, \ldots, 994 \). Since \( 7 \cdot 142 = 994 \leq 1000 \) and \( 7 \cdot 143 = 1001 > 1000 \), there are 142 multiples.
- Edge case: For \( n = 7 \), \( \frac{7}{1400} = \frac{1}{200} \), denominator \( 200 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \), which terminates. For \( n = 1 \), \( \frac{1}{1400} \), denominator \( 1400 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \), which does not terminate (as expected, since 1 is not divisible by 7).
- The condition \( n \) divisible by 7 is necessary and sufficient, and the count is correct.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 1000 such that \( \frac{n}{1400} \) has a terminating decimal is **142**.
