**Problem Statement**: Given that \(a\) and \(b\) are acute angles with \(\cos a = \frac{3}{5}\) and \(\cos b = \frac{5}{13}\), find \(\cos (a + b)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(\cos (a + b)\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the cosine addition formula: \(\cos (a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b\).  
2. Identify known values: \(\cos a = \frac{3}{5}\), \(\cos b = \frac{5}{13}\).  
3. Find \(\sin a\) and \(\sin b\) using the Pythagorean identity since \(a\) and \(b\) are acute angles.  
4. Compute \(\cos (a + b)\) using the formula and the values obtained.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \(\sin a\) using the Pythagorean identity. Since \(\cos a = \frac{3}{5}\) and \(a\) is acute, use \(\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a = 1\) to compute \(\sin a\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \(\cos a = \frac{3}{5}\), apply the Pythagorean identity:  
\[
\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 a + \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 a + \frac{9}{25} = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 a = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25}
\]
\[
\sin a = \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Since \(a\) is acute, \(\sin a = \frac{4}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \(\sin b\) using the Pythagorean identity. Since \(\cos b = \frac{5}{13}\) and \(b\) is acute, use \(\sin^2 b + \cos^2 b = 1\) to compute \(\sin b\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \(\cos b = \frac{5}{13}\), apply the Pythagorean identity:  
\[
\sin^2 b + \cos^2 b = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 b + \left(\frac{5}{13}\right)^2 = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 b + \frac{25}{169} = 1
\]
\[
\sin^2 b = 1 - \frac{25}{169} = \frac{144}{169}
\]
\[
\sin b = \sqrt{\frac{144}{169}} = \frac{12}{13}
\]
Since \(b\) is acute, \(\sin b = \frac{12}{13}\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(\cos (a + b)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the cosine addition formula (ongoing).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find \(\sin a\) (completed: \(\sin a = \frac{4}{5}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find \(\sin b\) (completed: \(\sin b = \frac{12}{13}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(\cos (a + b)\) using known values (next step).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(\cos (a + b)\) using the cosine addition formula.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\cos (a + b)\) using the formula \(\cos (a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b\) with known values: \(\cos a = \frac{3}{5}\), \(\cos b = \frac{5}{13}\), \(\sin a = \frac{4}{5}\), \(\sin b = \frac{12}{13}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply the cosine addition formula:  
\[
\cos (a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \left(\frac{5}{13}\right) - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \left(\frac{12}{13}\right)
\]
\[
= \frac{15}{65} - \frac{48}{65}
\]
\[
= \frac{15 - 48}{65} = \frac{-33}{65}
\]
Thus, \(\cos (a + b) = -\frac{33}{65}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(\cos (a + b) = -\frac{33}{65}\). Verify the calculations and ensure the result is reasonable given that \(a\) and \(b\) are acute angles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute each term:  
- \(\cos a \cos b = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{13} = \frac{15}{65}\).  
- \(\sin a \sin b = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{12}{13} = \frac{48}{65}\).  
- \(\cos (a + b) = \frac{15}{65} - \frac{48}{65} = \frac{-33}{65}\).  
The calculations are consistent. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are acute, \(a + b < 180^\circ\). The negative value of \(\cos (a + b)\) suggests \(a + b > 90^\circ\), which is possible (e.g., if \(a \approx 53.13^\circ\), \(b \approx 67.38^\circ\), then \(a + b \approx 120.51^\circ\)). The result is plausible.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \(\cos (a + b) = -\frac{33}{65}\)
