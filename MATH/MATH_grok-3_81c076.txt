### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of simplifying the expression \((x+1)^2 + 2(x+1)(3-x) + (3-x)^2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Expand each term in the expression: \((x+1)^2\), \(2(x+1)(3-x)\), and \((3-x)^2\).  
2. Combine like terms to simplify the resulting expression.  
3. Verify the simplified expression to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to expand each term in the expression \((x+1)^2 + 2(x+1)(3-x) + (3-x)^2\). This will be achieved by applying algebraic expansion techniques (e.g., binomial theorem for squares and distributive property for the middle term).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand each term:  
1. **First term: \((x+1)^2\)**  
   \((x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\).  

2. **Second term: \(2(x+1)(3-x)\)**  
   First, expand \((x+1)(3-x)\):  
   \((x+1)(3-x) = x \cdot 3 + x \cdot (-x) + 1 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot (-x) = 3x - x^2 + 3 - x = -x^2 + 2x + 3\).  
   Multiply by 2:  
   \(2(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = -2x^2 + 4x + 6\).  

3. **Third term: \((3-x)^2\)**  
   \((3-x)^2 = (3-x)(3-x) = 9 - 6x + x^2\).  

Combine the expanded terms:  
\((x^2 + 2x + 1) + (-2x^2 + 4x + 6) + (x^2 - 6x + 9)\).  

Group like terms:  
- \(x^2\)-terms: \(x^2 - 2x^2 + x^2 = 0x^2\).  
- \(x\)-terms: \(2x + 4x - 6x = 0x\).  
- Constant terms: \(1 + 6 + 9 = 16\).  

Thus, the expression simplifies to \(0x^2 + 0x + 16 = 16\).

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Simplify the expression \((x+1)^2 + 2(x+1)(3-x) + (3-x)^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Expand each term in the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms to simplify the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the simplified expression (pending).  

**Current Goal:** Verify the simplified expression to ensure correctness.

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the simplified expression \(16\). This will be achieved by substituting specific values of \(x\) into both the original and simplified expressions to confirm they match.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the original expression and simplified result with \(x = 0\):  
- Original: \((0+1)^2 + 2(0+1)(3-0) + (3-0)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 6 + 9 = 16\).  
- Simplified: \(16\).  
Matches.  

Test with \(x = 1\):  
- Original: \((1+1)^2 + 2(1+1)(3-1) + (3-1)^2 = 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 + 2^2 = 4 + 8 + 4 = 16\).  
- Simplified: \(16\).  
Matches.  

The simplified expression \(16\) is consistent for different values of \(x\).

### Step 5: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to confirm the correctness of the simplification process by recalling relevant information from previous steps, focusing on the expansion and combination of terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 2: The expression was expanded as:  
  - \((x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\).  
  - \(2(x+1)(3-x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 6\).  
  - \((3-x)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\).  
  - Combining like terms resulted in \(0x^2 + 0x + 16 = 16\).  
- From Step 4: Validation confirmed the result by substituting \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), both yielding \(16\).  
This supports the conclusion that the expression simplifies to a constant \(16\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
The expression \((x+1)^2 + 2(x+1)(3-x) + (3-x)^2\) simplifies to \(16\).
