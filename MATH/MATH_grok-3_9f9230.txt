**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to find the smallest possible value of \(4a_2 + 5a_3\), where \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) are the first three terms of a geometric sequence, and \(a_1 = 1\).

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the terms of the geometric sequence using the given \(a_1 = 1\).  
2. Express \(4a_2 + 5a_3\) in terms of the common ratio.  
3. Minimize the expression \(4a_2 + 5a_3\).  
4. Verify the solution accounts for all possible values, including positive and negative common ratios.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Define the terms of the geometric sequence and express \(4a_2 + 5a_3\).  
**How to Achieve:** Use the definition of a geometric sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio \(r\). Given \(a_1 = 1\), express \(a_2\) and \(a_3\) in terms of \(r\), then formulate the expression \(4a_2 + 5a_3\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In a geometric sequence, \(a_2 = a_1 \cdot r = 1 \cdot r = r\), and \(a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = r \cdot r = r^2\). Thus, the expression to minimize is:  
\[ 4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2. \]  
The goal now is to find the value of \(r\) that minimizes \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Minimize the expression \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\).  
**How to Achieve:** Treat \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\) as a quadratic function in \(r\). Find the critical points by taking the derivative, setting it to zero, and evaluating whether this gives a minimum. Consider the domain of \(r\), including positive and negative values, since the geometric sequence allows any non-zero common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The function to minimize is \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\). This is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient (\(5\)), so it opens upward and has a global minimum at its vertex. Compute the derivative:  
\[ f'(r) = 10r + 4. \]  
Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:  
\[ 10r + 4 = 0 \implies 10r = -4 \implies r = -\frac{4}{10} = -\frac{2}{5}. \]  
To confirm this is a minimum, check the second derivative:  
\[ f''(r) = 10 > 0, \]  
indicating a concave-up function, so \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\) corresponds to a minimum.  
Evaluate \(f(r)\) at \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\):  
\[ f\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) = 5\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + 4\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) = 5 \cdot \frac{4}{25} - \frac{8}{5} = \frac{20}{25} - \frac{8}{5} = \frac{20}{25} - \frac{40}{25} = -\frac{20}{25} = -\frac{4}{5}. \]  
Thus, the value of \(4a_2 + 5a_3\) at \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\) is \(-\frac{4}{5}\).

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\) yields the smallest possible value of \(4a_2 + 5a_3\).  
**How to Achieve:** Check the behavior of \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\) at other points (e.g., positive \(r\), boundaries, or other critical points) and ensure the geometric sequence is valid (i.e., \(r \neq 0\)). Consider whether the function has other minima or if negative values are permissible.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\) is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient, it has a single global minimum at \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\). To validate, evaluate \(f(r)\) at other points:  
- For \(r = 1\): \(f(1) = 5(1)^2 + 4(1) = 5 + 4 = 9\).  
- For \(r = -1\): \(f(-1) = 5(-1)^2 + 4(-1) = 5 - 4 = 1\).  
- For \(r = 0\): \(f(0) = 5(0)^2 + 4(0) = 0\).  
- As \(r \to \pm \infty\), \(f(r) \to +\infty\) due to the \(5r^2\) term.  
The value at \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\) (\(-\frac{4}{5}\)) is less than \(0\), \(1\), and \(9\), suggesting it may be the minimum. Since the geometric sequence allows any non-zero \(r\), and \(r = -\frac{2}{5} \neq 0\), the sequence \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = -\frac{2}{5}\), \(a_3 = \frac{4}{25}\) is valid. To further confirm, note that the parabola’s vertex is the only critical point, and the function increases symmetrically around it.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible value of \(4a_2 + 5a_3\) for a geometric sequence with \(a_1 = 1\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the terms of the geometric sequence (\(a_2 = r\), \(a_3 = r^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(4a_2 + 5a_3 = 5r^2 + 4r\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize \(f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r\).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the minimum by checking other values and ensuring the sequence is valid.  
**Current Goal:** Verify the solution and finalize the answer.  
All subgoals have been addressed. The expression \(5r^2 + 4r\) was minimized at \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\), yielding \(4a_2 + 5a_3 = -\frac{4}{5}\), and validated by comparing with other values and confirming the sequence’s validity.

**Step 6: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Finalize the solution by computing the sequence terms and the expression value at the minimum.  
**How to Achieve:** Use \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\) to compute \(a_2\) and \(a_3\), then calculate \(4a_2 + 5a_3\) explicitly to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \(r = -\frac{2}{5}\):  
- \(a_1 = 1\),  
- \(a_2 = a_1 \cdot r = 1 \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) = -\frac{2}{5}\),  
- \(a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) = \frac{4}{25}\).  
Now compute:  
\[ 4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4 \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) + 5 \cdot \frac{4}{25} = -\frac{8}{5} + \frac{20}{25} = -\frac{8}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{-8 + 4}{5} = -\frac{4}{5}. \]  
This matches the earlier result, confirming the minimum value.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
The smallest possible value of \(4a_2 + 5a_3\) is \(-\frac{4}{5}\).
