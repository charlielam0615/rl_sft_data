Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps. The goal is to find how many \(\frac{1}{4}\) units fit into \(\frac{7}{2}\). A logical approach is to:  
1. Understand the mathematical relationship between \(\frac{7}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).  
2. Set up a division to compute how many \(\frac{1}{4}\) units are in \(\frac{7}{2}\).  
3. Perform the calculation and verify the result.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute how many \(\frac{1}{4}\) units are in \(\frac{7}{2}\).  
To achieve this, we use division: divide \(\frac{7}{2}\) by \(\frac{1}{4}\). Mathematically, dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Thus, we calculate \(\frac{7}{2} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{2} \times \frac{4}{1}\).

[IMP]  
Perform the calculation:  
\(\frac{7}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{7 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = \frac{28}{2} = 14\)  
Thus, there are 14 one-fourths in \(\frac{7}{2}\).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation that there are 14 one-fourths in \(\frac{7}{2}\).  
To validate, we check if 14 \(\times\) \(\frac{1}{4}\) equals \(\frac{7}{2}\). We will compute this product and compare it to the original value.

[IMP]  
Compute: \(14 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = \frac{7}{2}\).  
The result matches \(\frac{7}{2}\), confirming our calculation is correct.
