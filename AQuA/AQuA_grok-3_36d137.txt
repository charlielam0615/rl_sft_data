### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers equals 55. The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). We need to solve the equation \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55 \) for \( n \).

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Recall the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.
2. Set up the equation based on the given sum (55).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is relevant to setting up the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). This was recalled from standard mathematical knowledge about arithmetic series.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to set up the equation using the recalled formula and the given sum (55). This involves substituting 55 into the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to form the equation \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55
\]
To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
\[
n(n+1) = 110
\]
This gives us a quadratic equation:
\[
n^2 + n - 110 = 0
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + n - 110 = 0 \) to find the value of \( n \). This can be achieved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + n - 110 = 0 \). First, attempt to factorize:
We need two numbers whose product is \( -110 \) and whose sum is \( 1 \). Testing possible pairs:
- \( 11 \times (-10) = -110 \), and \( 11 + (-10) = 1 \).

Thus, the equation factors as:
\[
(n + 11)(n - 10) = 0
\]
The solutions are:
\[
n = -11 \quad \text{or} \quad n = 10
\]
Since \( n \) represents the number of positive integers, discard \( n = -11 \) as it is not physically meaningful. Thus, \( n = 10 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that \( n = 10 \) satisfies the original condition that the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers equals 55. This involves substituting \( n = 10 \) into the formula and checking the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \):
\[
\frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
\]
The sum equals 55, which matches the given condition. Thus, \( n = 10 \) is a valid solution.

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is 55.
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the formula for the sum (completed: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation (completed: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation (completed: \( n = 10 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: sum equals 55 for \( n = 10 \)).

Current goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The value of \( n \) is \( 10 \).
