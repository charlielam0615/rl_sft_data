**Problem Statement:**
The rectangular field has a length that is twice its width. A square pond with a side length of 6 meters is inside the field, and the pond's area is 1/8 of the field's area. We need to find the length of the field.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the length of the rectangular field, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for the field's dimensions based on the given relationship (length is double the width).
2. Calculate the area of the pond using its side length.
3. Set up an equation relating the pond's area to the field's area (pond's area is 1/8 of the field's area).
4. Solve the equation to find the field's dimensions.
5. Determine the length of the field.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables for the field's dimensions and calculate the pond's area.
How to Achieve: Assign variables to the width and length of the field, using the relationship that the length is twice the width. Compute the pond's area using the given side length of 6 meters.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the width of the rectangular field be \( w \) meters. Since the length is double the width, the length is \( 2w \) meters. The area of the field is then \( w \cdot 2w = 2w^2 \) square meters.

The pond is a square with a side length of 6 meters. The area of the pond is:
\[ 6 \cdot 6 = 36 \text{ square meters}. \]
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up an equation relating the pond's area to the field's area.
How to Achieve: Use the fact that the pond's area (36 square meters) is 1/8 of the field's area (\( 2w^2 \)) to form an equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem states that the pond's area is 1/8 of the field's area. Therefore:
\[ 36 = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 2w^2. \]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find the field's width.
How to Achieve: Simplify and solve the equation \( 36 = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 2w^2 \) for \( w \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:
\[ 36 = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 2w^2. \]
Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 36 \cdot 8 = 2w^2. \]
Calculate:
\[ 36 \cdot 8 = 288, \]
so:
\[ 2w^2 = 288. \]
Divide by 2:
\[ w^2 = 144. \]
Take the square root:
\[ w = \sqrt{144} = 12 \text{ meters}. \]
Since \( w \) represents the width, and width is positive, \( w = 12 \).
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the length of the field.
How to Achieve: Use the relationship that the length is twice the width to compute the length.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The length of the field is twice the width:
\[ \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \cdot 12 = 24 \text{ meters}. \]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the pond's area is indeed 1/8 of the field's area.
How to Achieve: Calculate the field's area using the computed dimensions and confirm that 1/8 of it equals the pond's area (36 square meters).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The field's dimensions are width = 12 meters and length = 24 meters. The field's area is:
\[ 12 \cdot 24 = 288 \text{ square meters}. \]
The pond's area is 36 square meters. Check if the pond's area is 1/8 of the field's area:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \cdot 288 = 36. \]
This matches the pond's area, confirming the solution is correct.
