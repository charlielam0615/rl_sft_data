**Problem Statement:**  
We need to determine the number of ways to pick 2 basketball players from 3 teams, each with 3 players, such that the 2 players come from different teams.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of players across all teams.  
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 players from different teams.  
3. Ensure the constraint that no two players are from the same team is satisfied.  
4. Compute the final number of valid combinations.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the total number of players across all teams.  
- **How to Achieve:** Multiply the number of teams by the number of players per team.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
There are 3 teams, each with 3 players.  
Total players = 3 teams Ã— 3 players/team = 9 players.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals for choosing 2 players from different teams:  
1. Select 2 different teams from the 3 teams.  
2. For each pair of teams, choose 1 player from each team.  
3. Multiply the number of team pairs by the number of player choices per pair.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 different teams from the 3 teams.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) to select 2 teams out of 3.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Number of ways to choose 2 teams from 3:  
\( C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2!}{2! \times 1!} = 3 \).  
So, there are 3 possible pairs of teams.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 player from each of the 2 selected teams.  
- **How to Achieve:** For each team, select 1 player from the 3 available players, and multiply the choices for the two teams.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each team has 3 players. For a pair of teams:  
- Choose 1 player from the first team: 3 choices.  
- Choose 1 player from the second team: 3 choices.  
Total choices per team pair = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the total number of valid combinations.  
- **How to Achieve:** Multiply the number of team pairs by the number of player choices per pair.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Number of team pairs = 3 (from Step 4).  
Player choices per pair = 9 (from Step 5).  
Total combinations = \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the calculated combinations satisfy the constraint that no two players are from the same team.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check if the method of selecting players from different teams inherently satisfies the constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The method ensures that we first choose 2 different teams, and then select 1 player from each team. Since each player comes from a distinct team, the constraint that no two players are from the same team is satisfied.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Calculate the number of ways to pick 2 players from 3 teams (3 players each) such that no team is picked twice.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total players (completed: 9 players).  
  - Subgoal 2: Choose 2 different teams (completed: 3 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Choose 1 player from each of the 2 teams (completed: 9 ways per pair).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute total combinations (completed: 27 combinations).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the solution (completed: constraint satisfied).  
**Current Goal:** Finalize the solution as the validation is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Provide the final answer.  
- **How to Achieve:** State the total number of valid combinations based on previous calculations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The number of ways to pick 2 players from 3 teams, each with 3 players, such that no two players are from the same team, is 27.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:** 27
