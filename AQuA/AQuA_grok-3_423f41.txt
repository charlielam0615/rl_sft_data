### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of households in a neighborhood of 90 households that have only a bike. We are given that 11 households have neither a car nor a bike, 14 households have both a car and a bike, and 44 households have a car (which includes those with both a car and a bike). We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of households with only a bike.  
Subgoals:  
1. Define the sets and variables (e.g., households with a car, bike, both, or neither).  
2. Use the total number of households and given data to set up relationships.  
3. Calculate the number of households with only a bike using set theory or equations.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the sets and variables clearly and represent the given information mathematically. This will be achieved by using a Venn diagram approach or set notation to organize the data about households with cars, bikes, both, and neither.

[IMP]
Let:  
- \( C \) = set of households with a car.  
- \( B \) = set of households with a bike.  
- \( |C| \) = total households with a car = 44.  
- \( |C \cap B| \) = households with both a car and a bike = 14.  
- \( |C \cup B| \) = households with at least a car or a bike.  
- Total households = 90.  
- Households with neither a car nor a bike = 11, so \( |C \cup B| = 90 - 11 = 79 \).  
We need to find \( |B \text{ only}| \), the number of households with a bike but not a car, which is \( |B - C| = |B| - |C \cap B| \).  
Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  
\[ |C \cup B| = |C| + |B| - |C \cap B| \]  
\[ 79 = 44 + |B| - 14 \]  
\[ 79 = 30 + |B| \]  
\[ |B| = 79 - 30 = 49 \]  
So, the total number of households with a bike is 49.  
Now, calculate households with only a bike:  
\[ |B \text{ only}| = |B| - |C \cap B| = 49 - 14 = 35 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of households with only a bike by checking if the numbers align with all given data and the total number of households. This will be achieved by verifying the solution using the Venn diagram structure and ensuring all parts sum to 90.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2:  
- Households with only a bike: \( |B \text{ only}| = 35 \).  
- Households with both a car and a bike: \( |C \cap B| = 14 \).  
- Households with only a car: \( |C \text{ only}| = |C| - |C \cap B| = 44 - 14 = 30 \).  
- Households with neither: 11.  
Total households:  
\[ |C \text{ only}| + |B \text{ only}| + |C \cap B| + \text{neither} = 30 + 35 + 14 + 11 = 90 \]  
This matches the total number of households (90), confirming the calculations.  
Additionally, verify the car households:  
- \( |C| = |C \text{ only}| + |C \cap B| = 30 + 14 = 44 \), which matches the given data.  
The solution is consistent.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of households with only a bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define sets and variables (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up relationships and calculate \( |B \text{ only}| \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to ensure all steps are complete and the solution is finalized.  
The main goal has been achieved, as we calculated \( |B \text{ only}| = 35 \) and validated it. No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The number of households that have only a bike is 35.  
\[ \boxed{35} \]
