### Problem Statement
We need to determine the new arithmetic mean of seventy-five numbers when each number is increased by 5, given that the original arithmetic mean of these numbers is 35.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.

- **Subgoal 1**: Understand the arithmetic mean and how it is calculated for the original numbers.
- **Subgoal 2**: Determine the effect of increasing each number by 5 on the sum of the numbers.
- **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the new arithmetic mean using the updated sum.
- **Subgoal 4**: Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the arithmetic mean and how it is calculated for the original numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the definition of the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers, and apply the given values (75 numbers, mean = 35) to find the original sum.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The arithmetic mean of 75 numbers is given as 35. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of numbers}}{\text{Number of numbers}}
\]

Let the sum of the original 75 numbers be \( S \). Then:

\[
35 = \frac{S}{75}
\]

Solving for \( S \):

\[
S = 35 \times 75 = 2625
\]

So, the sum of the original numbers is 2625.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the effect of increasing each number by 5 on the sum of the numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Since each of the 75 numbers is increased by 5, calculate the total increase in the sum and add it to the original sum.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If each of the 75 numbers is increased by 5, the total increase in the sum is:

\[
75 \times 5 = 375
\]

The new sum of the numbers is:

\[
S_{\text{new}} = S + 375 = 2625 + 375 = 3000
\]

So, the sum of the new numbers is 3000.

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the new arithmetic mean using the updated sum.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the arithmetic mean formula again, with the new sum and the same number of numbers (75), to find the new mean.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The new arithmetic mean is calculated as:

\[
\text{New Mean} = \frac{S_{\text{new}}}{\text{Number of numbers}} = \frac{3000}{75}
\]

\[
3000 \div 75 = 40
\]

So, the new mean is 40.

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the calculation by considering the effect of adding a constant to each number on the mean and cross-check the computations.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, note that adding a constant \( c \) (in this case, 5) to each number in a dataset increases the arithmetic mean by the same constant. Since the original mean is 35:

\[
\text{New Mean} = \text{Original Mean} + c = 35 + 5 = 40
\]

This matches the calculated new mean. Additionally, recompute the sum and mean:

- Original sum: \( 35 \times 75 = 2625 \)
- New sum: \( 2625 + (75 \times 5) = 2625 + 375 = 3000 \)
- New mean: \( 3000 \div 75 = 40 \)

The calculations are consistent, confirming the new mean is 40.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the new arithmetic mean when each of 75 numbers is increased by 5, given the original mean is 35.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Understand the arithmetic mean and calculate the original sum (completed).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine the effect of increasing each number by 5 on the sum (completed).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the new arithmetic mean (completed).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Verify the solution (completed).

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as all subgoals have been completed, and the new mean is calculated as 40.

[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The mean of the new numbers, after increasing each of the 75 numbers by 5, is 40.
