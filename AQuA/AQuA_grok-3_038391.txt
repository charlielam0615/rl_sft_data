**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to determine the loss percentage for a radio with a cost price of Rs.1500 that was sold for Rs.1230.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the loss percentage, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the loss amount by subtracting the selling price from the cost price.  
2. Use the loss percentage formula: (Loss / Cost Price) × 100.  
3. Compute the final loss percentage.  
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the loss amount.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the selling price (Rs.1230) from the cost price (Rs.1500) to find the loss.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price  
     = 1500 - 1230  
     = Rs.270  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the loss percentage.  
How to Achieve: Apply the formula for loss percentage: (Loss / Cost Price) × 100, using the loss amount from the previous step and the given cost price.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100  
                = (270 / 1500) × 100  
                = 0.18 × 100  
                = 18%  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the loss percentage for the radio.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the loss amount. (Completed: Loss = Rs.270)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the loss percentage. (Completed: Loss Percentage = 18%)  
Current Goal: Confirm the loss percentage calculation.  
The loss percentage of 18% has been calculated based on the loss of Rs.270 and the cost price of Rs.1500.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:** The loss percentage is 18%.
