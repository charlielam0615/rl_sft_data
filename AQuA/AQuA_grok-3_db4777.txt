### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability \( T \) that the next couple seated at the restaurant will not order dessert, given that:
- 60% of couples order both dessert and coffee.
- 20% of couples who order dessert do not order coffee.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to compute the probability that a couple does not order dessert.

1. Define the events:
   - Let \( D \) be the event that a couple orders dessert.
   - Let \( C \) be the event that a couple orders coffee.
2. Use the given probabilities to find \( P(D) \), the probability that a couple orders dessert.
3. Compute \( T = P(\text{not } D) = 1 - P(D) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate \( P(D) \), the probability that a couple orders dessert, using the given probabilities: 60% of couples order both dessert and coffee (\( P(D \cap C) = 0.6 \)), and 20% of couples who order dessert do not order coffee (\( P(\text{not } C | D) = 0.2 \)). This will be achieved by setting up equations based on probability rules.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given:
- \( P(D \cap C) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(\text{not } C | D) = 0.2 \)

The conditional probability is defined as:
\[ P(\text{not } C | D) = \frac{P(D \cap \text{not } C)}{P(D)} \]

Thus:
\[ 0.2 = \frac{P(D \cap \text{not } C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(D \cap \text{not } C) = 0.2 \cdot P(D) \]

Since a couple who orders dessert either orders coffee or does not:
\[ P(D) = P(D \cap C) + P(D \cap \text{not } C) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.2 \cdot P(D) \]

Solve for \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) - 0.2 \cdot P(D) = 0.6 \]
\[ 0.8 \cdot P(D) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( T \), the probability that a couple does not order dessert, using \( P(D) = 0.75 \). This will be achieved by calculating \( T = 1 - P(D) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the result from Step 2:
\[ P(D) = 0.75 \]
\[ T = P(\text{not } D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of \( T = 0.25 \) by checking the consistency of the probabilities and ensuring the solution aligns with the given data.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the calculations:
- From Step 2, \( P(D) = 0.75 \).
- Then, \( P(D \cap \text{not } C) = 0.2 \cdot P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15 \).
- Total probability for dessert: \( P(D) = P(D \cap C) + P(D \cap \text{not } C) = 0.6 + 0.15 = 0.75 \), which matches.
- The probability of not ordering dessert: \( T = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \).

The calculations are consistent with the given data, and the probability sums align with probability rules (e.g., \( P(D) + P(\text{not } D) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \)).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to summarize the solution process and confirm the current goal has been achieved.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Compute the probability \( T \) that a couple does not order dessert.
  - Subgoal 1: Define events and use given probabilities to find \( P(D) \).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( T = 1 - P(D) \).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations for consistency.

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to validate the solution (\( T = 0.25 \)) in Step 4, which has been achieved.

**Summary**: The solution process involved defining events, calculating \( P(D) = 0.75 \) using the given probabilities, computing \( T = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \), and validating the result. All subgoals have been completed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The probability \( T \) that the next couple will not order dessert is 0.25, or 25%.
