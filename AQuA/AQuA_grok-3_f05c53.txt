**Problem Statement:**
Determine the equivalent single percentage increase that results from increasing the original price of an article by 5% and then increasing the new price by an additional 5%.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the equivalent single percentage increase:
1. Express the original price as a variable.
2. Calculate the price after the first 5% increase.
3. Calculate the price after the second 5% increase.
4. Determine the overall percentage increase from the original price.
5. Find the single percentage increase that yields the same final price.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Express the original price and calculate the price after the first 5% increase.
How to Achieve: Let the original price be a variable (e.g., P). Apply a 5% increase by multiplying P by 1.05 to get the new price.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the original price of the article be \( P \). A 5% increase means multiplying the price by \( 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \). Thus, the price after the first 5% increase is:
\[ P_1 = P \cdot 1.05 \]
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Calculate the price after the second 5% increase.
How to Achieve: Take the price after the first increase (\( P \cdot 1.05 \)) and apply another 5% increase by multiplying by 1.05.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The price after the first increase is \( P \cdot 1.05 \). Apply a second 5% increase:
\[ P_2 = (P \cdot 1.05) \cdot 1.05 = P \cdot (1.05)^2 \]
Calculate \( (1.05)^2 \):
\[ 1.05 \cdot 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
So, the final price is:
\[ P_2 = P \cdot 1.1025 \]
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Determine the overall percentage increase from the original price.
How to Achieve: Compare the final price \( P \cdot 1.1025 \) to the original price \( P \), and express the increase as a percentage.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The final price is \( P \cdot 1.1025 \). The increase over the original price is:
\[ P \cdot 1.1025 - P = P (1.1025 - 1) = P \cdot 0.1025 \]
The percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{P \cdot 0.1025}{P} \right) \cdot 100\% = 0.1025 \cdot 100\% = 10.25\% \]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify that two successive 5% increases are equivalent to a single 10.25% increase.
How to Achieve: Check if applying a single 10.25% increase to the original price yields the same final price as two 5% increases.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A single 10.25% increase means multiplying the original price \( P \) by \( 1 + 0.1025 = 1.1025 \):
\[ P \cdot 1.1025 \]
This matches the final price from two 5% increases: \( P \cdot (1.05)^2 = P \cdot 1.1025 \). The calculation is consistent, confirming the solution.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the equivalent single percentage increase for two successive 5% increases.
  - Subgoal 1: Express the original price as a variable (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the price after the first 5% increase (Completed: \( P \cdot 1.05 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the price after the second 5% increase (Completed: \( P \cdot 1.1025 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the overall percentage increase (Completed: 10.25%).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the equivalence of the single percentage increase (Completed).

Current Goal: None (problem solved).
The goal hierarchy is complete, with all subgoals addressed, leading to the solution of a 10.25% equivalent increase.

**Final Answer:**
Increasing the original price by 5% and then increasing the new price by 5% is equivalent to a single increase of 10.25%.
