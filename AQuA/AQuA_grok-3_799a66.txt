### Problem Statement
We need to find the time taken by a boat to travel 68 km downstream, given that the boat’s speed in still water is 13 km/hr and the stream’s speed is 4 km/hr.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the time taken. Subgoals:  
1. Determine the effective speed of the boat downstream.  
2. Use the effective speed and distance to calculate the time taken.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the effective speed of the boat downstream.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the boat is moving downstream, the stream’s speed adds to the boat’s speed in still water. Add the boat’s speed (13 km/hr) and the stream’s speed (4 km/hr) to find the effective speed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The effective speed of the boat downstream is:  
13 km/hr (boat’s speed) + 4 km/hr (stream’s speed) = 17 km/hr.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time taken to travel 68 km downstream.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. Divide the given distance (68 km) by the effective speed (17 km/hr) to find the time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Time taken = Distance / Speed = 68 km / 17 km/hr = 4 hours.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated time.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the effective speed and time, and check if the results are consistent. Additionally, ensure the units and logic align with the problem’s context.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recalculate effective speed: 13 km/hr + 4 km/hr = 17 km/hr.  
- Recalculate time: 68 km / 17 km/hr = 4 hours.  
- Check units: Distance (km) divided by speed (km/hr) gives time in hours, which is correct.  
- Logic check: Downstream travel means the stream aids the boat, so the speed should be higher than in still water, and 17 km/hr > 13 km/hr, which is consistent.  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the time taken by the boat to travel 68 km downstream.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the effective speed of the boat downstream (completed: 17 km/hr).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time taken using the effective speed and distance (completed: 4 hours).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations verified).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
The solution process is complete, with the time taken being 4 hours.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The time taken by the boat to travel 68 km downstream is 4 hours.
