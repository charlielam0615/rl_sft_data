### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many days it takes for one cow to eat one bag of husk, given that 50 cows eat 50 bags of husk in 50 days.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total amount of husk consumed in "cow-days" (the number of cows multiplied by the number of days).
2. Determine the amount of husk one cow eats in one day.
3. Find the number of days required for one cow to eat one bag of husk.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of cow-days for 50 bags of husk.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of cows (50) by the number of days (50) to get total cow-days, which corresponds to 50 bags of husk.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate total cow-days:  
50 cows × 50 days = 2500 cow-days.  
This means 2500 cow-days are required to consume 50 bags of husk.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the amount of husk one cow eats in one day.
How to Achieve: Divide the total number of bags (50) by the total cow-days (2500) to find the husk consumption rate per cow per day.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Husk consumed per cow per day:  
50 bags ÷ 2500 cow-days = 50 ÷ 2500 = 0.02 bags per cow per day.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the number of days for one cow to eat one bag of husk.
How to Achieve: Divide one bag of husk by the daily consumption rate of one cow (0.02 bags per day) to find the number of days.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Days for one cow to eat one bag:  
1 bag ÷ 0.02 bags per day = 1 ÷ 0.02 = 50 days.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Check if the rate of consumption aligns with the original problem by confirming that 50 cows eating at this rate over 50 days consumes 50 bags.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify: One cow eats 1 bag in 50 days, so 50 cows eat 50 bags in 50 days:  
(50 cows × 1 bag per cow) ÷ 50 days = 50 bags ÷ 50 days = 1 bag per day total, which matches 50 bags in 50 days.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many days one cow takes to eat one bag of husk.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total cow-days (completed: 2500 cow-days).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine husk consumption per cow per day (completed: 0.02 bags per day).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate days for one cow to eat one bag (completed: 50 days).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: calculation confirmed).
Current Goal: None (problem solved).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
One cow will eat one bag of husk in 50 days.
