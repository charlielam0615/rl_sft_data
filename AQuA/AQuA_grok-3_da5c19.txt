**Problem Restatement:**
We need to determine the relationship between A, B, and C given that A is 25% bigger than B, and B is 20% less than C. The goal is to express the relationships (e.g., ratios or relative sizes) between A, B, and C.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the relationship between A, B, and C:  
1. Express A in terms of B using the given condition (A is 25% bigger than B).  
2. Express B in terms of C using the given condition (B is 20% less than C).  
3. Combine these expressions to relate A, B, and C.  
4. Derive the relationships (e.g., ratios or comparisons) between A, B, and C.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Express A in terms of B.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the condition that A is 25% bigger than B, which means A = B + 0.25B = 1.25B.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since A is 25% bigger than B, we interpret this as A being 25% more than B. Mathematically:  
A = B + 0.25B = 1.25B.
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Express B in terms of C.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the condition that B is 20% less than C, which means B = C - 0.20C = 0.80C.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since B is 20% less than C, we interpret this as B being 80% of C. Mathematically:  
B = 0.80C.
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Express A in terms of C using the expressions from previous steps.  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute B = 0.80C into A = 1.25B to find A in terms of C.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, A = 1.25B. From Step 3, B = 0.80C. Substituting:  
A = 1.25 * (0.80C) = 1.25 * 0.80 * C = 1.00C = C.  
Thus, A = C.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the relationship between A, B, and C.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express A in terms of B (completed: A = 1.25B).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express B in terms of C (completed: B = 0.80C).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express A in terms of C (completed: A = C).  
  - Subgoal 4: Derive relationships between A, B, and C (current goal).  
**Current Goal:** Derive the relationships (e.g., ratios or comparisons) between A, B, and C.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Derive the relationships between A, B, and C.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the expressions A = 1.25B, B = 0.80C, and A = C to find ratios A:B, B:C, and A:C.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From previous steps:  
- A = 1.25B.  
- B = 0.80C.  
- A = C.  

**Ratios:**  
1. **A:B**: A = 1.25B, so A/B = 1.25. Thus, A:B = 5:4 (since 1.25 = 5/4).  
2. **B:C**: B = 0.80C, so B/C = 0.80. Thus, B:C = 4:5 (since 0.80 = 4/5).  
3. **A:C**: A = C, so A/C = 1. Thus, A:C = 1:1.  

**Summary of Relationships:**  
- A is 25% larger than B.  
- B is 20% smaller than C.  
- A equals C.

**Step 7: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify the correctness of the derived relationships.  
**How to Achieve:** Check the calculations by working backward and ensuring consistency with the given conditions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verification:**  
- Given: A is 25% bigger than B. From A = 1.25B, A/B = 1.25, which matches (1.25 - 1 = 0.25 = 25% bigger).  
- Given: B is 20% less than C. From B = 0.80C, B/C = 0.80, which matches (1 - 0.80 = 0.20 = 20% less).  
- Check A = C: Substitute B = 0.80C into A = 1.25B: A = 1.25 * 0.80C = 1.00C = C, which is consistent.  
The relationships A:B = 5:4, B:C = 4:5, and A:C = 1:1 are consistent with the given conditions.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**
The relationships between A, B, and C are:  
- A:B = 5:4 (A is 25% bigger than B).  
- B:C = 4:5 (B is 20% less than C).  
- A:C = 1:1 (A equals C).  

Thus, A = C, and A is 25% larger than B, while B is 20% smaller than C.
