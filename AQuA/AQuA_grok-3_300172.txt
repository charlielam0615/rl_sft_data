**Problem Statement**: A rectangular football field has a length that is three times its breadth, and the cost to fence all four sides is $360. The fieldâ€™s dimensions are changed by increasing the breadth by 50% and reducing the length by 25%. We need to determine the cost of fencing the new field, assuming the cost per unit length of fencing remains the same.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the original dimensions of the field and calculate the cost per unit length of fencing.  
2. Determine the new dimensions after adjusting the breadth and length.  
3. Calculate the new perimeter and use the cost per unit length to find the new fencing cost.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the original dimensions and calculate the cost per unit length of fencing. Let the breadth be \( b \). Then, the length is \( 3b \). The perimeter is \( 2(b + 3b) = 8b \). Given the fencing cost is $360, compute the cost per unit length as \( \frac{360}{8b} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the breadth of the original field be \( b \) units. Since the length is three times the breadth, the length is \( 3b \) units. The perimeter of the rectangular field is:  
\[ P = 2(\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2(3b + b) = 2(4b) = 8b \text{ units}. \]  
The cost of fencing the original field is $360. Thus, the cost per unit length of fencing is:  
\[ \text{Cost per unit} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Perimeter}} = \frac{360}{8b} = \frac{45}{b} \text{ dollars per unit}. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the new dimensions of the field. Increase the breadth by 50%, so the new breadth is \( b + 0.5b = 1.5b \). Reduce the length by 25%, so the new length is \( 3b - 0.25 \cdot 3b = 0.75 \cdot 3b = 2.25b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The original breadth is \( b \), so the new breadth is:  
\[ \text{New breadth} = b + 0.5b = 1.5b \text{ units}. \]  
The original length is \( 3b \), so the new length is:  
\[ \text{New length} = 3b - 0.25 \cdot 3b = 3b \cdot (1 - 0.25) = 3b \cdot 0.75 = 2.25b \text{ units}. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the new perimeter and the cost of fencing the new field. The new perimeter is \( 2(\text{new length} + \text{new breadth}) = 2(2.25b + 1.5b) \). Multiply this by the cost per unit length \( \frac{45}{b} \) to find the new fencing cost.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The new perimeter is:  
\[ \text{New perimeter} = 2(\text{new length} + \text{new breadth}) = 2(2.25b + 1.5b) = 2(3.75b) = 7.5b \text{ units}. \]  
The cost per unit length of fencing is \( \frac{45}{b} \) dollars per unit. Thus, the cost of fencing the new field is:  
\[ \text{New cost} = \text{New perimeter} \times \text{Cost per unit} = 7.5b \cdot \frac{45}{b} = 7.5 \cdot 45 = 337.5 \text{ dollars}. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations. Check if the new perimeter and cost calculations are consistent with the original cost and ensure no errors in the dimension adjustments or unit cancellations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the original perimeter: \( 2(3b + b) = 8b \), and cost: \( 8b \cdot \frac{45}{b} = 360 \), which matches the given $360.  
New dimensions: Breadth \( 1.5b = \frac{3}{2}b \), length \( 2.25b = \frac{9}{4}b \). New perimeter:  
\[ 2\left(\frac{9}{4}b + \frac{3}{2}b\right) = 2\left(\frac{9}{4}b + \frac{6}{4}b\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{15}{4}b = \frac{30}{4}b = 7.5b. \]  
New cost: \( 7.5b \cdot \frac{45}{b} = 7.5 \cdot 45 = 337.5 \). The variable \( b \) cancels out, confirming consistency. The calculations are correct.  
[/IMP]
