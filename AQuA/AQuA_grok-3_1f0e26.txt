### Problem Statement
The task is to find the 50th term of the sequence given by the terms 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... 

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the 50th term of the sequence into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the pattern or formula for the sequence.  
2. Derive the general term (nth term) of the sequence.  
3. Calculate the 50th term using the general term.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the pattern or formula for the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... This will be achieved by examining the differences between consecutive terms and determining if the sequence is arithmetic or follows another pattern.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To identify the pattern, calculate the differences between consecutive terms:  
- 3 - 1 = 2  
- 5 - 3 = 2  
- 7 - 5 = 2  
- 9 - 7 = 2  

The sequence has a common difference of 2, indicating it is an arithmetic sequence. For an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by:  
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]  
where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference. Here, \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( d = 2 \).  
Thus, the general term is:  
\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the general term formula \( a_n = 2n - 1 \) by checking if it correctly produces the given terms of the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the formula \( a_n = 2n - 1 \) for the first five terms:  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( a_1 = 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 \) (matches).  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( a_2 = 2 \cdot 2 - 1 = 3 \) (matches).  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( a_3 = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 5 \) (matches).  
- For \( n = 4 \): \( a_4 = 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 7 \) (matches).  
- For \( n = 5 \): \( a_5 = 2 \cdot 5 - 1 = 9 \) (matches).  

The formula correctly generates the given terms, confirming its validity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the 50th term of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the pattern or formula for the sequence (completed: sequence is arithmetic with \( a_n = 2n - 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the general term (completed: \( a_n = 2n - 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the 50th term using the general term (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the 50th term using the general term formula.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the 50th term of the sequence using the general term formula \( a_n = 2n - 1 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( n = 50 \) into the formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the general term \( a_n = 2n - 1 \):  
For \( n = 50 \):  
\[ a_{50} = 2 \cdot 50 - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99 \]  
The 50th term of the sequence is 99.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of the 50th term (\( a_{50} = 99 \)) by checking the formulaâ€™s consistency for terms close to the 50th term and ensuring the arithmetic progression holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, compute a few terms around the 50th term using \( a_n = 2n - 1 \):  
- For \( n = 49 \): \( a_{49} = 2 \cdot 49 - 1 = 98 - 1 = 97 \).  
- For \( n = 50 \): \( a_{50} = 2 \cdot 50 - 1 = 99 \) (as calculated).  
- For \( n = 51 \): \( a_{51} = 2 \cdot 51 - 1 = 102 - 1 = 101 \).  

Check differences:  
- \( a_{50} - a_{49} = 99 - 97 = 2 \).  
- \( a_{51} - a_{50} = 101 - 99 = 2 \).  

The differences are consistent with the common difference of 2, confirming the arithmetic progression and the correctness of \( a_{50} = 99 \).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The 50th term of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... is 99.
