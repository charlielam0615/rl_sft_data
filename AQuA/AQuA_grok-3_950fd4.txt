**Problem Statement**: The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Five years ago, the father’s age was four times the son’s age. We need to find the son’s current age.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Define intermediate subgoals to solve the problem by breaking it down into manageable steps.  
- Subgoal 1: Define variables for the father’s and son’s current ages.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the given information about their current ages and their ages five years ago.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the equations to find the son’s current age.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem’s conditions. This will be achieved by assigning variables to the father’s and son’s current ages and translating the problem’s statements into mathematical equations.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the son’s current age be \( S \) years and the father’s current age be \( F \) years.  
From the problem:  
1. The sum of their current ages is 60:  
   \( F + S = 60 \)  
2. Five years ago, the father’s age was \( F - 5 \) and the son’s age was \( S - 5 \). The father’s age was four times the son’s age at that time:  
   \( F - 5 = 4(S - 5) \)  

These equations represent the relationships given in the problem.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the son’s current age. This will be achieved by substituting one equation into the other and solving for \( S \).  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have the equations:  
1. \( F + S = 60 \)  
2. \( F - 5 = 4(S - 5) \)  

From equation 1, express \( F \) in terms of \( S \):  
\( F = 60 - S \)  

Substitute \( F = 60 - S \) into equation 2:  
\( (60 - S) - 5 = 4(S - 5) \)  
Simplify:  
\( 60 - S - 5 = 4S - 20 \)  
\( 55 - S = 4S - 20 \)  
Add \( S \) to both sides:  
\( 55 = 5S - 20 \)  
Add 20 to both sides:  
\( 75 = 5S \)  
Divide by 5:  
\( S = 15 \)  

The son’s current age is 15 years.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the son’s age of 15 years satisfies both conditions of the problem. This will be achieved by substituting \( S = 15 \) into the equations and checking consistency.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using \( S = 15 \):  
- From equation 1: \( F + S = 60 \), so \( F = 60 - 15 = 45 \). The father’s current age is 45 years.  
- Check the second condition (five years ago):  
  - Son’s age five years ago: \( S - 5 = 15 - 5 = 10 \).  
  - Father’s age five years ago: \( F - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \).  
  - Was the father’s age four times the son’s age? \( 40 = 4 \times 10 \), which is true.  

Both conditions are satisfied:  
- Current ages: \( 15 + 45 = 60 \).  
- Five years ago: \( 40 = 4 \times 10 \).  

The solution is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the son’s current age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for the father’s and son’s current ages (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the given information (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equations to find the son’s current age (completed, son’s age = 15).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal of finding the son’s current age has been achieved.  
The son’s current age is 15 years, and all subgoals have been successfully completed.
