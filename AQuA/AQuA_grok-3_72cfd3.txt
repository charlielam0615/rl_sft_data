### Problem Statement
We need to determine how long it takes for A and B to complete a piece of work together. A can complete the work in 80 days. A works alone for 10 days, and then B finishes the remaining work in 42 days. We need to find the time required for A and B to complete the entire work together.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the final solution:  
1. Calculate A's work rate.  
2. Determine the amount of work A completes in 10 days.  
3. Find the remaining work after A's 10 days.  
4. Calculate B's work rate based on the remaining work completed in 42 days.  
5. Compute the combined work rate of A and B.  
6. Calculate the time for A and B to complete the entire work together.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate A's work rate. This can be achieved by using the given information that A completes the work in 80 days, so the work rate is the fraction of work completed per day.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A completes the work in 80 days. Assuming the total work is 1 unit, A's work rate is:  
\[ \text{A's rate} = \frac{1}{80} \text{ work per day} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the amount of work A completes in 10 days. This can be achieved by multiplying A's work rate by the number of days worked.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A's work rate is \(\frac{1}{80}\) work per day. In 10 days, A completes:  
\[ \text{Work done by A} = 10 \times \frac{1}{80} = \frac{10}{80} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ of the work} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the remaining work after A's 10 days. This can be achieved by subtracting the work done by A from the total work (1 unit).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total work is 1 unit. Work done by A is \(\frac{1}{8}\). Remaining work is:  
\[ \text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \text{ of the work} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate B's work rate. Since B completes the remaining \(\frac{7}{8}\) work in 42 days, B's work rate is the remaining work divided by 42 days.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
B completes \(\frac{7}{8}\) work in 42 days. B's work rate is:  
\[ \text{B's rate} = \frac{\frac{7}{8}}{42} = \frac{7}{8} \times \frac{1}{42} = \frac{7}{336} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ work per day} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Find the time for A and B to complete the work together.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate A's work rate (completed: \(\frac{1}{80}\) work per day).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine work done by A in 10 days (completed: \(\frac{1}{8}\) work).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find remaining work (completed: \(\frac{7}{8}\) work).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate B's work rate (completed: \(\frac{1}{48}\) work per day).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute combined work rate of A and B (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 6: Calculate time for A and B to complete the work together.  
Current goal: Compute the combined work rate of A and B.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to compute the combined work rate. From previous steps:  
- A's work rate is \(\frac{1}{80}\) work per day (Step 2).  
- B's work rate is \(\frac{1}{48}\) work per day (Step 5).  
These rates will be used to find the combined rate in the next step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the combined work rate of A and B. This can be achieved by adding A's and B's individual work rates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A's work rate is \(\frac{1}{80}\) work per day, and B's work rate is \(\frac{1}{48}\) work per day. Combined work rate is:  
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{80} + \frac{1}{48} \]  
Find a common denominator (LCM of 80 and 48 is 240):  
\[ \frac{1}{80} = \frac{3}{240}, \quad \frac{1}{48} = \frac{5}{240} \]  
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \frac{3}{240} + \frac{5}{240} = \frac{8}{240} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ work per day} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time for A and B to complete the entire work together. This can be achieved by dividing the total work (1 unit) by the combined work rate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The combined work rate is \(\frac{1}{30}\) work per day. Time to complete 1 unit of work is:  
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{30}} = 30 \text{ days} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution. This can be achieved by checking if the individual and combined rates align with the given data and recalculating key steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the calculations:  
- A's rate: \(\frac{1}{80}\) work per day. In 10 days, A does \(\frac{10}{80} = \frac{1}{8}\) work.  
- Remaining work: \(1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\).  
- B's rate: \(\frac{\frac{7}{8}}{42} = \frac{7}{8} \times \frac{1}{42} = \frac{1}{48}\) work per day.  
- Combined rate: \(\frac{1}{80} + \frac{1}{48} = \frac{3}{240} + \frac{5}{240} = \frac{8}{240} = \frac{1}{30}\) work per day.  
- Time together: \(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{30}} = 30\) days.  
The calculations are consistent. Additionally, the combined rate \(\frac{1}{30}\) is reasonable since A and B together should work faster than either alone (80 days or 48 days).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
A and B, working together, can finish the work in **30 days**.
