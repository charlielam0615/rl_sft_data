### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the two numbers based on the given ratio 2:3.  
2. Set up equations using the condition that adding 1 to the numerator and subtracting 2 from the denominator results in the ratio 6:2.  
3. Solve the equations to find the numbers.  
4. Identify the largest number.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the two numbers and set up the equation based on the given conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Represent the numbers as proportional to the ratio 2:3, say 2x and 3x. Then, apply the transformations (add 1 to the numerator, subtract 2 from the denominator) and set the new ratio equal to 6:2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the two numbers be \(2x\) and \(3x\), where \(x\) is a positive constant, since the ratio is 2:3.  
The problem states that when 1 is added to the numerator (first number) and 2 is subtracted from the denominator (second number), the ratio becomes 6:2. Thus:  
\[
\frac{2x + 1}{3x - 2} = \frac{6}{2}
\]
Since \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\), the equation is:  
\[
\frac{2x + 1}{3x - 2} = 3
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation to find the value of \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the equation \(\frac{2x + 1}{3x - 2} = 3\) by cross-multiplying and simplifying to find \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with:  
\[
\frac{2x + 1}{3x - 2} = 3
\]
Cross-multiply:  
\[
2x + 1 = 3(3x - 2)
\]
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
2x + 1 = 9x - 6
\]
Rearrange all terms:  
\[
1 + 6 = 9x - 2x
\]
\[
7 = 7x
\]
Solve for \(x\):  
\[
x = 1
\]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by substituting \(x = 1\) into the original numbers and checking if the conditions hold.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the numbers using \(x = 1\), apply the transformations, and confirm the resulting ratio is 6:2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With \(x = 1\), the numbers are:  
- First number: \(2x = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\)  
- Second number: \(3x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\)  

Apply the transformations:  
- Numerator: \(2 + 1 = 3\)  
- Denominator: \(3 - 2 = 1\)  

New ratio:  
\[
\frac{3}{1} = 3
\]
Since \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\), the ratio \(3:1\) is equivalent to \(6:2\), confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest number.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the two numbers calculated from \(x = 1\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The numbers are 2 and 3. Comparing them:  
\[
3 > 2
\]
Thus, the largest number is 3.
