**Problem Statement:**
Farm A produces an average of 300 kg of rice per acre, and Farm B produces an average of 350 kg of rice per acre. Farm B’s area is 15 acres less than Farm A’s area. Farm B harvested 3000 kg more rice than Farm A. We need to determine the area of Farm A.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for Farm A’s area.  
1. Define variables for the areas of Farm A and Farm B.  
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships (area difference and total harvest difference).  
3. Solve the equations to find Farm A’s area.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to define variables and set up equations to represent the relationships between the farms’ areas and rice outputs. This will be achieved by assigning variables for the areas, using the given production rates and the relationships provided (Farm B’s area is 15 acres less than Farm A’s, and Farm B’s total harvest is 3000 kg more than Farm A’s).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the area of Farm A be \( x \) acres. Since Farm B’s area is 15 acres less than Farm A’s, Farm B’s area is \( x - 15 \) acres.  
Farm A’s total rice output is \( 300x \) kg (300 kg/acre × \( x \) acres).  
Farm B’s total rice output is \( 350(x - 15) \) kg (350 kg/acre × \( (x - 15) \) acres).  
It is given that Farm B harvested 3000 kg more rice than Farm A, so we can set up the equation:  
\[ 350(x - 15) = 300x + 3000 \]  
This equation represents the relationship between the total harvests of the two farms.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to solve the equation \( 350(x - 15) = 300x + 3000 \) to find the value of \( x \), which represents Farm A’s area. This will be achieved by simplifying and solving the linear equation step-by-step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:  
\[ 350(x - 15) = 300x + 3000 \]  
Distribute the 350 on the left side:  
\[ 350x - 5250 = 300x + 3000 \]  
Subtract \( 300x \) from both sides:  
\[ 350x - 300x - 5250 = 3000 \]  
\[ 50x - 5250 = 3000 \]  
Add 5250 to both sides:  
\[ 50x = 8250 \]  
Divide both sides by 50:  
\[ x = \frac{8250}{50} = 165 \]  
Thus, Farm A’s area is 165 acres.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the solution (\( x = 165 \) acres) by checking if it satisfies all given conditions (area difference and harvest difference). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 165 \) into the expressions for the areas and rice outputs of both farms and verifying the relationships.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the solution:  
- Farm A’s area: \( x = 165 \) acres.  
- Farm B’s area: \( x - 15 = 165 - 15 = 150 \) acres.  
- Farm A’s total output: \( 300 \times 165 = 49,500 \) kg.  
- Farm B’s total output: \( 350 \times 150 = 52,500 \) kg.  
- Check the harvest difference: \( 52,500 - 49,500 = 3,000 \) kg, which matches the given condition that Farm B harvested 3000 kg more than Farm A.  
- Check the area difference: \( 165 - 150 = 15 \) acres, which matches the given condition that Farm B’s area is 15 acres less than Farm A’s.  
The solution satisfies both conditions, confirming that Farm A’s area is 165 acres.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the area of Farm A.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations based on the given relationships.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation to find Farm A’s area.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking all conditions.  
**Current Goal:** The current goal is to confirm that all subgoals have been addressed and the main goal is achieved. The solution (Farm A’s area = 165 acres) has been validated, completing the goal hierarchy.  
**Final Answer:** The area of Farm A is 165 acres.
