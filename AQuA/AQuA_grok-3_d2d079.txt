**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to understand the condition \( \frac{3w}{y} \) being a prime integer greater than 2 and evaluate each option (I, II, III). Subgoals:
1. Express the condition mathematically and identify constraints.
2. Analyze each option to determine if it must hold given the constraints.
3. Synthesize findings to select the correct option(s).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Express the condition \( \frac{3w}{y} \) is a prime integer greater than 2 and derive constraints.  
**How to Achieve:** Set up the equation \( \frac{3w}{y} = p \), where \( p \) is a prime integer greater than 2 (e.g., 3, 5, 7, ...). Since \( p \) is an integer, \( \frac{3w}{y} \) must be an integer, implying \( y \) divides \( 3w \). Solve for \( w \) and consider the constraint \( y \neq 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( \frac{3w}{y} = p \), where \( p \) is a prime integer greater than 2. This gives:
\[ 3w = py \]
\[ w = \frac{py}{3} \]
For \( w \) to be an integer, \( py \) must be divisible by 3. Since \( p \) is a prime greater than 2 (e.g., 5, 7, 11, ...), \( p \neq 3 \), so \( p \) is not divisible by 3 (as \( p \) is prime and not 3). Thus, for \( \frac{py}{3} \) to be an integer, \( y \) must be divisible by 3. However, since \( y \neq 3 \), \( y \) could be a multiple of 3 such as \( \pm 6, \pm 9, \pm 12, \ldots \), or other values if \( p \) and \( y \) share factors with 3, but we focus on \( y \) dividing \( 3w \).

**Step 3: Track Goals**

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Determine which of I, II, III must be true given \( \frac{3w}{y} \) is a prime integer \( p > 2 \) and \( y \neq 3 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Express the condition mathematically (completed: \( \frac{3w}{y} = p \), \( w = \frac{py}{3} \), \( y \) must divide \( 3w \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Analyze options I, II, III.
  - Subgoal 3: Synthesize findings to select correct option(s).
**Current Goal:** Analyze options I, II, III to determine which must be true.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Analyze option I: \( w = y \).  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute \( w = y \) into \( \frac{3w}{y} = p \) and check if the result is a prime integer greater than 2, considering \( y \neq 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \( w = y \), then:
\[ \frac{3w}{y} = \frac{3y}{y} = 3 \]
Since \( p = 3 \), which is a prime integer greater than 2, option I holds in this case. However, we must check if \( w = y \) is always true. Consider a case where \( w \neq y \):
Let \( p = 5 \), then \( 3w = 5y \), so \( w = \frac{5y}{3} \). For \( w \) to be an integer, \( 5y \) must be divisible by 3. Since 5 is not divisible by 3, \( y \) must be divisible by 3. Try \( y = 6 \) (since \( y \neq 3 \)):
\[ w = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{3} = 10 \]
Then:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 10}{6} = 5 \]
Here, \( w = 10 \), \( y = 6 \), so \( w \neq y \), yet \( \frac{3w}{y} = 5 \), a prime greater than 2. Thus, \( w = y \) is not necessary.
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Analyze option II: \( y = 1 \).  
**How to Achieve:** Substitute \( y = 1 \) into \( \frac{3w}{y} = p \) and check if the result is a prime integer greater than 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \( y = 1 \):
\[ \frac{3w}{1} = 3w = p \]
Since \( p \) must be a prime integer greater than 2, \( 3w \) must be a prime like 5, 7, 11, etc. Then:
\[ w = \frac{p}{3} \]
For \( w \) to be an integer, \( p \) must be divisible by 3. The only prime \( p > 2 \) divisible by 3 is \( p = 3 \), but \( p = 3 \) is not greater than 2 in a strict sense, though we test it:
\[ w = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \]
But if \( p > 2 \), say \( p = 5 \):
\[ w = \frac{5}{3} \]
This is not an integer. Try \( p = 7 \):
\[ w = \frac{7}{3} \]
Also not an integer. Since no prime \( p > 2 \) is divisible by 3, \( y = 1 \) cannot produce an integer \( w \) such that \( 3w = p \). Thus, option II is not possible.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Analyze option III: \( w \) and \( y \) are prime integers.  
**How to Achieve:** Test if both \( w \) and \( y \) must be prime integers by using the equation \( w = \frac{py}{3} \) and checking if \( w \) and \( y \) are primes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From \( w = \frac{py}{3} \), \( w \) is an integer if \( py \) is divisible by 3. Assume \( y \) is a prime integer (e.g., 2, 5, 7, 11, ..., but not 3 since \( y \neq 3 \)). Try \( y = 2 \), \( p = 5 \):
\[ w = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]
Not an integer. Try \( y = 5 \), \( p = 7 \):
\[ w = \frac{7 \cdot 5}{3} = \frac{35}{3} \approx 11.67 \]
Not an integer. Now try a case where \( y \) is not prime, e.g., \( y = 6 \) (divisible by 3), \( p = 5 \):
\[ w = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{3} = 10 \]
Check:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 10}{6} = 5 \]
Here, \( w = 10 \) (not prime), \( y = 6 \) (not prime), and \( \frac{3w}{y} = 5 \), a prime greater than 2. Thus, \( w \) and \( y \) need not both be prime.

**Step 7: Track Goals**

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Determine which of I, II, III must be true.
  - Subgoal 1: Express the condition mathematically (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Analyze options I, II, III (completed: I is possible but not necessary, II is not possible, III is not necessary).
  - Subgoal 3: Synthesize findings to select correct option(s).
**Current Goal:** Synthesize findings to determine which options must be true.
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Synthesize findings to determine which options must be true.  
**How to Achieve:** Review the analyses of options I, II, and III to identify which, if any, are always true based on the condition \( \frac{3w}{y} = p > 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Option I (\( w = y \))**: Possible (e.g., \( w = y = 1 \), \( \frac{3 \cdot 1}{1} = 3 \)), but not necessary (e.g., \( w = 10 \), \( y = 6 \), \( \frac{3 \cdot 10}{6} = 5 \)).
- **Option II (\( y = 1 \))**: Not possible, as \( 3w = p > 2 \) requires \( w = \frac{p}{3} \) to be an integer, but no prime \( p > 2 \) is divisible by 3.
- **Option III (\( w \) and \( y \) are prime integers)**: Not necessary (e.g., \( w = 10 \), \( y = 6 \)).
Since none of the options must always be true, the answer is that none of I, II, or III must be true.

**Final Answer**

None of the options I, II, or III must be true.
