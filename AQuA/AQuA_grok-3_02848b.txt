Let’s solve the problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (M), which includes Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions, as specified. The problem involves finding the age of one of the Lee triplets in 20 years, given that the oldest inhabitant is x years older than the sum of the ages of the Lee triplets and is currently J years old. The user’s proposed answer, (J - X - 40)/3, is incorrect, and they’ve asked what’s wrong with their reasoning. We’ll solve the problem and identify the error.

### Problem Restatement
The oldest inhabitant is J years old and is x years older than the sum of the ages of the Lee triplets. If each triplet is currently Q years old, the sum of their ages is 3Q, and the oldest inhabitant’s age is J = 3Q + x. We need to find the age of one triplet in 20 years, which is Q + 20. The user’s answer, (J - X - 40)/3, is incorrect, and we need to determine the mistake in their reasoning.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Establish the relationship between the oldest inhabitant’s age (J), the age difference (x), and the current age of one triplet (Q).
2. Determine the expression for one triplet’s age in 20 years.
3. Derive the correct expression for Q + 20 in terms of J and x.
4. Analyze the user’s solution to identify the error.
5. Verify the solution for correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to establish the relationship between J, x, and Q. Use the problem statement to set up the equation relating the oldest inhabitant’s age to the sum of the triplets’ ages.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The oldest inhabitant is J years old and is x years older than the sum of the ages of the Lee triplets. Since there are three triplets, each Q years old, their combined age is 3Q. The statement “x years older than the sum” means J = 3Q + x. Solving for Q:
J = 3Q + x
3Q = J - x
Q = (J - x)/3
This gives the current age of one triplet in terms of J and x.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find the age of one triplet in 20 years. Using the expression for Q from the previous step, add 20 years to find Q + 20.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The age of one triplet in 20 years is Q + 20. From the previous step, Q = (J - x)/3. Thus:
Q + 20 = (J - x)/3 + 20
To combine, express 20 with a common denominator:
20 = 60/3
Q + 20 = (J - x)/3 + 60/3 = (J - x + 60)/3
This is the expression for one triplet’s age in 20 years.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: The current goal is to analyze the user’s solution to identify the error. Retrieve and summarize the user’s reasoning from their query to compare with the correct solution.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The user’s query provides their reasoning:
- Initial situation: J = x + L + L + L, where L is the age of one triplet (L = Q).
- After 20 years: J + 20 = x + (L + 20) + (L + 20) + (L + 20) = x + 3L + 60.
- They derive: J + 20 = x + 3L + 60, so 3L = J + 20 - x - 60 = J - x - 40, and L = (J - x - 40)/3.

This suggests they believe (J - x - 40)/3 is the triplet’s age in 20 years.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to identify the error in the user’s solution by comparing their equation to the correct one and analyzing their reasoning process.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The user’s equation for the triplet’s age in 20 years is (J - x - 40)/3. The correct expression, from Step 3, is (J - x + 60)/3. Let’s analyze the user’s reasoning:
- They correctly start with J = x + 3L (same as J = x + 3Q).
- For 20 years later, they write J + 20 = x + 3L + 60. This is incorrect because:
  - The left side, J + 20, represents the oldest inhabitant’s age in 20 years.
  - The right side should be x + 3(L + 20), since x is a fixed age difference (not an age that increases), and each triplet ages by 20 years.
  - Correctly: J + 20 = x + 3(L + 20) = x + 3L + 60.
  - Solving: J + 20 = x + 3L + 60 → 3L = J + 20 - x - 60 = J - x - 40 → L = (J - x - 40)/3.

The user’s error is in the interpretation of the final expression. They derived L = (J - x - 40)/3 as the current age (since J = x + 3L → 3L = J - x → L = (J - x)/3), but they incorrectly applied it to the future age. The correct future age starts from J + 20 = x + 3(L + 20):
J + 20 = x + 3L + 60
3L = J + 20 - x - 60 = J - x - 40
L = (J - x - 40)/3 (current age)
Future age = L + 20 = (J - x - 40)/3 + 20 = (J - x - 40 + 60)/3 = (J - x + 20)/3
However, our earlier derivation gives (J - x + 60)/3. Let’s correct the derivation:
Correctly, from J = x + 3Q:
In 20 years, J + 20 = x + 3(Q + 20) = x + 3Q + 60
But we need Q + 20. Use current Q:
Q = (J - x)/3
Q + 20 = (J - x)/3 + 20 = (J - x + 60)/3
The user’s (J - x - 40)/3 likely stems from confusing the current age equation and not properly adjusting for the future age.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the derived expression (J - x + 60)/3 for the triplet’s age in 20 years by testing with sample values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s test with J = 80, x = 20, and Q = 20 (so 3Q = 60, J = 60 + 20 = 80):
- Current age: Q = (J - x)/3 = (80 - 20)/3 = 60/3 = 20.
- In 20 years: Q + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.
- Using our expression: (J - x + 60)/3 = (80 - 20 + 60)/3 = 120/3 = 40.
- User’s expression: (J - x - 40)/3 = (80 - 20 - 40)/3 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 (not a plausible age).

The correct expression (J - x + 60)/3 matches the expected future age.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the age of one Lee triplet in 20 years and identify the user’s error.
  - Subgoal 1: Establish J = x + 3Q (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Derive Q + 20 = (J - x + 60)/3 (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Analyze user’s error (identified confusion in applying current age to future age).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solution (completed with sample values).
Current goal: Conclude the solution and summarize the user’s mistake.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to provide the final answer and clearly explain the user’s mistake.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Final Answer**: The age of one Lee triplet in 20 years is (J - x + 60)/3.

**User’s Mistake**: The user correctly derived the current age of a triplet, Q = (J - x)/3, from J = x + 3Q. However, they made an error in their equation for 20 years later. They wrote J + 20 = x + 3L + 60, which implies the sum of the triplets’ ages increases by 60 years, but they misinterpreted the resulting expression (J - x - 40)/3 as the future age. Instead:
- The correct setup is J = x + 3Q → Q = (J - x)/3.
- In 20 years, the triplet’s age is Q + 20 = (J - x)/3 + 20 = (J - x + 60)/3.
- The user’s expression (J - x - 40)/3 corresponds to the current age adjusted incorrectly, likely from misapplying the future age equation or confusing terms during algebraic manipulation.
