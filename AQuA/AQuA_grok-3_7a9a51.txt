**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to find the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 \).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, we’ll break down the goal of finding integer values of \( x \) into subgoals:  
1. Solve the compound inequality \( 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 \) to find the range of \( x \).  
2. Determine which values of \( x \) within this range are integers.  
3. Count the number of integer values.  
Let’s start with solving the inequality.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the compound inequality \( 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 \) to find the range of \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations on both parts of the inequality. Subtract 5 from all parts, then divide by 3 to solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the inequality:  
\( 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 \)  

Subtract 5 from all parts:  
\( 1 - 5 < 3x + 5 - 5 < 17 - 5 \)  
\( -4 < 3x < 12 \)  

Divide all parts by 3:  
\( -4/3 < x < 12/3 \)  
\( -4/3 < x < 4 \)  

Thus, \( x \) must satisfy \( -4/3 < x < 4 \).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine which values of \( x \) within the range \( -4/3 < x < 4 \) are integers.  
How to Achieve: Identify all integer values of \( x \) that lie between \( -4/3 \) (approximately -1.333) and 4. List these integers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The range is \( -4/3 < x < 4 \).  
- \( -4/3 \approx -1.333 \), so \( x \) must be greater than -1.333.  
- \( x \) must be less than 4.  
- The integers within this range are values greater than -1.333 and less than 4.  
List the integers:  
- \( x = -1 \): Check if \( -1 > -4/3 \). Since \( -1 > -1.333 \), this works.  
- \( x = 0, 1, 2, 3 \): All are greater than \( -4/3 \) and less than 4.  
- \( x = 4 \): Check if \( 4 < 4 \). This is not true, so 4 is not included.  

Thus, the integer values of \( x \) are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Count the number of integer values of \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Count the integers identified in the previous step: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The integer values of \( x \) are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.  
Count them:  
- -1  
- 0  
- 1  
- 2  
- 3  
Total: 5 integers.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if each integer value of \( x \) satisfies the original inequality \( 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute each integer value (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) into the inequality and confirm all parts hold. Also, check boundary values to ensure no integers are missed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check each integer:  
- For \( x = -1 \):  
  \( 3(-1) + 5 = -3 + 5 = 2 \)  
  \( 1 < 2 < 17 \), true.  
- For \( x = 0 \):  
  \( 3(0) + 5 = 5 \)  
  \( 1 < 5 < 17 \), true.  
- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \( 3(1) + 5 = 8 \)  
  \( 1 < 8 < 17 \), true.  
- For \( x = 2 \):  
  \( 3(2) + 5 = 11 \)  
  \( 1 < 11 < 17 \), true.  
- For \( x = 3 \):  
  \( 3(3) + 5 = 14 \)  
  \( 1 < 14 < 17 \), true.  
- Check boundary: For \( x = 4 \):  
  \( 3(4) + 5 = 17 \)  
  \( 1 < 17 < 17 \), not true (since 17 is not less than 17).  
- Check boundary: For \( x = -2 \):  
  \( 3(-2) + 5 = -1 \)  
  \( 1 < -1 < 17 \), not true.  

All listed integers (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) satisfy the inequality, and no other integers do. The count of 5 is valid.
