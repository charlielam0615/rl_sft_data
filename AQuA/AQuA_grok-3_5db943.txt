**Problem Restatement:**
The cricket player's current average over 20 innings is 32 runs. We need to determine how many runs he must score in his 21st innings to increase his average by 5, making the new average 37 runs.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the total runs scored in the 20 innings.
2. Express the new average after 21 innings in terms of the runs scored in the 21st innings.
3. Set up an equation to achieve the desired average of 37.
4. Solve for the runs needed in the 21st innings.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total runs scored in the 20 innings.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for average (total runs divided by number of innings) to find the total runs. Given the average is 32 over 20 innings, multiply the average by the number of innings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total runs = Average × Number of innings = 32 × 20 = 640 runs.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express the new average after 21 innings and set up an equation.
How to Achieve: The new average after 21 innings should be 37. Let \( x \) be the runs scored in the 21st innings. The total runs after 21 innings will be 640 + \( x \), and the average is (640 + \( x \)) / 21. Set this equal to 37 and solve for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
New average = (Total runs after 21 innings) / 21
37 = (640 + \( x \)) / 21
Multiply both sides by 21:
37 × 21 = 640 + \( x \)
777 = 640 + \( x \)
\( x \) = 777 - 640 = 137
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution.
How to Achieve: Check if scoring 137 runs in the 21st innings results in an average of 37 over 21 innings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total runs after 21 innings = 640 + 137 = 777
Average = 777 / 21 = 37
The calculation confirms that scoring 137 runs in the 21st innings results in an average of 37, which is the desired increase of 5 from the original average of 32.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine runs needed in the 21st innings to increase the average by 5.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total runs in 20 innings (completed: 640 runs).
  - Subgoal 2: Express the new average and set up an equation (completed: equation set up).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for runs in the 21st innings (completed: 137 runs).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: average is 37).
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The cricket player must score 137 runs in his next innings to increase his average by 5, resulting in a new average of 37.

**Final Answer: 137**
