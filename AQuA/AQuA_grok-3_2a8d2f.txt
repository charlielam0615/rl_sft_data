### Problem Statement
Calculate the simple interest earned on Rs. 8200 at an annual interest rate of 17.5% for a period of 2 years and 6 months.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the simple interest:  
1. Identify the formula for simple interest.  
2. Convert the time period (2 years and 6 months) into years.  
3. Extract the principal, rate, and time from the problem.  
4. Calculate the simple interest using the formula.  
5. Present the final answer in the required format (Rupees).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for simple interest. This will be achieved by recalling the standard formula for simple interest, which involves the principal, rate, and time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The formula for simple interest is:  
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{\text{P} \times \text{R} \times \text{T}}{100} \]  
where:  
- SI = Simple Interest  
- P = Principal amount  
- R = Annual interest rate (%)  
- T = Time period (in years)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the time period of 2 years and 6 months into years. This will be achieved by converting 6 months into a fraction of a year and adding it to the 2 years.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Time period = 2 years + 6 months.  
Since 6 months is half a year, convert 6 months to years:  
\[ 6 \text{ months} = \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \text{ years} \]  
Total time = \( 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 \) years.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract the principal, rate, and time from the problem. This will be achieved by identifying the given values directly from the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- Principal (P) = Rs. 8200  
- Rate (R) = 17.5% per annum  
- Time (T) = 2.5 years (from Step 3)  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the simple interest for Rs. 8200 at 17.5% p.a. for 2 years and 6 months.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the formula for simple interest (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Convert the time period into years (completed: T = 2.5 years).  
  - Subgoal 3: Extract principal, rate, and time (completed: P = 8200, R = 17.5, T = 2.5).  
  - **Current Subgoal**: Calculate the simple interest using the formula.  
  - Subgoal 5: Present the final answer in Rupees.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the simple interest using the formula \(\text{SI} = \frac{\text{P} \times \text{R} \times \text{T}}{100}\). This will be achieved by substituting P = 8200, R = 17.5, and T = 2.5 into the formula and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute the values into the simple interest formula:  
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{8200 \times 17.5 \times 2.5}{100} \]  
Calculate step-by-step:  
1. \( 17.5 \times 2.5 = 43.75 \)  
2. \( 8200 \times 43.75 = 8200 \times \frac{4375}{100} = 8200 \times 43.75 = 358750 \)  
3. \( \frac{358750}{100} = 3587.5 \)  
So, the simple interest is Rs. 3587.5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated simple interest. This will be achieved by rechecking the formula, inputs, and calculations to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
- Formula: \(\text{SI} = \frac{\text{P} \times \text{R} \times \text{T}}{100}\)  
- Inputs: P = 8200, R = 17.5, T = 2.5  
- Calculation:  
  \[ \text{SI} = \frac{8200 \times 17.5 \times 2.5}{100} \]  
  \[ 17.5 \times 2.5 = 43.75 \]  
  \[ 8200 \times 43.75 = 358750 \]  
  \[ \frac{358750}{100} = 3587.5 \]  
The result matches: Rs. 3587.5.  
To further confirm, compute using fractions to avoid decimal approximations:  
- Rate = 17.5% = \(\frac{17.5}{100} = \frac{175}{1000} = \frac{7}{40}\)  
- Time = 2.5 years = \(\frac{5}{2}\)  
- \(\text{SI} = 8200 \times \frac{7}{40} \times \frac{5}{2} = 8200 \times \frac{7 \times 5}{40 \times 2} = 8200 \times \frac{35}{80} = 8200 \times \frac{7}{16} = \frac{8200 \times 7}{16} = \frac{57400}{16} = 3587.5\)  
The calculation is consistent: Rs. 3587.5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to present the final answer in the required format (Rupees). This will be achieved by stating the calculated simple interest clearly as the final result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The simple interest earned on Rs. 8200 at 17.5% per annum for 2 years and 6 months is Rs. 3587.5.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The interest earned is Rs. 3587.5.
