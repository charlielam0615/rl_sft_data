**Problem Restatement:**
In a seventh-grade class of 24 students, girls each planted 3 roses, and every three boys planted 1 birch. By the end of the day, they planted a total of 24 plants. Determine how many birches and roses were planted.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break the problem into subgoals: 
1. Define variables for the number of girls, boys, birches, and roses.
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the number of birches and roses.
Start by defining variables and relationships.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and establish relationships.
- Let G be the number of girls, B the number of boys, R the number of roses, and T the number of birches.
- Relationships: 
  - Total students: G + B = 24
  - Each girl plants 3 roses: R = 3G
  - Every three boys plant 1 birch: T = B / 3
  - Total plants: R + T = 24
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the defined variables:
- G + B = 24 (total students)
- R = 3G (roses planted by girls)
- T = B / 3 (birches planted by boys)
- R + T = 24 (total plants)
These equations capture the relationships needed to solve for birches (T) and roses (R).
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the number of birches and roses.
- Substitute R = 3G and T = B / 3 into R + T = 24.
- Use G + B = 24 to express B in terms of G, then solve for G.
- Compute R and T using the values of G and B.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Step 1: From G + B = 24, express B as B = 24 - G.
Step 2: Substitute R = 3G and T = B / 3 into R + T = 24:
- 3G + (24 - G) / 3 = 24
Step 3: Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:
- 9G + (24 - G) = 72
- 9G + 24 - G = 72
- 8G + 24 = 72
Step 4: Solve for G:
- 8G = 48
- G = 6
Step 5: Find B, R, and T:
- B = 24 - G = 24 - 6 = 18
- R = 3G = 3 * 6 = 18
- T = B / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6
Thus, 18 roses and 6 birches were planted.

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the solution's validity.
- Verify: 6 girls plant 3 roses each (18 roses), 18 boys in groups of 3 plant 6 birches.
- Check total students: 6 + 18 = 24.
- Check total plants: 18 + 6 = 24.
- Confirm all relationships hold.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verification:
- Total students: G + B = 6 + 18 = 24 (matches)
- Roses: R = 3G = 3 * 6 = 18
- Birches: T = B / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6
- Total plants: R + T = 18 + 6 = 24 (matches)
All conditions are satisfied. The solution is valid: 18 roses and 6 birches.
[/IMP]

**Solution:**
They planted 18 roses and 6 birches.
