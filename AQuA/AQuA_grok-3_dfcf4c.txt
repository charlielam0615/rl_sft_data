**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the simple interest on Rs. 26 for 6 months at a rate of 7 paise per rupee per month.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the simple interest. Subgoals:  
1. Understand the simple interest formula.  
2. Identify and convert the given values (principal, time, rate) into appropriate units.  
3. Apply the formula to calculate the simple interest.  
4. Validate the result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify and convert the given values (principal, time, rate) into appropriate units for the simple interest formula. This will be achieved by extracting the values from the problem and converting the rate from paise per rupee per month to a decimal form suitable for the formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The simple interest formula is \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \), where:
- \( P \) is the principal (in rupees),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per period (in percentage),
- \( T \) is the time period (in the same units as the rate).

Given:
- Principal (\( P \)) = Rs. 26.
- Time (\( T \)) = 6 months.
- Rate = 7 paise per rupee per month.

Since 100 paise = 1 rupee, the rate of 7 paise per rupee per month means:
\[ R = \frac{7}{100} = 0.07 \text{ per rupee per month}. \]
To express this as a percentage for the formula:
\[ R = 0.07 \times 100 = 7\% \text{ per month}. \]
The values are now:
- \( P = 26 \),
- \( R = 7\% \text{ per month} \),
- \( T = 6 \text{ months} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the simple interest formula using the identified values (\( P = 26 \), \( R = 7\% \), \( T = 6 \)) to compute the simple interest. This will be achieved by substituting the values into the formula \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \) and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute the values into the simple interest formula:
\[ SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = \frac{26 \times 7 \times 6}{100}. \]

Calculate step-by-step:
1. \( 26 \times 7 = 182 \).
2. \( 182 \times 6 = 1092 \).
3. \( \frac{1092}{100} = 10.92 \).

Thus, the simple interest is Rs. 10.92.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the calculated simple interest (Rs. 10.92) by checking the calculations and ensuring the rate interpretation aligns with the problem’s context. This will be achieved by rechecking the formula application and considering the rate’s unit consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute to validate:
- Formula: \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).
- Values: \( P = 26 \), \( R = 7 \), \( T = 6 \).
- \( 26 \times 7 = 182 \).
- \( 182 \times 6 = 1092 \).
- \( \frac{1092}{100} = 10.92 \).

The calculation is consistent. Additionally, verify the rate:
- Rate = 7 paise per rupee per month = \( \frac{7}{100} = 0.07 \text{ rupees per rupee per month} = 7\% \text{ per month}.
- The rate is applied monthly, and the time is given in months, so the units are consistent.

The result of Rs. 10.92 is valid.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

**Goal Hierarchy:**
1. Understand the simple interest formula (completed).
2. Identify and convert the given values into appropriate units (completed).
3. Apply the formula to calculate the simple interest (completed).
4. Validate the result (completed).

**Current Goal:** Validation has been completed, and all subgoals are fulfilled. The final answer is ready to be presented.

**Final Answer:** The simple interest on Rs. 26 for 6 months at the rate of 7 paise per rupee per month is Rs. 10.92.
