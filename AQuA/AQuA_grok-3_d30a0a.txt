**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the probability of drawing a face card (Jack, Queen, or King) from a standard deck of 52 cards when one card is drawn randomly.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the total number of cards in the deck.  
2. Determine the number of face cards (Jack, Queen, King) in the deck.  
3. Calculate the probability as the ratio of face cards to total cards.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the total number of cards in the deck.  
How to Achieve: A standard deck of playing cards is known to contain 52 cards.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A standard deck consists of 52 cards, with 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) and 13 ranks per suit.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of face cards in the deck.  
How to Achieve: Identify the face cards (Jack, Queen, King) in each suit and count them across all suits.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Face cards are Jacks, Queens, and Kings. There are 3 face cards per suit (Jack, Queen, King), and there are 4 suits. Thus, the total number of face cards is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability of drawing a face card from a 52-card deck.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the total number of cards (completed: 52 cards).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of face cards (completed: 12 face cards).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability (pending).  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability as the ratio of face cards to total cards.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of drawing a face card.  
How to Achieve: Use the probability formula, where probability is the number of favorable outcomes (face cards) divided by the total number of outcomes (total cards).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The number of face cards is 12, and the total number of cards is 52. The probability of drawing a face card is:  
\[
\frac{\text{Number of face cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}.
\]  
The probability, in simplified form, is \(\frac{3}{13}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the probability calculation.  
How to Achieve: Check the counts of face cards and total cards, and ensure the probability calculation is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Total cards: A standard deck has \(4 \times 13 = 52\) cards, which is correct.  
- Face cards: Each suit has 3 face cards (Jack, Queen, King), so \(3 \times 4 = 12\) face cards, which is correct.  
- Probability: \(\frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}\), and 12 and 52 have a greatest common divisor of 4, confirming the fraction is simplified correctly.  
The calculation is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability of drawing a face card from a standard deck of 52 cards is \(\frac{3}{13}\).
