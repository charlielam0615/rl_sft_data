### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( k \) such that \( (t - 8) \) is a factor of the polynomial \( t^2 - kt - 46 \). This implies that when \( t = 8 \), the polynomial evaluates to zero (by the factor theorem).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the factor theorem to determine that \( t = 8 \) makes the polynomial \( t^2 - kt - 46 = 0 \).  
2. Substitute \( t = 8 \) into the polynomial to form an equation.  
3. Solve the equation for \( k \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the factor theorem by substituting \( t = 8 \) into the polynomial \( t^2 - kt - 46 \) to set it equal to zero, then solve for \( k \). This involves evaluating the polynomial at \( t = 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = 8 \) into \( t^2 - kt - 46 \):  
\[ 8^2 - k \cdot 8 - 46 = 0 \]  
Calculate:  
\[ 64 - 8k - 46 = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 18 - 8k = 0 \]  
Solve for \( k \):  
\[ 8k = 18 \]  
\[ k = \frac{18}{8} = \frac{9}{4} \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( k = \frac{9}{4} \) makes \( (t - 8) \) a factor of the polynomial by checking if the polynomial evaluates to zero at \( t = 8 \) or by confirming the factor through polynomial division.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( k = \frac{9}{4} \) back into the polynomial and evaluate at \( t = 8 \):  
Polynomial becomes:  
\[ t^2 - \frac{9}{4}t - 46 \]  
Evaluate at \( t = 8 \):  
\[ 8^2 - \frac{9}{4} \cdot 8 - 46 = 64 - \frac{72}{4} - 46 = 64 - 18 - 46 = 0 \]  
Since the result is zero, \( t = 8 \) is a root, confirming \( (t - 8) \) is a factor.  
Alternatively, perform synthetic division to confirm:  
Coefficients of \( t^2 - \frac{9}{4}t - 46 \): \( [1, -\frac{9}{4}, -46] \).  
Use root \( t = 8 \):  
\[ 
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}  
8 & 1 & -\frac{9}{4} & -46 \\  
  &   & 8 & \frac{47}{4} \\  
\hline  
  & 1 & \frac{23}{4} & 0 \\  
\end{array} 
\]  
Remainder is 0, confirming \( (t - 8) \) is a factor.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( k \) such that \( (t - 8) \) is a factor of \( t^2 - kt - 46 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply factor theorem by substituting \( t = 8 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( k \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution.  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution \( k = \frac{9}{4} \) is correct and complete.
