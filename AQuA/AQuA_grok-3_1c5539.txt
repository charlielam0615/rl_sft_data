**Problem Restatement:**
The average age of a family of 6 members is currently 28 years, and the youngest member is 7 years old. We need to determine the average age of the family at the time of the youngest member's birth, which was 7 years ago.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total current age of the family.
2. Determine the total age of the family 7 years ago (at the birth of the youngest member).
3. Calculate the average age of the family at that time, considering the number of family members then.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total current age of the family.
How to Achieve: Use the given average age (28 years) and the number of family members (6) to compute the total age by multiplying the average by the number of members.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The average age of the family is 28 years, and there are 6 members. The total current age is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \text{ years} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Refine the next steps to reach the solution:
1. Subtract the current age of the youngest member (7 years) from the total current age to find the total age of the other 5 members.
2. Determine the total age of the family 7 years ago by adjusting the ages of the other members and accounting for the youngest member at birth (age 0).
3. Compute the average age using the total age from 7 years ago and the number of family members at that time.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the total age of the other 5 family members currently.
How to Achieve: Subtract the youngest member’s age (7 years) from the total current age (168 years).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total current age of the family is 168 years, and the youngest member is 7 years old. The total age of the other 5 members is:
\[ 168 - 7 = 161 \text{ years} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total age of the family 7 years ago at the birth of the youngest member.
How to Achieve: Since the youngest member was 0 years old at birth, subtract 7 years from each of the other 5 members’ current ages (total 161 years) and include the youngest member’s age (0 years).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Seven years ago, each of the 5 older members was 7 years younger, so their total age decreases by:
\[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ years} \]
The total age of the 5 members 7 years ago was:
\[ 161 - 35 = 126 \text{ years} \]
The youngest member was 0 years old, so the total family age (including all 6 members) was:
\[ 126 + 0 = 126 \text{ years} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify if the family had 6 members at the time of the youngest member’s birth.
How to Achieve: Check the problem context to confirm the number of family members 7 years ago, as this affects the average calculation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem states a family of 6 members currently, and we need the average age at the birth of the youngest member. Since the youngest was just born, the family likely included all 6 members (the 5 older members plus the newborn). Thus, we assume 6 members for the calculation unless otherwise indicated.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the average age of the family 7 years ago.
How to Achieve: Divide the total family age 7 years ago (126 years) by the number of family members (6).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total age of the family 7 years ago was 126 years, with 6 members. The average age is:
\[ \frac{126}{6} = 21 \text{ years} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the average age of the family at the birth of the youngest member.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total current age of the family (completed: 168 years).
  - Subgoal 2: Find the total age of the other 5 members (completed: 161 years).
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the total family age 7 years ago (completed: 126 years).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the number of family members 7 years ago (completed: assumed 6).
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate the average age 7 years ago (completed: 21 years).
Current Goal: Completed (average age calculated as 21 years).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the final answer by recomputing the average age.
How to Achieve: Recompute the total age 7 years ago and the average to ensure consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute: Current total age = 168 years. Youngest member’s age = 7 years, so other 5 members’ total age = 161 years. Seven years ago, 5 members’ total age = 161 - (5 × 7) = 126 years. With the youngest at 0 years, total family age = 126 years. Average age = 126 ÷ 6 = 21 years. The calculation is consistent.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The average age of the family at the birth of the youngest member was 21 years.
