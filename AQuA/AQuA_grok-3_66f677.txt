**Problem Restatement**:  
Three business people are investing equally in a new company, each contributing one-third of the total investment. If two additional investors join, making five equal investors, each would pay $7,500 less than the original amount per person. We need to determine the total investment in the new business.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the total investment, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the total investment and the original contribution per person.  
2. Express the new contribution per person with two additional investors.  
3. Set up an equation based on the $7,500 reduction in individual contributions.  
4. Solve the equation to find the total investment.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up an equation representing the relationship between the original and new contributions. This will be achieved by defining the total investment as a variable, expressing each person’s contribution in both scenarios, and using the given $7,500 reduction to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the total investment be \( T \) dollars.  
- With 3 investors, each pays \( \frac{T}{3} \).  
- With 5 investors, each pays \( \frac{T}{5} \).  
- The problem states that each of the original investors would pay $7,500 less with 5 investors, so:  
  \[
  \frac{T}{3} - \frac{T}{5} = 7500
  \]  
This equation represents the reduction in individual contributions when moving from 3 to 5 investors.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{T}{3} - \frac{T}{5} = 7500 \) to find the total investment \( T \). This will be achieved by simplifying the equation and isolating \( T \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[
\frac{T}{3} - \frac{T}{5} = 7500
\]  
Find a common denominator for the fractions (15):  
\[
\frac{5T}{15} - \frac{3T}{15} = 7500
\]  
\[
\frac{5T - 3T}{15} = 7500
\]  
\[
\frac{2T}{15} = 7500
\]  
Multiply both sides by 15:  
\[
2T = 112500
\]  
Divide by 2:  
\[
T = 56250
\]  
The total investment is $56,250.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the total investment \( T = 56250 \) satisfies the problem’s conditions. This will be achieved by calculating the contributions per person with 3 and 5 investors and checking if the difference is $7,500.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- With 3 investors:  
  \[
  \frac{56250}{3} = 18750
  \]  
  Each pays $18,750.  
- With 5 investors:  
  \[
  \frac{56250}{5} = 11250
  \]  
  Each pays $11,250.  
- Check the difference:  
  \[
  18750 - 11250 = 7500
  \]  
The difference is exactly $7,500, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the total investment in the new business.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the total investment and contributions (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve an equation for the total investment (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the validation confirms the correctness of the total investment.  
The total investment is $56,250, and all subgoals have been addressed.

**Final Answer**: The total investment in the new business is $56,250.
