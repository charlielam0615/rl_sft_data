**Problem Statement:**  
P, Q, and R invested Rs.5500, Rs.9900, and Rs.12100, respectively, in a partnership business. We need to find Q's share of a total profit of Rs.62500 after one year.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into the following subgoals:  
1. Determine the ratio of investments by P, Q, and R.  
2. Calculate the total parts of the profit based on the investment ratio.  
3. Find Q's share of the profit using the ratio and the total profit of Rs.62500.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the ratio of investments by P, Q, and R.  
How to Achieve: Since the investments are Rs.5500 (P), Rs.9900 (Q), and Rs.12100 (R), and no time duration differences are mentioned, the profit is divided in the ratio of their investments. Calculate the ratio by simplifying the investment amounts.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The investments are:  
P = Rs.5500, Q = Rs.9900, R = Rs.12100.  
The ratio of investments is 5500 : 9900 : 12100.  
To simplify, divide by the greatest common divisor. The GCD of 5500, 9900, and 12100 is 1100 (since 5500 = 1100 × 5, 9900 = 1100 × 9, 12100 = 1100 × 11).  
Thus, the ratio is:  
5500 ÷ 1100 : 9900 ÷ 1100 : 12100 ÷ 1100 = 5 : 9 : 11.  
The ratio of P : Q : R is 5 : 9 : 11.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the investment ratio.  
How to Achieve: Check if the simplified ratio 5 : 9 : 11 accurately represents the investments by reconstructing the amounts and ensuring proportionality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The ratio 5 : 9 : 11 corresponds to investments of 5k, 9k, and 11k (for some constant k). Since 5500 : 9900 : 12100 simplifies to 5 : 9 : 11 (as calculated), the ratio is correct. Additionally, confirm the GCD: 5500 = 5 × 1100, 9900 = 9 × 1100, 12100 = 11 × 1100. The ratio holds.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total parts of the profit based on the investment ratio.  
How to Achieve: Sum the parts of the ratio (5 + 9 + 11) to find the total number of parts the profit is divided into.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The ratio of investments is 5 : 9 : 11.  
Total parts = 5 + 9 + 11 = 25.  
The profit of Rs.62500 is divided into 25 parts.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find Q's share of the profit using the ratio and total profit.  
How to Achieve: Since Q's share corresponds to 9 parts of the 25 total parts, calculate Q's share as (9/25) × 62500.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Q's share in the ratio is 9 parts out of 25.  
Q's share of the profit = (9/25) × 62500.  
Calculate:  
62500 ÷ 25 = 2500 (value of one part).  
9 × 2500 = 22500.  
Thus, Q's share is Rs.22500.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify Q's share of the profit.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the shares for P and R, sum all shares, and check if they equal the total profit of Rs.62500.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
P's share = (5/25) × 62500 = 5 × 2500 = 12500.  
Q's share = (9/25) × 62500 = 9 × 2500 = 22500 (as calculated).  
R's share = (11/25) × 62500 = 11 × 2500 = 27500.  
Total = 12500 + 22500 + 27500 = 62500.  
The sum matches the total profit, confirming Q's share of Rs.22500 is correct.
