### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( \log_x 16 = 0.8 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the logarithm equation and rewrite it in exponential form.  
2. Solve the resulting exponential equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the logarithm equation \( \log_x 16 = 0.8 \) in exponential form. This involves using the definition of a logarithm: if \( \log_b a = c \), then \( b^c = a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( \log_x 16 = 0.8 \), rewrite it using the logarithm definition:  
\[ x^{0.8} = 16 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the exponential equation \( x^{0.8} = 16 \) for \( x \). This can be achieved by raising both sides to the power of \( \frac{1}{0.8} \) to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with \( x^{0.8} = 16 \). To solve for \( x \), raise both sides to the power of \( \frac{1}{0.8} \):  
\[ (x^{0.8})^{\frac{1}{0.8}} = 16^{\frac{1}{0.8}} \]  
Since \( \frac{1}{0.8} = \frac{10}{8} = \frac{5}{4} \), this becomes:  
\[ x = 16^{\frac{5}{4}} \]  
Now compute \( 16^{\frac{5}{4}} \):  
- \( 16 = 2^4 \), so \( 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\frac{5}{4}} = 2^{4 \cdot \frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32 \).  
Thus, \( x = 32 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 32 \) by substituting it back into the original equation \( \log_x 16 = 0.8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 32 \) into \( \log_{32} 16 = 0.8 \):  
- Compute \( \log_{32} 16 \). Using the change of base formula:  
  \[ \log_{32} 16 = \frac{\log 16}{\log 32} \]  
- Since \( 16 = 2^4 \) and \( 32 = 2^5 \), we have:  
  \[ \log 16 = \log (2^4) = 4 \log 2, \quad \log 32 = \log (2^5) = 5 \log 2 \]  
  \[ \log_{32} 16 = \frac{4 \log 2}{5 \log 2} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \]  
- This matches the given value of 0.8, so the solution is correct.
