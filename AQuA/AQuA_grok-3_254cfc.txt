**Problem Restatement:**
Anil spends 40% of his monthly salary on rent. From the remaining amount, he spends 30% on medicines. From the amount left after paying for medicines, he spends 20% on education. After these expenditures, he saves Rs. 840 per month. We need to determine his monthly salary.

Let’s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set.

---

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for Anil’s monthly salary, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define the monthly salary as a variable.
2. Calculate the amount remaining after each expenditure (rent, medicines, education).
3. Set up an equation where the amount left after all expenditures equals the savings (Rs. 840).
4. Solve for the monthly salary.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the monthly salary and calculate the amount remaining after each expenditure.
How to Achieve: Assume the monthly salary is a variable (say, S). Compute the remaining amount after each percentage-based expenditure, leading to the savings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let Anil’s monthly salary be \( S \) (in Rs.).

1. **Rent**: Anil spends 40% of his salary on rent.
   - Amount spent on rent = \( 0.4S \).
   - Remaining after rent = \( S - 0.4S = 0.6S \).

2. **Medicines**: Anil spends 30% of the remaining amount on medicines.
   - Remaining after rent = \( 0.6S \).
   - Amount spent on medicines = \( 0.3 \times 0.6S = 0.18S \).
   - Remaining after medicines = \( 0.6S - 0.18S = 0.42S \).

3. **Education**: Anil spends 20% of the remaining amount on education.
   - Remaining after medicines = \( 0.42S \).
   - Amount spent on education = \( 0.2 \times 0.42S = 0.084S \).
   - Remaining after education = \( 0.42S - 0.084S = 0.336S \).

4. **Savings**: The remaining amount after all expenditures is the savings, which is Rs. 840.
   - \( 0.336S = 840 \).

This equation will be solved in the next step.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( 0.336S = 840 \) to find the monthly salary \( S \).
How to Achieve: Isolate \( S \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.336.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[ 0.336S = 840 \]
\[ S = \frac{840}{0.336} \]

Calculate:
\[ 0.336 = \frac{336}{1000} = \frac{84}{250} \]
\[ S = 840 \div \frac{84}{250} = 840 \times \frac{250}{84} \]

Simplify:
\[ \frac{250}{84} = \frac{125}{42} \] (dividing numerator and denominator by 2).
\[ 840 \div \frac{84}{250} = 840 \times \frac{250}{84} = \frac{840 \times 250}{84} \]

\[ \frac{840}{84} = 10 \]
\[ S = 10 \times 250 = 2500 \]

So, Anil’s monthly salary is Rs. 2500.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that a monthly salary of Rs. 2500 results in savings of Rs. 840 after all expenditures.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( S = 2500 \) back into the expenditure calculations and check if the remaining amount equals 840.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify with \( S = 2500 \):
1. **Rent**: \( 0.4 \times 2500 = 1000 \).
   - Remaining = \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \).
2. **Medicines**: \( 0.3 \times 1500 = 450 \).
   - Remaining = \( 1500 - 450 = 1050 \).
3. **Education**: \( 0.2 \times 1050 = 210 \).
   - Remaining = \( 1050 - 210 = 840 \).
4. **Savings**: The remaining amount is Rs. 840, which matches the given savings.

The calculations are consistent, confirming the solution.
