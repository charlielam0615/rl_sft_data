**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the probability that exactly one person out of nine pushes the button for each of the nine floors in an elevator, meaning each floor is selected by exactly one person.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this probability problem, break it down into subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of possible ways the nine people can choose floors.
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where each floor is chosen by exactly one person.
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible ways the nine people can choose floors. Assume each person independently chooses one of the nine floors, and calculate the total number of assignments.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each of the nine people can choose any of the nine floors. Since the choices are independent, the total number of possible assignments is:
\[ 9 \times 9 \times \cdots \times 9 = 9^9 \]
Calculate \( 9^9 \):
\[ 9^9 = 387,420,489 \]
So, there are 387,420,489 possible ways for the nine people to choose floors.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where each floor is chosen by exactly one person. This requires assigning each of the nine floors to a unique person, which is the number of permutations of the nine people.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For each floor to be chosen by exactly one person, we need to assign each of the nine floors to one of the nine people such that no floor is assigned to more than one person. This is equivalent to the number of permutations of the nine people:
\[ 9! = 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 362,880 \]
So, there are 362,880 favorable outcomes.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that each floor is selected by exactly one person.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of possible floor assignments (completed: \( 9^9 = 387,420,489 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (completed: \( 9! = 362,880 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes (current goal).
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability using the results from previous steps.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{9!}{9^9} = \frac{362,880}{387,420,489} \]
Calculate the numerical value:
\[ P \approx \frac{362,880}{387,420,489} \approx 0.000936 \]
To express this as a fraction in simplest form, note that:
\[ 362,880 = 9! = 2^7 \times 3^4 \times 5 \times 7 \]
\[ 387,420,489 = 9^9 = (3^2)^9 = 3^{18} \]
Thus:
\[ P = \frac{2^7 \times 3^4 \times 5 \times 7}{3^{18}} = \frac{2^7 \times 5 \times 7}{3^{18-4}} = \frac{2^7 \times 5 \times 7}{3^{14}} \]
Since \( 2^7 = 128 \), \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \), the numerator is:
\[ 128 \times 35 = 4,480 \]
So the probability is:
\[ P = \frac{4,480}{3^{14}} \]
where \( 3^{14} = 4,782,969 \). The fraction \( \frac{4,480}{4,782,969} \) is in simplest form since 4,480 (\( 2^8 \times 5 \times 7 \)) and 4,782,969 (\( 3^{14} \)) have no common factors.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the probability calculation by checking the logic and computations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Verify the total outcomes: Each of the nine people chooses one of nine floors, so \( 9^9 = 387,420,489 \) is correct.
Verify the favorable outcomes: We need a one-to-one assignment of people to floors, which is \( 9! = 362,880 \), correct.
The probability formula \( P = \frac{9!}{9^9} \) aligns with a permutation divided by total assignments. The numerical approximation \( 362,880 \div 387,420,489 \approx 0.000936 \) and the fraction \( \frac{4,480}{3^{14}} \) are consistent, as \( 3^{14} = 4,782,969 \), and no common factors exist between numerator and denominator.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that exactly one person pushes the button for each floor is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4480}{3^{14}}} \] or approximately 0.000936.
