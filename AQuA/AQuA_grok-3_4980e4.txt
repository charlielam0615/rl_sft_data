**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to determine the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word "MATHEMATICS" such that all vowels appear together.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the vowels and consonants in "MATHEMATICS."  
2. Treat the vowels as a single "block" since they must stay together.  
3. Calculate the number of ways to arrange this block and the consonants.  
4. Compute the arrangements within the vowel block.  
5. Multiply the results to get the total number of distinct arrangements.  
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the vowels and consonants in "MATHEMATICS."  
How to Achieve: List all letters, then categorize them into vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (all others).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The word "MATHEMATICS" has 11 letters: M, A, T, H, E, M, A, T, I, C, S.  
- Vowels: A, A, E, I (4 vowels)  
- Consonants: M, M, T, T, H, C, S (7 consonants)  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals:  
1. Treat the 4 vowels (A, A, E, I) as a single "block."  
2. Count the total units to arrange: the vowel block + 7 consonants = 8 units.  
3. Calculate arrangements of these 8 units, accounting for repeated consonants (M, M, T, T).  
4. Calculate arrangements of the 4 vowels within the block, accounting for repeated vowels (A, A).  
5. Multiply the results for the final answer.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to arrange 8 units (vowel block + 7 consonants), accounting for repetitions.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for permutations of a multiset: n! / (n1! * n2! * ...), where n is the total items and n1, n2, etc., are the frequencies of repeated items. Here, total units = 8, with repetitions M (2), T (2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total units to arrange = 8 (1 vowel block, M, M, T, T, H, C, S).  
Repetitions: M appears 2 times, T appears 2 times, others (H, C, S, vowel block) appear 1 time each.  
Number of ways to arrange the 8 units = 8! / (2! * 2!)  
= 40,320 / (2 * 2)  
= 40,320 / 4  
= 10,080  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 4 vowels (A, A, E, I) within the block, accounting for repetitions.  
How to Achieve: Use the multiset permutation formula again. Here, total items = 4, with repetition A (2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Vowels to arrange: A, A, E, I (4 letters).  
Repetitions: A appears 2 times, E and I appear 1 time each.  
Number of ways to arrange the vowels = 4! / (2!)  
= 24 / 2  
= 12  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the total number of distinct arrangements by combining the results.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 8 units by the number of ways to arrange the vowels within the block.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total distinct arrangements = (Ways to arrange 8 units) * (Ways to arrange vowels within the block)  
= 10,080 * 12  
= 120,960

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of "MATHEMATICS" with vowels together.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify vowels and consonants. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Treat vowels as a single block, making 8 units to arrange. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate arrangements of 8 units, accounting for repetitions. (Completed: 10,080 ways)  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate arrangements of 4 vowels within the block. (Completed: 12 ways)  
  - Subgoal 5: Multiply results for the final answer. (Completed: 120,960)  
Current Goal: Confirm the final answer aligns with all steps.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the solution.  
How to Achieve: Check each step: vowel/consonant identification, permutation calculations for the 8 units, permutation calculations for the vowel block, and the final multiplication.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Step 1: Vowels (A, A, E, I) and consonants (M, M, T, T, H, C, S) correctly identified.  
- Step 2: 8 units (vowel block, M, M, T, T, H, C, S) arranged: 8! / (2! * 2!) = 10,080. Correct.  
- Step 3: Vowels within block (A, A, E, I) arranged: 4! / (2!) = 12. Correct.  
- Step 4: Total = 10,080 * 12 = 120,960. Multiplication is correct.  
The solution is valid.  
**Final Answer:** The number of different ways to arrange the letters of "MATHEMATICS" so that the vowels always come together is 120,960.
