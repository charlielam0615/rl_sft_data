**Problem Statement:**  
Little Texas Drilling Company has three wells producing oil at constant rates: Well A produces 1 barrel every 2 minutes, Well B produces 1 barrel every 3 minutes, and Well C produces 1 barrel every 4 minutes. We need to determine how many hours it takes for the three wells, working together, to produce 115 barrels of oil.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the production rate of each well in barrels per minute.  
2. Determine the combined production rate of all three wells.  
3. Use the combined rate to find the time (in minutes) to produce 115 barrels.  
4. Convert the time from minutes to hours.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the production rate of each well in barrels per minute.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the given production times (1 barrel every 2 minutes for Well A, 3 minutes for Well B, and 4 minutes for Well C) to compute the rate as the reciprocal of the time per barrel.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Well A: Produces 1 barrel every 2 minutes, so the rate is \( \frac{1}{2} \) barrels per minute.  
- Well B: Produces 1 barrel every 3 minutes, so the rate is \( \frac{1}{3} \) barrels per minute.  
- Well C: Produces 1 barrel every 4 minutes, so the rate is \( \frac{1}{4} \) barrels per minute.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine the combined production rate of all three wells.  
- **How to Achieve:** Sum the individual production rates of Well A, Well B, and Well C to find the total barrels produced per minute.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The combined production rate is:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \]  
To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 4 is 12.  
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12} \)  
- \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12} \)  
- \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \)  
So,  
\[ \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{6 + 4 + 3}{12} = \frac{13}{12} \]  
The combined rate is \( \frac{13}{12} \) barrels per minute.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Check the validity of the combined production rate.  
- **How to Achieve:** Verify the calculation of the combined rate by re-computing the sum and ensuring the fractions are correctly added.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the sum:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \]  
Using the common denominator 12:  
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12} \)  
- \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12} \)  
- \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \)  
\[ \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12} \]  
The calculation is consistent, confirming the combined rate of \( \frac{13}{12} \) barrels per minute is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the time in minutes to produce 115 barrels.  
- **How to Achieve:** Divide the total barrels (115) by the combined production rate (\( \frac{13}{12} \) barrels per minute) to find the time in minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time to produce 115 barrels:  
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total barrels}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{115}{\frac{13}{12}} = 115 \times \frac{12}{13} \]  
Compute:  
\[ 115 \div 13 \approx 8.846 \]  
\[ 115 \times \frac{12}{13} \approx 8.846 \times 12 \approx 106.152 \]  
So, the time is approximately 106.152 minutes.  
To be precise:  
\[ 115 \times \frac{12}{13} = \frac{115 \times 12}{13} = \frac{1380}{13} \]  
\[ \frac{1380}{13} = 106 + \frac{2}{13} \approx 106.1538 \text{ minutes} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Convert the time from minutes to hours.  
- **How to Achieve:** Divide the time in minutes (\( \frac{1380}{13} \)) by 60 to convert to hours, and express the result as a decimal for simplicity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time in minutes: \( \frac{1380}{13} \approx 106.1538 \).  
Convert to hours:  
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{\frac{1380}{13}}{60} = \frac{1380}{13 \times 60} = \frac{1380}{780} = \frac{138}{78} = \frac{23}{13} \]  
As a decimal:  
\[ \frac{23}{13} \approx 1.76923 \]  
So, it takes approximately 1.769 hours.

### Step 7: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the time in hours for the three wells to produce 115 barrels.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the production rate of each well (completed: Well A: \( \frac{1}{2} \), Well B: \( \frac{1}{3} \), Well C: \( \frac{1}{4} \) barrels per minute).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the combined production rate (completed: \( \frac{13}{12} \) barrels per minute).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the time in minutes to produce 115 barrels (completed: \( \frac{1380}{13} \approx 106.1538 \) minutes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Convert the time to hours (completed: \( \frac{23}{13} \approx 1.769 \) hours).  
**Current Goal:** Finalize the solution by confirming the result addresses the problem.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the final calculation by checking the time to produce 115 barrels using the combined rate.  
- **How to Achieve:** Multiply the combined rate by the calculated time to confirm it yields 115 barrels, and ensure the unit conversion to hours is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify:  
Combined rate = \( \frac{13}{12} \) barrels per minute.  
Time = \( \frac{1380}{13} \) minutes.  
Barrels produced:  
\[ \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = \frac{13}{12} \times \frac{1380}{13} = \frac{13 \times 1380}{12 \times 13} = \frac{1380}{12} = 115 \]  
This confirms the time produces exactly 115 barrels.  
Check hours conversion:  
\[ \frac{1380}{13} \div 60 = \frac{1380}{13 \times 60} = \frac{1380}{780} = \frac{23}{13} \approx 1.769 \text{ hours} \]  
The calculations are consistent.

### Final Answer  
It takes approximately 1.769 hours for the three wells to produce 115 barrels of oil.
