**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram and define variables based on the given relationship.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the standard formula for the area of a parallelogram and express the altitude in terms of the base as given in the problem.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula:  
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{altitude} \]  
Given:  
- Area = 288 m²  
- Altitude = 2 × base  

Let the base be \( b \) meters. Then, the altitude is \( 2b \) meters.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Set up an equation using the area formula and the relationship between base and altitude.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute the known values and the relationship into the area formula to create an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the area formula:  
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{altitude} \]  
Substitute the given values:  
\[ 288 = b \times 2b \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 288 = 2b^2 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the equation to find the base.  
- **How to Achieve:** Solve the quadratic equation \( 2b^2 = 288 \) for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the equation:  
\[ 2b^2 = 288 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ b^2 = 144 \]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[ b = \sqrt{144} = 12 \]  
Since the base is a length, we take the positive root: \( b = 12 \) meters.

**Step 5: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the solution by checking if the calculated base and corresponding altitude satisfy the given area.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( b = 12 \) into the expressions for base and altitude, compute the area, and confirm it equals 288 m².  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If the base \( b = 12 \) meters, then the altitude is:  
\[ 2b = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ meters} \]  
Calculate the area:  
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{altitude} = 12 \times 24 = 288 \text{ m}^2 \]  
This matches the given area of 288 m², confirming the solution is correct.
