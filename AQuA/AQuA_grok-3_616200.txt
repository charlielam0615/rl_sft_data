**Problem Statement**:  
The area of a square field is 3136 square meters. We need to calculate the cost of fencing the field with barbed wire at a rate of Rs. 1.50 per meter, with the wire placed 3 meters around the field (interpreted as 3 meters inside the boundary, forming a smaller square). Two gates, each 1 meter wide, are to be left unfenced. The task is to determine the total cost of the fencing.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the side length of the square field using the given area.  
2. Determine the perimeter of the inner square (3 meters inside the boundary).  
3. Adjust the perimeter to account for the two 1-meter-wide gates.  
4. Calculate the cost of fencing based on the adjusted perimeter and the rate of Rs. 1.50 per meter.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the side length of the square field.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the area of the square (3136 m²) to find the side length by taking the square root of the area.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area of a square is given by \( A = s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length.  
Given \( A = 3136 \, \text{m}^2 \), we calculate:  
\[ s = \sqrt{3136} \]  
Since \( 56^2 = 3136 \) (as \( 56 \times 56 = 3136 \)), the side length of the square field is:  
\[ s = 56 \, \text{meters} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the perimeter of the inner square (3 meters inside the boundary).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the barbed wire is placed 3 meters inside the boundary, the inner square has a side length reduced by 3 meters on each side (i.e., 6 meters total per side). Calculate the side length of the inner square and then its perimeter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The original side length of the square field is 56 meters. The inner square is 3 meters inside from each side, so the reduction is 3 meters from two opposite sides:  
\[ \text{Side length of inner square} = 56 - (3 + 3) = 56 - 6 = 50 \, \text{meters} \]  
The perimeter of a square is \( 4 \times \text{side length} \):  
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \, \text{meters} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the perimeter calculation for the inner square.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the side length reduction and perimeter calculation by rechecking the interpretation of "3 meters around" and ensuring the arithmetic is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The phrase "3 meters around the field" is interpreted as the barbed wire being placed 3 meters inside the boundary, forming a smaller square. The original side length is 56 meters, and moving 3 meters inward from each side reduces the side length by 6 meters (3 meters from each end), yielding 50 meters. The perimeter is:  
\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \, \text{meters} \]  
To confirm, if the interpretation was a 3-meter offset outside, it would increase the side length, but the context of fencing a field suggests an inner boundary. The calculation is consistent: \( 56 - 6 = 50 \), and \( 4 \times 50 = 200 \). The arithmetic is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Adjust the perimeter to account for the two 1-meter-wide gates.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the total width of the gates (2 meters) from the perimeter of the inner square to find the length of fencing required.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The perimeter of the inner square is 200 meters. There are two gates, each 1 meter wide, so the total unfenced length is:  
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \, \text{meters} \]  
The length to be fenced is:  
\[ 200 - 2 = 198 \, \text{meters} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total cost of fencing.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the fencing length (198 meters) by the cost per meter (Rs. 1.50) to find the total cost.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The length to be fenced is 198 meters, and the cost is Rs. 1.50 per meter. The total cost is:  
\[ \text{Total cost} = 198 \times 1.50 \]  
\[ 198 \times 1.5 = 198 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{198 \times 3}{2} = \frac{594}{2} = 297 \]  
So, the total cost is Rs. 297.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 2: Determine the perimeter of the inner square (completed: 200 meters).  
  - Subgoal 3: Adjust the perimeter for the two gates (completed: 198 meters).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the total cost (completed: Rs. 297).

The hierarchy reflects the completed steps, with the final cost calculated.

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the entire solution for accuracy.  
**How to Achieve**: Recheck all calculations from the side length to the final cost, ensuring consistency with the problem’s requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s verify each step:  
1. **Side length**: Area = 3136 m², so \( s = \sqrt{3136} = 56 \) meters (correct, as \( 56^2 = 3136 \)).  
2. **Inner square side length**: 3 meters inside from each side reduces the side by 6 meters: \( 56 - 6 = 50 \) meters.  
3. **Perimeter**: \( 4 \times 50 = 200 \) meters.  
4. **Adjust for gates**: Two 1-meter gates reduce the fencing by 2 meters: \( 200 - 2 = 198 \) meters.  
5. **Cost**: \( 198 \times 1.50 = 198 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{594}{2} = 297 \).  
The rate is Rs. 1.50 per meter, and units are consistent (meters and rupees). The interpretation of “3 meters around” as an inner square is reasonable, and all arithmetic checks out. The final cost is Rs. 297.

**Final Answer**:  
The total cost of fencing the field is Rs. 297.
