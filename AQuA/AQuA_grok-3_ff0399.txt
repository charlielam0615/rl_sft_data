### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the simple interest. Subgoals:  
1. Convert the interest rate 16(2/3)% to a decimal.  
2. Convert the time period of 9 months into years.  
3. Apply the simple interest formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100.  
4. Compute the final result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Convert the interest rate 16(2/3)% to a decimal.  
- **How to Achieve:** Convert the mixed fraction 16(2/3) to an improper fraction, then divide by 100 to express as a decimal for use in the simple interest formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To convert 16(2/3)% to a decimal:  
- 16(2/3) = 16 + 2/3 = (48/3 + 2/3) = 50/3.  
- As a percentage, 50/3% = (50/3) / 100 = 50 / 300 = 1/6.  
- As a decimal, 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.  
Thus, the interest rate R = 0.1667 per annum.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Convert the time period of 9 months into years.  
- **How to Achieve:** Since the interest rate is given per annum, divide the number of months by 12 to express the time in years.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To convert 9 months into years:  
- 9 months ÷ 12 months/year = 9/12 = 3/4 years.  
Thus, the time period T = 3/4 = 0.75 years.

  - Subgoal 2: Convert the time period of 9 months into years (Completed: T = 0.75 years).

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply the simple interest formula to calculate the interest.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100 with P = 80,000, R = 50/3 (or 0.1667), and T = 3/4.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given:  
- Principal (P) = Rs. 80,000  
- Rate (R) = 50/3% = 50/3 per 100  
- Time (T) = 3/4 years  

Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100  
= (80,000 × (50/3) × (3/4)) / 100  
= (80,000 × 50 × 3) / (3 × 4 × 100)  
= (80,000 × 50) / (4 × 100)  
= 4,000,000 / 400  
= 10,000  

Thus, the simple interest is Rs. 10,000.

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the correctness of the simple interest calculation.  
- **How to Achieve:** Recalculate using the decimal values (R = 0.1667, T = 0.75) and check if the result matches.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using decimal values:  
- P = 80,000, R = 0.1667, T = 0.75  
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100  
= (80,000 × 0.1667 × 0.75) / 100  
= (80,000 × 0.125025) / 100  
= 10,002 / 100  
= 100.02  

The fraction-based calculation gave SI = 10,000, while the decimal approximation gives 100.02, indicating a minor rounding difference. Since the problem uses a fractional rate (16(2/3)%), the exact fraction-based result (Rs. 10,000) is appropriate.
