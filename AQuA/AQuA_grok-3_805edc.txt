**Problem Restatement:**
Diana has 1/2 gallon of paint, and each statue requires 1/16 gallon of paint. We need to determine how many statues she can paint with the remaining paint.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the total amount of paint available.
2. Identify the amount of paint required per statue.
3. Calculate how many statues can be painted by dividing the total paint by the paint per statue.
4. Ensure the result is a whole number, as we can only paint complete statues.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Calculate the number of statues Diana can paint.
How to Achieve: Divide the total paint (1/2 gallon) by the paint required per statue (1/16 gallon) to find the number of statues. Since statues must be whole, take the integer part of the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of statues, perform the division:

\[
\frac{\text{Total paint}}{\text{Paint per statue}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{16}}
\]

Simplify the division:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{16}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{16}{1} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Since 8 is a whole number, Diana can paint 8 statues.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the calculation is correct.
How to Achieve: Check the division by multiplying the number of statues by the paint per statue to ensure it does not exceed the total paint available.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate by calculating the total paint used for 8 statues:

\[
8 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This equals the total paint available (1/2 gallon), confirming the calculation is correct. Additionally, check if 9 statues are possible:

\[
9 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{9}{16} = 0.5625
\]

Since 0.5625 gallons exceeds 0.5 gallons, 9 statues cannot be painted. Thus, 8 statues is the maximum whole number possible.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many statues Diana can paint.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total amount of paint available (1/2 gallon).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the amount of paint required per statue (1/16 gallon).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of statues by dividing total paint by paint per statue (completed: 8 statues).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (completed: 8 statues confirmed).

Current Goal: The calculation is complete, and the answer is 8 statues.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**
Diana can paint 8 statues with 1/2 gallon of paint, as each statue requires 1/16 gallon.
