### Problem Statement
We are given an operation defined by \( a * b = a - \frac{b}{a + b} \), for all numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \neq -b \). We need to find the value of \( t \) given the conditions that \( a \neq -t \) and \( a * t = 0 \).

Letâ€™s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( t \).  
1. Understand the operation \( a * b = a - \frac{b}{a + b} \) and the constraint \( a \neq -b \).  
2. Use the condition \( a * t = 0 \) to set up an equation.  
3. Apply the constraint \( a \neq -t \) to ensure the operation is defined.  
4. Solve for \( t \) using the equation from the operation.  
5. Verify the solution satisfies all given conditions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up the equation using the condition \( a * t = 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( t \) into the operation definition \( a * t = a - \frac{t}{a + t} \) and set it equal to 0, since \( a * t = 0 \). Ensure \( a \neq -t \) to keep the operation defined.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the operation definition, we have:
\[
a * t = a - \frac{t}{a + t}
\]
Given \( a * t = 0 \), set up the equation:
\[
a - \frac{t}{a + t} = 0
\]
Simplify:
\[
a = \frac{t}{a + t}
\]
This equation represents the condition where the operation \( a * t \) equals 0, and we need to solve for \( t \) while ensuring \( a \neq -t \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( a = \frac{t}{a + t} \) for \( t \).  
**How to Achieve**: Manipulate the equation algebraically to isolate \( t \), keeping in mind the constraint \( a \neq -t \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:
\[
a = \frac{t}{a + t}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( a + t \) (noting that \( a + t \neq 0 \), which is ensured by \( a \neq -t \)):
\[
a (a + t) = t
\]
Expand:
\[
a^2 + at = t
\]
Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[
a^2 + at - t = 0
\]
Factorize:
\[
a^2 + t(a - 1) = 0
\]
\[
t(a - 1) = -a^2
\]
Solve for \( t \):
\[
t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
Since \( a \neq 1 \) (to avoid division by zero), and we must ensure \( a \neq -t \), substitute \( t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) into the constraint:
\[
a \neq -\left(-\frac{a^2}{a - 1}\right) \implies a \neq \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
Simplify the constraint:
\[
a \neq \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
Multiply through by \( a - 1 \) (assuming \( a \neq 1 \)):
\[
a(a - 1) \neq a^2
\]
\[
a^2 - a \neq a^2
\]
\[
-a \neq 0 \implies a \neq 0
\]
Thus, \( a \neq 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \). The expression for \( t \) is:
\[
t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) satisfies \( a * t = 0 \) and the constraint \( a \neq -t \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) back into the operation \( a * t \) and check if it equals 0. Also, confirm that \( a \neq -t \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) into the operation:
\[
a * t = a - \frac{t}{a + t}
\]
Compute \( a + t \):
\[
a + t = a + \left(-\frac{a^2}{a - 1}\right) = a - \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
Find a common denominator:
\[
a = \frac{a(a - 1)}{a - 1}, \quad \text{so} \quad a - \frac{a^2}{a - 1} = \frac{a(a - 1) - a^2}{a - 1} = \frac{a^2 - a - a^2}{a - 1} = \frac{-a}{a - 1}
\]
Now compute \( \frac{t}{a + t} \):
\[
t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1}, \quad a + t = \frac{-a}{a - 1}
\]
\[
\frac{t}{a + t} = \frac{-\frac{a^2}{a - 1}}{\frac{-a}{a - 1}} = \frac{-a^2}{a - 1} \cdot \frac{a - 1}{-a} = \frac{-a^2}{-a} = a
\]
Now:
\[
a * t = a - \frac{t}{a + t} = a - a = 0
\]
This satisfies \( a * t = 0 \).  
Next, verify \( a \neq -t \):
\[
-t = -\left(-\frac{a^2}{a - 1}\right) = \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
Check:
\[
a \neq \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
As derived earlier, this holds when \( a \neq 0 \). Thus, the solution is valid for \( a \neq 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \), and satisfies \( a \neq -t \).

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( t \) such that \( a * t = 0 \) and \( a \neq -t \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the operation \( a * b = a - \frac{b}{a + b} \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation \( a * t = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve \( a - \frac{t}{a + t} = 0 \) for \( t \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution satisfies \( a * t = 0 \) and \( a \neq -t \).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution by stating the value of \( t \).  
The solution \( t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) has been derived and verified, with constraints \( a \neq 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \), and \( a \neq \frac{a^2}{a - 1} \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( t \) is:
\[
t = -\frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]
where \( a \neq 0 \), \( a \neq 1 \).
