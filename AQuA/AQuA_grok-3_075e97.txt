### Problem Statement
Two goods trains, each 500 meters long, are traveling in opposite directions on parallel tracks. The speed of the faster train is 45 km/hr, and the speed of the slower train is 30 km/hr. We need to determine the time taken for the slower train to completely pass the driver of the faster train.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train:
1. Determine the relative speed of the two trains.
2. Identify the distance that needs to be covered for the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train.
3. Calculate the time using the formula time = distance / speed.

**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Calculate the time taken for the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the relative speed of the two trains.
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the distance to be covered.
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the time using time = distance / speed.

**Current Goal:** Determine the relative speed of the two trains.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Determine the relative speed of the two trains.  
**How to Achieve:** Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, add their speeds to find the relative speed. Convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s for consistency with the distance unit (meters).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Convert speeds to meters per second:
- Faster train: 45 km/hr = \( 45 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 45 \times \frac{5}{18} = 12.5 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Slower train: 30 km/hr = \( 30 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 30 \times \frac{5}{18} = 8.333 \, \text{m/s} \)

Relative speed (trains moving in opposite directions) = \( 12.5 + 8.333 = 20.833 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the distance to be covered for the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train.  
**How to Achieve:** Interpret the phrase "the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one" as the time from when the front of the slower train meets the driver (front) of the faster train until the entire slower train (back end) has passed the driver. This distance is the length of the slower train.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The distance to be covered is the length of the slower train, which is 500 meters.

  - Subgoal 1: Determine the relative speed of the two trains (Completed: 20.833 m/s).

  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the time using time = distance / speed.

**Current Goal:** Calculate the time using time = distance / speed.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Calculate the time taken for the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train.  
**How to Achieve:** Use the formula time = distance / relative speed, with the distance (500 meters) and relative speed (20.833 m/s) from previous steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Time = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{500}{20.833} \approx 24 \, \text{seconds} \).

To ensure precision:
\[ 20.833 = \frac{75}{3.6} \text{ (since } 45 + 30 = 75 \text{ km/hr, and } \frac{75 \times 1000}{3600} = \frac{75}{3.6} \text{ m/s)} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{500}{\frac{75}{3.6}} = 500 \times \frac{3.6}{75} = \frac{500 \times 3.6}{75} = \frac{1800}{75} = 24 \, \text{seconds} \].

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify the calculated time.  
**How to Achieve:** Recalculate the time using an alternative approach or check units and logic to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach: Consider the problem from the perspective of the faster train’s driver. The slower train approaches at the relative speed (20.833 m/s), and the driver sees the 500-meter length of the slower train pass by. Time = \( \frac{500}{20.833} = 24 \, \text{seconds} \), confirming the calculation.

Unit check: Distance (meters) divided by speed (m/s) gives time in seconds, which is consistent. The interpretation that only the slower train’s length matters aligns with the problem’s phrasing, as the driver is a point of reference.

### Final Answer
The time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster train is 24 seconds.
