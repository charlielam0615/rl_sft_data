**Problem Statement:**
We need to find the number of university students who took only the mathematics course, given the following survey data:
- 64 students took mathematics (M).
- 94 students took computer science (C).
- 58 students took physics (P).
- 28 students took both mathematics and physics (M ∩ P).
- 26 students took both mathematics and computer science (M ∩ C).
- 22 students took both computer science and physics (C ∩ P).
- 14 students took all three courses (M ∩ C ∩ P).

We aim to calculate the number of students who took mathematics only, i.e., M − (M ∩ C) − (M ∩ P) + (M ∩ C ∩ P).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of students who took only the mathematics course.  
1. Understand the total number of students in the mathematics course and the overlaps with other courses.  
2. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a Venn diagram to isolate the number of students in the mathematics-only region.  
3. Calculate the number of students who took only mathematics by subtracting the students in overlapping regions from the total mathematics students.

### Step 2: Track Goals

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Find the number of students who took only the mathematics course.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Understand the total number of students in the mathematics course and the overlaps with other courses.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a Venn diagram to isolate the mathematics-only region.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the number of students who took only mathematics.  

**Current Goal**: Subgoal 1 – Understand the total number of students in the mathematics course and the overlaps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the total number of students in the mathematics course and the overlaps.  
**How to Achieve**: Interpret the given data and represent it using a Venn diagram framework to clarify the relationships between the sets (mathematics, computer science, physics) and their intersections.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The survey provides:  
- Total in mathematics, |M| = 64.  
- Total in computer science, |C| = 94.  
- Total in physics, |P| = 58.  
- Mathematics and physics, |M ∩ P| = 28.  
- Mathematics and computer science, |M ∩ C| = 26.  
- Computer science and physics, |C ∩ P| = 22.  
- All three courses, |M ∩ C ∩ P| = 14.  

To understand the overlaps, we can visualize this using a Venn diagram with three circles (M, C, P). The region for all three courses (M ∩ C ∩ P) is 14. The pairwise intersections (M ∩ P, M ∩ C, C ∩ P) include this triple overlap, so we need to account for it when isolating regions. For now, we note that the mathematics course total (64) includes:  
- Students taking only mathematics.  
- Students taking mathematics and computer science (including those also taking physics).  
- Students taking mathematics and physics (including those also taking computer science).  
- Students taking all three courses.

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to focus on calculating the mathematics-only region. Updated subgoals:  
1. Represent the mathematics course total in terms of exclusive regions using a Venn diagram.  
2. Calculate the number of students in the mathematics-only region by subtracting the appropriate overlaps from the total mathematics students.  
3. Validate the calculation to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Represent the mathematics course total in terms of exclusive regions using a Venn diagram.  
**How to Achieve**: Break down the total number of mathematics students (|M| = 64) into exclusive regions: mathematics only, mathematics and computer science only, mathematics and physics only, and all three courses.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using a Venn diagram for sets M, C, and P:  
- The region for all three courses (M ∩ C ∩ P) = 14.  
- The region for mathematics and computer science only (M ∩ C − M ∩ C ∩ P) = |M ∩ C| − |M ∩ C ∩ P| = 26 − 14 = 12.  
- The region for mathematics and physics only (M ∩ P − M ∩ C ∩ P) = |M ∩ P| − |M ∩ C ∩ P| = 28 − 14 = 14.  
- The total number of students in mathematics is:  
  |M| = (mathematics only) + (M ∩ C − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ P − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ C ∩ P).  
  So, 64 = (mathematics only) + 12 + 14 + 14.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of students in the mathematics-only region.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equation from the previous step to solve for the mathematics-only region by subtracting the known regions from the total mathematics students.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step:  
|M| = (mathematics only) + (M ∩ C − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ P − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ C ∩ P).  
64 = (mathematics only) + 12 + 14 + 14.  
Calculate the sum of the known regions:  
12 + 14 + 14 = 40.  
Now, solve for mathematics only:  
Mathematics only = 64 − 40 = 24.  
So, 24 students took only the mathematics course.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the calculation for the mathematics-only region.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify the calculation by checking the consistency of the Venn diagram regions and ensuring no overlaps are double-counted or missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, recompute the mathematics-only region using the inclusion-exclusion principle for the mathematics set:  
|M| = (mathematics only) + (M ∩ C − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ P − M ∩ C ∩ P) + (M ∩ C ∩ P).  
We have:  
- M ∩ C − M ∩ C ∩ P = 26 − 14 = 12.  
- M ∩ P − M ∩ C ∩ P = 28 − 14 = 14.  
- M ∩ C ∩ P = 14.  
Total students in overlapping regions: 12 + 14 + 14 = 40.  
Mathematics only = 64 − 40 = 24.  

Additionally, check the Venn diagram consistency:  
- Total in M = 64, which includes:  
  - Mathematics only = 24.  
  - M ∩ C only = 12.  
  - M ∩ P only = 14.  
  - M ∩ C ∩ P = 14.  
Sum: 24 + 12 + 14 + 14 = 64, which matches |M|.  

The calculation is consistent, confirming that 24 students took only the mathematics course.
