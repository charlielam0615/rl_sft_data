**Problem Statement:**  
Calculate the area of a triangle with side lengths \( a = 3 \, \text{m} \), \( b = 5 \, \text{m} \), and \( c = 10 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the area of a triangle given its side lengths, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Verify if the given side lengths form a valid triangle.  
2. Choose an appropriate method to calculate the area (e.g., Heron's formula, since only side lengths are provided).  
3. Compute the semi-perimeter.  
4. Apply Heron's formula to find the area.  
5. Present the final area with appropriate units.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify if the side lengths \( a = 3 \, \text{m} \), \( b = 5 \, \text{m} \), and \( c = 10 \, \text{m} \) form a valid triangle. This can be achieved by applying the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side for all combinations.

[IMP]  
Check the triangle inequality conditions:  
1. \( a + b > c \): \( 3 + 5 > 10 \), so \( 8 > 10 \), which is false.  
Since one condition fails, the side lengths \( 3 \, \text{m} \), \( 5 \, \text{m} \), and \( 10 \, \text{m} \) do not form a valid triangle. Therefore, the area cannot be calculated.

### Step 3

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Calculate the area of a triangle with sides \( a = 3 \, \text{m} \), \( b = 5 \, \text{m} \), \( c = 10 \, \text{m} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify if the side lengths form a valid triangle (completed, invalid triangle).  
  - Subgoal 2: Choose a method to calculate the area (not pursued due to invalid triangle).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the semi-perimeter (not pursued).  
  - Subgoal 4: Apply Heron's formula (not pursued).  
  - Subgoal 5: Present the final area (not pursued).  
**Current Goal:** Since the triangle is invalid, the goal is to conclude the problem by stating that no area can be calculated.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to conclude the problem by stating that the area cannot be calculated since the side lengths do not form a valid triangle. This can be achieved by summarizing the findings and providing a clear conclusion.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The side lengths \( a = 3 \, \text{m} \), \( b = 5 \, \text{m} \), and \( c = 10 \, \text{m} \) do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (\( 3 + 5 \not> 10 \)). Therefore, a triangle with these side lengths cannot exist, and the area cannot be calculated.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**  
The side lengths \( 3 \, \text{m} \), \( 5 \, \text{m} \), and \( 10 \, \text{m} \) do not form a valid triangle, so the area cannot be calculated.
