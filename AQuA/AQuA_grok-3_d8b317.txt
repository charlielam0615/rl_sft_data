**Problem Statement**: Find the principal amount for a sum of money that, at an interest rate of 5% per annum, results in a total amount of Rs. 1120 after 2 2/5 years. The problem does not specify whether the interest is simple or compound; however, since itâ€™s a common practice in such problems to assume simple interest unless stated otherwise, we will proceed with simple interest and adjust if necessary.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the principal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for simple interest to relate the principal, interest rate, time, and amount.  
2. Convert the time period (2 2/5 years) into a suitable format for calculations.  
3. Rearrange the formula to solve for the principal.  
4. Substitute the given values and compute the principal.  
5. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for simple interest and express the amount in terms of the principal. The simple interest formula is \( I = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} \), where \( P \) is the principal, \( R \) is the rate, and \( T \) is the time in years. The total amount is given by \( A = P + I \). We will combine these to express \( A \) in terms of \( P \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the simple interest formula:  
\[ I = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} \]  
The amount is:  
\[ A = P + I = P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} = P \left(1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100}\right) \]  
This formula will allow us to solve for \( P \) given \( A \), \( R \), and \( T \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the time period of 2 2/5 years into a decimal form suitable for the formula. We will express 2 2/5 as a decimal to use in calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Convert 2 2/5 years:  
\[ 2 \frac{2}{5} = 2 + \frac{2}{5} = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 \text{ years} \]  
So, the time \( T = 2.4 \) years.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rearrange the amount formula to solve for the principal \( P \). Using \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100}\right) \), solve for \( P \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The amount formula is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100}\right) \]  
Rearrange to solve for \( P \):  
\[ P = \frac{A}{1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100}} \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute the given values (\( A = 1120 \), \( R = 5 \), \( T = 2.4 \)) into the formula \( P = \frac{A}{1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100}} \) and compute the principal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute the values:  
\[ R = 5, \ T = 2.4, \ A = 1120 \]  
Calculate the denominator:  
\[ \frac{R \cdot T}{100} = \frac{5 \cdot 2.4}{100} = \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \]  
\[ 1 + \frac{R \cdot T}{100} = 1 + 0.12 = 1.12 \]  
Now compute \( P \):  
\[ P = \frac{1120}{1.12} \]  
Perform the division:  
\[ 1120 \div 1.12 = 1120 \cdot \frac{100}{112} = \frac{1120 \cdot 100}{112} = \frac{112000}{112} = 1000 \]  
So, the principal \( P = 1000 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculated principal by computing the amount using the simple interest formula and checking if it matches Rs. 1120.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( P = 1000 \), \( R = 5 \), \( T = 2.4 \):  
Calculate interest:  
\[ I = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} = \frac{1000 \cdot 5 \cdot 2.4}{100} = \frac{1000 \cdot 12}{100} = 120 \]  
Calculate amount:  
\[ A = P + I = 1000 + 120 = 1120 \]  
The calculated amount matches the given amount of Rs. 1120, confirming the solution is correct.
