### Problem Statement
We need to determine the cost of 20 paper plates and 40 paper cups, given that 100 paper plates and 200 paper cups cost $7.50, with the rates (prices per plate and per cup) remaining the same.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups.  
- Subgoal 1: Define variables for the cost per plate and per cup.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up an equation based on the given total cost of 100 plates and 200 cups.  
- Subgoal 3: Determine the relationship between the quantities in the given problem and the target problem (20 plates and 40 cups).  
- Subgoal 4: Solve for the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups using the relationship.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up an equation for the given total cost (100 plates and 200 cups cost $7.50). This will be achieved by assigning variables to the cost per plate and per cup and forming an equation based on the given information.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( p \) be the cost per plate (in dollars), and \( c \) be the cost per cup (in dollars).  
From the problem, 100 plates and 200 cups cost $7.50, so we can write the equation:  
\[ 100p + 200c = 7.50 \]  
This equation represents the total cost based on the given quantities and will be used to find the relationship between \( p \) and \( c \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Continue breaking down the problem to determine how to use the given equation to find the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups.  
- Observe that the target quantities (20 plates and 40 cups) are exactly \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the given quantities (100 plates and 200 cups), since \( \frac{20}{100} = \frac{40}{200} = \frac{1}{5} \).  
- Subgoal: Use the proportional relationship to calculate the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups by scaling the total cost.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups using the proportional relationship. Since 20 plates and 40 cups are \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 100 plates and 200 cups, the cost will be \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $7.50. This will be achieved by performing the calculation directly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since 20 plates and 40 cups are \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 100 plates and 200 cups, and the total cost of 100 plates and 200 cups is $7.50, the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups is:  
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 7.50 = 1.50 \]  
Thus, the total cost is $1.50.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated cost of $1.50 for 20 plates and 40 cups. This will be achieved by setting up the cost equation for 20 plates and 40 cups using the variables from Step 2 and checking if the proportional method is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the variables from Step 2, the cost for 20 plates and 40 cups is:  
\[ 20p + 40c \]  
Notice that:  
\[ 20p + 40c = \frac{1}{5} \times (100p + 200c) = \frac{1}{5} \times 7.50 = 1.50 \]  
This matches the result from Step 4, confirming that the cost of 20 plates and 40 cups is $1.50.  
Alternatively, simplify the original equation \( 100p + 200c = 7.50 \):  
\[ 100p + 200c = 7.50 \implies p + 2c = 0.075 \] (dividing by 100).  
Then, for 20 plates and 40 cups:  
\[ 20p + 40c = 20(p + 2c) = 20 \times 0.075 = 1.50 \]  
Both methods yield the same result, validating the solution.
