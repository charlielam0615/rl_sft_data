### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability \( Q \) that the sum of the numbers \( a \) and \( b \), obtained from rolling a fair six-sided cube (with sides numbered 1 through 6) twice, is a prime number. Each roll has an equal probability of landing on any number from 1 to 6.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

To solve the problem, we break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the cube twice.
2. Identify all possible sums of the two rolls.
3. Determine which sums are prime numbers.
4. Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is prime.
5. Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the cube twice.

**How to Achieve**: Since the cube has 6 sides and is rolled twice, each roll is independent, and the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes per roll.

[IMP]
Each roll of the cube can result in any of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so there are 6 possibilities per roll. For two rolls, the total number of outcomes is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Thus, there are 36 possible outcomes for the pair \((a, b)\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Identify all possible sums of the two rolls and determine which are prime.

**How to Achieve**: List all possible sums by considering each combination of \((a, b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) range from 1 to 6, and identify which sums are prime numbers (a number greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself).

[IMP]
The possible sums range from \(1+1=2\) to \(6+6=12\). The sums are:

- \(a + b = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\)

Next, identify which of these are prime numbers. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself. Checking each:

- 2: Prime (divisible only by 1 and 2).
- 3: Prime (divisible only by 1 and 3).
- 4: Not prime (\(4 = 2 \times 2\)).
- 5: Prime (divisible only by 1 and 5).
- 6: Not prime (\(6 = 2 \times 3\)).
- 7: Prime (divisible only by 1 and 7).
- 8: Not prime (\(8 = 2 \times 4\)).
- 9: Not prime (\(9 = 3 \times 3\)).
- 10: Not prime (\(10 = 2 \times 5\)).
- 11: Prime (divisible only by 1 and 11).
- 12: Not prime (\(12 = 2 \times 6\)).

The prime sums are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum \(a + b\) is prime.

**How to Achieve**: For each prime sum (2, 3, 5, 7, 11), list the pairs \((a, b)\) that produce that sum and count them.

[IMP]
List the pairs \((a, b)\) for each prime sum:

- **Sum = 2**: \(1+1 = 2\). Pair: \((1, 1)\). Count: 1.
- **Sum = 3**: \(1+2 = 3\), \(2+1 = 3\). Pairs: \((1, 2), (2, 1)\). Count: 2.
- **Sum = 5**: \(1+4 = 5\), \(2+3 = 5\), \(3+2 = 5\), \(4+1 = 5\). Pairs: \((1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)\). Count: 4.
- **Sum = 7**: \(1+6 = 7\), \(2+5 = 7\), \(3+4 = 7\), \(4+3 = 7\), \(5+2 = 7\), \(6+1 = 7\). Pairs: \((1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)\). Count: 6.
- **Sum = 11**: \(5+6 = 11\), \(6+5 = 11\). Pairs: \((5, 6), (6, 5)\). Count: 2.

Total favorable outcomes:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Verify the number of outcomes where the sum is prime.

**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the number of favorable outcomes using an alternative method, such as enumerating all pairs systematically, to ensure correctness.

[IMP]
To validate, consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a, b \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and check their sums:

- For \(a = 1\): Pairs \((1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6)\). Sums: 2, 3, 5, 7 (all prime). Count: 4.
- For \(a = 2\): Pairs \((2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)\). Sums: 3, 5, 7 (all prime). Count: 3.
- For \(a = 3\): Pairs \((3, 2), (3, 4)\). Sums: 5, 7 (all prime). Count: 2.
- For \(a = 4\): Pairs \((4, 1), (4, 3)\). Sums: 5, 7 (all prime). Count: 2.
- For \(a = 5\): Pairs \((5, 2), (5, 6)\). Sums: 7, 11 (all prime). Count: 2.
- For \(a = 6\): Pair \((6, 1), (6, 5)\). Sums: 7, 11 (all prime). Count: 2.

Total: \(4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15\).

This matches the previous count, confirming 15 favorable outcomes.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability \( Q \) that the sum is prime.

**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

[IMP]
Total outcomes: 36 (from Step 2).
Favorable outcomes: 15 (from Steps 4 and 5).

The probability \( Q \) is:

\[ Q = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12} \]

The fraction is already in its simplest form (15 and 36 share a common factor of 3, so \(15 \div 3 = 5\), \(36 \div 3 = 12\)).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability \( Q \) that the sum of two rolls is prime.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total outcomes (completed: 36 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify possible sums and prime sums (completed: primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate favorable outcomes (completed: 15 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute probability (completed: \( Q = \frac{5}{12} \)).
  - Subgoal 5: Validate calculations (completed: confirmed 15 favorable outcomes).

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.

All subgoals have been addressed, and the solution is complete.

### Final Answer
The probability \( Q \) that the sum of the numbers from two rolls of a six-sided cube is prime is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{5}{12}} \]
