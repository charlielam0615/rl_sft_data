Let’s solve the math problem: A fort has food provisions for 150 men for 45 days. After 15 days, 25 men leave the fort. We need to determine how many days the remaining food will last for the remaining men, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step.

### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the number of days the remaining food will last after 25 men leave the fort, given that the food initially supports 150 men for 45 days, and 15 days have already passed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Calculate the total amount of food in terms of man-days.  
2. Determine the food consumed in the first 15 days by 150 men.  
3. Calculate the remaining food after 15 days.  
4. Determine the number of men remaining after 25 leave.  
5. Calculate how many days the remaining food will last for the remaining men.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total amount of food in man-days. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of men (150) by the number of days the food lasts (45).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total food is calculated as:  
Total food = 150 men × 45 days = 6,750 man-days.  
This means the fort has enough food to sustain 6,750 man-days of consumption.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the food consumed in the first 15 days by 150 men. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of men (150) by the number of days (15).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Food consumed = 150 men × 15 days = 2,250 man-days.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the remaining food after 15 days. This can be achieved by subtracting the food consumed (2,250 man-days) from the total food (6,750 man-days).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remaining food = Total food - Food consumed = 6,750 man-days - 2,250 man-days = 4,500 man-days.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of men remaining after 25 leave the fort. This can be achieved by subtracting 25 from the initial 150 men.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remaining men = 150 men - 25 men = 125 men.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate how many days the remaining food (4,500 man-days) will last for the remaining 125 men. This can be achieved by dividing the remaining food by the number of remaining men.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Days remaining = Remaining food ÷ Remaining men = 4,500 man-days ÷ 125 men = 36 days.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the solution by verifying the calculations and ensuring the logic aligns with the problem. This can be achieved by recomputing key steps and checking for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s verify:  
- Total food: 150 × 45 = 6,750 man-days (correct).  
- Food consumed: 150 × 15 = 2,250 man-days (correct).  
- Remaining food: 6,750 - 2,250 = 4,500 man-days (correct).  
- Remaining men: 150 - 25 = 125 men (correct).  
- Days remaining: 4,500 ÷ 125 = 36 days (correct, as 4,500 ÷ 125 = 36).  
Alternatively, we can check using food consumption rates:  
- Each man consumes 1 man-day of food per day.  
- For 125 men, 4,500 man-days last 4,500 ÷ 125 = 36 days.  
The calculations are consistent, and the logic (total food in man-days, subtracting consumed food, and dividing by remaining men) aligns with the problem’s requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the number of days the remaining food will last after 25 men leave the fort.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total food (6,750 man-days).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate food consumed in 15 days (2,250 man-days).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate remaining food (4,500 man-days).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine remaining men (125 men).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate days the remaining food lasts (36 days).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the solution (confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution and finalize the answer, as all subgoals have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the answer by summarizing key information related to the number of days the remaining food will last. Retrieve relevant results from previous steps, focusing on the final calculation and validation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- Total food: 6,750 man-days (Step 2).  
- Food consumed in 15 days: 2,250 man-days (Step 3).  
- Remaining food: 4,500 man-days (Step 4).  
- Remaining men: 125 (Step 5).  
- Days remaining: 4,500 ÷ 125 = 36 days (Step 6).  
- Validation confirmed the calculations are correct (Step 7).  
The remaining food will last 36 days for the 125 men.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The remaining food will last for **36 days**.
