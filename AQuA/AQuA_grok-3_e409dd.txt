### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the average age of a cricket team consisting of 11 players. The captain is 26 years old, and the wicket keeper is 3 years older, so 29 years old. The average age of the remaining 9 players is one year less than the average age of the entire team. We are tasked with finding the average age of the whole team.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the average age of the team.  
- Subgoal 1: Define variables for the unknown quantities, such as the total sum of ages and the average age of the team.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up an equation based on the given information about the average age of the remaining players.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find the average age of the team.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies all conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define variables and set up the equation for the average age of the team.  
**How to Achieve**: Assign a variable for the average age of the team, calculate the total sum of ages, express the ages of the remaining players, and use the given condition about the average of the remaining players to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the average age of the entire team be \( A \) years.  
- Total number of players: 11  
- Captain’s age: 26 years  
- Wicket keeper’s age: \( 26 + 3 = 29 \) years  
- Total sum of ages of the team: \( 11A \)  
- Sum of ages of the captain and wicket keeper: \( 26 + 29 = 55 \)  
- Sum of ages of the remaining 9 players: \( 11A - 55 \)  
- Average age of the remaining 9 players: \( \frac{11A - 55}{9} \)  
- Given condition: The average age of the remaining 9 players is one year less than the team’s average, so:  
  \[
  \frac{11A - 55}{9} = A - 1
  \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation to find the average age of the team.  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the equation \( \frac{11A - 55}{9} = A - 1 \) for \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:  
\[
\frac{11A - 55}{9} = A - 1
\]  
Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the denominator:  
\[
11A - 55 = 9(A - 1)
\]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
11A - 55 = 9A - 9
\]  
Subtract \( 9A \) from both sides:  
\[
11A - 9A - 55 = -9
\]  
\[
2A - 55 = -9
\]  
Add 55 to both sides:  
\[
2A = 46
\]  
Divide by 2:  
\[
A = 23
\]  
So, the average age of the team is 23 years.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the average age of 23 years satisfies the problem’s conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the total sum of ages, the sum of the remaining players’ ages, and their average, then check if it is one year less than the team’s average.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Team’s average age: \( A = 23 \) years  
- Total sum of ages: \( 11 \times 23 = 253 \)  
- Sum of captain’s and wicket keeper’s ages: \( 26 + 29 = 55 \)  
- Sum of ages of the remaining 9 players: \( 253 - 55 = 198 \)  
- Average age of the remaining 9 players: \( \frac{198}{9} = 22 \)  
- Check the condition: The average age of the remaining players (22) should be one year less than the team’s average (23).  
  \[
  23 - 1 = 22
  \]  
The condition holds true, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the average age of the cricket team.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for the average age and set up the equation (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation to find the average age (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all subgoals are addressed.  
The average age of the team, 23 years, has been calculated and verified, completing all subgoals.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The average age of the cricket team is 23 years.
