**Problem Statement**: We need to solve the equation \( 5^z \times 5^y = (125)^4 \) and find two values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy it, such that the product equals \( (125)^4 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
1. Simplify the equation by expressing all terms with the same base.  
2. Equate the exponents to form a relationship between \( z \) and \( y \).  
3. Identify two values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation by expressing all terms with the same base.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite \( 125 \) as a power of 5, then simplify the equation using exponent rules.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), we can rewrite \( (125)^4 \) as:  
\[ (125)^4 = (5^3)^4 = 5^{3 \times 4} = 5^{12} \].  
The left side of the equation is \( 5^z \times 5^y \). Using the exponent rule \( a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \), this becomes:  
\[ 5^z \times 5^y = 5^{z+y} \].  
Thus, the equation \( 5^z \times 5^y = (125)^4 \) simplifies to:  
\[ 5^{z+y} = 5^{12} \].  
Since the bases are the same, we equate the exponents:  
\[ z + y = 12 \].

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( 5^z \times 5^y = (125)^4 \) for two values of \( z \) and \( y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by expressing all terms with the same base (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate the exponents to form a relationship between \( z \) and \( y \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify two values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Identify two values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( z + y = 12 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify two values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( z + y = 12 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( z + y = 12 \) is a linear equation with two variables, find any pair of values for \( z \) and \( y \) that satisfy it, as the problem asks for "two values."  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation \( z + y = 12 \) has infinitely many solutions. To provide two specific values, we can choose simple integers. For example:  
- Let \( z = 6 \). Then \( y = 12 - 6 = 6 \).  
Thus, one pair of values is \( z = 6 \), \( y = 6 \).  
To verify:  
\[ 5^6 \times 5^6 = 5^{6+6} = 5^{12} \], and since \( (125)^4 = 5^{12} \), the equation holds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the values \( z = 6 \), \( y = 6 \) satisfy the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( z = 6 \), \( y = 6 \) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( z = 6 \), \( y = 6 \) into \( 5^z \times 5^y \):  
\[ 5^6 \times 5^6 = 5^{6+6} = 5^{12} \].  
The right side is:  
\[ (125)^4 = (5^3)^4 = 5^{12} \].  
Since \( 5^{12} = 5^{12} \), the values \( z = 6 \), \( y = 6 \) satisfy the equation.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The two values that satisfy \( 5^z \times 5^y = (125)^4 \) are \( z = 6 \) and \( y = 6 \).  
\[ \boxed{z = 6, \, y = 6} \]
