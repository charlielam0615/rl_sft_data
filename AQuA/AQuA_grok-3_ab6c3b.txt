**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into manageable subgoals to calculate the number of ways to form 4 teams of 2 people each from 8 people. Subgoals:  
1. Understand the problem structure (e.g., whether teams are distinct or indistinguishable).  
2. Choose a method to form pairs (e.g., combinations).  
3. Account for the arrangement of pairs into teams.  
4. Compute the final number of ways.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand the problem structure to determine if teams are distinct or indistinguishable.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the problem context. In combinatorics, when dividing people into teams of equal size without labels (e.g., "Team A" vs. "Team B"), teams are typically indistinguishable unless specified. Assume teams are indistinguishable for now, as no labels are mentioned.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the problem does not specify team names or roles, treat the teams as indistinguishable. This means the order of teams does not matter (e.g., pairing {A,B}, {C,D}, {E,F}, {G,H} is the same as {C,D}, {A,B}, {G,H}, {E,F}). We need to form 4 pairs from 8 people and account for indistinguishability.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to form 4 pairs from 8 people.  
**How to Achieve**: Use combinations to select pairs and adjust for the indistinguishability of teams.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To form 4 pairs from 8 people:  
1. Choose 2 people for the first pair: C(8,2) = (8×7)/2 = 28 ways.  
2. Choose 2 people for the second pair from the remaining 6: C(6,2) = (6×5)/2 = 15 ways.  
3. Choose 2 people for the third pair from the remaining 4: C(4,2) = (4×3)/2 = 6 ways.  
4. Choose 2 people for the fourth pair from the remaining 2: C(2,2) = 1 way.  
Total ways to choose pairs in order: 28 × 15 × 6 × 1 = 2520.  
Since the teams are indistinguishable, divide by the number of ways to arrange 4 teams: 4! = 24.  
Thus, number of ways = 2520 / 24 = 105.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation for accuracy.  
**How to Achieve**: Use an alternative method to compute the number of ways and compare results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alternative method: Use the formula for partitioning n people into k indistinguishable pairs. For n=8 people into k=4 pairs, the number of ways is given by the double factorial (2k-1)!!, adjusted for pairing:  
Number of ways = C(8,2) × C(6,2) × C(4,2) × C(2,2) / 4! = (8! / (2^4 × 4!)) / 4! = (8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1) / (16 × 24) / 24 = 40320 / 384 / 24 = 105.  
This matches the previous result (105), confirming correctness.
