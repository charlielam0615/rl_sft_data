**Problem Statement:** Two mechanics work on a car. The first mechanic can complete the job in 6 hours, and the new mechanic takes 10 hours. They work together for 2 hours, after which the first mechanic leaves, and the new mechanic continues alone. Determine how long it takes the new mechanic to finish the job.

---

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the time the new mechanic takes to finish the job.  
1. Calculate the work rates of both mechanics.  
2. Determine the work completed when they work together for 2 hours.  
3. Calculate the remaining work.  
4. Determine the time for the new mechanic to complete the remaining work alone.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the work rates of both mechanics.  
How to Achieve: The work rate is the fraction of the job completed per hour, calculated as the inverse of the time to complete the job alone.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first mechanic completes the job in 6 hours, so their work rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) job per hour.  
The new mechanic completes the job in 10 hours, so their work rate is \( \frac{1}{10} \) job per hour.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the work completed when both mechanics work together for 2 hours.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the combined work rate by the time they work together (2 hours).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Combined work rate: \( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{30} + \frac{3}{30} = \frac{8}{30} = \frac{4}{15} \) job per hour.  
Work done in 2 hours: \( \frac{4}{15} \times 2 = \frac{8}{15} \) of the job.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the remaining work after the first 2 hours.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the work completed from the total job (1 job).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total job = 1.  
Work remaining: \( 1 - \frac{8}{15} = \frac{15}{15} - \frac{8}{15} = \frac{7}{15} \) of the job.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the time for the new mechanic to complete the remaining work alone.  
How to Achieve: Divide the remaining work by the new mechanic’s work rate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
New mechanic’s work rate: \( \frac{1}{10} \) job per hour.  
Remaining work: \( \frac{7}{15} \).  
Time required: \( \frac{\frac{7}{15}}{\frac{1}{10}} = \frac{7}{15} \times 10 = \frac{70}{15} = \frac{14}{3} \) hours.  
Convert to mixed number: \( \frac{14}{3} = 4 \frac{2}{3} \) hours, or approximately 4 hours and 40 minutes (since \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) minutes).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking the total work and time.  
How to Achieve: Ensure the total work equals 1 job and the timelines are consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Work done together: \( \frac{8}{15} \).  
Work done by new mechanic: \( \frac{7}{15} \).  
Total work: \( \frac{8}{15} + \frac{7}{15} = 1 \), which matches the total job.  
Time check: Together for 2 hours, new mechanic alone for \( \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \) hours. Total time: \( 2 + 4.67 = 6.67 \) hours.  
Cross-check: First mechanic’s contribution: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \). New mechanic’s contribution: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{10} + \frac{14}{3} \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} + \frac{14}{30} = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{14}{30} = \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3} \).  
Total work: \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 1 \), which is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the time for the new mechanic to finish the job.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate work rates (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute work done in 2 hours together (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate remaining work (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute time for new mechanic to finish remaining work (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate solution (completed).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution is complete with the new mechanic taking \( \frac{14}{3} \) hours (or \( 4 \frac{2}{3} \) hours) to finish the job alone after the first 2 hours.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer:** The new mechanic will take \( 4 \frac{2}{3} \) hours, or approximately 4 hours and 40 minutes, to finish the car alone after the first 2 hours of working together.
