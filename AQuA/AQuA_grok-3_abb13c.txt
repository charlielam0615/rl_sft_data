### Problem Statement
Cars P and Q are approaching each other on the same highway. Car P moves northbound at 47 mph, and Car Q moves southbound at 53 mph. At 2:00 pm, they are 190 miles apart and approaching each other. We need to determine the clock time when they are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the time when the cars pass each other (distance = 0).  
2. Determine the time after passing when the cars are 35 miles apart while moving away.  
3. Convert the total time elapsed from 2:00 pm to find the clock time.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time when the cars pass each other (distance = 0).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the cars are approaching each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds (47 mph + 53 mph = 100 mph). Use the formula distance = speed × time to find the time it takes for the distance between them to become zero, starting from 190 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The cars are approaching at a relative speed of 47 + 53 = 100 mph.  
Initial distance = 190 miles.  
Time to meet = distance ÷ relative speed = 190 ÷ 100 = 1.9 hours.  
Convert 1.9 hours to hours and minutes: 1.9 hours = 1 hour + 0.9 × 60 minutes = 1 hour 54 minutes.  
Starting at 2:00 pm, add 1 hour 54 minutes:  
2:00 pm + 1 hour = 3:00 pm.  
3:00 pm + 54 minutes = 3:54 pm.  
The cars pass each other at 3:54 pm.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals based on the previous step:  
1. (Completed) Calculate the time when the cars pass each other (3:54 pm).  
2. Calculate the time after 3:54 pm when the cars are 35 miles apart while moving away.  
3. Convert the total time from 2:00 pm to the clock time when the distance is 35 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time after 3:54 pm when the cars are 35 miles apart while moving away.  
**How to Achieve**: After passing, the cars move in opposite directions, so their relative speed remains 100 mph. Use the formula distance = speed × time to find the time it takes for the distance to increase from 0 to 35 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After passing at 3:54 pm, the cars move away at a relative speed of 100 mph.  
Distance = 35 miles.  
Time to reach 35 miles = distance ÷ relative speed = 35 ÷ 100 = 0.35 hours.  
Convert 0.35 hours to minutes: 0.35 × 60 = 21 minutes.  
Add 21 minutes to 3:54 pm:  
3:54 pm + 21 minutes = 4:15 pm.  
The cars are 35 miles apart at 4:15 pm.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that at 4:15 pm, the cars are 35 miles apart and moving away.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the positions of both cars at 4:15 pm relative to their meeting point at 3:54 pm to confirm the distance and direction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time from 3:54 pm to 4:15 pm = 21 minutes = 21/60 = 0.35 hours.  
- Car P (northbound at 47 mph): Distance traveled = 47 × 0.35 = 16.45 miles north of the meeting point.  
- Car Q (southbound at 53 mph): Distance traveled = 53 × 0.35 = 18.55 miles south of the meeting point.  
Total distance between them = 16.45 + 18.55 = 35 miles.  
Since Car P is north and Car Q is south of the meeting point, they are moving away from each other.  
The calculation confirms they are 35 miles apart at 4:15 pm.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the clock time when the cars are moving away and 35 miles apart.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the time when the cars pass each other (Completed: 3:54 pm).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time after passing when the cars are 35 miles apart (Completed: 4:15 pm).  
  - Subgoal 3: Convert the total time from 2:00 pm to the clock time (Completed in Subgoal 2).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer aligns with the main goal.  
The calculations show the cars are 35 miles apart and moving away at 4:15 pm, fulfilling the main goal.

### Final Answer
The cars are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart at 4:15 pm.
