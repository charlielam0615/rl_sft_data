### Problem Statement
We need to find the average of \( b \) and \( c \), given that the average of \( a \) and \( b \) is 160, and \( c - a = 200 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the given conditions as equations.  
2. Use the equations to find relationships between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
3. Compute the average of \( b \) and \( c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the given conditions as equations. We will translate the problem's statements into mathematical form to establish relationships between the variables.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The average of \( a \) and \( b \) is 160, so:  
\[
\frac{a + b}{2} = 160 \implies a + b = 320
\]
The second condition is \( c - a = 200 \), which gives:  
\[
c = a + 200
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the average of \( b \) and \( c \). We will use the equations \( a + b = 320 \) and \( c = a + 200 \) to express the average of \( b \) and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The average of \( b \) and \( c \) is:  
\[
\frac{b + c}{2}
\]
From the previous step, we have \( c = a + 200 \). Substitute this into the average:  
\[
\frac{b + (a + 200)}{2} = \frac{a + b + 200}{2}
\]
Since \( a + b = 320 \), substitute this in:  
\[
\frac{320 + 200}{2} = \frac{520}{2} = 260
\]
Thus, the average of \( b \) and \( c \) is 260.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the computed average satisfies the given conditions. We will assume values for the variables and verify consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume \( a = 100 \). Then:  
- From \( a + b = 320 \), we get \( b = 320 - 100 = 220 \).  
- From \( c = a + 200 \), we get \( c = 100 + 200 = 300 \).  
- Check the average of \( a \) and \( b \):  
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{100 + 220}{2} = \frac{320}{2} = 160
  \]
  This satisfies the first condition.  
- Check \( c - a \):  
  \[
  c - a = 300 - 100 = 200
  \]
  This satisfies the second condition.  
- Compute the average of \( b \) and \( c \):  
  \[
  \frac{b + c}{2} = \frac{220 + 300}{2} = \frac{520}{2} = 260
  \]
The computed average matches our result, confirming the solution is consistent.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the average of \( b \) and \( c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the given conditions as equations (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the equations to compute the average of \( b \) and \( c \) (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 4).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as we have computed and validated the average of \( b \) and \( c \) to be 260. No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The average of \( b \) and \( c \) is 260.
