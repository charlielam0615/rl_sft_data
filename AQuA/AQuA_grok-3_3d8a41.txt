**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the area of a triangle given its base of 10 meters and height of 5 meters.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the area of a triangle, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the formula for the area of a triangle.
2. Substitute the given values into the formula.
3. Perform the calculation to find the area.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the formula for the area of a triangle.
How to Achieve: Recall the standard formula for the area of a triangle, which is based on its base and height.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The formula for the area of a triangle is \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Substitute the given values into the formula.
How to Achieve: Use the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \), and plug in the given values: base = 10 meters, height = 5 meters.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \, \text{m} \times 5 \, \text{m} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Perform the calculation to find the area.
How to Achieve: Calculate the expression \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 \) to determine the area in square meters.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Calculate:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \, \text{square meters} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculated area.
How to Achieve: Verify the calculation steps and ensure the formula was applied correctly with the given values.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Verify the steps:
- Formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \)
- Given: base = 10 m, height = 5 m
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 = 25 \, \text{m}^2 \)
The formula was applied correctly, and the arithmetic is accurate: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \), and \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \). The unit (square meters) is consistent with an area measurement.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the area of a triangle with base 10 m and height 5 m.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the formula for the area of a triangle (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute the given values into the formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Perform the calculation to find the area (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.
The calculated area is 25 square meters.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square meters.
