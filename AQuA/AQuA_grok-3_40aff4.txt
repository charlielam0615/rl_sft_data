### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many additional flights, after the first late flight and three subsequent on-time flights, must depart on-time from Phoenix airport to achieve an on-time departure rate greater than 70%.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the on-time departure rate mathematically.  
2. Model the given scenario (one late flight, three on-time flights, and additional on-time flights).  
3. Set up an inequality to find the number of additional on-time flights needed for the rate to exceed 70%.  
4. Solve the inequality to determine the minimum number of additional flights.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define the on-time departure rate mathematically.  
**How to Achieve**: The on-time departure rate is the number of on-time flights divided by the total number of flights, expressed as a percentage. We need to formulate this as a mathematical expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The on-time departure rate is defined as:  
\[
\text{On-time rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of on-time flights}}{\text{Total number of flights}} \right) \times 100\%
\]  
To exceed 70%, we need:  
\[
\frac{\text{Number of on-time flights}}{\text{Total number of flights}} > 0.7
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Model the scenario with one late flight, three on-time flights, and additional on-time flights.  
**How to Achieve**: Assign variables to represent the number of additional on-time flights and express the total flights and on-time flights based on the problem’s conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( x \) be the number of additional flights that depart on-time after the first four flights (one late, three on-time).  
- **Total flights**: The first flight is late, the next three are on-time, and \( x \) additional flights are on-time. Thus, the total number of flights is \( 1 + 3 + x = 4 + x \).  
- **On-time flights**: The first flight is late (0 on-time), the next three are on-time (3 on-time), and \( x \) additional flights are on-time. Thus, the total number of on-time flights is \( 3 + x \).  
The on-time departure rate is:  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{4 + x}
\]  
We need this rate to exceed 70%:  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality to find the minimum number of additional on-time flights (\( x \)).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the inequality \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7 \) for the smallest integer \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7
\]  
Multiply both sides by \( 4 + x \) (noting that \( 4 + x > 0 \) since \( x \geq 0 \)):  
\[
3 + x > 0.7(4 + x)
\]  
Distribute on the right:  
\[
3 + x > 0.7 \cdot 4 + 0.7x
\]  
\[
3 + x > 2.8 + 0.7x
\]  
Subtract \( 0.7x \) from both sides:  
\[
3 + x - 0.7x > 2.8
\]  
\[
3 + 0.3x > 2.8
\]  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
\[
0.3x > 2.8 - 3
\]  
\[
0.3x > -0.2
\]  
Divide by 0.3:  
\[
x > \frac{-0.2}{0.3}
\]  
\[
x > -\frac{2}{3}
\]  
Since \( x \) represents the number of flights, \( x \geq 0 \), and the inequality \( x > -\frac{2}{3} \) is satisfied for any non-negative \( x \). However, this suggests a possible issue, as the inequality seems too permissive. Let’s reconsider the setup to ensure correctness.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the current path, as the solution \( x > -\frac{2}{3} \) seems incorrect for a practical number of flights.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the inequality and test the model with sample values to identify any errors in the setup or interpretation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The inequality \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7 \) yielding \( x > -\frac{2}{3} \) suggests that any non-negative \( x \) satisfies the condition, which is unexpected. Let’s test with sample values:  
- For \( x = 0 \):  
  \[
  \frac{3 + 0}{4 + 0} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 = 75\% > 70\%
  \]  
- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[
  \frac{3 + 1}{4 + 1} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 = 80\% > 70\%
  \]  
The test with \( x = 0 \) shows the rate is already 75%, exceeding 70%, suggesting no additional flights may be needed. This indicates a potential misinterpretation. Let’s clarify the problem: the question asks for “subsequent flights” after the first four (one late, three on-time). The inequality’s result implies the rate is already above 70% with the given flights. Let’s try setting the inequality to find when the rate first exceeds 70% by testing integer values:  
- For \( x = 0 \): Rate = 75% (as calculated).  
Since 75% > 70%, the condition is satisfied with no additional flights.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Backtrack

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
The solution suggests zero additional flights are needed, which seems counterintuitive given the problem’s phrasing. Return to the problem statement to ensure the scenario is modeled correctly, considering whether “subsequent flights” implies additional flights beyond the three on-time flights or a different interpretation.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Model the scenario correctly to determine the number of additional on-time flights.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information from the problem statement and previous steps to clarify the interpretation of “subsequent flights” and the initial conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The problem states: “The first flight out of Phoenix airport had a late departure. If the next three flights departed on-time, how many subsequent flights need to depart on-time for the airport’s on-time departure rate to be higher than 70%?”  
From previous steps:  
- Step 3 modeled the scenario with 1 late flight, 3 on-time flights, and \( x \) additional on-time flights, giving a rate of \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} \).  
- Step 5 showed that for \( x = 0 \), the rate is 75%, which exceeds 70%.  
The term “subsequent flights” likely refers to flights after the first four (1 late + 3 on-time). The calculation suggests the rate is already above 70% with the given flights, indicating a possible misinterpretation or that the problem expects additional constraints (e.g., the rate before additional flights is below 70%, or a different total flight context).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The current model suggests the on-time rate is already 75% after four flights, which conflicts with the expectation of needing additional flights. Adjust the subgoals to:  
1. Reinterpret “subsequent flights” to mean flights after the first late flight (i.e., include the three on-time flights in the count).  
2. Set up a new model where the three on-time flights are part of the “subsequent” flights, and find additional flights needed.  
3. Solve the new inequality.  
4. Validate the solution with test values.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Model the scenario assuming “subsequent flights” includes the three on-time flights and additional flights.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( x \) represent additional on-time flights after the first late flight, with the three on-time flights included in the initial count, and set up the inequality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume “subsequent flights” refers to all flights after the first late flight. Let’s redefine:  
- First flight: Late (0 on-time).  
- Subsequent flights: 3 on-time flights + \( x \) additional on-time flights.  
- **Total flights**: \( 1 + 3 + x = 4 + x \).  
- **On-time flights**: \( 3 + x \).  
The rate is:  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7
\]  
This is the same inequality as before, indicating the interpretation may still be off. Let’s try an alternative: assume the problem implies the rate must be below 70% without additional flights, or consider a cumulative context. Since \( \frac{3}{4} = 75\% \), let’s explore if the problem assumes a different starting point, e.g., more late flights or a reset after the first four flights. For now, proceed with the current model and solve:  
\[
3 + x > 0.7(4 + x)
\]  
\[
3 + x > 2.8 + 0.7x
\]  
\[
0.3x > -0.2
\]  
\[
x > -\frac{2}{3}
\]  
Since \( x \geq 0 \), test \( x = 0 \):  
\[
\frac{3}{4} = 75\% > 70\%
\]  
This confirms no additional flights are needed under this model.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Determine the number of additional on-time flights needed for the on-time departure rate to exceed 70%.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the on-time departure rate (completed: \( \frac{\text{On-time flights}}{\text{Total flights}} > 0.7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Model the scenario (completed: 1 late, 3 on-time, \( x \) additional on-time; rate = \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the inequality (completed: \( x > -\frac{2}{3} \), but suggests \( x = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: rate is 75% at \( x = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Reinterpret “subsequent flights” and adjust model (attempted: same model resulted).  
**Current Goal**: Validate the final answer, considering the problem’s intent.  
The calculations consistently show the rate is 75% after the first four flights, suggesting no additional flights are needed. However, the problem’s phrasing implies additional flights. This discrepancy suggests the problem may assume a different context (e.g., a larger set of flights or prior late flights reducing the rate below 70%).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by considering alternative interpretations or errors in the problem setup.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the current model with the problem’s intent and explore if additional context (e.g., prior flights) changes the outcome.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The current model assumes: 1 late flight, 3 on-time flights, and \( x \) additional on-time flights, yielding a rate of \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} \). At \( x = 0 \), the rate is 75%, exceeding 70%. The problem’s phrasing (“how many subsequent flights”) suggests additional flights are needed, so let’s test an alternative: assume the “subsequent flights” reset the count after the first late flight, or the rate must increase from below 70%.  
Alternative model: Suppose the airport tracks flights in a session, and we need the rate to recover from a lower value. If we assume only the given flights (1 late, 3 on-time), the rate is already 75%. Let’s try assuming additional late flights before the three on-time flights to force the rate below 70%:  
- Suppose there are \( k \) late flights before the 3 on-time flights and \( x \) additional on-time flights.  
- Total flights: \( k + 3 + x \).  
- On-time flights: \( 3 + x \).  
- Rate: \( \frac{3 + x}{k + 3 + x} > 0.7 \).  
Test with \( k = 1 \) (as given):  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{1 + 3 + x} = \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7
\]  
This is the original equation, confirming 75% at \( x = 0 \). Try \( k = 2 \):  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{2 + 3 + x} = \frac{3 + x}{5 + x} > 0.7
\]  
For \( x = 0 \):  
\[
\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 = 60\% < 70\%
\]  
Solve:  
\[
\frac{3 + x}{5 + x} > 0.7
\]  
\[
3 + x > 0.7(5 + x)
\]  
\[
3 + x > 3.5 + 0.7x
\]  
\[
0.3x > 0.5
\]  
\[
x > \frac{0.5}{0.3} \approx 1.6667
\]  
Since \( x \) is an integer, try \( x = 2 \):  
\[
\frac{3 + 2}{5 + 2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143 = 71.43\% > 70\%
\]  
This suggests 2 additional flights if there were two late flights initially. However, the problem specifies only one late flight, so the original model seems correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Backtrack

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
The consistent result of \( x = 0 \) satisfies the inequality, but the problem’s wording suggests additional flights. Return to the problem statement to confirm the interpretation of “subsequent flights” and ensure no context (e.g., prior flights or a specific time window) is missed.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 13: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the interpretation of the problem’s conditions.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the exact problem wording and previous modeling attempts to clarify “subsequent flights” and the on-time rate context.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Problem Wording**: “The first flight out of Phoenix airport had a late departure. If the next three flights departed on-time, how many subsequent flights need to depart on-time for the airport’s on-time departure rate to be higher than 70%?”  
**Previous Steps**:  
- Step 3: Modeled as 1 late, 3 on-time, \( x \) additional on-time flights; rate = \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} \).  
- Step 5 & 9: Found \( x = 0 \) gives 75%, satisfying > 70%.  
- Step 11: Tested alternative with additional late flights, but problem specifies only one late flight.  
The term “subsequent flights” likely means flights after the first four (1 late + 3 on-time), but calculations show the rate is already 75%. The problem may assume a context where the rate is initially below 70% or misinterprets “subsequent.” The most direct interpretation (1 late, 3 on-time) holds, suggesting no additional flights are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Provide the final answer based on the most consistent interpretation.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the model \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7 \), confirm \( x = 0 \), and address the problem’s intent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the model:  
- 1 late flight, 3 on-time flights, \( x \) additional on-time flights.  
- Rate: \( \frac{3 + x}{4 + x} > 0.7 \).  
- At \( x = 0 \):  
\[
\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 = 75\% > 70\%
\]  
The condition is satisfied with no additional flights. The problem’s phrasing (“how many subsequent flights”) may expect a non-zero answer, but mathematically, zero additional flights suffice since the rate is already above 70%. To align with the intent, note that any \( x \geq 0 \) maintains the rate above 70% (e.g., \( x = 1 \): \( \frac{4}{5} = 80\% \)). Thus, the minimum number is:  
**Answer**: 0 additional flights.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
No additional flights need to depart on-time for the airport’s on-time departure rate to be higher than 70%, as the rate is already 75% after the first four flights (one late, three on-time).

\[ \boxed{0} \]
