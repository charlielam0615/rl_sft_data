**Problem Statement:**
We need to find the positive integer Y such that when a positive integer X is divided by Y, the remainder is 9, and the division X/Y equals 96.12. We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Interpret the given information to express X in terms of Y and set up an equation using X/Y = 96.12.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the remainder condition (X = Yq + 9, where q is the quotient) and the given X/Y = 96.12 to form equations, then derive a relationship for Y.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given X/Y = 96.12, rewrite 96.12 as a fraction:
96.12 = 96 + 0.12 = 96 + 12/100 = 96 + 3/25 = 2403/25 (since 96 = 2400/25, so 96 + 3/25 = 2403/25).

Thus, X/Y = 2403/25, implying X = (2403/25)Y.

From the remainder condition, when X is divided by Y, the remainder is 9:
X = Yq + 9, where q is a positive integer (the quotient).

Substitute X = (2403/25)Y into the remainder equation:
(2403/25)Y = Yq + 9.

Multiply through by 25 to eliminate the fraction:
2403Y = 25Yq + 225.

Rearrange to isolate terms:
2403Y - 25Yq = 225.

Factor out Y:
Y(2403 - 25q) = 225.

Thus, Y = 225 / (2403 - 25q).

For Y to be a positive integer, 2403 - 25q must be a positive divisor of 225.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve for Y by finding q such that 2403 - 25q is a positive divisor of 225.  
**How to Achieve**: Find the positive divisors of 225, then solve 2403 - 25q = d for q, where d is a divisor of 225, and ensure q is a positive integer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, find the divisors of 225:
225 = 3² × 5², so the positive divisors are:
1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225.

From Step 2, Y = 225 / (2403 - 25q), and 2403 - 25q = d, where d is a divisor of 225. Thus:
q = (2403 - d) / 25.

Since q must be a positive integer, 2403 - d must be divisible by 25, and d must be a divisor of 225. Check which divisors of 225 make 2403 - d divisible by 25 (i.e., 2403 - d ≡ 0 (mod 25)).

Since 2403 ÷ 25 = 96.12, we have 2403 = 25 × 96 + 3, so:
2403 ≡ 3 (mod 25).

Thus, 2403 - d ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies:
3 - d ≡ 0 (mod 25) → d ≡ 3 (mod 25).

Check divisors of 225 modulo 25:
- 1 ≡ 1
- 3 ≡ 3
- 5 ≡ 5
- 9 ≡ 9
- 15 ≡ 15
- 25 ≡ 0
- 45 ≡ 20
- 75 ≡ 0
- 225 ≡ 0

Only d = 3 satisfies d ≡ 3 (mod 25).

Calculate q for d = 3:
q = (2403 - 3) / 25 = 2400 / 25 = 96, which is an integer.

Calculate Y:
Y = 225 / 3 = 75.

Test other divisors to ensure completeness:
- d = 75 (75 ≡ 0 mod 25): q = (2403 - 75) / 25 = 2328 / 25 = 93.12 (not an integer).
- d = 225 (225 ≡ 0 mod 25): q = (2403 - 225) / 25 = 2178 / 25 = 87.12 (not an integer).
- Other divisors (1, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45) yield d ≢ 3 (mod 25), so q is not an integer (e.g., d = 1: q = (2403 - 1) / 25 = 2402 / 25 = 96.08).

Thus, Y = 75 is the only candidate.

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that Y = 75 satisfies X/Y = 96.12 and the remainder condition.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute X using Y = 75 and check if X/Y = 96.12 and X ÷ Y has remainder 9.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From X/Y = 96.12, calculate X:
X = 96.12 × 75 = 7209 (since 96.12 = 2403/25, so X = (2403/25) × 75 = 2403 × 3 = 7209).

Check the remainder:
X = 7209, Y = 75.
7209 ÷ 75 = 96.12, quotient = 96.
7209 = 75 × 96 + 9 (since 75 × 96 = 7200, and 7200 + 9 = 7209).

Remainder is 9, which satisfies the condition.

Check the quotient:
X/Y = 7209 / 75 = 96.12, which matches the given value.

The solution Y = 75 satisfies both conditions.

Y = 75.
