**Problem Restatement**:  
A, B, and C started a business with investments of Rs. 2000, Rs. 3000, and Rs. 4000, respectively. The total profit from the business is Rs. 4500. We need to find A's share of the profit.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of finding A's share of the profit, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the basis for dividing the profit (likely proportional to investments).  
2. Calculate the ratio of investments among A, B, and C.  
3. Use the ratio to find A's share of the total profit (Rs. 4500).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the basis for dividing the profit.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the problem involves a business partnership with different investments and no mention of time or other factors, assume the profit is divided in proportion to the investments. This is a standard approach in partnership problems where profit is shared based on the ratio of contributions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The profit is divided in proportion to the investments of A, B, and C. Therefore, we need to calculate the ratio of their investments to determine how the total profit of Rs. 4500 is distributed.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the ratio of investments among A, B, and C.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the ratio of A’s, B’s, and C’s investments (Rs. 2000, Rs. 3000, Rs. 4000) by expressing them as a ratio in simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Investments:  
- A: Rs. 2000  
- B: Rs. 3000  
- C: Rs. 4000  

Ratio of investments = 2000 : 3000 : 4000.  
To simplify, divide by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1000:  
2000 ÷ 1000 = 2  
3000 ÷ 1000 = 3  
4000 ÷ 1000 = 4  
Thus, the ratio is 2 : 3 : 4.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the investment ratio calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the simplified ratio 2 : 3 : 4 accurately represents the investments and ensure no errors in simplification.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The investments are Rs. 2000, Rs. 3000, and Rs. 4000. The ratio 2 : 3 : 4 corresponds to 2 × 1000 : 3 × 1000 : 4 × 1000, which matches the given amounts. The GCD of 2000, 3000, and 4000 is 1000, confirming the ratio is correctly simplified.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate A’s share of the profit using the investment ratio.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the ratio 2 : 3 : 4 to divide the total profit of Rs. 4500. Compute A’s share by determining A’s portion based on the ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The ratio of investments is 2 : 3 : 4.  
Total parts = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.  
A’s share corresponds to 2 parts out of 9.  
Value of one part = Total profit ÷ Total parts = 4500 ÷ 9 = Rs. 500.  
A’s share = 2 × 500 = Rs. 1000.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify A’s share calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate A’s share using an alternative method (e.g., proportion of total investment) and check if the sum of all shares equals the total profit.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Alternative Calculation**:  
Total investment = 2000 + 3000 + 4000 = Rs. 9000.  
A’s investment proportion = 2000 ÷ 9000 = 2/9.  
A’s share = (2/9) × 4500 = 2 × 500 = Rs. 1000, which matches the previous result.  

**Check Total Shares**:  
B’s share = 3 parts = 3 × 500 = Rs. 1500.  
C’s share = 4 parts = 4 × 500 = Rs. 2000.  
Total = A’s share + B’s share + C’s share = 1000 + 1500 + 2000 = Rs. 4500, which equals the total profit.  
The calculation is consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find A’s share of the profit (Rs. 4500) based on investments of A (Rs. 2000), B (Rs. 3000), and C (Rs. 4000).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the basis for dividing the profit (proportional to investments).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the ratio of investments (2 : 3 : 4).  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the ratio to find A’s share (Rs. 1000).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (confirmed correct).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, as A’s share has been calculated and verified.

**Final Answer**:  
A’s share of the profit is Rs. 1000.
