**Problem Restatement:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with sides of lengths 78 cm, 72 cm, and 30 cm.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the area of a triangle with sides 78 cm, 72 cm, and 30 cm, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Verify if the sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
2. Determine the appropriate formula for the triangle's area (e.g., Heron's formula, since no height or angles are provided).
3. Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle.
4. Apply Heron's formula to compute the area.
5. Validate the result to ensure it is reasonable.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify if the sides 78 cm, 72 cm, and 30 cm form a valid triangle.
How to Achieve: Apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side for all three pairs of sides.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the triangle inequality:
- 78 + 72 > 30: 150 > 30 (True)
- 78 + 30 > 72: 108 > 72 (True)
- 72 + 30 > 78: 102 > 78 (True)
All conditions are satisfied, so the sides 78 cm, 72 cm, and 30 cm form a valid triangle.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2, where a, b, and c are the side lengths (78 cm, 72 cm, 30 cm).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the semi-perimeter:
s = (78 + 72 + 30) / 2 = 180 / 2 = 90 cm
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the area using Heron's formula.
How to Achieve: Apply Heron's formula, Area = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (90 cm) and a, b, c are the side lengths (78 cm, 72 cm, 30 cm).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using Heron's formula:
- s = 90 cm
- s - a = 90 - 78 = 12 cm
- s - b = 90 - 72 = 18 cm
- s - c = 90 - 30 = 60 cm
Area = √(90 × 12 × 18 × 60)
First, compute the product inside the square root:
- 90 × 12 = 1080
- 1080 × 18 = 19440
- 19440 × 60 = 1166400
So, Area = √1166400
Calculate the square root:
- 1166400 = 1080² (since 1080 × 1080 = 1166400)
- √1166400 = 1080
Thus, the area is 1080 cm².
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the computed area to ensure it is reasonable.
How to Achieve: Check if the area (1080 cm²) is reasonable for a triangle with sides 78 cm, 72 cm, and 30 cm by estimating the area using an alternative method (e.g., approximating the triangle as right-angled or comparing with a known formula) and ensuring the result aligns.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, estimate the area by assuming the triangle is close to right-angled or use the base-height method with an approximated height. Since Heron's formula is exact, cross-check by recomputing key steps:
- Recompute product: 90 × 12 × 18 × 60 = 1166400
- Square root: √1166400 = 1080
The calculation is consistent. Additionally, the area seems reasonable since the triangle has relatively large sides, and 1080 cm² is plausible compared to, say, a right triangle with base 78 cm and estimated height (using 30 cm as a rough height projection), which would yield a comparable area (e.g., (1/2) × 78 × 30 ≈ 1170 cm², close to 1080 cm²).
