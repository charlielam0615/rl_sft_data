**Problem Statement:** Calculate the amount Kiran receives after investing Rs. 8000 at a 10% per annum compound interest rate for six years, with compounding done annually.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the final amount.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the formula for compound interest.  
- Subgoal 2: Assign the given values to the formula variables.  
- Subgoal 3: Compute the amount using the formula.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the formula for compound interest. This will be achieved by recalling the standard formula for compound interest with annual compounding.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The formula for compound interest, when compounded annually, is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]  
where:  
- \( A \) is the final amount,  
- \( P \) is the principal (initial investment),  
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in percentage),  
- \( n \) is the number of years.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to assign the given values to the formula variables. This will be achieved by extracting values from the problem statement and mapping them to the formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- Principal (\( P \)) = Rs. 8000  
- Interest rate (\( r \)) = 10% per annum  
- Time (\( n \)) = 6 years  
The formula becomes:  
\[ A = 8000 \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right)^6 \]  
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:  
\[ A = 8000 \left(1 + 0.1\right)^6 = 8000 \times (1.1)^6 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to compute the amount using the formula \( A = 8000 \times (1.1)^6 \). This will be achieved by calculating \( (1.1)^6 \) and multiplying by 8000.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \( (1.1)^6 \):  
- \( 1.1^2 = 1.21 \)  
- \( 1.1^3 = 1.21 \times 1.1 = 1.331 \)  
- \( 1.1^4 = 1.331 \times 1.1 = 1.4641 \)  
- \( 1.1^5 = 1.4641 \times 1.1 = 1.61051 \)  
- \( 1.1^6 = 1.61051 \times 1.1 = 1.771561 \)  

Now compute the amount:  
\[ A = 8000 \times 1.771561 = 14172.488 \]  
So, the amount is approximately Rs. 14172.49 (rounded to two decimal places).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the calculation of the amount. This will be achieved by recomputing \( (1.1)^6 \) using an alternative method (e.g., approximation or tool-based calculation) and checking consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, use the compound interest formula with a different approach. Compute \( (1.1)^6 \) using a more precise method, such as a known value or calculator approximation:  
- \( (1.1)^6 = 1.771561 \) (matches previous calculation).  
Recompute:  
\[ A = 8000 \times 1.771561 = 14172.488 \approx 14172.49 \]  
The result is consistent. Alternatively, check using the compound interest formula step-by-step:  
\[ A = 8000 \times (1 + 0.1)^6 = 8000 \times 1.771561 \]  
The calculations align, confirming the amount is Rs. 14172.49.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Calculate the amount Kiran receives.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the formula for compound interest (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Assign the given values to the formula variables (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the amount using the formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (completed).  

**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals are completed. The final amount is Rs. 14172.49.
