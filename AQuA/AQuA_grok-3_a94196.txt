### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the approximate percent change in the number of unemployed construction workers in Country Z from September 1, 1992, to September 1, 1996. The unemployment rate among construction workers decreased from 16% in 1992 to 9% in 1996, and the total number of construction workers increased by 20% over the same period.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to calculate the percent change in the number of unemployed construction workers.

- **Subgoal 1**: Calculate the number of unemployed construction workers in 1992 based on the unemployment rate and an assumed total number of workers.
- **Subgoal 2**: Determine the total number of construction workers in 1996 using the 20% increase.
- **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the number of unemployed construction workers in 1996 using the 9% unemployment rate.
- **Subgoal 4**: Compute the percent change in the number of unemployed workers from 1992 to 1996.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of unemployed construction workers in 1992.  
**How to Achieve**: Assume a base number of construction workers in 1992 (e.g., 100 for simplicity, as the problem involves percentages and the result will be a percent change). Apply the 16% unemployment rate to find the number of unemployed workers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s assume there were 100 construction workers in 1992 for simplicity. With a 16% unemployment rate:  
Unemployed workers in 1992 = 16% of 100 = 0.16 × 100 = 16 workers.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the total number of construction workers in 1996.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the 20% increase in the number of construction workers from 1992 to 1996 to calculate the total number of workers in 1996.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of construction workers in 1992 is 100 (from Step 2). A 20% increase means:  
Total workers in 1996 = 100 × (1 + 0.20) = 100 × 1.2 = 120 workers.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of unemployed construction workers in 1996.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the 9% unemployment rate to the total number of construction workers in 1996 (from Step 3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of construction workers in 1996 is 120. With a 9% unemployment rate:  
Unemployed workers in 1996 = 9% of 120 = 0.09 × 120 = 10.8 workers.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the percent change in the number of unemployed construction workers from 1992 to 1996.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate unemployed workers in 1992 (completed: 16 workers).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine total workers in 1996 (completed: 120 workers).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate unemployed workers in 1996 (completed: 10.8 workers).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the percent change in unemployed workers (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the percent change in the number of unemployed workers from 1992 to 1996.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the percent change in the number of unemployed workers from 1992 to 1996.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for percent change:  
\[
\text{Percent Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100
\]
Use the number of unemployed workers in 1992 (16) and 1996 (10.8) from previous steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Unemployed workers in 1992 = 16.  
Unemployed workers in 1996 = 10.8.  
Percent change = \(\frac{10.8 - 16}{16} \times 100 = \frac{-5.2}{16} \times 100 \approx -32.5\%\).  
The number of unemployed workers decreased by approximately 32.5%.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for accuracy.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate each step to ensure correctness and confirm the percent change aligns with the problem’s context.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Recheck Step 2**: 16% of 100 = 0.16 × 100 = 16 unemployed workers in 1992 (correct).  
- **Recheck Step 3**: 20% increase from 100 = 100 × 1.2 = 120 workers in 1996 (correct).  
- **Recheck Step 4**: 9% of 120 = 0.09 × 120 = 10.8 unemployed workers in 1996 (correct).  
- **Recheck Step 6**: Percent change = \(\frac{10.8 - 16}{16} \times 100 = \frac{-5.2}{16} \times 100 = -0.325 \times 100 = -32.5\%\) (correct).  

The calculations are consistent. The negative percent change makes sense since the unemployment rate decreased, and the 20% increase in total workers was offset by the lower rate, resulting in fewer unemployed workers.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The approximate percent change in the number of unemployed construction workers from September 1, 1992, to September 1, 1996, is a decrease of 32.5%.
