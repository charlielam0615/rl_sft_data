**Problem Statement**: A student scored 71% in math and 81% in history. We need to determine the required score in a third subject to achieve an overall average of 75% across all three subjects.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the required score in the third subject into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the formula for the average of three subjects.  
2. Set up an equation using the given scores and the desired average.  
3. Solve for the unknown score in the third subject.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the formula for the average of three subjects.  
**How to Achieve**: The average is the sum of the scores divided by the number of subjects. For three subjects with scores \( S_1 \), \( S_2 \), and \( S_3 \), the average is \( \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3}{3} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The formula for the average of three subjects is:  
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3}{3} \]  
Here, \( S_1 = 71 \), \( S_2 = 81 \), and \( S_3 \) is the unknown score. The desired average is 75.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up an equation using the given scores and the desired average.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the known values into the average formula and set it equal to 75 to form an equation for \( S_3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the average formula:  
\[ \frac{71 + 81 + S_3}{3} = 75 \]  
Simplify the sum of known scores:  
\[ 71 + 81 = 152 \]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{152 + S_3}{3} = 75 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve for the unknown score \( S_3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the equation \( \frac{152 + S_3}{3} = 75 \) by isolating \( S_3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \frac{152 + S_3}{3} = 75 \]  
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:  
\[ 152 + S_3 = 225 \]  
Subtract 152 from both sides:  
\[ S_3 = 225 - 152 \]  
\[ S_3 = 73 \]  
So, the student needs 73% in the third subject.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the calculated score.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( S_3 = 73 \) back into the average formula and verify if the average equals 75.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the average with \( S_3 = 73 \):  
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{71 + 81 + 73}{3} \]  
\[ = \frac{225}{3} \]  
\[ = 75 \]  
The average is 75, which matches the desired average, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the required score in the third subject to achieve an overall average of 75%.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the formula for the average of three subjects (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation using the given scores and desired average (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the unknown score in the third subject (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The required score in the third subject is 73%.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The student needs to score 73% in the third subject to achieve an overall average of 75%.
