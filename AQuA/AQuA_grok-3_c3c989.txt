### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the probability that Ms. Barton, who has four children and at least two girls, also has two boys, given that the probability of having a boy equals the probability of having a girl (i.e., 0.5 for each). The problem does not specify which children are girls, only that there are at least two.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability.  
1. Define the sample space for the gender configurations of four children.  
2. Identify the condition: at least two girls.  
3. Determine the favorable outcomes: exactly two girls and two boys.  
4. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes satisfying the condition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total number of possible gender configurations for four children, assuming equal probability (0.5) for a boy or girl.  
**How to Achieve**: Since each child is independently a boy or girl with probability 0.5, use the binomial distribution to find the number of possible sequences. Each child has 2 possible genders, so for 4 children, calculate \(2^4\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), with \(P(B) = P(G) = 0.5\). For 4 children, the total number of possible gender sequences is:  
\[
2^4 = 16
\]  
These sequences represent all combinations, such as GGGG, GGGB, GGBB, etc.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the number of outcomes with at least two girls.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the binomial coefficient to count configurations with 2, 3, or 4 girls, as "at least two girls" means the number of girls \(k \geq 2\). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) gives the number of ways to choose \(k\) girls out of \(n = 4\) children.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of girls can be 2, 3, or 4. Using the binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{k}\):  
- Exactly 2 girls: \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\)  
- Exactly 3 girls: \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4\)  
- Exactly 4 girls: \(\binom{4}{4} = \frac{4!}{4!0!} = 1\)  

Total outcomes with at least two girls:  
\[
6 + 4 + 1 = 11
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the number of favorable outcomes where there are exactly two girls and two boys.  
**How to Achieve**: Since "two girls and two boys" corresponds to exactly 2 girls, use the binomial coefficient already calculated for 2 girls.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3, the number of outcomes with exactly 2 girls (and thus 2 boys, since \(4 - 2 = 2\)) is:  
\[
\binom{4}{2} = 6
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that Ms. Barton has two boys given at least two girls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute total gender configurations (completed: 16 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute outcomes with at least two girls (completed: 11 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute outcomes with exactly two girls and two boys (completed: 6 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 4 (Current): Calculate the conditional probability using the results from subgoals 2 and 3.  

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes (2 girls, 2 boys) to total outcomes (at least 2 girls).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the conditional probability \(P(\text{2 boys} \mid \text{at least 2 girls})\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for conditional probability:  
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]  
Here, \(A\) is the event of having exactly 2 boys (and thus 2 girls), and \(B\) is the event of having at least 2 girls. Compute the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the number of outcomes with at least 2 girls, adjusted by their probabilities.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Favorable outcomes (\(A \cap B\)): Exactly 2 girls and 2 boys, which is 6 outcomes (from Step 4). Since each sequence has probability \((\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{16}\), the probability is:  
\[
P(A \cap B) = 6 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8}
\]  
- Total outcomes with at least 2 girls (\(B\)): 11 outcomes (from Step 3). Probability is:  
\[
P(B) = 11 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{11}{16}
\]  
- Conditional probability:  
\[
P(\text{2 boys} \mid \text{at least 2 girls}) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{6}{16}}{\frac{11}{16}} = \frac{6}{11}
\]  
Alternatively, since all sequences are equally likely, the probability is the ratio of counts:  
\[
\frac{\text{Number of outcomes with 2 girls, 2 boys}}{\text{Number of outcomes with at least 2 girls}} = \frac{6}{11}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the binomial coefficients and probability calculation by listing outcomes explicitly and confirming the counts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
List the outcomes for clarity:  
- Total outcomes: \(2^4 = 16\).  
- Outcomes with at least 2 girls:  
  - 2 girls (GGBB): Use binomial coefficient or list: e.g., GGBB, GBGB, GBBG, BGBG, BGGB, BBGG (6 outcomes).  
  - 3 girls (GGGB): GGGB, GGBG, GBGG, BGGG (4 outcomes).  
  - 4 girls (GGGG): 1 outcome.  
  Total: \(6 + 4 + 1 = 11\).  
- Favorable outcomes (2 girls, 2 boys): 6 outcomes (confirmed above).  
Probability:  
\[
\frac{6}{11}
\]  
The counts match Step 3 and Step 4, and the probability calculation is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that Ms. Barton has two boys given that she has at least two girls is \(\frac{6}{11}\).
