**Problem Statement:**
We need to determine how many of the 30 applicants for a job have both at least 4 years of experience and a degree, given that 16 applicants have at least 4 years of experience, 21 applicants have degrees, and 5 applicants have less than 4 years of experience and do not have a degree.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:
1. Define the sets involved: applicants with at least 4 years of experience (E) and applicants with a degree (D).
2. Use the given data to express the number of applicants in each set and their intersections.
3. Apply set theory or a similar method (e.g., Venn diagram or formula) to find the number of applicants with both at least 4 years of experience and a degree.
4. Validate the solution to ensure consistency with the given data.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the sets and express the given data mathematically.
How to Achieve: Assign variables to the sets and use the given numbers to set up equations or a Venn diagram. Let E be the set of applicants with at least 4 years of experience, and D be the set of applicants with a degree. We are given:
- Total applicants: 30
- |E| = 16 (applicants with at least 4 years of experience)
- |D| = 21 (applicants with a degree)
- Applicants with less than 4 years of experience and no degree: 5
We need to find |E ∩ D|, the number of applicants with both at least 4 years of experience and a degree.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s denote:
- E: Applicants with at least 4 years of experience, so |E| = 16.
- D: Applicants with a degree, so |D| = 21.
- Total applicants = 30.
- Applicants with less than 4 years of experience and no degree: This is the complement of E (not E) and not D, i.e., |(E') ∩ (D')| = 5.

Since the total number of applicants is 30, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find |E ∩ D|. First, note that the complement of E (less than 4 years of experience) is 30 - 16 = 14 applicants. The 5 applicants who have less than 4 years of experience and no degree are part of these 14. We need to find |E ∩ D|.

Using inclusion-exclusion for the total applicants:
|E ∪ D| = |E| + |D| - |E ∩ D|
The total applicants are 30, so |E ∪ D| ≤ 30. We calculate:
|E ∪ D| = 16 + 21 - |E ∩ D| = 37 - |E ∩ D|

To find |E ∩ D|, we need the number of applicants outside E ∪ D, i.e., |(E ∪ D)'| = |(E') ∩ (D')|. Since |(E') ∩ (D')| = 5 (those with less than 4 years of experience and no degree), the number of applicants in E ∪ D is:
|E ∪ D| = Total applicants - |(E') ∩ (D')| = 30 - 5 = 25

Now, equate the two expressions for |E ∪ D|:
37 - |E ∩ D| = 25
|E ∩ D| = 37 - 25 = 12

Thus, the number of applicants with both at least 4 years of experience and a degree is 12.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the solution (|E ∩ D| = 12) is consistent with all given data.
How to Achieve: Check if the calculated value satisfies the conditions provided in the problem using the set relationships and total applicants.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the solution:
- |E| = 16 (given).
- |D| = 21 (given).
- |(E') ∩ (D')| = 5 (given).
- Total applicants = 30 (given).
- Calculated |E ∩ D| = 12.

Check |E ∪ D|:
|E ∪ D| = |E| + |D| - |E ∩ D| = 16 + 21 - 12 = 25

Applicants not in E ∪ D:
|(E ∪ D)'| = 30 - 25 = 5, which matches |(E') ∩ (D')| = 5.

Now, verify other set relationships:
- Applicants with less than 4 years of experience: |E'| = 30 - 16 = 14.
- Among these, 5 have no degree (given), so applicants with less than 4 years of experience and a degree: |E' ∩ D| = 14 - 5 = 9.
- Total applicants with a degree: |D| = |(E ∩ D)| + |(E' ∩ D)| = 12 + 9 = 21, which matches the given |D| = 21.
- Applicants with at least 4 years of experience: |E| = |(E ∩ D)| + |(E ∩ D')| = 12 + (16 - 12) = 16, which matches |E| = 16.

All conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of applicants with both at least 4 years of experience and a degree.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the sets and express the given data mathematically (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate |E ∩ D| using set theory or inclusion-exclusion (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution to ensure consistency (completed in Step 3).
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, with |E ∩ D| = 12, and the solution has been validated.

**Final Answer:**
The number of applicants with at least 4 years of experience and a degree is 12.
