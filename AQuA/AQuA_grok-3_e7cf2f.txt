**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between the gears’ circumferential rates and their diameters.  
2. Determine the relationship between the gears’ revolutions per minute based on their diameters.  
3. Calculate the ratio of revolutions per minute for Gear A to Gear B.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to understand the relationship between the gears’ circumferential rates and their diameters. Since the gears have the same circumferential rate (linear speed at the edge), use the formula for circumference (C = πd) and the relationship between circumferential rate, diameter, and revolutions per minute to establish how the revolutions are related.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The circumferential rate (linear speed) of a gear is given by the product of its circumference and the number of revolutions per minute (RPM). For Gear A with diameter \( d_A = 80 \) cm, the circumference is \( C_A = π \cdot 80 \). For Gear B with diameter \( d_B = 50 \) cm, the circumference is \( C_B = π \cdot 50 \). Let \( n_A \) and \( n_B \) be the RPM of Gear A and Gear B, respectively. Since the circumferential rates are equal:  
\[ C_A \cdot n_A = C_B \cdot n_B \]  
\[ (π \cdot 80) \cdot n_A = (π \cdot 50) \cdot n_B \]  
The \( π \) terms cancel out:  
\[ 80 \cdot n_A = 50 \cdot n_B \]  
This gives the relationship between the revolutions:  
\[ n_A = \frac{50}{80} \cdot n_B = \frac{5}{8} \cdot n_B \]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the ratio of the number of revolutions per minute of Gear A to Gear B. Using the relationship derived in the previous step, compute the ratio \( n_A : n_B \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ n_A = \frac{5}{8} \cdot n_B \]  
The ratio of revolutions per minute of Gear A to Gear B is:  
\[ \frac{n_A}{n_B} = \frac{5}{8} \]  
Thus, the ratio \( n_A : n_B \) is \( 5 : 8 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the correctness of the ratio \( n_A : n_B = 5 : 8 \). Check if the relationship aligns with the physical principle that larger gears rotate slower when the circumferential rate is the same.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since Gear A has a larger diameter (80 cm) than Gear B (50 cm), Gear A should complete fewer revolutions per minute to maintain the same circumferential rate. The ratio \( \frac{n_A}{n_B} = \frac{5}{8} \) indicates that Gear A makes 5 revolutions for every 8 revolutions of Gear B, which is consistent because \( \frac{5}{8} < 1 \), meaning Gear A rotates slower. To further validate, consider the circumferences:  
- Circumference of Gear A: \( 80π \) cm  
- Circumference of Gear B: \( 50π \) cm  
If Gear B makes 8 revolutions, its edge travels \( 8 \cdot 50π = 400π \) cm. For Gear A to match this distance, it makes \( n_A \) revolutions:  
\[ n_A \cdot 80π = 400π \]  
\[ n_A = \frac{400π}{80π} = 5 \]  
Thus, \( n_A : n_B = 5 : 8 \), confirming the calculation.
