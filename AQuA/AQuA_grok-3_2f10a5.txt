**Problem Restatement:**
Find the smallest positive number \( N \) such that:
- \( N \div 20 \) leaves a remainder of 14 (\( N \equiv 14 \pmod{20} \)),
- \( N \div 25 \) leaves a remainder of 19 (\( N \equiv 19 \pmod{25} \)),
- \( N \div 35 \) leaves a remainder of 29 (\( N \equiv 29 \pmod{35} \)),
- \( N \div 40 \) leaves a remainder of 34 (\( N \equiv 34 \pmod{40} \)).

I will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and following the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the smallest number \( N \) satisfying the given congruences:
1. Understand the pattern in the congruences.
2. Formulate the system of congruences.
3. Solve the system of congruences.
4. Find the smallest positive solution.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Understand the pattern in the congruences.
How to Achieve: Analyze the given congruences to identify any relationships between the divisors and remainders, which may simplify the system.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Observe the congruences:
- \( N \equiv 14 \pmod{20} \)
- \( N \equiv 19 \pmod{25} \)
- \( N \equiv 29 \pmod{35} \)
- \( N \equiv 34 \pmod{40} \)

Notice that for each congruence \( N \equiv r \pmod{m} \), the remainder \( r \) and modulus \( m \) satisfy:
- \( 20 - 14 = 6 \)
- \( 25 - 19 = 6 \)
- \( 35 - 29 = 6 \)
- \( 40 - 34 = 6 \)

Thus, each congruence can be rewritten as:
- \( N = 20k + 14 \implies N - 14 = 20k \implies N \equiv -6 \pmod{20} \), since \( -6 \equiv 14 \pmod{20} \).
- \( N = 25m + 19 \implies N - 19 = 25m \implies N \equiv -6 \pmod{25} \), since \( -6 \equiv 19 \pmod{25} \).
- \( N = 35n + 29 \implies N - 29 = 35n \implies N \equiv -6 \pmod{35} \), since \( -6 \equiv 29 \pmod{35} \).
- \( N = 40p + 34 \implies N - 34 = 40p \implies N \equiv -6 \pmod{40} \), since \( -6 \equiv 34 \pmod{40} \).

This simplifies the system to:
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{20} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{25} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{35} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{40} \)

Equivalently, since \( -6 \equiv m - 6 \pmod{m} \), the system is:
- \( N \equiv 14 \pmod{20} \)
- \( N \equiv 19 \pmod{25} \)
- \( N \equiv 29 \pmod{35} \)
- \( N \equiv 34 \pmod{40} \)

The pattern confirms the system is consistent with the original congruences, and the relationship \( N = m - 6 \) holds for each modulus.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the simplified system.
How to Achieve: Verify that the transformed congruences are equivalent to the original ones and ensure the system is solvable by checking the moduli for coprimality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The transformed system is identical to the original:
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{20} \equiv 14 \pmod{20} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{25} \equiv 19 \pmod{25} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{35} \equiv 29 \pmod{35} \)
- \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{40} \equiv 34 \pmod{40} \)

To ensure solvability, check if the moduli \( 20, 25, 35, 40 \) are pairwise coprime:
- \( \gcd(20, 25) = \gcd(2^2 \cdot 5, 5^2) = 5 \)
- \( \gcd(20, 35) = \gcd(2^2 \cdot 5, 5 \cdot 7) = 5 \)
- \( \gcd(20, 40) = \gcd(2^2 \cdot 5, 2^3 \cdot 5) = 2^2 \cdot 5 = 20 \)
- \( \gcd(25, 35) = \gcd(5^2, 5 \cdot 7) = 5 \)
- \( \gcd(25, 40) = \gcd(5^2, 2^3 \cdot 5) = 5 \)
- \( \gcd(35, 40) = \gcd(5 \cdot 7, 2^3 \cdot 5) = 5 \)

Since the moduli are not pairwise coprime (\( \gcd \neq 1 \)), the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) cannot be applied directly. However, since the remainders satisfy \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{m_i} \), we can attempt to solve \( N \equiv -6 \) modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of the moduli.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Formulate and solve the system using the LCM of the moduli.
How to Achieve: Compute the LCM of \( 20, 25, 35, 40 \), express \( N \) in terms of this LCM, and find the smallest positive \( N \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the LCM of \( 20, 25, 35, 40 \):
- Prime factorizations:
  - \( 20 = 2^2 \cdot 5 \)
  - \( 25 = 5^2 \)
  - \( 35 = 5 \cdot 7 \)
  - \( 40 = 2^3 \cdot 5 \)
- LCM takes thehighest power of each prime:
  - \( 2^3 = 8 \)
  - \( 5^2 = 25 \)
  - \( 7^1 = 7 \)
- \( \text{LCM} = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 = 8 \cdot 25 \cdot 7 = 200 \cdot 7 = 1400 \)

Since \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{m_i} \) for each modulus, we hypothesize \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{\text{LCM}(20, 25, 35, 40)} \), i.e., \( N \equiv -6 \pmod{1400} \).

Thus, \( N = 1400k - 6 \), where \( k \) is an integer. The smallest positive \( N \) occurs when \( k = 1 \):
- \( N = 1400 \cdot 1 - 6 = 1394 \).

Verify:
- \( 1394 \div 20 = 69 \text{ remainder } 14 \) (\( 1394 = 20 \cdot 69 + 14 \)).
- \( 1394 \div 25 = 55 \text{ remainder } 19 \) (\( 1394 = 25 \cdot 55 + 19 \)).
- \( 1394 \div 35 = 39 \text{ remainder } 29 \) (\( 1394 = 35 \cdot 39 + 29 \)).
- \( 1394 \div 40 = 34 \text{ remainder } 34 \) (\( 1394 = 40 \cdot 34 + 34 \)).

All conditions are satisfied.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest positive number \( N \) satisfying the given congruences.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the pattern in the congruences (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Formulate the system of congruences (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system of congruences (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Find the smallest positive solution (completed).

Current Goal: Confirm the smallest positive solution and finalize the answer.

The solution \( N = 1394 \) has been computed and verified.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Confirm that \( N = 1394 \) is the smallest positive solution.
How to Achieve: Check if a smaller positive \( N \) exists by considering the general solution \( N = 1400k - 6 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The general solution is \( N = 1400k - 6 \). For positive \( N \):
- \( k = 0 \): \( N = -6 \) (not positive).
- \( k = 1 \): \( N = 1400 \cdot 1 - 6 = 1394 \).
- \( k = 2 \): \( N = 1400 \cdot 2 - 6 = 2794 \), and so on.

Since \( k = 0 \) yields a negative number, \( k = 1 \) gives the smallest positive \( N = 1394 \). Any \( N < 1394 \) would require \( k < 1 \), making \( N \) negative or zero, which is not suitable.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The smallest positive number that satisfies the given conditions is **1394**.
