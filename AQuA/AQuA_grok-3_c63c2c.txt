### Problem Statement
We need to determine the concentration of water in a mixture in a tank after 2 hours. The tank starts with 24 gallons capacity, filled to one quarter, so the initial mixture volume is 6 gallons (24 × 1/4). The mixture is 50% water and 50% sodium chloride by volume, meaning 3 gallons of water and 3 gallons of sodium chloride. Water evaporates at 0.5 gallons per hour, while the sodium chloride remains constant. We need to find the water concentration (as a percentage) after 2 hours.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the initial amounts of water and sodium chloride in the tank.  
2. Determine the amount of water lost due to evaporation over 2 hours.  
3. Calculate the new total volume of the mixture after evaporation.  
4. Compute the new concentration of water as a percentage of the total volume.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the initial amounts of water and sodium chloride in the tank.  
How to Achieve: Use the tank’s capacity (24 gallons), the fact that it’s filled to one quarter (24 × 1/4 = 6 gallons), and the given 50% proportion for each component to find the volumes of water and sodium chloride.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The tank’s capacity is 24 gallons, and it is filled to one quarter:  
24 × 1/4 = 6 gallons of mixture.  
The mixture is 50% water and 50% sodium chloride by volume:  
- Water: 6 × 0.5 = 3 gallons  
- Sodium chloride: 6 × 0.5 = 3 gallons  
So, initially, there are 3 gallons of water and 3 gallons of sodium chloride.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the amount of water lost due to evaporation over 2 hours.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the evaporation rate (0.5 gallons per hour) by the time (2 hours) to find the total water lost.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Water evaporates at 0.5 gallons per hour. Over 2 hours:  
0.5 × 2 = 1 gallon of water lost.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the new total volume of the mixture and the new amount of water after evaporation.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the water lost from the initial water volume to get the new water volume. Add the new water volume to the unchanged sodium chloride volume to get the new total mixture volume.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Initial water volume: 3 gallons.  
Water lost: 1 gallon.  
New water volume: 3 - 1 = 2 gallons.  
Sodium chloride volume remains: 3 gallons.  
New total mixture volume: 2 + 3 = 5 gallons.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the new concentration of water as a percentage of the total volume.  
How to Achieve: Divide the new water volume by the new total mixture volume and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
New water volume: 2 gallons.  
New total mixture volume: 5 gallons.  
Water concentration: (2 / 5) × 100 = 40%.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.  
How to Achieve: Recheck the steps: initial mixture volume, initial component volumes, water loss, new mixture volume, and final concentration calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Tank capacity: 24 gallons, filled to 1/4 = 6 gallons.  
- Initial mixture: 50% water (3 gallons), 50% sodium chloride (3 gallons).  
- Evaporation: 0.5 gallons/hour × 2 hours = 1 gallon water lost.  
- New water volume: 3 - 1 = 2 gallons.  
- Sodium chloride: 3 gallons (unchanged).  
- New total volume: 2 + 3 = 5 gallons.  
- Water concentration: (2 / 5) × 100 = 40%.  
All calculations are consistent and follow the problem’s conditions.  
[/IMP]
