**Problem Restatement:**  
We need to determine Somu's current age. We know that Somu's current age is one-third of his father's current age, and six years ago, Somu's age was one-fifth of his father's age at that time. We need to find Somu's present age.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for Somu's current age, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for Somu's and his father's current ages.  
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships (current age and six years ago).  
3. Solve the equations to find Somu's age.  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the given relationships. Define Somu's current age as \( S \) and his father's current age as \( F \). Use the information that Somu's current age is one-third his father's and six years ago Somu's age was one-fifth his father's to create two equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( S \) be Somu's current age and \( F \) be his father's current age.  
From the problem:  
- Somu's current age is one-third his father's: \( S = \frac{1}{3}F \).  
- Six years ago, Somu's age was \( S - 6 \), and his father's age was \( F - 6 \). Somu's age then was one-fifth his father's: \( S - 6 = \frac{1}{5}(F - 6) \).  
Thus, we have the equations:  
1. \( S = \frac{1}{3}F \)  
2. \( S - 6 = \frac{1}{5}(F - 6) \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find Somu's age. Substitute \( S = \frac{1}{3}F \) into the second equation and solve for \( F \), then find \( S \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( S = \frac{1}{3}F \) into \( S - 6 = \frac{1}{5}(F - 6) \):  
\[ \frac{1}{3}F - 6 = \frac{1}{5}(F - 6) \]  
Multiply through by 15 (the least common multiple of 3 and 5) to eliminate fractions:  
\[ 15 \cdot \frac{1}{3}F - 15 \cdot 6 = 15 \cdot \frac{1}{5}(F - 6) \]  
\[ 5F - 90 = 3(F - 6) \]  
\[ 5F - 90 = 3F - 18 \]  
\[ 5F - 3F = 90 - 18 \]  
\[ 2F = 72 \]  
\[ F = 36 \]  
Now, find \( S \):  
\[ S = \frac{1}{3}F = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 36 = 12 \]  
So, Somu's current age is 12 years, and his father's current age is 36 years.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the ages satisfy both conditions given in the problem.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the conditions:  
- **Current ages:** Somu's age is 12, father's age is 36. Since \( 12 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 36 \), the first condition holds.  
- **Six years ago:** Somu's age was \( 12 - 6 = 6 \), father's age was \( 36 - 6 = 30 \). Check if \( 6 = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 30 \):  
  \[ \frac{1}{5} \cdot 30 = 6 \]  
This satisfies the second condition.  
The solution \( S = 12 \) is consistent with both conditions.
