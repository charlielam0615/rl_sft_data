### Problem Statement
We need to determine the time it takes for pipe A to fill a cistern separately, given that:
- Pipes A and B together fill the cistern in 4 hours.
- If opened separately, pipe B takes 6 hours more than pipe A to fill the cistern.

Let’s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the time for pipe A to fill the cistern into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for the times taken by pipes A and B to fill the cistern separately.
2. Set up equations based on the given information about combined and individual filling times.
3. Solve the equations to find the time for pipe A.
4. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies all conditions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem’s conditions. Achieve this by assigning variables to the times taken by pipes A and B and translating the problem’s statements into mathematical equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the time taken by pipe A to fill the cistern separately be \( x \) hours.  
Since pipe B takes 6 hours more than pipe A, the time taken by pipe B is \( x + 6 \) hours.  
The rate of pipe A is \( \frac{1}{x} \) cisterns per hour, and the rate of pipe B is \( \frac{1}{x + 6} \) cisterns per hour.  
Together, they fill the cistern in 4 hours, so their combined rate is \( \frac{1}{4} \) cisterns per hour.  
This gives the equation:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 6} = \frac{1}{4} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 6} = \frac{1}{4} \) to find the value of \( x \). Achieve this by simplifying the equation and solving the resulting quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 6} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
Combine the fractions on the left:  
\[ \frac{(x + 6) + x}{x(x + 6)} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
\[ \frac{2x + 6}{x^2 + 6x} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:  
\[ 4(2x + 6) = x^2 + 6x \]  
\[ 8x + 24 = x^2 + 6x \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[ x^2 + 6x - 8x - 24 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 24 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), \( c = -24 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 10}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \]  
Since time cannot be negative, discard \( x = -4 \). Thus, \( x = 6 \).  
So, pipe A takes 6 hours to fill the cistern separately.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 6 \) hours for pipe A satisfies all conditions of the problem. Achieve this by checking the combined filling time and the time difference between pipes A and B.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If pipe A takes 6 hours, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) cisterns per hour.  
Pipe B takes \( 6 + 6 = 12 \) hours, so its rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) cisterns per hour.  
Check the combined rate:  
\[ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2 + 1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
This matches the problem’s condition that together they fill the cistern in 4 hours (rate \( \frac{1}{4} \)).  
Check the time difference:  
Pipe B takes 12 hours, which is 6 hours more than pipe A’s 6 hours, satisfying the condition.  
The solution \( x = 6 \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the time taken by pipe A to fill the cistern separately.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find pipe A’s time.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution.  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as we have calculated and verified that pipe A takes 6 hours.  
All subgoals have been completed, and the solution is consistent with the problem’s conditions.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Pipe A takes 6 hours to fill the cistern separately.
