**Problem Restatement:**  
The current ages of P and Q have a ratio of 6:7, and Q is 4 years older than P. We need to find the ratio of their ages after 4 years.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the current ages of P and Q using the given ratio and age difference.  
2. Calculate their ages after 4 years.  
3. Find the ratio of their ages after 4 years.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the current ages of P and Q.  
How to Achieve: Use the ratio 6:7 and the fact that Q is 4 years older than P to set up equations and solve for their ages.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let P’s current age be 6x and Q’s current age be 7x (based on the ratio 6:7).  
Since Q is 4 years older than P:  
7x = 6x + 4  
Subtract 6x from both sides:  
x = 4  
Thus, P’s age = 6x = 6 * 4 = 24 years, and Q’s age = 7x = 7 * 4 = 28 years.

**Step 3: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated ages of P and Q.  
How to Achieve: Check if the ages satisfy both the ratio and the age difference conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculated ages: P = 24, Q = 28.  
- Ratio check: 24 : 28 = 6 : 7 (simplified by dividing by 4), which satisfies the given ratio.  
- Age difference check: 28 - 24 = 4, which satisfies Q being 4 years older than P.  
The calculations are valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the ages of P and Q after 4 years.  
How to Achieve: Add 4 years to the current ages of P and Q.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Current ages: P = 24, Q = 28.  
After 4 years:  
- P’s age = 24 + 4 = 28 years.  
- Q’s age = 28 + 4 = 32 years.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the ratio of P and Q’s ages after 4 years.  
How to Achieve: Use the ages after 4 years to compute the ratio and simplify it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Ages after 4 years: P = 28, Q = 32.  
Ratio of P’s age to Q’s age = 28 : 32.  
Simplify by dividing by 4: 28 ÷ 4 : 32 ÷ 4 = 7 : 8.  
Thus, the ratio is 7 : 8.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the ratio of P and Q’s ages after 4 years.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the current ages of P and Q (completed: P = 24, Q = 28).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate their ages after 4 years (completed: P = 28, Q = 32).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the ratio of their ages after 4 years (completed: 7 : 8).  
Current Goal: Completed (ratio found).

**Final Answer:**  
The ratio of the ages of P and Q after 4 years is 7 : 8.
