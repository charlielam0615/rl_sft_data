Let’s solve the problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

---

**Problem Statement:**
A certain characteristic in a large population has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean \( m \). If 68 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation \( d \) of the mean, we need to find what percent \( E \) of the distribution is less than \( m + d \).

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem and break it down

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the percent \( E \) of the distribution less than \( m + d \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Determine the type of distribution based on the given information.  
2. Interpret the meaning of “68 percent lies within one standard deviation of the mean” in the context of the distribution.  
3. Use the symmetry of the distribution to find the percent of the distribution less than \( m + d \).  
4. Compute the final percentage \( E \).

### Step 2: Identify the distribution type

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the type of distribution based on the information that 68 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation of the mean.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the given percentage (68%) and the symmetry property to infer the distribution type, likely comparing it to known statistical distributions such as the normal distribution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem states that the distribution is symmetric about the mean \( m \), and 68 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation \( d \) of the mean, i.e., between \( m - d \) and \( m + d \). In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., between \( m - d \) and \( m + d \)). Since the distribution is symmetric and the 68% figure aligns closely with the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule) for a normal distribution, it is reasonable to assume the distribution is normal or approximately normal.  
Thus, the distribution is likely a normal distribution with mean \( m \) and standard deviation \( d \).

### Step 3: Organize the goal hierarchy

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal-Management System**:  
- **Main Goal**: Find the percent \( E \) of the distribution less than \( m + d \).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Determine the type of distribution (completed: assumed normal distribution).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Interpret the 68% within one standard deviation (completed: aligns with normal distribution).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Use symmetry to find the percent less than \( m + d \) (current goal).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Compute the final percentage \( E \).  
**Current Goal**: Use the symmetry of the distribution to find the percent of the distribution less than \( m + d \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Use symmetry to find the percent less than \( m + d \)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the percent of the distribution less than \( m + d \) using the symmetry of the normal distribution.  
**How to Achieve**: Leverage the symmetry of the normal distribution and the fact that 68% lies between \( m - d \) and \( m + d \) to determine the cumulative probability up to \( m + d \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the distribution is symmetric about the mean \( m \), the normal distribution has equal areas on both sides of the mean. The total probability under the distribution curve is 100% (or 1). Given that 68% of the distribution lies between \( m - d \) and \( m + d \), this represents the area under the normal curve from \( z = -1 \) to \( z = 1 \) (since \( m - d \) corresponds to \( z = -1 \) and \( m + d \) to \( z = 1 \)).

- The 68% within one standard deviation means 34% lies between \( m \) and \( m + d \) (right of the mean) and 34% lies between \( m - d \) and \( m \) (left of the mean) due to symmetry.
- The area to the left of the mean (\( m \)) is 50%, as the mean splits the normal distribution equally.
- The percent of the distribution less than \( m + d \) includes:
  - The 50% to the left of the mean (\( m \)).
  - The 34% between \( m \) and \( m + d \).

Thus, the percent \( E \) less than \( m + d \) is:
\[ E = 50\% + 34\% = 84\% \]

Alternatively, in a standard normal distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at \( z = 1 \) (corresponding to \( m + d \)) is approximately 0.8413, or 84.13%. Since the problem uses 68% (a rounded figure from 68.27%), we use the approximate value for consistency, giving \( E = 84\% \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Verify the calculation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the percent less than \( m + d \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the logic of the calculation by considering the normal distribution properties and symmetry, and ensure the result aligns with standard normal distribution values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, reconsider the normal distribution properties:
- The total area under the curve is 100%.
- The 68% between \( m - d \) and \( m + d \) implies 32% remains in the tails (100% - 68% = 32%).
- Due to symmetry, the right tail (beyond \( m + d \)) has 16% (32% / 2).
- Thus, the area to the left of \( m + d \) is 100% - 16% = 84%, confirming the calculation.

Additionally, the standard normal CDF at \( z = 1 \) is approximately 0.8413 (84.13%), which is consistent with the 68% approximation (since 68% is a rounded figure). The calculation of 84% is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Finalize the answer

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute and present the final percentage \( E \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the result from the previous steps to state the final answer clearly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The percent of the distribution less than \( m + d \) is:
\[ E = 84\% \]
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**

The percent \( E \) of the distribution that is less than \( m + d \) is 84%.  
\[ \boxed{84} \]
