**Problem Statement:**
A teacher grades tests by subtracting twice the number of incorrect responses from the number of correct responses. Student A answers all 100 questions on a test and receives a score of 61. We need to determine how many questions Student A answered correctly.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for the number of correct and incorrect responses.
2. Set up an equation based on the grading formula and the total number of questions.
3. Solve the equation to find the number of correct responses.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations based on the problem's grading formula and total questions.
How to Achieve: Let \( c \) be the number of correct responses and \( i \) be the number of incorrect responses. Use the grading formula (score = correct - 2 Ã— incorrect) and the fact that all 100 questions were answered to create equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Define \( c \) as the number of correct responses and \( i \) as the number of incorrect responses. Since Student A answered all 100 questions, we have:
\[ c + i = 100 \]
The grading formula is given as the score being the number of correct responses minus twice the number of incorrect responses, and the score is 61:
\[ c - 2i = 61 \]
These two equations represent the problem mathematically.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the number of correct responses.
How to Achieve: Use the equations \( c + i = 100 \) and \( c - 2i = 61 \) to solve for \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have the system of equations:
1. \( c + i = 100 \)
2. \( c - 2i = 61 \)

Solve using the elimination method. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + i) - (c - 2i) = 100 - 61 \]
\[ c + i - c + 2i = 39 \]
\[ 3i = 39 \]
\[ i = 13 \]

Substitute \( i = 13 \) into the first equation:
\[ c + 13 = 100 \]
\[ c = 100 - 13 \]
\[ c = 87 \]

So, Student A answered 87 questions correctly.
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the calculated values satisfy the grading formula and total question count.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( c = 87 \) and \( i = 13 \) into both equations to ensure they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the total number of questions:
\[ c + i = 87 + 13 = 100 \]
This satisfies \( c + i = 100 \).

Check the grading formula:
\[ c - 2i = 87 - 2 \times 13 = 87 - 26 = 61 \]
This matches the given score of 61.

The solution is valid: Student A answered 87 questions correctly.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of questions Student A answered correctly.
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for correct and incorrect responses (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the grading formula and total questions (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equations to find the number of correct responses (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).

Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, with the number of correct responses determined as 87.

**Final Answer:**
Student A answered 87 questions correctly.
