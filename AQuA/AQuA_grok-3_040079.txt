### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x \), where \( x \) is 12 percent greater than 80. This means \( x \) is equal to 80 plus an additional 12% of 80.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( x \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Interpret "12 percent greater than 80" mathematically.  
2. Calculate 12% of 80.  
3. Add the result to 80 to find \( x \).  
4. Validate the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to interpret "12 percent greater than 80" mathematically. This involves expressing the statement as a mathematical expression, where \( x = 80 + 0.12 \times 80 \), or equivalently, \( x = 80 \times (1 + 0.12) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To interpret "12 percent greater than 80," we note that "12 percent greater" means 80 plus an additional 12% of 80. Mathematically:  
- 12% as a decimal is \( 0.12 \).  
- The expression for \( x \) is:  
  \[
  x = 80 + (0.12 \times 80) = 80 \times (1 + 0.12) = 80 \times 1.12
  \]  
This interpretation sets up the calculation for the next step.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate 12% of 80 and add it to 80 to find \( x \). This involves computing \( 0.12 \times 80 \) and then adding the result to 80, or directly computing \( 80 \times 1.12 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( x \):  
\[
x = 80 \times (1 + 0.12) = 80 \times 1.12
\]  
First, compute \( 80 \times 1.12 \):  
\[
80 \times 1.12 = 80 \times (1 + 0.12) = 80 + (0.12 \times 80)
\]  
Calculate \( 0.12 \times 80 \):  
\[
0.12 \times 80 = 9.6
\]  
Add to 80:  
\[
x = 80 + 9.6 = 89.6
\]  
Alternatively:  
\[
80 \times 1.12 = 89.6
\]  
So, \( x = 89.6 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 89.6 \). This involves checking if 89.6 is indeed 12% greater than 80 by verifying that \( 89.6 - 80 = 0.12 \times 80 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, check if \( 89.6 \) is 12% greater than 80:  
- Compute 12% of 80:  
  \[
  0.12 \times 80 = 9.6
  \]  
- Add to 80:  
  \[
  80 + 9.6 = 89.6
  \]  
This matches \( x = 89.6 \).  
Alternatively, check the percentage increase:  
\[
\text{Increase} = 89.6 - 80 = 9.6
\]  
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{9.6}{80} \right) \times 100 = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
\]  
The solution \( x = 89.6 \) satisfies the condition.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( x \) such that \( x \) is 12% greater than 80.  
  - Subgoal 1: Interpret "12 percent greater than 80" mathematically (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate 12% of 80 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the result to 80 to find \( x \) (completed, \( x = 89.6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are complete.  
The solution is \( x = 89.6 \).

### Final Answer
\[
x = 89.6
