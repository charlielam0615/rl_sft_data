### Problem Restatement
A paintbrush and a bucket of whitewash cost a total of B dollars. The paintbrush costs 100 cents (or 1 dollar, since 100 cents = 1 dollar) less than twice the price of a bucket of whitewash. We need to find the price of half a bucket of whitewash in dollars.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into manageable subgoals to reach the solution.  
1. Define variables for the price of the paintbrush and the bucket of whitewash.  
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships.  
3. Solve for the price of the bucket of whitewash.  
4. Calculate the price of half a bucket of whitewash.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Define variables and set up equations based on the problem's conditions.  
- **How to Achieve:** Assign variables to the paintbrush and bucket prices, translate the total cost and price relationship into equations, and ensure units are consistent (convert cents to dollars).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the price of a bucket of whitewash be \( w \) dollars.  
The paintbrush costs 100 cents less than twice the price of the bucket. Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, the paintbrush price is \( 2w - 1 \) dollars.  
The total cost of the paintbrush and bucket is B dollars, so:  
\[ (2w - 1) + w = B \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 3w - 1 = B \]  
This equation represents the relationship between the bucket price and the total cost.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve for the price of the bucket of whitewash.  
- **How to Achieve:** Solve the equation \( 3w - 1 = B \) for \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the equation \( 3w - 1 = B \):  
\[ 3w = B + 1 \]  
\[ w = \frac{B + 1}{3} \]  
Thus, the price of a bucket of whitewash is \( \frac{B + 1}{3} \) dollars.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the price of half a bucket of whitewash.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the price of the bucket (\( w = \frac{B + 1}{3} \)) and compute half of it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The price of half a bucket of whitewash is:  
\[ \frac{w}{2} = \frac{\frac{B + 1}{3}}{2} = \frac{B + 1}{6} \]  
Thus, the price of half a bucket of whitewash is \( \frac{B + 1}{6} \) dollars.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the solution by checking if the derived prices satisfy the problem's conditions.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( w = \frac{B + 1}{3} \) back into the equations to ensure consistency and confirm the final answer for half a bucket.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The bucket price is \( w = \frac{B + 1}{3} \). The paintbrush price is:  
\[ 2w - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{B + 1}{3} - 1 = \frac{2(B + 1)}{3} - 1 \]  
Their sum should equal B:  
\[ w + (2w - 1) = \frac{B + 1}{3} + \frac{2(B + 1)}{3} - 1 = \frac{3(B + 1)}{3} - 1 = (B + 1) - 1 = B \]  
This satisfies the total cost condition.  
Now, the price of half a bucket is:  
\[ \frac{w}{2} = \frac{\frac{B + 1}{3}}{2} = \frac{B + 1}{6} \]  
The units are in dollars, as required. The solution is consistent.
