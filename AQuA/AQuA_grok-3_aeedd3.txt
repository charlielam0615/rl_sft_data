### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen person from a village of 2,700 people is either male or younger than 70 years old, given the following:
- Total population: 2,700.
- 900 people are over 70 years old.
- 1,200 people are female.
- 60% of females are younger than 70 years old.
- No one is exactly 70 years old.

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the probability into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of males and females in the village.  
2. Calculate the number of females younger than 70 years old.  
3. Determine the number of people younger than 70 years old (total).  
4. Identify the number of people who are either male or younger than 70 years old using set theory (union of sets).  
5. Compute the probability by dividing the favorable outcomes by the total population.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the number of males and females in the village. Use the total population and given number of females to find the number of males.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total population is 2,700, and 1,200 people are female.  
Number of males = Total population - Number of females = 2,700 - 1,200 = 1,500.  
Thus, there are 1,500 males and 1,200 females.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the number of females younger than 70 years old. Use the given information that 60% of females are younger than 70 years old.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Number of females = 1,200.  
Percentage of females younger than 70 = 60%.  
Number of females younger than 70 = 60% of 1,200 = 0.6 Ã— 1,200 = 720.  
Number of females over 70 = 1,200 - 720 = 480.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the total number of people younger than 70 years old. Use the number of people over 70 and the total population, and verify using the number of females younger than 70.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total population = 2,700.  
Number of people over 70 = 900.  
Number of people younger than 70 = 2,700 - 900 = 1,800.  
To verify, consider females:  
- Females younger than 70 = 720 (from Step 3).  
- Males younger than 70 = Total younger than 70 - Females younger than 70 = 1,800 - 720 = 1,080.  
This is consistent, as the number of males is 1,500, and males over 70 = 1,500 - 1,080 = 420.  
Total over 70 = Females over 70 + Males over 70 = 480 + 420 = 900, which matches the given data.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the probability that a randomly chosen person is either male or younger than 70 years old.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of males and females (completed: 1,500 males, 1,200 females).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of females younger than 70 (completed: 720 females).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the total number of people younger than 70 (completed: 1,800 people).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the number of people who are either male or younger than 70 (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the probability (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the number of people who are either male or younger than 70 years old.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to find the number of people who are either male or younger than 70 years old. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the sets of males and people younger than 70.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let:  
- \( A \): Set of males (|A| = 1,500).  
- \( B \): Set of people younger than 70 (|B| = 1,800).  
We need \( |A \cup B| \), the number of people who are either male or younger than 70.  
Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]  
- \( |A \cap B| \): Number of males younger than 70 = 1,080 (from Step 4).  
- \( |A \cup B| = 1,500 + 1,800 - 1,080 = 3,300 - 1,080 = 2,220 \).  
Verify: Total population = 2,700. People neither male nor younger than 70 are females over 70 = 480 (from Step 3).  
Thus, people who are either male or younger than 70 = 2,700 - 480 = 2,220, which matches.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the calculations so far, ensuring consistency across all computed values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check consistency:  
- Total population: 2,700.  
- Males: 1,500; Females: 1,200 (Step 2).  
- Females younger than 70: 720; Females over 70: 480 (Step 3).  
- Total younger than 70: 1,800; Total over 70: 900 (Step 4).  
- Males younger than 70: 1,080; Males over 70: 420 (Step 4).  
- People either male or younger than 70: 2,220 (Step 6).  
Cross-check:  
- Total over 70 = Females over 70 + Males over 70 = 480 + 420 = 900 (matches).  
- Total younger than 70 = Females younger than 70 + Males younger than 70 = 720 + 1,080 = 1,800 (matches).  
- People neither male nor younger than 70 = Females over 70 = 480.  
- Total population = 2,220 + 480 = 2,700 (matches).  
All calculations are consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the probability that a randomly chosen person is either male or younger than 70 years old. Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total population.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Favorable outcomes (people who are either male or younger than 70) = 2,220 (from Step 6).  
Total population = 2,700.  
Probability = \( \frac{2,220}{2,700} \).  
Simplify: \( \frac{2,220 \div 30}{2,700 \div 30} = \frac{74}{90} = \frac{37}{45} \).  
Decimal (optional): \( \frac{37}{45} \approx 0.8222 \).  
Thus, the probability is \( \frac{37}{45} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to confirm the final probability by recalling relevant calculations and ensuring no information was overlooked.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- Total population: 2,700 (Step 2).  
- Males: 1,500; Females: 1,200 (Step 2).  
- Females younger than 70: 720; Females over 70: 480 (Step 3).  
- Total younger than 70: 1,800; Males younger than 70: 1,080 (Step 4).  
- People either male or younger than 70: 2,220 (Step 6).  
- Probability: \( \frac{2,220}{2,700} = \frac{37}{45} \) (Step 8).  
- Validation confirmed consistency across all groups (Step 7).  
No information contradicts the final probability. The condition that no one is exactly 70 years old was accounted for by assuming a clear split between younger than 70 and over 70.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The probability that a randomly chosen person is either male or younger than 70 years old is \( \frac{37}{45} \approx 0.8222 \).

\[ \boxed{\frac{37}{45}} \]
