### Problem Statement
We need to determine the values of \( p \) for which a company makes a profit when producing and selling a batch of widgets. The cost to produce a batch is \( p + 5 \) dollars, and the revenue from selling a batch is \( p(6 - p) \) dollars. Profit is made when revenue exceeds cost.

Let’s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the values of \( p \) where the company makes a profit, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the profit function by subtracting cost from revenue.  
2. Set up an inequality to find where profit is positive.  
3. Solve the inequality to determine the range of \( p \).  
4. Consider any constraints on \( p \) (e.g., non-negative prices or realistic values).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the profit function. Achieve this by expressing profit as revenue minus cost, using the given expressions for revenue (\( p(6 - p) \)) and cost (\( p + 5 \)).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Profit is defined as revenue minus cost. Given:  
- Revenue = \( p(6 - p) \)  
- Cost = \( p + 5 \)  

The profit function \( P(p) \) is:  
\[ P(p) = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = p(6 - p) - (p + 5) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ P(p) = p(6 - p) - p - 5 = 6p - p^2 - p - 5 = -p^2 + 5p - 5 \]  
The profit function is \( P(p) = -p^2 + 5p - 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an inequality for positive profit. Achieve this by setting the profit function greater than zero and simplifying the inequality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the company to make a profit, profit must be positive:  
\[ P(p) > 0 \]  
Using the profit function from Step 2:  
\[ -p^2 + 5p - 5 > 0 \]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) (and reverse the inequality sign):  
\[ p^2 - 5p + 5 < 0 \]  
The inequality to solve is:  
\[ p^2 - 5p + 5 < 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic inequality \( p^2 - 5p + 5 < 0 \). Achieve this by finding the roots of the corresponding equation \( p^2 - 5p + 5 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula, then determining the interval where the quadratic is negative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \( p^2 - 5p + 5 = 0 \) to find the roots:  
Use the quadratic formula \( p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), \( c = 5 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]  
\[ p = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]  
Roots are:  
\[ p_1 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx \frac{5 + 2.236}{2} \approx 3.618 \]  
\[ p_2 = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx \frac{5 - 2.236}{2} \approx 1.382 \]  

The quadratic \( p^2 - 5p + 5 \) is a parabola opening upward (since the coefficient of \( p^2 \) is positive). It is negative between the roots:  
\[ \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < p < \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]  
Approximate interval: \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine values of \( p \) for which the company makes a profit.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the profit function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an inequality for positive profit (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the inequality (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Consider constraints on \( p \) (e.g., non-negative prices).  

**Current Goal**: Consider constraints on \( p \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to consider constraints on \( p \). Achieve this by analyzing the revenue and cost expressions to ensure \( p \) is realistic (e.g., non-negative revenue and cost, and domain of the revenue function).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Cost**: \( p + 5 \). Since cost is a dollar amount, assume \( p + 5 \geq 0 \), so \( p \geq -5 \). However, negative prices are typically unrealistic, so consider \( p \geq 0 \).  
- **Revenue**: \( p(6 - p) \). Revenue should be non-negative:  
  \[ p(6 - p) \geq 0 \]  
  Solve: \( p = 0 \) or \( 6 - p = 0 \implies p = 6 \). Since the parabola \( p(6 - p) \) opens downward, revenue is non-negative for \( 0 \leq p \leq 6 \).  
- **Intersection with profit condition**: The profit condition from Step 4 is \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \). Since this interval is within \( 0 \leq p \leq 6 \), and \( p \geq 0 \) is reasonable for price, the constraint \( p > 0 \) is appropriate (since \( p = 0 \) yields zero revenue and negative profit).  

Thus, the profit condition remains:  
\[ \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < p < \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution. Achieve this by testing values inside, outside, and at the boundaries of the interval \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \) to confirm the profit is positive within this range and non-positive outside.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the profit function \( P(p) = -p^2 + 5p - 5 \):  
- **Inside the interval**: Choose \( p = 2 \):  
  \[ P(2) = -(2)^2 + 5 \cdot 2 - 5 = -4 + 10 - 5 = 1 \]  
  Profit is positive (\( 1 > 0 \)).  
- **Boundary**: Choose \( p \approx 1.382 \):  
  \[ P\left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) = -\left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 + 5 \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 5 \]  
  Compute: \( \left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25 - 10\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{30 - 10\sqrt{5}}{4} \). This is complex, but from Step 4, we know it’s a root, so \( P \approx 0 \). Numerically, \( P(1.382) \approx 0 \).  
- **Outside (below)**: Choose \( p = 1 \):  
  \[ P(1) = -(1)^2 + 5 \cdot 1 - 5 = -1 + 5 - 5 = -1 \]  
  Profit is negative.  
- **Outside (above)**: Choose \( p = 4 \):  
  \[ P(4) = -(4)^2 + 5 \cdot 4 - 5 = -16 + 20 - 5 = -1 \]  
  Profit is negative.  

The tests confirm profit is positive for \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the answer by summarizing the solution and ensuring all relevant information is considered. Retrieve information related to the profit condition and constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the answer.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 2: Profit function is \( P(p) = -p^2 + 5p - 5 \).  
- From Step 3: Profit is positive when \( p^2 - 5p + 5 < 0 \).  
- From Step 4: Solution to the inequality is \( \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < p < \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), approximately \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \).  
- From Step 6: Constraints ensure \( p > 0 \), and revenue is non-negative for \( 0 \leq p \leq 6 \). The profit interval satisfies these constraints.  
- From Step 7: Validation confirmed the interval is correct.  

The values of \( p \) for positive profit are consistent across steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The company makes a profit for:
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < p < \dfrac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} \]  
Approximate numerical interval: \( 1.382 < p < 3.618 \).
