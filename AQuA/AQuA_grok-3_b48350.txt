**Problem Restatement:**  
In Town X, 120% of the population are employed (implying the population is a reference value, and the employed population exceeds it, possibly indicating an error or specific context, but we’ll assume the total population is 100% for simplicity unless clarified), and 80% of the population are employed males. We need to find what percentage of the employed people in Town X are females.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the percentage of employed people who are females:  
1. Determine the percentage of the population that are employed females.  
2. Calculate the percentage of employed females out of the total employed population.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine the percentage of the population that are employed females.  
- **How to Achieve:** Subtract the percentage of employed males (80%) from the total employed population (120%) to find the percentage of employed females, assuming the total population is 100%.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given that 120% of the population are employed and 80% of the population are employed males, the percentage of employed females is:  
120% (total employed) - 80% (employed males) = 40%.  
So, 40% of the population are employed females.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the percentage of employed females out of the total employed population.  
- **How to Achieve:** Divide the percentage of employed females (40%) by the total employed percentage (120%) and multiply by 100 to find the percentage of employed people who are females.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The percentage of employed people who are females is:  
(40% / 120%) × 100 = (40 / 120) × 100 = (1/3) × 100 ≈ 33.33%.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the calculation that 33.33% of employed people are females.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the calculations by confirming the employed females’ percentage and ensuring the sum of employed males and females matches the total employed population.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Employed females: 40% of the population.  
- Employed males: 80% of the population.  
- Total employed: 120% of the population.  
- Check: 80% (males) + 40% (females) = 120% (total employed), which holds.  
- Percentage of employed females: (40 / 120) × 100 = 33.33%.  
- Alternatively, if 80% are employed males, then 80/120 = 2/3 = 66.67% of employed people are males. Thus, 100% - 66.67% = 33.33% are females, confirming the result.  
The calculations are consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the percentage of employed people in Town X who are females.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the percentage of the population that are employed females (completed: 40%).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the percentage of employed females out of the total employed population (completed: 33.33%).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations (completed).  
**Current Goal:** Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The percentage of employed people in Town X who are females is approximately 33.33%.
