### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many positive even integers less than 100 contain at least one digit that is either 3 or 9. This includes one-digit numbers (1 to 9) and two-digit numbers (10 to 99), but we only count those that are even and have at least one 3 or 9 in their digits.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals and highlighting the current focus.  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Count positive even integers less than 100 with at least one digit 3 or 9.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the range of positive even integers less than 100.  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for a number to contain at least one digit 3 or 9.  
  - Subgoal 3: Count one-digit even numbers with 3 or 9.  
  - Subgoal 4: Count two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9.  
  - Subgoal 5: Sum the counts from one-digit and two-digit numbers.  
**Current Goal:** Start with Subgoal 1 to define the range of numbers.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the range of positive even integers less than 100. This involves listing all positive even integers from 1 to 99 and understanding their structure (one-digit or two-digit).  
**How to achieve:** List the even numbers by considering their divisibility by 2 and categorize them by the number of digits.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Positive even integers less than 100 are numbers divisible by 2, ranging from 2 to 98.  
- **One-digit even numbers**: 2, 4, 6, 8 (since 0 is not positive).  
- **Two-digit even numbers**: 10, 12, ..., 98.  
To confirm the range, note that 100 is not included (less than 100). The two-digit even numbers can be represented as 10 to 98, incrementing by 2, giving us 45 numbers (from 10 to 98: (98 - 10)/2 + 1 = 45).  
Total even integers: 4 (one-digit) + 45 (two-digit) = 49 even numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to determine the condition for a number to contain at least one digit 3 or 9.  
**How to achieve:** Analyze the digits of each number. For one-digit numbers, the number itself is the digit. For two-digit numbers, check both the tens and units digits for the presence of 3 or 9.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A number contains at least one digit 3 or 9 if:  
- For one-digit numbers: The number itself is 3 or 9.  
- For two-digit numbers: At least one of the tens digit or units digit is 3 or 9.  
This condition will guide the counting in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to count one-digit even numbers that contain 3 or 9.  
**How to achieve:** List the one-digit even numbers and check which ones are 3 or 9.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
One-digit even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8.  
Check each:  
- 2: No 3 or 9.  
- 4: No 3 or 9.  
- 6: No 3 or 9.  
- 8: No 3 or 9.  
None of these numbers are 3 or 9.  
**Count of one-digit even numbers with 3 or 9**: 0.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to count two-digit even numbers (10 to 98) that contain at least one 3 or 9.  
**How to achieve:** Use a combinatorial approach to count two-digit even numbers (tens digit from 1 to 9, units digit from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) where at least one digit is 3 or 9. It’s easier to count all two-digit even numbers and subtract those with no 3 or 9.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Total two-digit even numbers**:  
- Tens digit: 1 to 9 (9 choices).  
- Units digit: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 choices, since even).  
- Total: 9 × 5 = 45 numbers.  

**Two-digit even numbers with no 3 or 9**:  
- Tens digit: Exclude 3 and 9, so choices are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (7 choices).  
- Units digit: Exclude 3 and 9 from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, so choices are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 choices).  
- Total: 7 × 5 = 35 numbers.  

**Two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9**:  
- 45 − 35 = 10 numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the count of two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9.  
**How to achieve:** Double-check the combinatorial calculation by explicitly listing some numbers or using an alternative method, such as inclusion-exclusion, to confirm the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use inclusion-exclusion for two-digit even numbers (tens: 1 to 9, units: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8):  
- Let A = numbers with at least one 3.  
- Let B = numbers with at least one 9.  
- |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|.  

1. **|A| (at least one 3)**:  
   - Tens = 3, units = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8: 1 × 5 = 5 numbers.  
   - Tens = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (7 choices), units = 3: 7 × 1 = 7 numbers.  
   - Total |A| = 5 + 7 = 12 (subtract overlap later).  

2. **|B| (at least one 9)**:  
   - Tens = 9, units = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8: 1 × 5 = 5 numbers.  
   - Tens = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (7 choices), units = 9: 7 × 1 = 7 numbers.  
   - Total |B| = 5 + 7 = 12.  

3. **|A ∩ B| (has both 3 and 9)**:  
   - Tens = 3, units = 9: 1 number (39).  
   - Tens = 9, units = 3: 1 number (93).  
   - Total |A ∩ B| = 2.  

4. **Inclusion-exclusion**:  
   - |A ∪ B| = 12 + 12 − 2 = 22.  

This suggests 22 numbers, which differs from 10. Re-evaluate: The inclusion-exclusion counts numbers with 3 or 9 in any position, but we need even numbers. Let’s correct by ensuring the units digit is even:  
- **|A|**: Tens = 3, units = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 numbers). Units = 3 not possible (odd).  
- **|B|**: Tens = 9, units = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 numbers). Units = 9 not possible (odd).  
- **|A ∩ B|**: No number has both 3 and 9 with an even units digit (39, 93 are odd).  
- |A ∪ B| = 5 + 5 − 0 = 10.  

This matches the previous count (10), confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to sum the counts of one-digit and two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9.  
**How to achieve:** Add the counts from previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- One-digit even numbers with 3 or 9: 0 (from Step 5).  
- Two-digit even numbers with 3 or 9: 10 (from Step 6, validated in Step 7).  
- Total = 0 + 10 = 10 numbers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the final count.  
**How to achieve:** List the two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9 to confirm the count of 10.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
List two-digit even numbers with at least one 3 or 9:  
- Tens = 3: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 (5 numbers).  
- Tens = 9: 90, 92, 94, 96, 98 (5 numbers).  
- Check for units = 3 or 9: Not possible since units must be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (even).  
- Total: 5 + 5 = 10 numbers.  
This matches the count from Step 6 and Step 7, confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The number of positive even integers less than 100 that contain at least one digit 3 or 9 is **10**.
