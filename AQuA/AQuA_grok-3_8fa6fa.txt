**Problem Statement:**  
Ramesh can complete a work in 20 days, and Sushil can complete the same work in 25 days. They work together for 5 days, after which Sushil leaves. We need to determine how many additional days Ramesh will take to complete the remaining work.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Calculate the work rates of Ramesh and Sushil.  
2. Determine the amount of work completed when they work together for 5 days.  
3. Calculate the remaining work after 5 days.  
4. Determine how many days Ramesh needs to complete the remaining work alone.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to calculate the work rates of Ramesh and Sushil. This will be achieved by finding the fraction of work each can complete in one day based on the given time to complete the entire work.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Ramesh completes the work in 20 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{20} \) of the work per day.  
Sushil completes the work in 25 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{25} \) of the work per day.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to calculate the amount of work completed when Ramesh and Sushil work together for 5 days. This will be achieved by summing their individual work rates and multiplying by the number of days they work together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Combined work rate of Ramesh and Sushil:  
\[ \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{25} = \frac{5 + 4}{100} = \frac{9}{100} \text{ work per day} \]  
Work completed in 5 days:  
\[ 5 \times \frac{9}{100} = \frac{45}{100} = \frac{9}{20} \text{ of the work} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to calculate the remaining work after Ramesh and Sushil work together for 5 days. This will be achieved by subtracting the work completed from the total work (1 whole work).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total work is 1. Work completed in 5 days is \( \frac{9}{20} \).  
Remaining work:  
\[ 1 - \frac{9}{20} = \frac{20 - 9}{20} = \frac{11}{20} \text{ of the work} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to determine how many days Ramesh needs to complete the remaining work alone. This will be achieved by dividing the remaining work by Ramesh’s work rate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Remaining work is \( \frac{11}{20} \). Ramesh’s work rate is \( \frac{1}{20} \) work per day.  
Days required by Ramesh:  
\[ \frac{\frac{11}{20}}{\frac{1}{20}} = \frac{11}{20} \times 20 = 11 \text{ days} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Determine how many days Ramesh needs to complete the remaining work after working with Sushil for 5 days.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the work rates of Ramesh and Sushil (completed: \( \frac{1}{20} \) and \( \frac{1}{25} \) work per day).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate work done together in 5 days (completed: \( \frac{9}{20} \) work).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate remaining work (completed: \( \frac{11}{20} \) work).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate days for Ramesh to complete remaining work (completed: 11 days).  
**Current Goal:** Verify the solution by reviewing the calculations.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to verify the correctness of the solution by checking the calculations and logic. This will be achieved by re-evaluating the steps and ensuring the total work and time align with the problem’s conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify:  
- Work rates: Ramesh (\( \frac{1}{20} \)), Sushil (\( \frac{1}{25} \)), combined (\( \frac{9}{100} \)). Correct.  
- Work in 5 days: \( 5 \times \frac{9}{100} = \frac{45}{100} = \frac{9}{20} \). Correct.  
- Remaining work: \( 1 - \frac{9}{20} = \frac{11}{20} \). Correct.  
- Days for Ramesh: \( \frac{\frac{11}{20}}{\frac{1}{20}} = 11 \). Correct.  
Total work check: Work done together (\( \frac{9}{20} \)) + work by Ramesh alone (\( \frac{11}{20} \)) = \( \frac{9}{20} + \frac{11}{20} = 1 \). The entire work is completed.  
Total days: 5 (together) + 11 (Ramesh alone) = 16 days. Ramesh’s total work time is 5 + 11 = 16 days, which is less than 20 days, consistent with his rate.  
The solution is valid.

**Final Answer:**  
Ramesh will complete the remaining work in **11 days**.
