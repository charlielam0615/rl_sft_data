**Problem Statement:**  
A student is ranked 16th from the right and 6th from the left in a group. We need to determine the total number of students in the group.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the ranking system and what "16th from the right" and "6th from the left" mean.  
2. Develop a method to calculate the total number of students based on these rankings.  
3. Validate the calculation to ensure correctness.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
Current goal: Calculate the total number of students using the given rankings.  
How to achieve it: Interpret the rankings as positions in a linear arrangement. The student is the 6th student from the left (meaning 5 students are to their left) and 16th from the right (meaning 15 students are to their right). Add these positions and account for the student themselves to find the total number of students.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The student’s position is 6th from the left, so there are 5 students before them. They are 16th from the right, so there are 15 students after them. The total number of students is calculated as:  
- Students to the left: 5  
- The student themselves: 1  
- Students to the right: 15  
Total = 5 + 1 + 15 = 21 students.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
Current goal: Verify the correctness of the calculated total (21 students).  
How to achieve it: Check if the student being 6th from the left and 16th from the right is consistent with a total of 21 students.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In a group of 21 students, the student’s position is 6th from the left, so their position number is 6. From the right, their position is:  
Total students - Position from left + 1 = 21 - 6 + 1 = 16.  
This matches the given information (16th from the right). Thus, the calculation is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Determine the total number of students.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the ranking system (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of students (completed: 21 students).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: calculation is consistent).  
**Current Goal:** Finalize the solution as the calculation and validation are complete.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
The total number of students is 21.
