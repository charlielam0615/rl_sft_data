**Problem Restatement**: A solution has 8 parts water for every 7 parts lemonade syrup. We need to determine how many parts of this solution should be removed and replaced with water to achieve a solution with 40% lemonade syrup.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the initial composition of the solution (ratio of water to lemonade syrup).  
2. Express the initial concentration of lemonade syrup.  
3. Set up the condition for the final concentration (40% lemonade syrup) after removing and replacing some solution with water.  
4. Formulate equations based on the amount of lemonade syrup remaining constant.  
5. Solve for the amount of solution to be removed and replaced.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the initial composition and concentration of the solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the given ratio of 8 parts water to 7 parts lemonade syrup to find the total parts and the initial percentage of lemonade syrup.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solution has 8 parts water and 7 parts lemonade syrup, so the total parts are:  
\[ 8 + 7 = 15 \text{ parts} \]  
The initial concentration of lemonade syrup is:  
\[ \frac{7}{15} \times 100 \approx 46.67\% \]  
This confirms the starting composition: 8/15 water and 7/15 lemonade syrup.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Define the next subgoals to achieve the 40% lemonade syrup concentration:  
1. Let \( x \) be the parts of solution removed and replaced with water.  
2. Since the lemonade syrup amount remains constant (only water is added), express the syrup amount before and after the replacement.  
3. Set up an equation where the final concentration of lemonade syrup equals 40%.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up the equation for the lemonade syrup concentration after removal and replacement.  
**How to Achieve**: Assume the initial solution has 15 parts (to match the ratio 8:7). Calculate the lemonade syrup after removing \( x \) parts and adding \( x \) parts water, then set the concentration to 40%.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assume the initial solution has 15 parts (8 water + 7 lemonade syrup).  
- Initial lemonade syrup: 7 parts.  
- When \( x \) parts of solution are removed, the fraction of lemonade syrup removed is \( \frac{7}{15}x \), so lemonade syrup remaining is:  
\[ 7 - \frac{7}{15}x \]  
- Total solution after removing \( x \) parts and adding \( x \) parts water remains 15 parts.  
- Final lemonade syrup concentration is 40% (or 0.4), so:  
\[ \frac{7 - \frac{7}{15}x}{15} = 0.4 \]  
Multiply through by 15:  
\[ 7 - \frac{7}{15}x = 6 \]  
Subtract 7:  
\[ -\frac{7}{15}x = -1 \]  
Multiply by \(-\frac{15}{7}\):  
\[ x = \frac{15}{7} \approx 2.1429 \text{ parts} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if removing and replacing \( \frac{15}{7} \) parts results in 40% lemonade syrup.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = \frac{15}{7} \) back into the concentration equation and confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Initial lemonade syrup: 7 parts.  
Amount removed: \( x = \frac{15}{7} \).  
Lemonade syrup removed: \( \frac{7}{15} \times \frac{15}{7} = 1 \).  
Remaining lemonade syrup: \( 7 - 1 = 6 \).  
Total solution remains 15 parts.  
Final concentration:  
\[ \frac{6}{15} = 0.4 = 40\% \]  
The calculation is correct, as the final concentration is exactly 40%.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many parts of the solution to remove and replace with water to achieve 40% lemonade syrup.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine initial composition (completed: 8 water + 7 syrup = 15 parts, 46.67% syrup).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equation for final concentration (completed: equation based on constant syrup amount).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( x \) (completed: \( x = \frac{15}{7} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solution (completed: confirmed 40% concentration).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as validated.

### Final Answer
Remove and replace \( \frac{15}{7} \approx 2.1429 \) parts of the solution with water to achieve a 40% lemonade syrup concentration.
