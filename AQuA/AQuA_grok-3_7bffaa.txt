### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the total weekly revenue \( R \) from selling cars priced at $15,000 each, given the relationship between the number of cars sold per week \( x \) and the price per car \( y \) in dollars, described by the equation \( x = 800,000 - 50y \). Revenue is calculated as the product of the number of cars sold and the price per car, i.e., \( R = x \cdot y \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total weekly revenue:  
1. Substitute the given price \( y = 15,000 \) into the equation \( x = 800,000 - 50y \) to find the number of cars sold \( x \).  
2. Calculate the revenue \( R \) using the formula \( R = x \cdot y \).  
3. Ensure the solution is in dollars as requested.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the number of cars sold \( x \) when the price \( y = 15,000 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = 15,000 \) into the given equation \( x = 800,000 - 50y \) and perform the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( y = 15,000 \) into the equation:  
\[ x = 800,000 - 50 \cdot 15,000 \]  
Calculate the term:  
\[ 50 \cdot 15,000 = 750,000 \]  
So:  
\[ x = 800,000 - 750,000 = 50,000 \]  
Thus, 50,000 cars are sold per week when the price is $15,000.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of \( x \) to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate \( x \) using the equation and check if the result is consistent, ensuring no arithmetic errors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate:  
\[ x = 800,000 - 50 \cdot 15,000 \]  
\[ 50 \cdot 15,000 = 750,000 \]  
\[ x = 800,000 - 750,000 = 50,000 \]  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming that \( x = 50,000 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total weekly revenue \( R \) using the formula \( R = x \cdot y \).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the number of cars sold \( x = 50,000 \) by the price per car \( y = 15,000 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate revenue:  
\[ R = x \cdot y = 50,000 \cdot 15,000 \]  
\[ 50,000 \cdot 15,000 = 750,000,000 \]  
So, the total weekly revenue is $750,000,000.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the revenue calculation to ensure accuracy.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate \( R = x \cdot y \) and check for consistency, ensuring the units are in dollars as required.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate:  
\[ R = 50,000 \cdot 15,000 = 750,000,000 \]  
The result is consistent. Since \( y \) is in dollars and \( x \) is the number of cars, \( R = x \cdot y \) gives revenue in dollars, which matches the problemâ€™s requirement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total weekly revenue \( R \) for cars priced at $15,000.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute the number of cars sold \( x \) using \( x = 800,000 - 50y \) with \( y = 15,000 \). (Completed: \( x = 50,000 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate revenue \( R = x \cdot y \). (Completed: \( R = 750,000,000 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify calculations for accuracy. (Completed for both \( x \) and \( R \))  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution as the revenue has been computed and verified.

### Final Answer
The total weekly revenue from selling cars priced at $15,000 is $750,000,000.
