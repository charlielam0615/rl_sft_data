**Problem Restatement**: A train traveling at 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 seconds. We need to find the length of the train.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the length of the train, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert the train’s speed from km/hr to m/s for consistency with the time unit (seconds).  
2. Use the relationship between speed, time, and distance to calculate the length of the train, as the train crosses a pole (a point) in the given time.  
3. Verify the solution for correctness.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert the train’s speed from 60 km/hr to m/s.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the conversion factor where 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s. Multiply 60 by 5/18 to get the speed in meters per second.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Convert 60 km/hr to m/s:  
\[ 60 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{60 \times 5}{18} = \frac{300}{18} = \frac{50}{3} \text{ m/s} \]  
The train’s speed is \( \frac{50}{3} \) m/s or approximately 16.67 m/s.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the length of the train using the speed and time.  
**How to Achieve**: The length of the train is the distance it travels while crossing the pole, which can be found using the formula: distance = speed × time. Use the speed from Step 2 (\( \frac{50}{3} \) m/s) and the given time (9 seconds).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the length of the train:  
\[ \text{Length} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{50}{3} \times 9 = 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ meters} \]  
The length of the train is 150 meters.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated train length.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the length using an alternative method or check units and logic. Ensure the speed conversion and distance formula are applied correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the calculation:  
- Speed conversion: 60 km/hr = \( 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = \frac{60000}{3600} = \frac{50}{3} \) m/s (correct).  
- Length: \( \frac{50}{3} \times 9 = 150 \) meters.  
- Alternative check: Convert time to hours (9 seconds = \( \frac{9}{3600} = \frac{1}{400} \) hours). Distance = \( 60 \times \frac{1}{400} = 0.15 \) km = 150 meters.  
The calculations are consistent, and units (meters for length) are appropriate.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the length of the train.  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert speed from 60 km/hr to m/s (completed: \( \frac{50}{3} \) m/s).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the train’s length using speed and time (completed: 150 meters).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: calculations consistent).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the length of the train has been calculated and verified.

**Final Answer**: The length of the train is 150 meters.
