**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the total number of pets into intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to sum the number of each type of pet (parrots, fish, rabbits, dogs). Subgoals:  
1. Identify the number of each type of pet.  
2. Add the numbers together to get the total.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the number of each type of pet and sum them to find the total number of pets. This will be achieved by listing the given quantities and performing addition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
James has:  
- 10 parrots  
- 4 fish  
- 9 rabbits  
- 6 dogs  

To find the total number of pets, add these quantities:  
10 + 4 + 9 + 6 = 29  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify the correctness of the total number of pets (29) by checking the addition and ensuring all pet types are included.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the sum:  
10 (parrots) + 4 (fish) + 9 (rabbits) + 6 (dogs) = 29  
Confirm that all pet types (parrots, fish, rabbits, dogs) are included in the calculation. The addition is correct:  
- 10 + 4 = 14  
- 14 + 9 = 23  
- 23 + 6 = 29  
The total of 29 pets is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of pets James has.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the number of each type of pet (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the numbers to find the total (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed).  

**Current Goal:** The main goal of calculating the total number of pets has been achieved, with a validated result of 29 pets. No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
James has a total of 29 pets.
