**Problem Restatement**: John was 35 years old when he married Betty. They have been married for 5 years, and Betty's current age is 7/8 of John's current age. We need to determine Betty's current age.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find Betty's current age.  
1. Determine John's current age based on his age at marriage and the years since.  
2. Express Betty's current age as a fraction of John's current age.  
3. Set up an equation to solve for Betty's current age.  
4. Solve the equation and verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate John's current age.  
How to Achieve: John was 35 years old when he married Betty, and they have been married for 5 years. Add 5 years to John's age at marriage to find his current age.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
John's age at marriage was 35 years. Since 5 years have passed, his current age is:  
35 + 5 = 40 years.  
So, John is currently 40 years old.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express Betty's current age in terms of John's current age and set up an equation.  
How to Achieve: Betty's current age is 7/8 of John's current age. Using John's current age from the previous step, write an equation for Betty's age.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
John's current age is 40 years. Betty's current age is 7/8 of John's age, so:  
Betty's age = (7/8) × 40.  
Calculate:  
(7/8) × 40 = (7 × 40) / 8 = 280 / 8 = 35.  
So, Betty's current age is 35 years.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution for Betty's age.  
How to Achieve: Check if Betty's age (35 years) satisfies the condition that it is 7/8 of John's age (40 years). Additionally, consider the ages at the time of marriage to ensure consistency.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Verify the fraction condition:  
Betty's age = 35 years, John's age = 40 years.  
Calculate 7/8 of John's age: (7/8) × 40 = 35, which matches Betty's age.  
2. Check consistency with marriage information:  
Five years ago, at the time of marriage, John was 35 years old. Betty's current age is 35, so five years ago, Betty was 35 − 5 = 30 years old. This is consistent, as the problem does not provide constraints on Betty's age at marriage.  
The solution satisfies all given conditions.

Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine Betty's current age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate John's current age (completed: 40 years).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express Betty's age as 7/8 of John's age and solve (completed: Betty's age = 35 years).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: solution is consistent).  
Current Goal: Completed (Betty's current age is 35 years).  
The solution process is complete, and no further subgoals are needed.
