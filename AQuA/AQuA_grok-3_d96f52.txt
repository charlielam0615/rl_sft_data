### Problem Statement
We need to identify the odd man out in the sequence of numbers: 1, 8, 27, 60, 125. This means determining which number does not follow the pattern or rule that the others share.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to identify the odd man out.  
Subgoals:  
1. Analyze the sequence to identify a potential pattern (e.g., mathematical relationship, sequence type).  
2. Test each number against the identified pattern.  
3. Determine which number deviates from the pattern.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to analyze the sequence to identify a potential pattern. This will be achieved by examining the numbers (1, 8, 27, 60, 125) for common mathematical properties, such as whether they are perfect cubes, squares, or follow another sequence.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let’s examine the numbers:  
- 1 = 1³ (1 cubed)  
- 8 = 2³ (2 cubed)  
- 27 = 3³ (3 cubed)  
- 60: Check if 60 is a perfect cube. The cube root of 60 is approximately 3.915 (since 3³ = 27 and 4³ = 64), so 60 is not a perfect cube.  
- 125 = 5³ (5 cubed)  

Observation: 1, 8, 27, and 125 are perfect cubes (1³, 2³, 3³, 5³), but 60 is not. This suggests a pattern where most numbers are perfect cubes, and 60 may be the odd man out. Let’s explore if there’s another pattern (e.g., arithmetic or geometric sequence) to confirm.  
- Differences between consecutive numbers: 8 − 1 = 7, 27 − 8 = 19, 60 − 27 = 33, 125 − 60 = 65. These differences (7, 19, 33, 65) are not consistent, so it’s not an arithmetic sequence.  
- Ratios: 8/1 = 8, 27/8 = 3.375, 60/27 ≈ 2.222, 125/60 ≈ 2.083. The ratios are not constant, so it’s not a geometric sequence.  
The perfect cube pattern seems most prominent, as 60 is the only number that doesn’t fit.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether 60 is indeed the odd man out by confirming that the pattern of perfect cubes (1³, 2³, 3³, 5³) applies to all numbers except 60, and checking if another pattern better explains the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reconfirm the perfect cube pattern:  
- Numbers: 1 (1³), 8 (2³), 27 (3³), 60 (not a perfect cube), 125 (5³).  
- The sequence of cube roots is 1, 2, 3, ?, 5. If 60 were a perfect cube, its cube root would be an integer (e.g., 4³ = 64, which is close but not 60). The expected number for 4³ would be 64, not 60.  
Alternative patterns:  
- Check if numbers are perfect squares: 1 = 1², 8 (not a square, √8 ≈ 2.828), 27 (not a square, √27 ≈ 5.196), 60 (not a square), 125 (not a square). Only 1 is a perfect square, so this pattern doesn’t hold.  
- Check for a polynomial sequence or other mathematical properties: The differences and ratios (calculated in Step 2) don’t suggest a clear alternative pattern.  
Since 1, 8, 27, and 125 are perfect cubes corresponding to cube roots 1, 2, 3, and 5, and 60 does not fit this pattern, 60 is likely the odd man out.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the odd man out in the sequence 1, 8, 27, 60, 125.  
  - Subgoal 1: Analyze the sequence to identify a potential pattern (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Test each number against the identified pattern (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine which number deviates from the pattern (in progress).  
**Current Goal**: Determine which number deviates from the pattern.  
Based on previous steps, the pattern identified is that the numbers are perfect cubes (1³, 2³, 3³, 5³), except for 60, which is not a perfect cube. This supports the conclusion that 60 is the odd man out.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine which number deviates from the pattern and finalize the answer. This will be achieved by concluding that 60 is the odd man out, as it does not fit the perfect cube pattern observed in the other numbers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Based on the analysis:  
- The numbers 1, 8, 27, and 125 are perfect cubes (1³, 2³, 3³, 5³).  
- 60 is not a perfect cube, as its cube root is not an integer, and no other consistent pattern (e.g., arithmetic, geometric, or other mathematical properties) explains the sequence better.  
Thus, the odd man out is 60.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The odd man out in the sequence 1, 8, 27, 60, 125 is **60**.
