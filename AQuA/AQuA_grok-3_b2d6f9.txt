### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many integers between 324,700 and 436,600 (inclusive or exclusive, to be clarified) have a tens digit of 1 and a units digit of 3. This means we are looking for numbers of the form ...13, where the last two digits are 13, and the number lies within the given range.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Clarify whether the range is inclusive or exclusive of the endpoints.  
2. Identify the pattern of numbers ending in 13 (tens digit 1, units digit 3).  
3. Determine the smallest and largest numbers in the range that end in 13.  
4. Calculate how many such numbers exist within the range.  
5. Validate the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clarify whether the range 324,700 to 436,600 is inclusive or exclusive of the endpoints. This will be achieved by making a reasonable assumption based on standard mathematical problem conventions, as the problem does not specify.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the problem does not explicitly state whether the endpoints 324,700 and 436,600 are included, we follow the common convention in number theory problems that "between A and B" typically means inclusive of the endpoints unless otherwise specified. Thus, we assume the range is inclusive: from 324,700 to 436,600, including both 324,700 and 436,600.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the pattern of numbers with tens digit 1 and units digit 3 within the range 324,700 to 436,600. This will be achieved by determining the general form of such numbers, which end in 13.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Numbers with a tens digit of 1 and a units digit of 3 end in the digits 13. Thus, we are looking for integers of the form \( N = 100k + 13 \), where \( k \) is an integer, because:  
- The units digit is 3.  
- The tens digit is 1 (so the last two digits are 13).  
- The factor of 100 accounts for the hundreds place and beyond.  
For example, numbers like 113, 213, 1,013, 10,013, 100,013, etc., fit this pattern. We need these numbers to be within the range [324,700, 436,600].  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the smallest and largest numbers in the range [324,700, 436,600] that end in 13. This will be achieved by adjusting the numbers to have the last two digits as 13 and checking if they fall within the range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the smallest number \( \geq 324,700 \) that ends in 13:  
- Consider the number as \( N = 100k + 13 \).  
- We need \( 100k + 13 \geq 324,700 \).  
- Solve for \( k \):  
  \[
  100k \geq 324,700 - 13 = 324,687 \implies k \geq \frac{324,687}{100} = 3,246.87 \implies k \geq 3,247.
  \]
- Thus, the smallest \( k = 3,247 \).  
- Smallest number: \( 100 \cdot 3,247 + 13 = 324,700 + 13 = 324,713 \).  
- Check: 324,713 has tens digit 1 (from 13) and units digit 3, and \( 324,713 \geq 324,700 \).

To find the largest number \( \leq 436,600 \) that ends in 13:  
- We need \( 100k + 13 \leq 436,600 \).  
- Solve for \( k \):  
  \[
  100k \leq 436,600 - 13 = 436,587 \implies k \leq \frac{436,587}{100} = 4,365.87 \implies k \leq 4,365.
  \]
- Thus, the largest \( k = 4,365 \).  
- Largest number: \( 100 \cdot 4,365 + 13 = 436,500 + 13 = 436,513 \).  
- Check: 436,513 has tens digit 1 and units digit 3, and \( 436,513 \leq 436,600 \).

Thus, the numbers of the form \( 100k + 13 \) must have \( k \) from 3,247 to 4,365, inclusive.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of integers of the form \( 100k + 13 \) where \( k \) ranges from 3,247 to 4,365, inclusive. This will be achieved by counting the number of integers in this range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The numbers are of the form \( 100k + 13 \), with \( k \) from 3,247 to 4,365, inclusive.  
- Number of integers from \( a \) to \( b \) inclusive is \( b - a + 1 \).  
- Here, \( a = 3,247 \), \( b = 4,365 \).  
- Number of \( k \):  
  \[
  4,365 - 3,247 + 1 = 1,118 + 1 = 1,119.
  \]
- Each \( k \) produces a unique number \( 100k + 13 \).  
- Thus, there are 1,119 numbers between 324,713 and 436,513, inclusive, that end in 13.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking if all numbers of the form \( 100k + 13 \) for \( k \) from 3,247 to 4,365 satisfy the conditions and that no numbers are missed. This will be achieved by verifying the endpoints and the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Verify endpoints**:  
  - Smallest number: \( k = 3,247 \), gives \( 100 \cdot 3,247 + 13 = 324,713 \).  
    - Last two digits: 13 (tens = 1, units = 3).  
    - Check range: \( 324,713 \geq 324,700 \), which is true.  
  - Largest number: \( k = 4,365 \), gives \( 100 \cdot 4,365 + 13 = 436,513 \).  
    - Last two digits: 13 (tens = 1, units = 3).  
    - Check range: \( 436,513 \leq 436,600 \), which is true.  
- **Verify sequence**:  
  - The numbers form an arithmetic sequence: \( 324,713, 324,813, 324,913, \ldots, 436,513 \).  
  - Common difference: \( (100k + 13) - (100(k-1) + 13) = 100 \).  
  - Each number ends in 13, satisfying the tens digit = 1 and units digit = 3.  
- **Check for missed numbers**:  
  - Any number ending in 13 must be of the form \( 100k + 13 \).  
  - For numbers outside \( k = 3,247 \) to 4,365:  
    - If \( k = 3,246 \), number = \( 100 \cdot 3,246 + 13 = 324,613 < 324,700 \), outside the range.  
    - If \( k = 4,366 \), number = \( 100 \cdot 4,366 + 13 = 436,613 > 436,600 \), outside the range.  
  - Thus, no numbers ending in 13 are missed within the range.  
- **Recalculate count**:  
  - Sequence terms: First term \( k = 3,247 \), last term \( k = 4,365 \).  
  - Number of terms: \( 4,365 - 3,247 + 1 = 1,119 \), consistent with previous calculation.  
The calculation is valid.
