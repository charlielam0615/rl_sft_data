### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the time it takes for a train of length 200 meters moving at 72 km/h to completely cross another train of length 300 meters moving at 36 km/h in the same direction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the time taken to cross the trains:  
1. Determine the relative speed of the two trains since they are moving in the same direction.  
2. Calculate the total distance to be covered for one train to completely cross the other.  
3. Use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken.  
4. Ensure all units are consistent (convert speeds to m/s if necessary).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the relative speed of the two trains.  
**How to Achieve**: Since both trains are moving in the same direction, subtract the speed of the slower train (36 km/h) from the speed of the faster train (72 km/h) to find the relative speed. Convert the result to meters per second for consistency with the distance units (meters).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The speed of the first train is 72 km/h, and the second train is 36 km/h.  
Relative speed = 72 km/h - 36 km/h = 36 km/h.  
Convert to meters per second:  
\[ 36 \, \text{km/h} = 36 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 36 \times \frac{5}{18} = 10 \, \text{m/s} \]  
The relative speed is 10 m/s.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the total distance to be covered for the first train to completely cross the second train.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the lengths of both trains, as the first train must travel the entire length of both trains to completely cross the second train.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The length of the first train is 200 meters, and the length of the second train is 300 meters.  
Total distance = 200 m + 300 m = 500 meters.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time taken to cross the trains using the formula time = distance / speed.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the relative speed (10 m/s) and the total distance (500 m) to compute the time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Relative speed = 10 m/s.  
Total distance = 500 m.  
Time taken = distance / speed = 500 / 10 = 50 seconds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Recheck the relative speed, total distance, and time calculation. Consider an alternative approach (e.g., solving in km/h) to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Recheck calculations**:  
- Relative speed: 72 km/h - 36 km/h = 36 km/h = 10 m/s (confirmed).  
- Total distance: 200 m + 300 m = 500 m (confirmed).  
- Time: 500 m / 10 m/s = 50 s (confirmed).  

**Alternative approach (in km/h)**:  
Convert distances to kilometers: 200 m = 0.2 km, 300 m = 0.3 km.  
Total distance = 0.2 km + 0.3 km = 0.5 km.  
Relative speed = 36 km/h.  
Time = distance / speed = 0.5 km / 36 km/h = 0.5 / 36 hours = 1/72 hours.  
Convert to seconds: (1/72) Ã— 3600 = 3600 / 72 = 50 seconds.  
The alternative approach yields the same result (50 seconds), confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the time for the first train to cross the second train.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the relative speed (completed: 10 m/s).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total distance (completed: 500 m).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the time using distance and speed (completed: 50 seconds).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: confirmed via alternative approach).  
**Current Goal**: None (problem solved and validated).  
The calculations are complete, and the solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The time taken for the train to cross the other train is 50 seconds.
