--- Case 66 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (5,4) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the agent can move only up, down, left, or right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0]]
```

Where:
- 2 represents the start (0,0),
- 3 represents the destination (5,4),
- 1 represents an obstacle at (5,3),
- 0 represents free cells.

The goal is to compute the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,4) from (0,0) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), we can approach this systematically:
- The agent starts at (0,0) and needs to reach (5,4), which is 5 steps right and 4 steps down in a Manhattan distance sense (total 9 steps if unobstructed).
- The obstacle at (5,3) blocks direct access to (5,4) from (5,3) or (4,3).
- Subgoals:
  1. Move toward the destination by increasing x and/or y coordinates, prioritizing moves that reduce the Manhattan distance (|x-5| + |y-4|).
  2. Avoid the obstacle at (5,3) by ensuring the path does not pass through it.
  3. Reach an intermediate position close to (5,4), such as (5,2), (4,4), or (5,4) itself, while keeping the path valid.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (0,0) toward (5,4) by selecting a valid first step (up, down, left, or right) that reduces the Manhattan distance and avoids invalid moves.  
- **How to Achieve**: From (0,0), valid moves are right to (1,0) or down to (0,1). Moving right reduces the x-distance to 4 (from 5), and moving down reduces the y-distance to 3 (from 4). Since both are equally valid in terms of distance reduction, choose "right" to (1,0) to progress along the x-axis.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (0,0), move right to (1,0). This is a valid move as (1,0) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (1,0).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Reach (5,4) from (0,0) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move toward (5,4) by reducing Manhattan distance.
    - **Current Subgoal**: From (1,0), continue moving toward (5,4).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Avoid the obstacle at (5,3).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reach an intermediate position close to (5,4).

**Current Goal**: From the current position (1,0), select the next move to continue reducing the Manhattan distance to (5,4) while ensuring the path remains valid.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (1,0) toward (5,4) by selecting a valid next step.  
- **How to Achieve**: From (1,0), valid moves are right to (2,0), down to (1,1), or left to (0,0). Moving right to (2,0) reduces the x-distance to 3, moving down to (1,1) reduces the y-distance to 3, and moving left increases the distance. Choose "right" to (2,0) to continue progressing along the x-axis.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,0), move right to (2,0). This is a valid move as (2,0) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (2,0).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the current path from (0,0) to (2,0) is valid and progresses toward (5,4) without hitting the obstacle.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)] against the grid to ensure all positions are free cells and no obstacles are encountered. Assess if the path is still optimal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path so far is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]. Checking the grid:
- (0,0) is the start (2, valid).
- (1,0) is a free cell (0, valid).
- (2,0) is a free cell (0, valid).
No obstacles (1 at (5,3)) have been encountered. The path is valid, and the Manhattan distance from (2,0) to (5,4) is |5-2| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7, indicating progress toward the goal.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From the current position (2,0), continue toward (5,4). Refine subgoals:
- Move closer to (5,4) by prioritizing moves that reduce the Manhattan distance (currently 7).
- Plan to avoid (5,3) when approaching the destination. Since (5,3) is adjacent to (5,4), avoid moving to (5,3) from (4,3) or (5,2).
- Intermediate subgoal: Reach (5,2) or (4,4) to safely approach (5,4). For example, from (2,0), moving right to (3,0) and then down toward (3,4) or (5,2) keeps the path clear of the obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (2,0) toward (5,4), aiming for an intermediate position like (5,2) or (4,4).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (2,0), valid moves are right to (3,0), down to (2,1), or left to (1,0). Moving right to (3,0) reduces the x-distance to 2, moving down to (2,1) reduces the y-distance to 3. Choose "right" to (3,0) to continue along the x-axis toward (5,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,0), move right to (3,0). This is a valid move as (3,0) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (3,0).
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (3,0) toward (5,4), aiming for (5,2) to avoid (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (3,0), valid moves are right to (4,0), down to (3,1), or left to (2,0). Moving right to (4,0) reduces the x-distance to 1, aligning with the subgoal of reaching (5,2) via (5,0). Choose "right" to (4,0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,0), move right to (4,0). This is a valid move as (4,0) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (4,0).
[/IMP]

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (4,0) toward (5,4), aiming for (5,2) to avoid (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (4,0), valid moves are right to (5,0), down to (4,1), or left to (3,0). Moving right to (5,0) reduces the x-distance to 0, aligning with the subgoal of reaching (5,2). Choose "right" to (5,0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,0), move right to (5,0). This is a valid move as (5,0) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (5,0).
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (5,0) toward (5,4), aiming for (5,2) to avoid (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (5,0), valid moves are down to (5,1) or left to (4,0). Moving down to (5,1) reduces the y-distance to 3, progressing toward (5,2). Choose "down" to (5,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,0), move down to (5,1). This is a valid move as (5,1) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (5,1).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (5,1) to (5,4), passing through (5,2) to avoid (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (5,1), valid moves are down to (5,2), up to (5,0), or left to (4,1). Moving down to (5,2) reduces the y-distance to 2 and reaches the intermediate subgoal. Choose "down" to (5,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,1), move down to (5,2). This is a valid move as (5,2) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (5,2).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the path from (0,0) to (5,2) is valid and avoids the obstacle at (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)] against the grid. Ensure no obstacles are encountered and the path is on track to reach (5,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path so far is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)]. Checking the grid:
- All positions are free cells (0 or 2 for start).
- No moves have passed through (5,3) (obstacle).
- Current position (5,2) has a Manhattan distance of |5-5| + |4-2| = 2 to (5,4).
The path is valid, and the next move to (5,4) via (5,3) must be avoided.
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (5,2) to (5,4), avoiding (5,3).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (5,2), valid moves are down to (5,3), up to (5,1), or left to (4,2). Moving down to (5,3) is invalid (obstacle). Moving to (4,2) allows a safe approach to (5,4) via (4,4). Choose "left" to (4,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,2), move left to (4,2). This is a valid move as (4,2) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (4,2).
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (4,2) to (5,4).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (4,2), valid moves are right to (5,2), down to (4,3), up to (4,1), or left to (3,2). Moving down to (4,3) reduces the y-distance to 1 and positions the agent to reach (5,4) via (4,4). Choose "down" to (4,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,2), move down to (4,3). This is a valid move as (4,3) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (4,3).
[/IMP]

### Step 15: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (4,3) to (5,4).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (4,3), valid moves are right to (5,3), down to (4,4), up to (4,2), or left to (3,3). Moving right to (5,3) is invalid (obstacle). Moving down to (4,4) reduces the y-distance to 0 and positions the agent one step from (5,4). Choose "down" to (4,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,3), move down to (4,4). This is a valid move as (4,4) is a free cell (0 in the grid). The new position is (4,4).
[/IMP]

### Step 16: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (4,4) to (5,4).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (4,4), valid moves are right to (5,4), up to (4,3), or left to (3,4). Moving right to (5,4) reaches the destination. Choose "right" to (5,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,4), move right to (5,4). This is a valid move as (5,4) is the destination (3 in the grid). The new position is (5,4).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the complete path from (0,0) to (5,4) is valid and optimal.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the entire path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] against the grid. Ensure no obstacles are encountered and the path length is minimal (Manhattan distance is 9, adjusted for obstacle).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The complete path is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]:
- All positions are free cells (0), start (2), or destination (3).
- The path avoids (5,3) (obstacle).
- Path length: 11 steps (5 right, 4 down, 1 left, 1 right). The Manhattan distance is 9 (5 right + 4 down), but the obstacle at (5,3) forces a detour, making 11 steps reasonable.
The path is valid and reaches (5,4).
[/IMP]

### Step 18: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Reach (5,4) from (0,0) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3) — **Completed**.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move toward (5,4) by reducing Manhattan distance — **Completed**.
  - **Subgoal 2**: Avoid the obstacle at (5,3) — **Completed**.
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reach an intermediate position like (5,2) or (4,4) — **Completed** (reached (4,4) before (5,4)).

**Current Goal**: None, as the destination (5,4) has been reached, and the path has been validated.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,0) to (5,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:

**[(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]**

This path takes 11 steps, which is minimal given the need to detour around (5,3).
