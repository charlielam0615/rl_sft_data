**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (0,2) to the destination at (5,2), while avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]], where 2 marks the start, 3 marks the goal, 1 marks the obstacle, and 0 represents free space. The solution should return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (5,2) from (0,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the start and goal are in the same column (x=2), a direct downward path seems feasible. However, I must ensure no obstacles block this path. The obstacle at (0,4) is not in column 2, so a direct path downward along column 2 should work. I will set intermediate subgoals as moving down one row at a time: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2).

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,2) from (0,2)  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,2) to (1,2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,2) to (2,2)

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (0,2) to (1,2)  
How to Achieve: Use the "down" action to move from row 0 to row 1 while staying in column 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will execute the "down" action from (0,2). This moves the position to (1,2). Checking the grid, (1,2) is a free space (value 0), so the move is successful. Current position is now (1,2).

**Step 13:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the path taken from (0,2) to (5,2)  
How to Achieve: Check if the path avoids obstacles, stays within grid boundaries, uses only allowed actions (up, down, left, right), and reaches the goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path taken is: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2).  
- Obstacle Check: The obstacle is at (0,4), which is not on the path.  
- Boundary Check: All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 to 5 for both rows and columns).  
- Action Check: All moves are "down," which is a valid action.  
- Goal Check: The path ends at (5,2), which is the goal.  
- Shortest Path Check: The path consists of 5 moves, which is the minimum number of moves required to go from row 0 to row 5.  
The path is valid and is the shortest possible.  
[/IMP]

**Final Solution:**  
The shortest path from (0,2) to (5,2) in the given 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**(0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2)**
