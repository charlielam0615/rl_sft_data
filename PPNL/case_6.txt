**Problem Statement**: Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,3) to the destination (5,5), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]], where 2 is the starting point, 1 is the obstacle, 3 is the destination, and 0 represents free cells. The agent can only move up, down, left, or right, and the path should be returned in coordinate form using 0-based indexing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,5) from (0,3) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), subgoals can be defined as reaching key intermediate positions that progress toward (5,5). Since the grid is open except for the obstacle, a reasonable approach is to move right and down to increase the x and y coordinates, adjusting as needed to avoid (2,1). Initial subgoals: reach (0,5) by moving right, then (5,5) by moving down, checking for obstacle avoidance.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (0,5) from (0,3) by moving right along row 0. This involves moving from (0,3) to (0,4), then (0,5), as there are no obstacles in row 0 (y=0).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (0,3), move right to (0,4): valid move (grid[0][4] = 0). From (0,4), move right to (0,5): valid move (grid[0][5] = 0). Path so far: [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5)].

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (5,5) from (0,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (0,5) from (0,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (5,5) from (0,5) [Current].  
**Current Goal**: Reach (5,5) from (0,5).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From (0,5), the next subgoal is to reach (5,5) by moving down column 5 (x=5). This path involves moving from (0,5) to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and finally (5,5). Check for obstacles: grid positions (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) are all 0 or 3 (destination), with no obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (5,5) from (0,5) by moving down along column 5. Move through (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), to (5,5).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (0,5), move down to (1,5): valid (grid[1][5] = 0). Continue down to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), all valid (grid values = 0). Finally, move to (5,5): valid (grid[5][5] = 3, destination). Path so far: [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] to ensure it is the shortest and avoids the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check path:  
- Starts at (0,3), ends at (5,5).  
- Moves: 2 right (from (0,3) to (0,5)), 5 down (from (0,5) to (5,5)). Total steps = 7.  
- Obstacle avoidance: Path does not pass through (2,1).  
- Shortest path check: Manhattan distance from (0,3) to (5,5) is |5-0| + |5-3| = 7 steps. Path uses 7 steps, so it is optimal.  
- All moves are valid (up, down, left, right) and stay within grid bounds.  
Path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (5,5) from (0,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (0,5) from (0,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (5,5) from (0,5) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
Final path: [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (0,3) to (5,5) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].
