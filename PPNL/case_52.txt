--- Case 52 ---
### Problem Restatement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (5,4) to the destination (0,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0]]
```
Here, (5,4) is the start (marked as 2), (0,3) is the destination (marked as 3), and (5,3) is the obstacle (marked as 1). The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,4) to (0,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at row 0 and the start is at row 5, a reasonable subgoal is to move upward (reduce the row index) while adjusting the column index from 4 to 3, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). Possible subgoals include:
- Move to (4,4) to start moving up.
- Continue moving up through valid cells, adjusting to column 3 when feasible.
- Avoid (5,3) by not moving left from (5,4) directly.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach the first subgoal at (4,4). This can be achieved by moving up from (5,4), as it is a valid move within the grid and avoids the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,4), move up to (4,4). This reduces the row index by 1, aligning with the subgoal. The grid at (4,4) is 0, indicating no obstacle.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (0,3) from (5,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Continue moving toward (0,3), likely by moving up or adjusting to column 3.
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,4) toward (0,3), likely by continuing upward or adjusting to column 3 while avoiding (5,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From (4,4), the next subgoal is to continue moving toward (0,3). Since the destination is in row 0, column 3, continue moving up to reduce the row index (e.g., to (3,4)) and later adjust the column to 3 when closer to row 0. Possible subgoals:
- Move to (3,4) to continue upward progression.
- Eventually move left to align with column 3.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (3,4) from (4,4). Achieve this by moving up, as (3,4) is a valid cell (grid value 0) and continues the upward trajectory toward (0,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Move up from (4,4) to (3,4). This reduces the row index by 1, maintaining progress toward row 0.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the current path from (5,4) to (3,4) via (4,4). Check if the moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and progress toward (0,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path so far is (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4). Both moves are valid:
- (5,4) to (4,4): Upward move, grid[4][4] = 0 (no obstacle).
- (4,4) to (3,4): Upward move, grid[3][4] = 0 (no obstacle).
The path avoids (5,3) and reduces the row index, aligning with the goal of reaching row 0. The current position (3,4) is one column away from the target column 3, indicating progress.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From (3,4), the next subgoal is to continue moving toward (0,3). Options include:
- Move up to (2,4) to further reduce the row index.
- Alternatively, move left to (3,3) to align with the target column.
Since (3,3) is in the target column and closer to the destination, set the subgoal to reach (3,3).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (3,3) from (3,4). Achieve this by moving left, as (3,3) is a valid cell (grid value 0) and aligns the column with the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Move left from (3,4) to (3,3). This adjusts the column index to 3, matching the destination’s column.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (0,3) from (5,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (3,3) to (0,3).
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,3) to (0,3) by continuing upward through valid cells.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From (3,3), the next subgoal is to reach (2,3) by moving up, as this continues progress toward row 0 while staying in column 3, which aligns with the destination (0,3).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (2,3) from (3,3). Achieve this by moving up, as (2,3) is a valid cell (grid value 0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Move up from (3,3) to (2,3). This reduces the row index to 2, maintaining column 3.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (1,3) from (2,3). Continue moving up, as (1,3) is a valid cell (grid value 0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Move up from (2,3) to (1,3). This reduces the row index to 1.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (0,3) from (1,3). Move up to reach the destination, as (0,3) is a valid cell (grid value 3, destination).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Move up from (1,3) to (0,3). This reaches the destination.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the complete path from (5,4) to (0,3) to ensure it is the shortest, avoids the obstacle, and follows valid moves.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path is (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3).
- **Validity**: All moves are either up or left, within the 6x6 grid, and land on cells with grid values 0 or 3 (destination). The obstacle at (5,3) is avoided.
- **Shortest Path**: The path has 6 moves. The Manhattan distance from (5,4) to (0,3) is |5-0| + |4-3| = 6, and the obstacle at (5,3) forces at least one column adjustment. This path minimizes moves by moving up to (3,4) and then left to (3,3) before continuing up.
- **Conclusion**: The path is valid and optimal.
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (0,3) from (5,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 5: Reach (1,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 6: Reach (0,3) [Completed].
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.
**Final Path**: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3)]
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (5,4) to (0,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:
**[(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3)]**
