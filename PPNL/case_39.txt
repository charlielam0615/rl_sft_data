**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The starting point is (2,2), and the destination is (2,0). There is an obstacle at (0,4) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the destination and return it in coordinate form. The grid layout is provided as:  
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 1 represents an obstacle, 2 represents the start, and 3 represents the destination.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of moving from (2,2) to (2,0) into smaller, forward-looking subgoals. Since the destination is directly to the left of the starting point on the same row, a straightforward approach is to move left along row 2. I will set intermediate subgoals as moving to (2,1) and then to (2,0), checking for obstacles along the way.

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,2).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,0).  
Current Goal: Move to (2,1).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move to (2,1).  
How to Achieve: From the current position (2,2), I will move left by one step to reach (2,1). I will check the grid to ensure there are no obstacles in this path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Checking the grid at position (2,1), the value is 0, indicating no obstacle. Therefore, the move from (2,2) to (2,1) is valid. Current position updated to (2,1).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm the move to (2,1).  
How to Achieve: I will verify that the current position is indeed (2,1) and that this aligns with the planned subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The current position is (2,1), which matches the first subgoal. The path taken so far is valid as no obstacles were encountered, and the movement was within the allowed action space (left).

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,2).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (2,1) [Achieved].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,0).  
Current Goal: Move to (2,0).

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move to (2,0).  
How to Achieve: From the current position (2,1), I will move left by one step to reach (2,0). I will check the grid to ensure there are no obstacles at (2,0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Checking the grid at position (2,0), the value is 3, indicating the destination and no obstacle. Therefore, the move from (2,1) to (2,0) is valid. Current position updated to (2,0).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm the move to (2,0).  
How to Achieve: I will verify that the current position is (2,0) and that this completes the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The current position is (2,0), which matches the destination and main goal. The path taken is valid as no obstacles were encountered, and all movements were within the allowed action space (left).  
[/IMP]

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,2) [Achieved].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (2,1) [Achieved].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,0) [Achieved].  
Current Goal: None (All goals achieved).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 9:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review Category)  
Meta-data: Retrieve the sequence of positions visited to form the final path from (2,2) to (2,0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Current Goal: Summarize the path taken.  
Relevant Information:  
- Started at (2,2).  
- Moved left to (2,1).  
- Moved left to (2,0).  
Final Path: [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0)].  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (2,2) to (2,0) in the 6x6 grid world, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is: [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0)]. All planning steps are complete, and the goal has been achieved.
