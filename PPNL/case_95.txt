--- Case 95 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at (3,4), find the shortest path from the starting point (2,5) to the destination (2,1) using only the actions up, down, left, and right. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the path should be returned in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of moving from (2,5) to (2,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the movement is constrained to up, down, left, and right, and the destination is in the same row (y=2), the primary subgoal is to move vertically from x=5 to x=1 while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). A possible subgoal is to move left to x=4, then down to x=1, checking for obstacle avoidance.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,5) to (2,4) to progress toward (2,1).
How to Achieve: From (2,5), move left to (2,4). This is a valid move as (2,4) is not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the current position (2,5), execute the action "left" to reach (2,4). The grid at (2,4) is 0 (free), so the move is valid.
Current path: [(2,5), (2,4)]
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the move to (2,4) and ensure the path remains viable.
How to Achieve: Check if (2,4) is a valid position (not an obstacle) and if it progresses toward (2,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The position (2,4) is valid as the grid value is 0 (free). It is one step closer to x=1 along the row y=2, maintaining progress toward (2,1). The path [(2,5), (2,4)] is valid so far.
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (2,4), continue toward (2,1). The next logical subgoal is to move left to (2,3), as it continues along row y=2 and avoids the obstacle at (3,4).
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,4) to (2,3).
How to Achieve: From (2,4), move left to (2,3). This is a valid move as (2,3) is not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action "left" to move from (2,4) to (2,3). The grid at (2,3) is 0 (free), so the move is valid.
Current path: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the move to (2,3) and ensure the path is still viable.
How to Achieve: Confirm that (2,3) is not an obstacle and progresses toward (2,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The position (2,3) is valid (grid value 0). It is one step closer to x=1 along y=2, maintaining progress. The path [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] is valid.
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (2,3), the next subgoal is to move left to (2,2) to continue toward (2,1), staying in row y=2 to minimize steps and avoid the obstacle at (3,4).
[/PLANNING]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,3) to (2,2).
How to Achieve: From (2,3), move left to (2,2). This is a valid move as (2,2) is not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action "left" to move from (2,3) to (2,2). The grid at (2,2) is 0 (free), so the move is valid.
Current path: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the move to (2,2) and ensure the path remains viable.
How to Achieve: Check if (2,2) is a valid position and progresses toward (2,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The position (2,2) is valid (grid value 0). It is one step away from the destination (2,1) along y=2. The path [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] is valid.
[/IMP]

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (2,2), the final subgoal is to move left to (2,1), reaching the destination.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 11**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,2) to (2,1).
How to Achieve: From (2,2), move left to (2,1). This is a valid move as (2,1) is the destination and not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action "left" to move from (2,2) to (2,1). The grid at (2,1) is 3 (destination), so the move is valid.
Current path: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]
[/IMP]

**Step 12**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Move from (2,5) to (2,1) while avoiding obstacle at (3,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,5) to (2,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (2,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,3) to (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (2,2) to (2,1) [Completed].
Current Goal: Reached (2,1), the destination. The path is complete.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 13**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the final path from (2,5) to (2,1).
How to Achieve: Confirm that the path [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)] is the shortest, avoids the obstacle at (3,4), and reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)] involves 4 moves (all left), which is the minimum number of steps to move from x=5 to x=1 in row y=2. The path stays in row y=2, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). All positions are valid (grid values 0 or 3 for destination). The path is optimal and correct.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**

The shortest path from (2,5) to (2,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:
[(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]
