--- Case 7 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (5,5) to the destination (3,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the goal:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
```

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (5,5) to (3,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since we need the shortest path in a grid with obstacles and restricted movements (up, down, left, right), a suitable approach is to define subgoals as key positions that move closer to (3,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1). Subgoals will be intermediate coordinates that reduce the Manhattan distance to the destination, ensuring valid moves within the grid boundaries (0 to 5) and avoiding the obstacle.

Subgoals:
1. Move from (5,5) toward (3,3), prioritizing reducing the row and column differences (from 5 to 3 in both dimensions).
2. Check for valid moves at each step, avoiding (2,1) and staying within the 6x6 grid.
3. Reach (3,3) as the final subgoal.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make the first move from (5,5) toward (3,3). To achieve this, evaluate the four possible moves (up, down, left, right), ensuring the move is within the grid, avoids the obstacle at (2,1), and reduces the Manhattan distance to (3,3). The Manhattan distance from (5,5) to (3,3) is |5-3| + |5-3| = 4, so prioritize moves that decrease this distance.

Possible moves from (5,5):
- Up: (4,5) — valid, distance = |4-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3
- Down: (6,5) — invalid (out of bounds)
- Left: (5,4) — valid, distance = |5-3| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3
- Right: (5,6) — invalid (out of bounds)

Both (4,5) and (5,4) reduce the distance from 4 to 3 and are valid. Choose (4,5) to prioritize moving up toward row 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,5), move up to (4,5). This position is within the grid, not an obstacle, and reduces the Manhattan distance to (3,3).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (5,5) to (3,3), avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,5) to an intermediate position closer to (3,3).
    - Achieved: Moved to (4,5).
  - Subgoal 2: Continue moving from (4,5) toward (3,3), avoiding (2,1).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,3).

**Current Goal**: Move from (4,5) to the next position closer to (3,3), ensuring valid moves and avoiding the obstacle.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,5) toward (3,3). Evaluate the four possible moves from (4,5), ensuring the move is within the grid, avoids the obstacle at (2,1), and reduces the Manhattan distance to (3,3). The current distance is |4-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.

Possible moves from (4,5):
- Up: (3,5) — valid, distance = |3-3| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2
- Down: (5,5) — valid, distance = |5-3| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4
- Left: (4,4) — valid, distance = |4-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2
- Right: (4,6) — invalid (out of bounds)

Both (3,5) and (4,4) reduce the distance to 2 and are valid. Choose (4,4) to balance progress in both row and column toward (3,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,5), move left to (4,4). This position is within the grid, not an obstacle, and reduces the Manhattan distance to (3,3).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path taken so far: (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4). Check if the path is valid (within grid boundaries, avoids the obstacle at (2,1)) and progresses toward (3,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Path Validation**:
- (5,5): Starting point, valid (grid position, marked as 2 in the grid).
- (4,5): Valid move (up from (5,5)), within grid (0 ≤ 4,5 ≤ 5), not an obstacle (grid value 0).
- (4,4): Valid move (left from (4,5)), within grid, not an obstacle (grid value 0).
- Obstacle check: None of the positions are (2,1).
- Progress check: Manhattan distance reduced from 4 at (5,5) to 3 at (4,5) to 2 at (4,4).

The path is valid and progresses toward (3,3).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,4) to (3,3). Evaluate possible moves from (4,4), ensuring the move is within the grid, avoids the obstacle, and reaches or moves closer to (3,3). Current distance: |4-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.

Possible moves from (4,4):
- Up: (3,4) — valid, distance = |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 1 = 1
- Down: (5,4) — valid, distance = |5-3| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3
- Left: (4,3) — valid, distance = |4-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1
- Right: (4,5) — valid, distance = |4-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

Both (3,4) and (4,3) reduce the distance to 1. Choose (3,4) to move to row 3, aligning with the destination’s row.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,4), move up to (3,4). This position is within the grid, not an obstacle, and reduces the Manhattan distance to (3,3).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,4) to (3,3). Evaluate possible moves from (3,4). Current distance: |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 1 = 1.

Possible moves from (3,4):
- Up: (2,4) — valid, distance = |2-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2
- Down: (4,4) — valid, distance = |4-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2
- Left: (3,3) — valid, distance = |3-3| + |3-3| = 0 + 0 = 0
- Right: (3,5) — valid, distance = |3-3| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

The move to (3,3) reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,4), move left to (3,3). This position is the destination (grid value 3), within the grid, and not an obstacle.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current status.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (5,5) to (3,3), avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,5) to an intermediate position closer to (3,3).
    - Achieved: Moved to (4,5).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,5) to the next position closer to (3,3).
    - Achieved: Moved to (4,4).
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (4,4) to the next position closer to (3,3).
    - Achieved: Moved to (3,4).
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (3,3).
    - Achieved: Moved to (3,3).

**Current Status**: The destination (3,3) has been reached. The path is (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path: (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3). Check if the path is valid (within grid, avoids obstacle, uses allowed moves) and is the shortest possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Path Validation**:
- **Path**: (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3)
- **Validity**:
  - All positions are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ row, col ≤ 5).
  - Moves: (5,5) to (4,5) (up), (4,5) to (4,4) (left), (4,4) to (3,4) (up), (3,4) to (3,3) (left) — all are valid actions.
  - Obstacle check: No position is (2,1).
  - Grid values: (5,5) = 2 (start), (4,5) = 0, (4,4) = 0, (3,4) = 0, (3,3) = 3 (goal).
- **Shortest Path**: The path has 4 moves. The Manhattan distance from (5,5) to (3,3) is 4, but the obstacle at (2,1) does not block this path. The path is optimal as it uses the minimum number of moves (4) to reach (3,3) while satisfying constraints.

The path is valid and appears to be the shortest.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the path’s correctness by recalling relevant information about the grid, obstacle, and path constraints to ensure no errors were made.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- **Grid**: 6x6, 0-based indexing, obstacle at (2,1), start at (5,5), goal at (3,3).
- **Constraints**: Moves are up, down, left, right. Path must avoid (2,1) and stay within grid boundaries.
- **Path**: (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3).
- **Validation Summary**: All moves are valid, the path avoids (2,1), and the length (4 moves) matches the minimum required based on Manhattan distance and obstacle constraints.

The recalled information confirms the path is correct and adheres to all constraints.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (5,5) to (3,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:

**[(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]**

This path uses 4 moves (up, left, up, left), stays within the grid, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination efficiently.
