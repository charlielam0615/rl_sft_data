### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (4,2) to the destination (1,0) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Where:
- 1 represents an obstacle (at (0,4)),
- 2 represents the starting point (at (4,2)),
- 3 represents the destination (at (1,0)),
- 0 represents a free cell.

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the shortest path from (4,2) to (1,0), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. The start is at (4,2), and the destination is at (1,0), requiring a movement of 3 units up (from row 4 to row 1) and 2 units left (from column 2 to column 0). The obstacle at (0,4) is not directly in the path but must be considered. A reasonable subgoal is to move toward the destination by reducing the row and column indices, prioritizing valid moves. The first subgoal is to move from (4,2) to an adjacent cell closer to (1,0), such as (3,2) (up) or (4,1) (left).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (4,2) to an adjacent cell closer to (1,0), specifically (3,2) or (4,1).
How to Achieve: Check valid moves from (4,2). Possible moves are:
- Up: (3,2)
- Down: (5,2)
- Left: (4,1)
- Right: (4,3)
Calculate Manhattan distance to (1,0) for each:
- (3,2): |3-1| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4
- (4,1): |4-1| + |1-0| = 3 + 1 = 4
- (5,2): |5-1| + |2-0| = 4 + 2 = 6
- (4,3): |4-1| + |3-0| = 3 + 3 = 6
Both (3,2) and (4,1) reduce the distance equally. Choose (3,2) (up) as it reduces the row index, aligning with the need to reach row 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,2), move up to (3,2). The grid cell at (3,2) is 0 (free), so the move is valid. The path so far is [(4,2), (3,2)].

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,0) from (4,2) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (4,2) to (3,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to a cell closer to (1,0).
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to a cell closer to (1,0).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to a cell closer to (1,0).
How to Achieve: Check valid moves from (3,2):
- Up: (2,2)
- Down: (4,2)
- Left: (3,1)
- Right: (3,3)
Manhattan distances to (1,0):
- (2,2): |2-1| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3
- (4,2): |4-1| + |2-0| = 3 + 2 = 5
- (3,1): |3-1| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3
- (3,3): |3-1| + |3-0| = 2 + 3 = 5
Both (2,2) and (3,1) have a distance of 3. Choose (2,2) (up) to continue reducing the row index toward 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,2), move up to (2,2). The grid cell at (2,2) is 0 (free), so the move is valid. The path is now [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,2) to a cell closer to (1,0).
How to Achieve: Check valid moves from (2,2):
- Up: (1,2)
- Down: (3,2)
- Left: (2,1)
- Right: (2,3)
Manhattan distances to (1,0):
- (1,2): |1-1| + |2-0| = 0 + 2 = 2
- (3,2): |3-1| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4
- (2,1): |2-1| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2
- (2,3): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4
Both (1,2) and (2,1) have a distance of 2. Choose (1,2) (up) to reach row 1, aligning with the destination’s row.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,2), move up to (1,2). The grid cell at (1,2) is 0 (free), so the move is valid. The path is now [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (1,2) to (1,0).
How to Achieve: Check valid moves from (1,2):
- Up: (0,2)
- Down: (2,2)
- Left: (1,1)
- Right: (1,3)
Manhattan distances to (1,0):
- (0,2): |0-1| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3
- (2,2): |2-1| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3
- (1,1): |1-1| + |1-0| = 0 + 1 = 1
- (1,3): |1-1| + |3-0| = 0 + 3 = 3
Choose (1,1) (left) as it has the smallest distance and moves closer to column 0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,2), move left to (1,1). The grid cell at (1,1) is 0 (free), so the move is valid. The path is now [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (1,1) to (1,0).
How to Achieve: Check valid moves from (1,1):
- Up: (0,1)
- Down: (2,1)
- Left: (1,0)
- Right: (1,2)
Manhattan distances to (1,0):
- (0,1): |0-1| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2
- (2,1): |2-1| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2
- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-0| = 0 + 0 = 0
- (1,2): |1-1| + |2-0| = 0 + 2 = 2
Choose (1,0) (left), as it reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,1), move left to (1,0). The grid cell at (1,0) is 3 (destination), so the move is valid. The path is now [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the path [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].
How to Achieve: Check each step for validity:
- All moves are between adjacent cells (up or left).
- All intermediate cells (3წ, (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1) are 0 (free).
- No obstacles (0,4) are encountered.
- The path length is 5 steps, and the Manhattan distance from (4,2) to (1,0) is 5, suggesting optimality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)] is valid:
- Moves: (4,2)→(3,2) (up), (3,2)→(2,2) (up), (2,2)→(1,2) (up), (1,2)→(1,1) (left), (1,1)→(1,0) (left).
- All cells are free (0) except the destination (3).
- The obstacle at (0,4) is not on the path.
- Path length matches the Manhattan distance (3 up + 2 left = 5 steps), confirming it is the shortest.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,2) to (1,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:

**[(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)]**
