### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (3,1) to the destination (1,1) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start (3,1), and 3 indicates the destination (1,1):

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The goal is to compute the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and the obstacle is avoided.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Path Planning
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (3,1) to (1,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (1,1), the agent needs to move left from x=3 to x=1 (2 steps left) and up from y=1 to y=1 (0 steps vertically, as y-coordinates are the same). However, the obstacle at (3,4) may affect paths if the agent moves vertically first. Subgoals:  
1. Move left to reduce x-coordinate from 3 to 1, staying on y=1 if possible.  
2. Avoid the obstacle at (3,4) by ensuring the path does not pass through it.  
3. Reach the destination (1,1).

### Step 2: Track Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the recent planning:  
- **Main Goal**: Reach (1,1) from (3,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move left from x=3 to x=1, preferably along y=1.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Arrive at (1,1).  
**Current Goal**: Move left from (3,1) toward x=1, staying on y=1 if feasible.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Attempt to Reach First Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (3,1) to reduce x-coordinate (toward x=1), staying on y=1.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if moving left from (3,1) to (2,1) is valid (within grid bounds and obstacle-free). Then, attempt another left move to (1,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (3,1), moving left leads to (2,1):  
- Check grid: (2,1) has value 0 (empty, no obstacle).  
- Move is valid (within 0 to 5 bounds).  
Path so far: [(3,1), (2,1)].  
From (2,1), moving left leads to (1,1):  
- Check grid: (1,1) has value 3 (destination, no obstacle).  
- Move is valid.  
Updated path: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)].  
The obstacle at (3,4) is not on this path, so it’s unaffected.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validate the Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] to ensure it’s correct and optimal.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify each step is within bounds, obstacle-free, and leads to the destination. Check if this is the shortest path by calculating the Manhattan distance and comparing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]:  
- **Step 1**: (3,1) to (2,1): Left move, x: 3→2, y: 1 (unchanged). Grid value at (2,1) is 0 (valid). Within bounds (0 ≤ x,y ≤ 5).  
- **Step 2**: (2,1) to (1,1): Left move, x: 2→1, y: 1 (unchanged). Grid value at (1,1) is 3 (destination, valid). Within bounds.  
- **Obstacle Check**: Path does not include (3,4).  
- **Shortest Path Check**: Manhattan distance from (3,1) to (1,1) = |3-1| + |1-1| = 2. Path has 2 steps, matching the minimum possible moves.  
The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Recall Information to Confirm Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of confirming the path from (3,1) to (1,1), focusing on grid constraints, obstacle location, and path validity.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)].  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Grid is 6x6, 0-based indexing, with obstacle at (3,4).  
- Start at (3,1), destination at (1,1).  
- Action space: up, down, left, right.  
- Previous steps: Subgoals to move left along y=1, avoid (3,4), and reach (1,1). Path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] was computed and validated as obstacle-free and optimal (2 steps match Manhattan distance).  
No discrepancies found in prior steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Finalize the Plan
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Finalize and return the shortest path in coordinate form.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the validated path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] as the final plan, as it meets all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The shortest path from (3,1) to (1,1), avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]**  
This path requires 2 moves (left, left), is obstacle-free, and matches the minimum Manhattan distance.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,1) to (1,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]**
