**Problem Restatement**:  
The task is to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at coordinate (3,2) to the destination at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and there is an obstacle at (3,4) that must be avoided. The possible actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the shortest path from (3,2) to (2,1) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. The direct Manhattan distance is |3-2| + |2-1| = 2 steps (up and left). However, the obstacle at (3,4) may affect the path if moving right is considered. Subgoals:  
1. Move from (3,2) to an intermediate point closer to (2,1), such as (3,1) or (2,2).  
2. From the intermediate point, reach (2,1).  
Plan to explore moving left to (3,1) and then up to (2,1), or up to (2,2) and then left to (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to intermediate point (3,1).  
How to Achieve: From (3,2), move left one step to (3,1). This avoids the obstacle at (3,4) and reduces the column coordinate closer to the destination’s column (1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,2), execute the action "left" to reach (3,1). Check grid: (3,1) has value 0, indicating it is a valid, obstacle-free position.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (3,2) to (3,1).  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the position (3,1) is within the 6x6 grid boundaries, is not an obstacle, and progresses toward (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check:  
- (3,1) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ 3 < 6, 0 ≤ 1 < 6).  
- Grid value at (3,1) is 0, indicating no obstacle.  
- Manhattan distance to (2,1): |3-2| + |1-1| = 1, reduced from 2, confirming progress.  
The move is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,1) to the destination (2,1).  
How to Achieve: From (3,1), move up one step to (2,1). This aligns the row coordinate with the destination and completes the path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,1), execute the action "up" to reach (2,1). Check grid: (2,1) has value 3, but the problem specifies (2,1) as the destination, so it is a valid position.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (3,1) to (2,1).  
How to Achieve: Confirm that (2,1) is within the grid, is the destination, and is reachable without hitting the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check:  
- (2,1) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ 2 < 6, 0 ≤ 1 < 6).  
- (2,1) is the destination, so it is valid regardless of grid value.  
- The move from (3,1) to (2,1) does not pass through (3,4).  
The move is valid, and the destination is reached.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (3,2) to (2,1) avoiding (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,2) to (3,1) (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,1) to (2,1) (achieved).  
Current Goal: The main goal is completed, as the path (3,2) → (3,1) → (2,1) has been validated.  
Path Summary: The shortest path is [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)].  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
The shortest path from (3,2) to (2,1) avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) is:  
[(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]
