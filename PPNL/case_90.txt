**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point (0,1) to the destination (0,4), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid is represented as [[0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination. The agent can only move up, down, left, or right. The goal is to find the shortest path from (0,1) to (0,4) in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of navigating from (0,1) to (0,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the start and destination are in the same row (row 0), a straightforward approach is to move rightward along row 0, checking for obstacles. The obstacle at (3,4) is not in row 0, so the path may remain in row 0. Subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,1) to (0,2).  
2. Move from (0,2) to (0,3).  
3. Move from (0,3) to (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,1) to (0,2). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (0,2) is directly adjacent and the grid cell at (0,2) is empty (0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (0,1), move right to (0,2). This is a valid move since (0,2) is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle.  
Path so far: [(0,1), (0,2)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the move from (0,1) to (0,2) is valid. Check if (0,2) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and reachable via a right move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The move to (0,2) is valid: it is within the 6x6 grid, the cell at (0,2) is 0 (empty), and it is reachable by moving right from (0,1). No obstacles are present in row 0 between (0,1) and (0,2).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,2) to (0,3). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (0,3) is directly adjacent and the grid cell at (0,3) is empty (0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (0,2), move right to (0,3). This is a valid move since (0,3) is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle.  
Path so far: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the move from (0,2) to (0,3) is valid. Check if (0,3) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and reachable via a right move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The move to (0,3) is valid: it is within the 6x6 grid, the cell at (0,3) is 0 (empty), and it is reachable by moving right from (0,2). No obstacles are present in row 0 between (0,2) and (0,3).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,3) to (0,4). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (0,4) is the destination, directly adjacent, and the grid cell at (0,4) is the destination (3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (0,3), move right to (0,4). This is a valid move since (0,4) is within the grid boundaries and is the destination.  
Path so far: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (0,1) to (0,4), avoiding obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (0,2) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (0,2) to (0,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (0,3) to (0,4) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the path from (0,1) to (0,4) is complete. The path [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)] has been constructed, and the destination (0,4) has been reached.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the entire path from (0,1) to (0,4). Check that all moves are valid, the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4), and the destination is reached.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]:  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid.  
- Moves are: (0,1) → (0,2) [right], (0,2) → (0,3) [right], (0,3) → (0,4) [right]. All are valid single-step moves (up, down, left, or right).  
- Cells visited: (0,1) [start, 2], (0,2) [empty, 0], (0,3) [empty, 0], (0,4) [destination, 3]. None are the obstacle at (3,4).  
- The path length is 3 moves, which is the shortest possible since the Manhattan distance from (0,1) to (0,4) is 3, and no obstacles block row 0.  
The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to confirm the path’s correctness by recalling relevant information about the grid, obstacle, and path constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Recalled information relevant to the current goal:  
- Grid: 6x6, with obstacle at (3,4) [value 1], start at (0,1) [value 2], destination at (0,4) [value 3].  
- Action space: Up, down, left, right.  
- Path constructed: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)].  
- The obstacle at (3,4) is not in row 0, so it does not affect the path.  
- All moves are rightward, staying in row 0, and each step is to an empty or destination cell.  
This confirms the path adheres to constraints and reaches the destination.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,1) to (0,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]**

All planning steps are completed, and the path has been validated as optimal and obstacle-free.
