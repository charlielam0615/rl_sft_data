--- Case 36 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (5,0) to the destination (4,2) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,0) to (4,2) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid with four possible actions (up, down, left, right) and an obstacle at (0,4), we can consider a sequence of moves that reduces the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in x and y coordinates) while avoiding the obstacle. The Manhattan distance from (5,0) to (4,2) is |5-4| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, suggesting a minimum of 3 moves if unobstructed. Subgoals:
1. Move from (5,0) to (5,1) (right, reduces y-distance).
2. Move from (5,1) to (5,2) (right, reaches target y-coordinate).
3. Move from (5,2) to (4,2) (up, reaches target x-coordinate).
These subgoals aim to form a path: (5,0) → (5,1) → (5,2) → (4,2).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move from (5,0) to (5,1).  
**How to Achieve**: From (5,0), apply the "right" action to move to (5,1), as it is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the current position (5,0), the "right" action increases the y-coordinate by 1, resulting in (5,1). Checking the grid, position (5,1) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The move is successful, and the path so far is: [(5,0), (5,1)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the validity of the current path from (5,0) to (5,1).  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the move to (5,1) is within bounds, not an obstacle, and progresses toward (4,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The position (5,1) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 0 ≤ y ≤ 5). The grid value at (5,1) is 0, confirming it is not an obstacle. The Manhattan distance from (5,1) to (4,2) is |5-4| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than the initial distance of 3, indicating progress toward the destination. The path [(5,0), (5,1)] is valid so far.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move from (5,1) to (5,2).  
**How to Achieve**: From (5,1), apply the "right" action to move to (5,2), as it aligns with the y-coordinate of the destination (4,2) and is not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,1), the "right" action increases the y-coordinate to 2, reaching (5,2). The grid value at (5,2) is 0, indicating a valid, empty cell. The path is now: [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the validity of the move from (5,1) to (5,2).  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that (5,2) is within bounds, not an obstacle, and reduces the distance to (4,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The position (5,2) is within the 6x6 grid. The grid value at (5,2) is 0, confirming it is not an obstacle. The Manhattan distance from (5,2) to (4,2) is |5-4| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1, showing progress toward the destination. The path [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)] remains valid.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move from (5,2) to (4,2).  
**How to Achieve**: From (5,2), apply the "up" action to move to (4,2), which is the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (5,2), the "up" action decreases the x-coordinate by 1, reaching (4,2). The grid value at (4,2) is 3, indicating the destination. The move is valid, and the path is now: [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (5,0) to (4,2).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,0) to (5,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (5,1) to (5,2) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (5,2) to (4,2) (completed).
**Current Goal**: The destination (4,2) has been reached, completing the main goal. The path [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)] is the shortest, with 3 moves, matching the Manhattan distance. No further subgoals are needed.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the complete path from (5,0) to (4,2).  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the path [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)] avoids the obstacle at (0,4), stays within bounds, and reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]:
- Avoids the obstacle at (0,4), as none of the coordinates match.
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).
- Each move is valid (right, right, up), and the grid values are 0 or 3 (destination), indicating no obstacles.
- The final coordinate (4,2) is the destination.
The path is valid and shortest, with 3 moves.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (5,0) to (4,2) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:
**[(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]**.
