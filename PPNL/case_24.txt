**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (1,4) to the destination at (4,5), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (4,5) from (1,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (4,5), the agent needs to move 3 units right (from x=1 to x=4) and 1 unit down (from y=4 to y=5). The obstacle at (2,1) must be avoided. Possible subgoals include moving right to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), and finally down to (4,5), checking each step to avoid the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,4) to (2,4). This involves moving one unit right. Check if the path to (2,4) is clear of obstacles and within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The grid at (2,4) has a value of 0, indicating no obstacle. The move from (1,4) to (2,4) is valid as it is within the 6x6 grid and does not encounter the obstacle at (2,1). The action is a right move, and the new position is (2,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) to (2,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,4) to (4,4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (4,4) to (4,5).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,4) to (3,4).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,4) to (3,4). This involves moving one unit right. Verify that the path to (3,4) is clear and within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The grid at (3,4) has a value of 0, indicating no obstacle. The move from (2,4) to (3,4) is valid as it is within the grid and does not involve the obstacle at (2,1). The action is a right move, and the new position is (3,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) to (2,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (3,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,4) to (4,4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (4,4) to (4,5).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,4) to (4,4).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,4) to (4,4). This involves moving one unit right. Confirm that the path to (4,4) is clear and within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The grid at (4,4) has a value of 0, indicating no obstacle. The move from (3,4) to (4,4) is valid as it is within the grid and does not encounter the obstacle at (2,1). The action is a right move, and the new position is (4,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) to (2,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (3,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,4) to (4,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (4,4) to (4,5).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,4) to (4,5).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,4) to (4,5). This involves moving one unit down. Verify that the path to (4,5) is clear and within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The grid at (4,5) has a value of 3, indicating the destination. The move from (4,4) to (4,5) is valid as it is within the grid and does not involve the obstacle at (2,1). The action is a down move, and the new position is (4,5).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (1,4) to (4,5). Check if the sequence of moves—(1,4) to (2,4), (2,4) to (3,4), (3,4) to (4,4), (4,4) to (4,5)—is valid, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The path is: (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,5).  
- All moves are within the 6x6 grid.  
- The path avoids the obstacle at (2,1).  
- Each step uses valid actions (right, right, right, down).  
- The final position is (4,5), the destination.  
- The path has 4 moves, which is optimal given the Manhattan distance (|4-1| + |5-4| = 4) and obstacle avoidance.  
The path is valid and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) to (2,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (3,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,4) to (4,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (4,4) to (4,5) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None (all goals completed).  
The path (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) has been validated as the shortest path.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (1,4) to (4,5) is [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)].
