### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (1,4) to the destination (0,5) in a 6x6 grid world. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and there is an obstacle at position (0,4) that must be avoided. The allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3],  // Row 0
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],  // Row 1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 2
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 4
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  // Row 5
```

Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents an obstacle at (0,4).
- 2 represents the starting point at (1,4).
- 3 represents the destination at (0,5).

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle and staying within the grid boundaries.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals to Reach the Destination
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (1,4) to (0,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (0,5), we need to:
1. Move from (1,4) to a position that allows access to (0,5).
2. Avoid the obstacle at (0,4).
3. Reach (0,5) using only up, down, left, or right moves.
Subgoals:
- Move to a neighboring cell of (0,5) that is not an obstacle, such as (0,5) itself or (1,5).
- Ensure the path avoids (0,4).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system based on the previous planning step. The hierarchy of goals is:
- **Main Goal**: Reach (0,5) from (1,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move to a neighboring cell of (0,5) that is not an obstacle (e.g., (1,5) or directly to (0,5)).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Ensure the path avoids (0,4).

**Current Goal**: Move to a neighboring cell of (0,5), such as (1,5), which is directly accessible from (1,4) and avoids (0,4).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Subgoal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Move from (1,4) to (1,5) to approach the destination (0,5).
- **How to Achieve**: From (1,4), move right to (1,5), as it is a valid move (within the grid, no obstacle at (1,5)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the current position (1,4), moving right to (1,5) is valid since:
- (1,5) is within the 6x6 grid.
- The cell at (1,5) is 0 (empty, no obstacle).
- The move reduces the Manhattan distance to (0,5) (from |1-0| + |4-5| = 2 to |1-0| + |5-5| = 1).
**Path so far**: [(1,4), (1,5)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Validate that the current position (1,5) and the path taken [(1,4), (1,5)] are correct and progress toward (0,5).
- **How to Achieve**: Check if (1,5) is a valid position, not an obstacle, and closer to (0,5). Verify the path avoids (0,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Position Check**: (1,5) is within the 6x6 grid and has a value of 0 (empty).
- **Path Check**: The path [(1,4), (1,5)] does not include (0,4), the obstacle.
- **Progress Check**: From (1,5), the Manhattan distance to (0,5) is |1-0| + |5-5| = 1, which is closer than from (1,4) (distance = 2).
- **Conclusion**: The move to (1,5) is valid and progresses toward the destination.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Final Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Move from (1,5) to the destination (0,5).
- **How to Achieve**: From (1,5), move up to (0,5), as it is a valid move (within the grid, no obstacle at (0,5)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the current position (1,5), moving up to (0,5) is valid since:
- (0,5) is within the 6x6 grid.
- The cell at (0,5) is 3 (destination, no obstacle).
- The move reaches the destination.
**Path so far**: [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Validate that the path [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)] reaches the destination (0,5) and avoids the obstacle at (0,4).
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the final position is (0,5), the path is valid (all moves are within the grid and avoid obstacles), and the path is the shortest possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Final Position Check**: The path ends at (0,5), which is the destination.
- **Path Validity**:
  - All coordinates [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)] are within the 6x6 grid.
  - None of the coordinates are (0,4), the obstacle.
  - All moves are valid (right from (1,4) to (1,5), up from (1,5) to (0,5)).
- **Shortest Path Check**: The Manhattan distance from (1,4) to (0,5) is |1-0| + |4-5| = 2. The path has 2 moves: (1,4) → (1,5) → (0,5), which matches the minimum number of moves required.
- **Conclusion**: The path [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)] is valid, avoids the obstacle, and is the shortest possible.
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:
- **Main Goal**: Reach (0,5) from (1,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4) (Completed).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move to a neighboring cell of (0,5), such as (1,5) (Completed in Step 3).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Ensure the path avoids (0,4) (Completed, verified in Steps 4 and 6).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reach (0,5) (Completed in Step 5).

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.
**Final Path**: [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)].
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,4) to (0,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:

**[(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)]**
