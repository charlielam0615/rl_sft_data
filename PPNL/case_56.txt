--- Case 56 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (4,5) to the destination (2,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates the obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

The goal is to compute the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,5) to (2,3) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider moving towards the destination by reducing the Manhattan distance (difference in x and y coordinates). From (4,5) to (2,3), the Manhattan distance is |4-2| + |5-3| = 4, suggesting a minimum of 4 moves. Subgoals will involve moving up (to reduce row index from 4 to 2) and left (to reduce column index from 5 to 3), while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). Possible intermediate points include moving up to row 3 or 2, then left towards column 3, checking for obstacle avoidance.

### Step 2: Implementation - Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (4,5) to an intermediate point closer to (2,3), such as (3,5), by moving up one step. This reduces the row index from 4 to 3, aligning with the destination’s row range, and is a valid move as (3,5) is an empty cell (grid[3][5] = 0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the current position (4,5), execute the move up to (3,5). The grid confirms (3,5) is empty, and the move is within the action space (up, down, left, right). The new position is (3,5).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (2,3) from (4,5).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (4,5) to (3,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,5) towards (2,3), potentially via (3,4) or (2,5).
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,5) to (2,3), avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Implementation - Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (3,5) to (2,5), moving up one step to further reduce the row index from 3 to 2, aligning with the destination’s row. The cell (2,5) is empty (grid[2][5] = 0), and this move is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,5), execute the move up to (2,5). The grid confirms (2,5) is empty, and the move is within the action space. The new position is (2,5).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path taken so far: (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5). Check if the moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and progress towards (2,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the path:
- Move from (4,5) to (3,5): Up move, valid as (3,5) is empty (grid[3][5] = 0).
- Move from (3,5) to (2,5): Up move, valid as (2,5) is empty (grid[2][5] = 0).
- Obstacle check: Neither (3,5) nor (2,5) is (5,3), so the path avoids the obstacle.
- Progress check: Current position (2,5) is on the destination row (2), and only two columns away from (2,3) (Manhattan distance = 2). The path is valid and progressing towards the goal.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Implementation - Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,5) to (2,4), moving left to reduce the column index from 5 to 4. The cell (2,4) is empty (grid[2][4] = 0), and this move is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,5), execute the move left to (2,4). The grid confirms (2,4) is empty, and the move is within the action space. The new position is (2,4).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Implementation - Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,4) to (2,3), moving left to reach the destination column. The cell (2,3) is the destination (grid[2][3] = 3), and this move is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,4), execute the move left to (2,3). The grid confirms (2,3) is the destination, and the move is within the action space. The new position is (2,3), reaching the goal.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (2,3) from (4,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (4,5) to (3,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,5) to (2,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,5) to (2,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (2,4) to (2,3) [Completed].
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal has been achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to confirm the final path from (4,5) to (2,3) by retrieving all moves made and ensuring they form the shortest path while avoiding the obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- Path taken: (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (2,3).
- Total moves: 4 (2 up, 2 left).
- Obstacle avoidance: Path does not include (5,3).
- Shortest path check: Manhattan distance from (4,5) to (2,3) is 4, and the path uses exactly 4 moves, confirming it is optimal.
- All moves were valid (up, left) and stayed within empty cells or the destination.
The final path is: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)].
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,5) to (2,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:

**[(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]**

This path consists of 4 moves: two up (from (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5)) and two left (from (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3)), satisfying the constraints and avoiding the obstacle.
