--- Case 12 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to navigate from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (0,5) while avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid is represented as a 2D array with 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (0,5) from (0,0) into intermediate subgoals. Given the obstacle at (2,1), I need to plan a path that avoids this position. A logical approach is to move along the top row (row 0) since the destination is also in row 0, and there are no obstacles in this row. Therefore, the intermediate subgoals will be the positions along the path from (0,0) to (0,5), specifically: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), and finally (0,5).

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,5) from (0,0)  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (0,1)  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (0,2)  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (0,3)  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (0,4)  
  - Subgoal 5: Reach (0,5)  
Current Goal: Reach (0,1) as the first step toward (0,5).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (0,1) from (0,0).  
How to Achieve: Move right from the current position (0,0) to (0,1) as it is a direct and valid move within the grid boundaries and avoids any obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting from (0,0), I execute the action "right" to move to (0,1). This position is within the 6x6 grid, and there are no obstacles at (0,1). The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,1).

Current Goal: Reach (0,2) from (0,1).  
How to Achieve: Move right from the current position (0,1) to (0,2) as it is a direct and valid move within the grid boundaries and avoids any obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting from (0,1), I execute the action "right" to move to (0,2). This position is within the 6x6 grid, and there are no obstacles at (0,2). The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,2).

Starting from (0,2), I execute the action "right" to move to (0,3). This position is within the 6x6 grid, and there are no obstacles at (0,3). The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,3).

**Step 11:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (0,5) from (0,4).  
How to Achieve: Move right from the current position (0,4) to (0,5) as it is a direct and valid move within the grid boundaries and avoids any obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting from (0,4), I execute the action "right" to move to (0,5). This position is within the 6x6 grid, and there are no obstacles at (0,5). The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,5). The main goal of reaching (0,5) from (0,0) has been achieved.  
[/IMP]

**Step 12:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the path taken from (0,0) to (0,5).  
How to Achieve: Review the sequence of moves to ensure all steps are valid, within grid boundaries, avoid obstacles, and confirm that the shortest path was taken.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I am validating the path: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Each move was a "right" action, staying within the 6x6 grid boundaries. The path does not pass through the obstacle at (2,1). The total number of moves is 5, which is the shortest possible path since the Manhattan distance between (0,0) and (0,5) is 5, and no detours were needed. The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (0,0) to (0,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:  
[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]
