--- Case 81 ---
### Problem Statement
We need to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,5) to the destination (0,1) in a 6x6 grid world. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and there is an obstacle at position (3,4) that must be avoided. The allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2],  // y=0
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // y=1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // y=2
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  // y=3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // y=4
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  // y=5
```

Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents an obstacle at (3,4).
- 2 represents the starting point at (0,5).
- 3 represents the destination at (0,1).

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle and staying within the grid boundaries.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Path Planning
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,5) to (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same column (x=0) but at a lower row (y=1), the primary movement is upward (decreasing y-coordinate). The obstacle at (3,4) may require a detour if the path approaches row y=3. Subgoals:
1. Move upward from (0,5) toward row y=1 while staying in column x=0, if possible.
2. If the obstacle at (3,4) blocks the path, adjust the path to detour around it.
3. Reach the destination (0,1).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Check Validity of Direct Upward Path
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate if moving directly upward from (0,5) to (0,1) is feasible without hitting the obstacle at (3,4). This involves checking the cells in column x=0 from y=5 to y=1 for obstacles.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the path, examine the cells in column x=0 from (0,5) to (0,1):
- (0,5): Grid[5][0] = 0 (empty, starting point).
- (0,4): Grid[4][0] = 0 (empty).
- (0,3): Grid[3][0] = 0 (empty).
- (0,2): Grid[2][0] = 0 (empty).
- (0,1): Grid[1][0] = 0 (empty, destination).

No obstacles are present in column x=0 from y=5 to y=1. The direct upward path is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Current Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (0,5) to (0,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward from (0,5) toward (0,1) in column x=0.
  - Subgoal 2: If needed, detour around the obstacle at (3,4) (not required based on validation).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach the destination (0,1).

**Current Goal**: Move upward from (0,5) to (0,1) along column x=0, as the path has been validated as obstacle-free.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach the Destination
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,5) to (0,1) by following the validated path along column x=0. This can be achieved by moving up four times (from y=5 to y=1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting at (0,5), execute the following moves:
1. From (0,5) move up to (0,4).
2. From (0,4) move up to (0,3).
3. From (0,3) move up to (0,2).
4. From (0,2) move up to (0,1).

The path is:
- (0,5) → (0,4) → (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1).

This path has 4 moves, which is minimal since the Manhattan distance between (0,5) and (0,1) is |0-0| + |5-1| = 4, and no obstacles were encountered.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Final Review of Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (0,5) to (0,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward from (0,5) toward (0,1) in column x=0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Detour around the obstacle at (3,4) if needed (not required).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach the destination (0,1) (completed).

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved. The path (0,5) → (0,4) → (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1) has been determined.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,5) to (0,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:

**[(0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)]**

This path involves 4 moves, all upward, and is obstacle-free.
