--- Case 50 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,4) to the destination at (2,0), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], where 2 is the start, 3 is the goal, 1 is an obstacle, and 0 represents free cells. The agent can move up, down, left, or right, and the task is to find the shortest path in coordinate form using 0-based indexing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,4) to (2,0) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider moving toward the destination while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). Subgoals:  
1. Move left from (0,4) to reduce the x-coordinate toward 2.  
2. Move down to reduce the y-coordinate toward 0.  
3. Adjust movements to stay within the grid and avoid (5,3).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move left from (0,4) to (0,3) as a step toward reducing the y-coordinate. Achieve this by selecting the "left" action, ensuring the move is valid within the grid and avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,4), moving left results in (0,3). The grid at (0,3) is 0 (free cell), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (2,0) from (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move left to reduce y-coordinate (completed: reached (0,3)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move down to reduce x-coordinate toward 2.  
  - Subgoal 3: Adjust movements to avoid obstacle at (5,3).  
**Current Goal**: Move down from (0,3) to reduce the x-coordinate toward 2.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move down from (0,3) to (1,3) to approach x=2. Achieve this by selecting the "down" action, ensuring the move is valid.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,3), moving down results in (1,3). The grid at (1,3) is 0 (free cell), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (0,4) to (1,3) and ensure it aligns with reaching (2,0) while avoiding (5,3). Check if the current position (1,3) is on a feasible shortest path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Current position: (1,3). The path so far: (0,4) → (0,3) → (1,3). The Manhattan distance from (1,3) to (2,0) is |2-1| + |0-3| = 4, and no moves have approached the obstacle at (5,3). The path is valid and progressing toward the goal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move down from (1,3) to (2,3) to reach x=2. Achieve this by selecting the "down" action.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,3), moving down results in (2,3). The grid at (2,3) is 0 (free cell), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move left from (2,3) to (2,2) to reduce the y-coordinate toward 0. Achieve this by selecting the "left" action.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,3), moving left results in (2,2). The grid at (2,2) is 0 (free cell), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move left from (2,2) to (2,1) to further reduce the y-coordinate. Achieve this by selecting the "left" action.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,2), moving left results in (2,1). The grid at (2,1) is 0 (free cell), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move left from (2,1) to (2,0) to reach the destination. Achieve this by selecting the "left" action.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,1), moving left results in (2,0). The grid at (2,0) is 3 (goal), so the move is valid and the destination is reached.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (2,0) from (0,4) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move left to reduce y-coordinate (completed: reached (0,3)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move down to reduce x-coordinate (completed: reached (2,3)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move left to reach y=0 (completed: reached (2,0)).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the destination (2,0) has been reached.  
**Path**: (0,4) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,4) to (2,0) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3) is:  
**(0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)**.
