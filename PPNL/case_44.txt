**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (5,5) to the destination at (1,4), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

The grid is represented as:
- (0,4) contains an obstacle (1).
- (5,5) is the starting point (2).
- (1,4) is the destination (3).
- All other cells are empty (0).

I will solve this path-planning problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format and constraints.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the shortest path from (5,5) to (1,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since this is a grid with four possible moves (up, down, left, right), the Manhattan distance between (5,5) and (1,4) is |5-1| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps, assuming no obstacles. The obstacle at (0,4) is near the destination, so the path must approach (1,4) without passing through (0,4). A reasonable subgoal is to move toward (1,4) by reducing the row and column distances, prioritizing moves that keep the path valid. Let’s set an initial subgoal to reach an intermediate point closer to (1,4), such as (2,4), which is one row above the destination and avoids the obstacle.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (5,5) to an intermediate point (2,4), which is closer to the destination (1,4). To achieve this, calculate a path using a simple heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance) and ensure moves are valid (within grid bounds and avoiding the obstacle). A sequence of moves (e.g., up and left) can reduce the row and column distances to reach (2,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To move from (5,5) to (2,4), compute the differences: row distance (5-2 = 3 steps up) and column distance (5-4 = 1 step left). A possible path is:
- From (5,5) to (4,5): Move up.
- From (4,5) to (3,5): Move up.
- From (3,5) to (2,5): Move up.
- From (2,5) to (2,4): Move left.  
This path avoids the obstacle at (0,4) and stays within the 6x6 grid. The intermediate path is: (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (5,5) to (2,4): (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4). Check if all moves are within the grid, avoid the obstacle at (0,4), and ensure the path progresses toward the final destination (1,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path:
- **Grid bounds**: All coordinates (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) are within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).
- **Obstacle avoidance**: None of the coordinates match (0,4), the obstacle.
- **Move validity**: Each step is a single move (up or left), valid per the action space.
- **Progress**: The path reduces the Manhattan distance from (5,5) to (1,4) (initially 5) to a distance of |2-1| + |4-4| = 1 from (2,4) to (1,4).  
The path is valid and progresses toward the destination.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The current position is (2,4), and the final destination is (1,4), one step down. The initial subgoal to reach (2,4) has been achieved. Adjust the subgoal to reach the final destination (1,4) by moving down one step, ensuring the move avoids the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,4) to the final destination (1,4). This requires a single move down, which should be checked for validity (within bounds and avoiding the obstacle).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,4), move down to (1,4):
- **Move**: (2,4) to (1,4) is a single step down.
- **Grid bounds**: (1,4) is within the 6x6 grid.
- **Obstacle avoidance**: (1,4) is not (0,4), so the move avoids the obstacle.
- **Action validity**: Moving down is a valid action.
The path segment is: (2,4) → (1,4).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the shortest path from (5,5) to (1,4), avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Reach intermediate point (2,4) from (5,5) [Completed].
  - **Subgoal 2**: Reach final destination (1,4) from (2,4) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that the final destination (1,4) has been reached, completing the path.  
**Path Summary**: The complete path is (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (1,4), which has 5 steps, matching the Manhattan distance (indicating a shortest path) and avoiding the obstacle.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path: (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (1,4). Ensure all moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and confirm the path is the shortest possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the complete path:
- **Grid bounds**: All coordinates (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4) are within the 6x6 grid.
- **Obstacle avoidance**: No coordinate is (0,4).
- **Move validity**: Each step is a single move (up, left, or down), all valid per the action space.
- **Shortest path**: The path has 5 steps, equal to the Manhattan distance (|5-1| + |5-4| = 5). The obstacle at (0,4) does not block this path, as the final move to (1,4) comes from (2,4), not (0,4).
- **Start and end**: The path starts at (5,5) and ends at (1,4), as required.
The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
The shortest path from (5,5) to (1,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**(5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (1,4)**
