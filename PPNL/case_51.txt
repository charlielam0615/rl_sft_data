**Problem Statement**:  
Navigate a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at (2,2) to the destination at (5,4), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,4) from (2,2) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, calculate the Manhattan distance: |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves. Possible subgoals involve moving right (toward x=5) and up (toward y=4), while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). Initial subgoals:  
1. Move right from (2,2) to (3,2).  
2. Move right to (4,2).  
3. Move right to (5,2).  
4. Move up to (5,3) (check for obstacle).  
5. Move up to (5,4).  
Since (5,3) is an obstacle, adjust the path to avoid it, possibly by moving up earlier.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The initial subgoals include (5,3), which is an obstacle. Adjust the subgoals to avoid (5,3). Instead of moving to (5,2) and then up, consider moving up before reaching x=5. Revised subgoals:  
1. Move right from (2,2) to (3,2).  
2. Move right to (4,2).  
3. Move up to (4,3).  
4. Move up to (4,4).  
5. Move right to (5,4).  
This path avoids (5,3) and maintains the Manhattan distance of 5 moves.

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,4) from (2,2) while avoiding (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (3,2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (4,2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (4,3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Move to (4,4).  
  - Subgoal 5: Move to (5,4).  
**Current Goal**: Move to (3,2).  
The subgoals reflect the adjusted plan from the previous step, ensuring the path avoids the obstacle at (5,3).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,2) to (3,2).  
**How to Achieve**: Move right one step, as the action space allows moving right from (2,2) to (3,2), and (3,2) is not an obstacle.

[IMP]  
Execute the move: From (2,2), move right to (3,2).  
Current position: (3,2).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**How to Achieve**: Check if (3,2) is within the 6x6 grid, not an obstacle, and aligns with the planned path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
(3,2) is within the grid (0 ≤ 3 < 6, 0 ≤ 2 < 6), not an obstacle (grid[3][2] = 0), and matches the first subgoal. The move is valid.
