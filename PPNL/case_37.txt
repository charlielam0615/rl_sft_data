--- Case 37 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at coordinate (1,1) to the destination at coordinate (0,1), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form. The grid is represented as [[0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 1 indicates an obstacle, and the starting point (1,1) is marked as 2, and the destination (0,1) is marked as 3.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (1,1) to (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step away vertically (up) from the starting point, and no obstacles lie directly between (1,1) and (0,1), a single subgoal is to move up to (0,1). The path must avoid (0,4), but itâ€™s not on the direct route. Thus, the subgoal is to reach (0,1) in one step.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,1) to (0,1). This can be achieved by taking one step up, as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and does not encounter the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (1,1), move up to (0,1). This is a valid move since (0,1) is within the 6x6 grid, and the grid value at (0,1) is 3 (destination, not an obstacle). The path so far is [(1,1), (0,1)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the path [(1,1), (0,1)] is valid and reaches the destination (0,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the path [(1,1), (0,1)]:  
- Starting at (1,1), moving up to (0,1) is a valid action (within grid boundaries).  
- The coordinate (0,1) has no obstacle (grid value is 3, indicating the destination).  
- The obstacle at (0,4) is not on the path.  
- The destination (0,1) is reached.  
The path is valid and complete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (1,1) to (0,1) avoiding obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal: Move from (1,1) to (0,1) in one step (up).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the path [(1,1), (0,1)] as the solution.  
The subgoal to reach (0,1) was set in Step 1 and achieved in Step 2, validated in Step 3. No additional subgoals are needed since the destination is reached.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,1) to (0,1) avoiding the obstacle at (0,4) is: **[(1,1), (0,1)]**.
