--- Case 49 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (2,4) to the destination (4,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

Where:
- 2 represents the starting point (2,4).
- 3 represents the destination (4,3).
- 1 represents the obstacle (5,3).
- 0 represents free cells.

The goal is to compute the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,4) to (4,3) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a grid with only up, down, left, and right moves, we can aim to reduce the Manhattan distance (difference in x and y coordinates) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). The Manhattan distance is |4-2| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, suggesting a minimum of 3 moves if no obstacles interfere. Subgoals include:
1. Move from (2,4) to an intermediate point closer to (4,3), such as (3,4) or (2,3).
2. Continue moving toward (4,3), ensuring the path avoids (5,3).
3. Reach the destination (4,3).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,4) to an intermediate point closer to (4,3), such as (3,4) or (2,3). This can be achieved by selecting a valid move (up, down, left, or right) that reduces the distance to the destination and avoids the obstacle at (5,3). From (2,4), possible moves are:
- Up: (1,4)
- Down: (3,4)
- Left: (2,3)
- Right: (2,5)
Moving to (2,3) reduces the y-coordinate difference (|3-4|=1 to |3-3|=0) and is a valid move since (2,3) is a free cell (0 in the grid).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,4), move left to (2,3). This step reduces the Manhattan distance to (4,3) from 3 to 2 (|4-2| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2) and keeps the path on track toward the destination.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the move from (2,4) to (2,3) is valid and keeps the path toward (4,3) feasible. Check if (2,3) is a valid cell, not an obstacle, and if the path can continue to (4,3) without being blocked by (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The move to (2,3) is valid since the grid at (2,3) contains 0 (free cell). The obstacle at (5,3) does not block immediate moves from (2,3), which include:
- Up: (1,3)
- Down: (3,3)
- Left: (2,2)
- Right: (2,4)
The destination (4,3) is still reachable from (2,3) by moving down to (3,3) then (4,3), or other potential paths, without hitting (5,3). The path remains feasible.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
From the current position (2,3), continue toward (4,3). The remaining Manhattan distance is 2 (|4-2| + |3-3| = 2), suggesting at least two more moves. Subgoals include:
1. Move from (2,3) to (3,3) to reduce the x-coordinate difference.
2. Move from (3,3) to (4,3) to reach the destination.
These steps avoid the obstacle at (5,3) since neither (3,3) nor (4,3) is obstructed.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,3) to (3,3) to reduce the x-coordinate difference to the destination (4,3). This can be achieved by moving down from (2,3) to (3,3), which is a valid move since (3,3) is a free cell (0 in the grid).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,3), move down to (3,3). This reduces the Manhattan distance to (4,3) from 2 to 1 (|4-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the move from (2,3) to (3,3) is valid and keeps the path to (4,3) feasible. Check if (3,3) is a free cell and if the destination (4,3) can be reached without hitting the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The move to (3,3) is valid since the grid at (3,3) contains 0 (free cell). From (3,3), possible moves are:
- Up: (2,3)
- Down: (4,3)
- Left: (3,2)
- Right: (3,4)
The destination (4,3) is directly reachable by moving down, and (4,3) is a free cell (contains 3, the destination). The obstacle at (5,3) does not interfere. The path remains valid.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,3) to the destination (4,3). This can be achieved by moving down from (3,3) to (4,3), which is a valid move since (4,3) is the destination and a free cell.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,3), move down to (4,3). This reaches the destination, completing the path.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (2,4) to (4,3) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,4) to (2,3) [Completed in Step 2].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,3) to (3,3) [Completed in Step 5].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,3) to (4,3) [Completed in Step 7].

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the completion of the path to (4,3), which has been achieved.

The path constructed is:
- (2,4) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3)

This path has 3 moves, matching the minimum Manhattan distance, and avoids the obstacle at (5,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the entire path from (2,4) to (4,3): [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]. Check that all moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and lead to the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the path:
- (2,4) to (2,3): Valid move (left), grid[2][3] = 0 (free).
- (2,3) to (3,3): Valid move (down), grid[3][3] = 0 (free).
- (3,3) to (4,3): Valid move (down), grid[4][3] = 3 (destination).
- Obstacle check: None of the path coordinates (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) include (5,3).
- Path length: 3 moves, which is optimal given the Manhattan distance of 3.
The path is valid and correct.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,4) to (4,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:

**[(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]**

This path uses 3 moves: left, down, down, and is verified to be valid and obstacle-free.
