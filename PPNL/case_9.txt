--- Case 9 ---
**Problem Statement**:  
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world, starting from position (3,5) to reach the destination at (3,0), while avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form, adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework (Planning, Implementation, Review) as specified.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (3,5) to (3,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same column (x=3) and we need to move from y=5 to y=0, the primary movement is downward. The obstacle at (2,1) must be considered to ensure the path avoids it. Subgoals:  
1. Move downward from (3,5) toward (3,0), checking for obstacles.  
2. If an obstacle is encountered, adjust the path to bypass it while minimizing steps.  
3. Reach the final position (3,0).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move downward from (3,5) toward (3,0) while checking for obstacles. Use the action space (up, down, left, right) to explore possible moves, prioritizing downward steps since the destination is at y=0. Start by attempting a direct downward path and validate against the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Attempt a direct downward path from (3,5):  
- From (3,5), move down to (3,4).  
- From (3,4), move down to (3,3).  
- From (3,3), move down to (3,2).  
- From (3,2), move down to (3,1).  
- Check: (3,1) is adjacent to the obstacle at (2,1), but (3,1) is not an obstacle.  
- From (3,1), move down to (3,0).  

Path so far: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)].  
This path has 5 steps, all downward, and avoids the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)] to ensure it is feasible, avoids the obstacle, and is the shortest possible. Check each coordinate against the grid constraints and obstacle, and verify the path length.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the proposed path:  
- **Grid boundaries**: All coordinates [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)] are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).  
- **Obstacle avoidance**: The obstacle is at (2,1). None of the path coordinates match (2,1).  
- **Action validity**: Each step is a downward move (y decreases by 1), which is allowed (action: down).  
- **Path length**: The path has 5 steps. Since the Manhattan distance from (3,5) to (3,0) is |3-3| + |5-0| = 5, this is the shortest possible path in terms of steps, as no detours are needed to avoid the obstacle.  
The path is valid and appears optimal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the shortest path from (3,5) to (3,0) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move downward from (3,5) toward (3,0), checking for obstacles (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Adjust path if an obstacle is encountered (not needed, as direct path avoids obstacle).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,0) (completed via proposed path).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)] as the final solution, ensuring all subgoals are met and no further adjustments are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the final path by retrieving relevant information from previous steps, focusing on the path’s coordinates, obstacle avoidance, and path length to ensure completeness.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 1 (Forward Subgoaling): The goal was broken into moving downward and avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
- From Step 2 (Reach Goal): A direct downward path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)] was proposed, with 5 steps.  
- From Step 3 (Validation): The path was validated as within grid boundaries, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), using only downward moves, and having the minimal length (5 steps, matching the Manhattan distance).  
- From Step 4 (Track Goals): All subgoals were met, with no need for path adjustments.  

The recalled information confirms the path is correct, feasible, and optimal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,5) to (3,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:  
[(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)]
