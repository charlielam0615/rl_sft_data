**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at (2,1), find the shortest path from the starting point (2,2) to the destination (0,5) using only the actions up, down, left, and right. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the path should be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,2) to (0,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), we can consider moving towards the destination by reducing the Manhattan distance (difference in x and y coordinates). The goal requires moving from x=2 to x=0 (2 steps left) and from y=2 to y=5 (3 steps up). A subgoal could be to first move left to reach x=0 while avoiding the obstacle, then move up to y=5. Let’s set an initial subgoal to reach (0,2) by moving left, avoiding (2,1).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach the subgoal (0,2) from (2,2). This can be achieved by moving left two steps along row 2, checking that the path avoids the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,2), move left to (1,2), then left to (0,2). The path (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) avoids the obstacle at (2,1) since it stays in row 2.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate that the path from (2,2) to (0,2) is feasible and avoids the obstacle. Check each step in the path (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) to ensure it stays within the grid and does not pass through (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The path (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) is valid:  
- (2,2) to (1,2): Move left, stays in row 2, no obstacle.  
- (1,2) to (0,2): Move left, stays in row 2, no obstacle.  
All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5), and (2,1) is not on the path.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From the current position (0,2), the final destination is (0,5). The next subgoal is to move from (0,2) to (0,5) by moving up 3 steps along column 0. This path should be checked for obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (0,5) from (0,2). This can be achieved by moving up three steps: (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (0,2), move up to (0,3), then to (0,4), then to (0,5). The path (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5) stays in column 0 and does not encounter the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the path from (0,2) to (0,5) to ensure it is feasible and avoids the obstacle. Check each step: (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The path (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5) is valid:  
- (0,2) to (0,3): Move up, stays in column 0, no obstacle.  
- (0,3) to (0,4): Move up, stays in column 0, no obstacle.  
- (0,4) to (0,5): Move up, stays in column 0, no obstacle.  
All coordinates are within the grid, and the obstacle at (2,1) is not on the path.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Move from (2,2) to (0,5).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,2) to (0,2) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (0,2) to (0,5) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the path from (2,2) to (0,5) has been constructed.  
The complete path is (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the entire path from (2,2) to (0,5): (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5). Ensure it is the shortest path by checking the number of steps and obstacle avoidance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The path (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5) has 5 steps.  
- All moves are valid (left or up, within the grid).  
- The obstacle at (2,1) is avoided (path stays in row 2 or column 0).  
- The Manhattan distance from (2,2) to (0,5) is |2-0| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5, matching the path length, confirming it is the shortest.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,2) to (0,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:  
**(2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (0,5)**
