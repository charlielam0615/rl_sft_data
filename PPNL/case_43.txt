**Problem Statement**:  
In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,5) to the destination at (5,5), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form. The grid is represented as:  
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  // Row 0, obstacle at (0,4)
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 2
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],  // Row 4, start at (4,5)
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]]  // Row 5, destination at (5,5)
```
where 0 represents an empty cell, 1 an obstacle, 2 the start, and 3 the destination.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of navigating from (4,5) to (5,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step below the start, a potential subgoal is to move from (4,5) to (5,5) directly. Possible actions from (4,5) are: up to (3,5), down to (5,5), left to (4,4), or right (out of bounds). The shortest path appears to be a single downward move, as it reaches the destination directly.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,5) to (5,5). Validate if the direct downward move from (4,5) to (5,5) is feasible by checking for obstacles and grid boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,5), moving down leads to (5,5). The grid shows (5,5) has a value of 3 (destination), not an obstacle (1), and is within the 6x6 grid boundaries. The move is valid, and no obstacles are present on this path.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (4,5) to (5,5).  
- Subgoal: Move from (4,5) to (5,5) in one step (downward).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,5) to (5,5).  
The subgoal from Step 1 (move to (5,5)) has been validated as feasible in Step 2. No additional subgoals are needed, as the path is direct.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,5) to (5,5). Achieve this by executing the validated downward move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at (4,5), perform the downward move to reach (5,5). The path is: [(4,5), (5,5)]. This completes the navigation to the destination.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer  
The shortest path from (4,5) to (5,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**[(4,5), (5,5)]**  

The plan is complete, as the destination has been reached in the shortest possible way (one move).
