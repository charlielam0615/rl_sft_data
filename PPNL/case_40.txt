--- Case 40 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,0) to the destination at (3,0), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, or right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,0) to (3,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step upward from the starting point and there are no obstacles between (4,0) and (3,0), the subgoal is to move up one step to reach (3,0).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,0) to (3,0).  
**How to Achieve**: Execute the "up" action to move from (4,0) to (3,0), as it is a valid move within the grid and avoids the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the current position (4,0), perform the "up" action. This moves the agent to (3,0), which is the destination. The path so far is [(4,0), (3,0)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the path from (4,0) to (3,0) is valid and complete.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the current position (3,0) matches the destination, confirm the path avoids the obstacle at (0,4), and ensure all moves are within the grid and follow the allowed actions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The current position is (3,0), which matches the destination. The path [(4,0), (3,0)] involves one "up" move, which is a valid action. The path does not pass through the obstacle at (0,4), and all coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 to 5 for both x and y). The path is valid and complete, as it reaches the destination in the shortest possible way (one step).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Navigate from (4,0) to (3,0) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (4,0) to (3,0) via the "up" action (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to reach (3,0), which has been achieved as validated in the previous step. No further subgoals are needed since the destination has been reached.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Path**: The shortest path from (4,0) to (3,0) is [(4,0), (3,0)].
