--- Case 25 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at (5,4) to the destination at (2,4), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Row 0 (obstacle at (0,4))
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],  # Row 2 (destination at (2,4))
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 4
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]]  # Row 5 (start at (5,4))
```

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid (within grid boundaries and avoiding the obstacle).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,4) to (2,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same column (y=4), the primary movement is upward along column 4. The obstacle at (0,4) means we must stop at (1,4) and find a way around (0,4). Subgoals:  
1. Move from (5,4) to (1,4).  
2. Navigate around the obstacle at (0,4) to reach (2,4).

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,4) from (5,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,4) to (1,4).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate around (0,4) to reach (2,4).  
**Current Goal:** Move from (5,4) to (1,4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to move from (5,4) to (1,4). This can be achieved by moving up along column 4 (from (5,4) to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)), as there are no obstacles in these positions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at (5,4), move up:  
- From (5,4) to (4,4).  
- From (4,4) to (3,4).  
- From (3,4) to (2,4).  
- From (2,4) to (1,4).  
This path is valid as all coordinates are within the 6x6 grid and avoid the obstacle at (0,4). The current position is now (1,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the path from (5,4) to (1,4). Check if the path [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] is valid by ensuring all coordinates are within the grid and do not include the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the path:  
- Coordinates: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4).  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).  
- None of the coordinates are (0,4), the obstacle.  
- Each move is a valid up action (decreasing x by 1, y unchanged).  
The path is valid. Current position is (1,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The current position is (1,4), and the next subgoal is to navigate around the obstacle at (0,4) to reach (2,4). Since moving up from (1,4) to (0,4) is blocked, adjust the subgoal to:  
1. Move laterally (left or right) from (1,4) to a safe column (e.g., y=3 or y=5).  
2. Move to (2, y) in the safe column.  
3. Move back to (2,4) if needed.  
Choose to move left to (1,3), then down to (2,3), and right to (2,4).  
[/PLANNING]

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,4) from (5,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,4) to (1,4) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate around (0,4) to reach (2,4).  
    - Adjusted Subgoal 2.1: Move from (1,4) to (1,3).  
    - Adjusted Subgoal 2.2: Move from (1,3) to (2,3).  
    - Adjusted Subgoal 2.3: Move from (2,3) to (2,4).  
**Current Goal:** Move from (1,4) to (1,3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to move from (1,4) to (1,3). This can be achieved by moving left from (1,4) to (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,4), move left to (1,3).  
- (1,3) is within the 6x6 grid and is not an obstacle.  
The current position is now (1,3).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to move from (1,3) to (2,3). This can be achieved by moving down from (1,3) to (2,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,3), move down to (2,3).  
- (2,3) is within the 6x6 grid and is not an obstacle.  
The current position is now (2,3).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to move from (2,3) to (2,4). This can be achieved by moving right from (2,3) to (2,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,3), move right to (2,4).  
- (2,4) is the destination, within the 6x6 grid, and not an obstacle.  
The current position is now (2,4), the destination.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the complete path from (5,4) to (2,4): [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4)]. Ensure all moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and reach the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the path: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4)]  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid.  
- The obstacle (0,4) is not in the path.  
- Moves:  
  - (5,4) to (4,4): Up (valid).  
  - (4,4) to (3,4): Up (valid).  
  - (3,4) to (2,4): Up (valid).  
  - (2,4) to (1,4): Up (valid).  
  - (1,4) to (1,3): Left (valid).  
  - (1,3) to (2,3): Down (valid).  
  - (2,3) to (2,4): Right (valid).  
- The path starts at (5,4) and ends at (2,4).  
- Path length: 7 moves, which is minimal given the need to detour around (0,4).  
The path is valid and complete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The core content is the complete path from (5,4) to (2,4). Retrieve and summarize all relevant information about the path and its validation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- The path from (5,4) to (2,4) is: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4)].  
- The path avoids the obstacle at (0,4) by detouring through (1,3) and (2,3).  
- Validation confirmed all moves are within the 6x6 grid and use only up, down, left, or right actions.  
- The path length is 7 moves, accounted for by 4 upward moves to (1,4) and 3 moves to navigate around the obstacle.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (5,4) to (2,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**[(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4)]**
