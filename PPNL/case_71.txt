**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning problem in a 6x6 grid world. The starting position is at (0,5), and the goal is to reach (4,0). There is an obstacle at (5,3) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The objective is to find the shortest path from the start to the goal and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the problem of moving from (0,5) to (4,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is 6x6 and there is an obstacle at (5,3), I need to navigate around it while minimizing the number of steps. My initial subgoals are to first move toward the target row (row 4) and then adjust to reach the target column (column 0), avoiding the obstacle. Potential subgoals could be reaching intermediate points like (2,5) and then (4,3) before heading to (4,0).  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To refine the path, I will work backward from the goal (4,0) to identify necessary intermediate subgoals. Starting from (4,0), I can move to (4,1) or (3,0). Given the obstacle at (5,3), moving along row 4 seems safer initially. A possible subgoal could be (4,3) as a midpoint to connect from the starting area. From there, I can trace back to (2,5) or similar points to connect to the start at (0,5).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After considering forward and backward subgoaling, I will adjust the intermediate subgoals for clarity. The subgoals will be:  
1. Move from (0,5) to (2,5) to progress toward row 4.  
2. Move from (2,5) to (4,3) to avoid the obstacle at (5,3) and approach the goal row and column.  
3. Move from (4,3) to (4,0) to reach the final destination.  
These subgoals provide a clear structure to guide the path planning.

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (4,0) from (0,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,5) to (2,5).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,5) to (4,3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (4,3) to (4,0).  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Move from (0,5) to (2,5).  
This hierarchy keeps the focus on progressing step by step toward the final destination.

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Move from (0,5) to (2,5).  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will move down the grid from row 0 to row 2 while staying in column 5, as there are no obstacles in this path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (0,5), I will execute the following movements:  
- Move down to (1,5).  
- Move down to (2,5).  
I have now reached the first subgoal at (2,5). The path so far is: [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)].

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Validate the path from (0,5) to (2,5).  
Description: I will check if the path taken adheres to the grid constraints and avoids obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path from (0,5) to (2,5) is [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)]. All moves are within the 6x6 grid, use only allowed actions (up, down, left, right), and do not pass through the obstacle at (5,3). The path is valid.
