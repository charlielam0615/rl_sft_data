--- Case 64 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I am tasked with planning a path in a 6x6 grid world. The starting point is (2,0), and the destination is (3,4). There is an obstacle at (5,3) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the destination and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (3,4) from (2,0) into intermediate subgoals. Considering the grid layout and the obstacle at (5,3), I aim to move towards the target by increasing the y-coordinate to reach column 4 while adjusting the x-coordinate from 2 to 3. A possible sequence of subgoals could be: first move to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), and finally adjust to (3,4). This path avoids the obstacle and seems direct.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
Upon reviewing the initial subgoals, I notice that moving directly from (2,4) to (3,4) is feasible since there are no obstacles in between. However, I will consider if a shorter path exists by possibly adjusting the x-coordinate earlier. Instead of moving all the way to (2,4), I can adjust to (3,3) from (2,3) and then move to (3,4). New subgoals: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). This reduces the total steps.
