--- Case 84 ---
### Problem Statement
We need to find the shortest path from the starting point (1,1) to the destination (3,1) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding obstacles at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents an obstacle at (3,4).
- 2 represents the starting point at (1,1).
- 3 represents the destination at (3,1).

The path should be returned in coordinate form, and we must select one meta-cognitive action per step from the set M (Planning, Implementation, Review) to solve the problem systematically.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the shortest path from (1,1) to (3,1), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (3,1) and the start is at (1,1), we need to move 2 steps down (from row 1 to row 3) while staying in column 1, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Subgoals:
1. Move from (1,1) to (2,1).
2. Move from (2,1) to (3,1).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,1) to (2,1). This can be achieved by taking a single "down" action, as (2,1) is directly below (1,1) and the cell is empty (grid value 0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,1), move down to (2,1). This is a valid move since (2,1) is within the grid and has no obstacle.  
Current path: [(1,1), (2,1)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (1,1) to (2,1). Check if the move to (2,1) is valid and aligns with the goal of reaching (3,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The move from (1,1) to (2,1) is valid:  
- (2,1) is within the 6x6 grid.  
- The grid at (2,1) has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
- The move brings us closer to (3,1), as we are now one row away.  
The path [(1,1), (2,1)] is valid so far.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,1) from (1,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,1) to (2,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,1) to (3,1) [Current].  
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,1) to (3,1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,1) to (3,1). This can be achieved by taking a single "down" action, as (3,1) is directly below (2,1) and the cell is empty (grid value 3, destination).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,1), move down to (3,1). This is a valid move since (3,1) is within the grid and is the destination.  
Updated path: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (2,1) to (3,1) and ensure the entire path from (1,1) to (3,1) is correct. Check if the move to (3,1) is valid and if the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The move from (2,1) to (3,1) is valid:  
- (3,1) is within the 6x6 grid.  
- The grid at (3,1) is the destination (value 3).  
- The path [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)] avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
- The path is the shortest possible, requiring only 2 moves (down, down).  
The complete path [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)] is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,1) from (1,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,1) to (2,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,1) to (3,1) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The final path is [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,1) to (3,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]**
