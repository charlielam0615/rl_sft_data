--- Case 89 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (0,2) to the destination at (1,5), while avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid layout is provided as [[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 2 indicates the start, 3 the destination, 1 the obstacle, and 0 empty cells. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (1,5) from (0,2) into intermediate subgoals. Given the grid layout and the obstacle at (3,4), I need to plan a path that moves around the obstacle while aiming for the shortest route. My initial subgoals will be to move eastward towards column 5 while adjusting row position to reach row 1, avoiding row 3 near column 4 due to the obstacle. Tentative subgoals are: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), then adjust to (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After considering the grid, I realize that moving directly to (0,5) and then to (1,5) is straightforward and likely the shortest path since there are no obstacles in this route. I will adjust the subgoals to: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), and finally (1,5). This keeps the path minimal in steps (total of 4 moves: 3 right, 1 down).

How to Achieve: Move right by one step from (0,2) to (0,3), as the path is clear with no obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (0,2), I execute the movement to the right. The new position is (0,3). This step is completed successfully.

How to Achieve: Check if (0,3) is within grid bounds, not an obstacle, and aligns with the planned subgoals.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The position (0,3) is within the 6x6 grid bounds. According to the grid layout, (0,3) has a value of 0, indicating it is an empty cell and not an obstacle. This position matches Subgoal 1 in the planned path towards (1,5). The current path remains valid.
