--- Case 23 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,0) to the destination at (2,0), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the shortest path from (0,0) to (2,0) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (2,0), the path requires moving 2 units right along the x-axis while staying at y=0 to avoid the obstacle at (2,1). Possible subgoals include moving to (1,0) and then to (2,0), as this path avoids the obstacle and minimizes steps.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,0) from (0,0) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move to (1,0).  
The subgoals reflect the plan to move right along y=0 to reach (2,0) in two steps, ensuring the obstacle at (2,1) is avoided.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (0,0) to (1,0).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (0,0), apply the "right" action to move to (1,0). This keeps the path along y=0, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (0,0), execute the "right" action. This moves the agent to (1,0). The coordinates of the path so far are [(0,0), (1,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the validity of the current position (1,0) and the path taken.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if (1,0) is within the 6x6 grid, not an obstacle, and aligns with the subgoal of moving toward (2,0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The current position (1,0) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 0 ≤ y ≤ 5). It is not the obstacle at (2,1), and the path [(0,0), (1,0)] is valid as it progresses toward (2,0) without encountering obstacles. The move aligns with the subgoal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,0) from (0,0) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move to (2,0).  
The first subgoal is complete, and the next step is to reach the final destination (2,0).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move from (1,0) to (2,0).  
- **How to Achieve**: From (1,0), apply the "right" action to move to (2,0). This completes the path to the destination while avoiding the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,0), execute the "right" action. This moves the agent to (2,0). The complete path is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the validity of the final position (2,0) and the complete path.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if (2,0) is the destination, within the grid, not an obstacle, and if the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)] is the shortest while avoiding (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The current position (2,0) matches the destination and is within the 6x6 grid. It is not the obstacle at (2,1). The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)] uses 2 moves, which is the shortest possible (Manhattan distance = 2), and avoids the obstacle. The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of confirming the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)] as the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal was to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (2,0) avoiding (2,1). Previous steps established:  
- Subgoals were to move to (1,0) then (2,0) [Step 1, Step 2].  
- The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)] was constructed and validated [Steps 3, 6, 7].  
- The path uses 2 moves, matching the minimum required, and avoids the obstacle at (2,1) [Step 7].  
This confirms the path is correct and complete.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Path**: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
