--- Case 76 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at coordinates (0,1) to the destination at (5,0), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form. The grid is represented as [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 0 indicates a free cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,0) from (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the objective is to find the shortest path in a grid with obstacles, define subgoals as key points that guide the path while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Possible subgoals include moving downward to approach row 5 and then leftward to reach column 0, ensuring the path remains valid by avoiding the obstacle.  
Subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,1) to (3,1), staying in column 1 to avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
2. Move from (3,1) to (5,1), continuing downward.  
3. Move from (5,1) to (5,0), making a final left move to the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the feasibility of the subgoals defined in Step 1: moving from (0,1) to (3,1), then to (5,1), and finally to (5,0). Check if the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4) and stays within the grid boundaries, using only up, down, left, or right movements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate the path:  
- From (0,1) to (3,1): Move down through (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). All cells are 0 (free) in the grid, and none are at (3,4).  
- From (3,1) to (5,1): Move down through (4,1), (5,1). Both cells are 0, and the path avoids (3,4).  
- From (5,1) to (5,0): Move left to (5,0). The cell at (5,0) is 3 (destination), which is valid.  
The path stays within the 6x6 grid (rows 0–5, columns 0–5) and only uses down and left movements, which are allowed. The obstacle at (3,4) is not on the path. The path is valid.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,0) from (0,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (3,1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,1) to (5,1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (5,1) to (5,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (0,1) to (3,1).  
The subgoals reflect the plan from Step 1, validated in Step 2, and provide a clear structure for the path.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,1) to (3,1). Achieve this by applying a sequence of down movements through the grid, ensuring each step is valid and avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (0,1):  
- Move down to (1,1): Cell is 0 (free).  
- Move down to (2,1): Cell is 0 (free).  
- Move down to (3,1): Cell is 0 (free).  
The sequence is (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1). All cells are free, and the path avoids (3,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,0) from (0,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (3,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,1) to (5,1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (5,1) to (5,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,1) to (5,1).  
Subgoal 1 has been achieved, as confirmed in Step 4. The focus shifts to the next subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,1) to (5,1). Achieve this by moving downward through the grid, ensuring the path remains valid.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (3,1):  
- Move down to (4,1): Cell is 0 (free).  
- Move down to (5,1): Cell is 0 (free).  
The sequence is (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1). All cells are free, and the path avoids (3,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,0) from (0,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (3,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,1) to (5,1) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (5,1) to (5,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (5,1) to (5,0).  
Subgoal 2 has been achieved, as confirmed in Step 6. The final subgoal remains.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (5,1) to (5,0). Achieve this by making a single left movement to the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (5,1):  
- Move left to (5,0): Cell is 3 (destination).  
The sequence is (5,1) → (5,0). The destination is reached, and the path avoids (3,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the complete path from (0,1) to (5,0). Retrieve all relevant path segments from previous steps to construct the final path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- Step 4: Path from (0,1) to (3,1): (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1).  
- Step 6: Path from (3,1) to (5,1): (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1).  
- Step 8: Path from (5,1) to (5,0): (5,1) → (5,0).  
Combining these, the complete path is: (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → (5,0).  
This path has 6 moves, avoids the obstacle at (3,4), and uses only down and left movements, satisfying all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,1) to (5,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
[(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,0)].
