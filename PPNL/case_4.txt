--- Case 4 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at (2,1), find the shortest path from the starting point (3,2) to the destination (5,2). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (3,2) to (5,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the movement is restricted to up, down, left, and right, and there is an obstacle at (2,1), the subgoals involve moving rightward along row 2 (y=2) while ensuring valid moves. The subgoals are:
1. Move from (3,2) to (4,2).
2. Move from (4,2) to (5,2).

### Step 2: Track Goals

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (3,2) to (5,2) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,2) to (4,2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,2) to (5,2).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,2) to (4,2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,2) to (4,2). This can be achieved by taking a single right move, as (4,2) is directly adjacent and not an obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (3,2), move right to (4,2). The path so far is: [(3,2), (4,2)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the move from (3,2) to (4,2). Check if the move is within the grid boundaries, avoids the obstacle, and progresses toward the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The move from (3,2) to (4,2) is valid:
- (4,2) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 0 ≤ y ≤ 5).
- (4,2) is not the obstacle at (2,1).
- The move reduces the Manhattan distance to the destination (5,2) from 2 to 1.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (3,2) to (5,2) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,2) to (4,2) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,2) to (5,2).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,2) to (5,2).

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,2) to (5,2). This can be achieved by taking a single right move, as (5,2) is directly adjacent and not an obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (4,2), move right to (5,2). The path so far is: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)].

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the move from (4,2) to (5,2). Check if the move is within the grid boundaries, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The move from (4,2) to (5,2) is valid:
- (5,2) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 0 ≤ y ≤ 5).
- (5,2) is not the obstacle at (2,1).
- (5,2) is the destination, completing the path.

  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,2) to (4,2) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,2) to (5,2) (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,2) to (5,2) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is: **[(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]**.
