--- Case 45 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (2,5) to the destination at (1,4), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 1 is the obstacle, 2 is the start, and 3 is the destination. The goal is to find the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,5) to (1,4) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider the Manhattan distance ((|2-1| + |5-4| = 2) and possible moves (up, down, left, right) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). Subgoals:  
1. Move left from (2,5) to (2,4) to reduce the y-coordinate.  
2. Move up from (2,4) to (1,4) to reach the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (2,5) to (1,4) via (2,4). Check if the subgoals (move left to (2,4), then up to (1,4)) form a valid path by ensuring no obstacles are encountered and moves are within the grid.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the path:  
- From (2,5) to (2,4): Move left (y: 5 → 4). Grid[2][4] = 0 (no obstacle), and coordinates are within bounds (0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 0 ≤ y ≤ 5). Valid move.  
- From (2,4) to (1,4): Move up (x: 2 → 1). Grid[1][4] = 3 (destination, no obstacle), and coordinates are within bounds. Valid move.  
- Check obstacle: (0,4) is not on the path [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)].  
The path is valid and has a length of 2 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance, suggesting it’s optimal.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (2,5) to (1,4) avoiding obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move left from (2,5) to (2,4). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Move up from (2,4) to (1,4). [Completed]  
**Current Goal**: The path [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] has been validated. The goal is now to confirm this as the final path or explore alternatives if needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To ensure optimality, work backward from (1,4) to (2,5) to confirm the shortest path or identify alternatives. From (1,4), possible moves to reach (2,5) are:  
- Move down to (2,4), then right to (2,5).  
- Move right to (1,5), then down to (2,5).  
Analyze these paths for validity and length.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the backward-generated paths: (1,4) → (2,4) → (2,5) and (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5). Check both for obstacles and grid bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the two paths:  
- **Path 1**: (1,4) → (2,4) → (2,5)  
  - (1,4) to (2,4): Move down (x: 1 → 2). Grid[2][4] = 0, within bounds. Valid.  
  - (2,4) to (2,5): Move right (y: 4 → 5). Grid[2][5] = 2 (start), within bounds. Valid.  
  - Obstacle check: (0,4) not on path. Length = 2 moves.  
- **Path 2**: (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5)  
  - (1,4) to (1,5): Move right (y: 4 → 5). Grid[1][5] = 0, within bounds. Valid.  
  - (1,5) to (2,5): Move down (x: 1 → 2). Grid[2][5] = 2, within bounds. Valid.  
  - Obstacle check: (0,4) not on path. Length = 2 moves.  
Both paths are valid and have 2 moves, matching the forward path’s length.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (2,5) to (1,4) avoiding obstacle at (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1 (Forward): Move left from (2,5) to (2,4). [Validated]  
  - Subgoal 2 (Forward): Move up from (2,4) to (1,4). [Validated]  
  - Subgoal 3 (Backward): Validate alternative path (1,4) → (2,4) → (2,5). [Validated]  
  - Subgoal 4 (Backward): Validate alternative path (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5). [Validated]  
**Current Goal**: Both forward path [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] and backward paths are valid with 2 moves. Select the forward path as the solution since it was derived first and meets the shortest path criterion.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to finalize the shortest path from (2,5) to (1,4). Use the validated forward path [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] as the solution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The shortest path from (2,5) to (1,4) is:  
- Start at (2,5).  
- Move left to (2,4).  
- Move up to (1,4).  
**Final Path**: [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)]  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (2,5) to (1,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)].
