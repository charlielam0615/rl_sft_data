### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (3,1) to the destination (3,4) in a 6x6 grid world. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and an obstacle is located at (0,4). The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  // Row 0
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 2
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0],  // Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 4
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  // Row 5
```

- **0** represents an empty cell.
- **1** at (0,4) represents an obstacle.
- **2** at (3,1) is the starting point.
- **3** at (3,4) is the destination.
- The agent can only move up, down, left, or right, and must avoid the obstacle at (0,4).
- The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates representing the shortest valid route.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format and constraints.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the shortest path from (3,1) to (3,4), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since the start and destination are on the same row (y=3), and the destination is to the right (x=1 to x=4), a straightforward approach is to move right along row 3, checking for obstacles. Subgoals:  
1. Move from (3,1) to (3,2).  
2. Move from (3,2) to (3,3).  
3. Move from (3,3) to (3,4).  
The obstacle at (0,4) is not on row 3, so it should not affect this path.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the proposed path: (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4). Check if this path is feasible by ensuring all coordinates are within the grid, each move is valid (up, down, left, right), and no obstacles are encountered.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the path:  
- **Grid boundaries**: All coordinates (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) have x, y ∈ [0,5], so they are within the 6x6 grid.  
- **Move validity**: Each step is a right move (x increases by 1, y remains 3), which is allowed.  
- **Obstacles**: Check the path coordinates against the obstacle at (0,4). None of the path coordinates (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) match (0,4).  
- **Grid values**: From the grid, row 3 is [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]. Positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) have values 2, 0, 0, 3, respectively, indicating no obstacles (only the start and destination markers).  
The path is valid and has a length of 3 moves.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the shortest path from (3,1) to (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (3,3) (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,3) to (3,4) (achieved).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the path (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) completes the task.  
The path has been validated as feasible and obstacle-free. All subgoals align with the main goal, and no further subgoals are needed since the destination (3,4) is reached.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the path from (3,1) to (3,4). The validated path (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) will be returned as the solution in coordinate form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The shortest path from (3,1) to (3,4), based on the validated subgoals, is:  
**[(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]**  
This path consists of three right moves, avoids the obstacle at (0,4), and is the shortest possible since the Manhattan distance (|3-3| + |4-1| = 3) is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,1) to (3,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**[(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]**

This completes the path planning task, as all subgoals have been achieved and validated, and the final path has been provided in coordinate form.
