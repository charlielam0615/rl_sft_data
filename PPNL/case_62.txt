--- Case 62 ---
**Problem Statement**:  
In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (5,1) to the destination at (1,2), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,1) to (1,2) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider Manhattan distance (requiring 4 moves up and 1 move right) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). Subgoals:  
1. Move up from (5,1) to reduce the y-coordinate toward 2.  
2. Adjust x-coordinate toward 1, ensuring the path avoids (5,3).  
3. Reach (1,2) by continuing valid moves.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (1,2) from (5,1) while avoiding (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move up to reduce y-coordinate toward 2.  
  - Subgoal 2: Adjust x-coordinate toward 1, avoiding (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (1,2) with valid moves.  
**Current Goal**: Move up from (5,1) to reduce y-coordinate.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move up from (5,1) to reduce the y-coordinate toward 2. Achieve this by selecting the "up" action to move to (4,1), which is a valid move (no obstacle and within grid bounds).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (5,1), move up to (4,1). This reduces the y-coordinate from 5 to 4, progressing toward the target y-coordinate of 2. The move is valid as (4,1) is not an obstacle and is within the 6x6 grid.  
Current position: (4,1).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path taken so far ((5,1) to (4,1)). Check if the current position (4,1) is valid, not an obstacle, and progresses toward (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The current position (4,1) is valid: it is within the 6x6 grid, not an obstacle (only (5,3) is an obstacle), and reduces the Manhattan distance to (1,2) (from 5 to 4). The path so far: [(5,1), (4,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From (4,1), continue toward (1,2). Subgoals:  
1. Continue moving up to reach y=2 (current y=4, target y=2).  
2. Move right to adjust x-coordinate from 1 to 2, ensuring the path avoids (5,3).  
3. Confirm arrival at (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to continue moving up from (4,1) to reduce y-coordinate toward 2. Select the "up" action to move to (3,1), which is valid and progresses toward the goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (4,1), move up to (3,1). This reduces the y-coordinate from 4 to 3. The move is valid as (3,1) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.  
Current position: (3,1).  
Path so far: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to continue moving up from (3,1) to reduce y-coordinate to 2. Select the "up" action to move to (2,1), which is valid and aligns with the target y-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (3,1), move up to (2,1). This reduces the y-coordinate to 2, matching the target y-coordinate. The move is valid as (2,1) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.  
Current position: (2,1).  
Path so far: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to adjust the x-coordinate from 1 to 2 to reach (1,2). From (2,1), select the "right" action to move to (2,2), which is valid and progresses toward the goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (2,1), move right to (2,2). This adjusts the x-coordinate from 1 to 2. The move is valid as (2,2) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.  
Current position: (2,2).  
Path so far: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (1,2) from (2,2). Select the "up" action to move to (1,2), which is the destination and a valid move.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (2,2), move up to (1,2). This reduces the y-coordinate from 2 to 1, reaching the destination. The move is valid as (1,2) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.  
Current position: (1,2).  
Path: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the final path from (5,1) to (1,2): [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2)]. Check if the path is valid, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The path [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2)] is valid:  
- All moves are within the 6x6 grid.  
- No position in the path is (5,3), the obstacle.  
- Each move is a valid action (up or right).  
- The path starts at (5,1) and ends at (1,2).  
- The path has 5 moves, which is the minimum (Manhattan distance = 5).  
**Final Path**: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The shortest path from (5,1) to (1,2) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3) is:  
[(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2)].
