**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (5,1) to the destination at (3,2), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

**Step 1: Define Subgoals to Reach Destination**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of moving from (5,1) to (3,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (3,2), the path requires moving up (from row 5 to row 3) and right (from column 1 to column 2), while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). Subgoals:
1. Move from (5,1) to (4,1) (up).
2. Move from (4,1) to (3,1) (up).
3. Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (right).
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Validate Initial Movement**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (5,1) to (4,1).
How to Achieve: Check if moving up from (5,1) to (4,1) is valid by ensuring (4,1) is within the grid and not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify grid boundaries: (4,1) is within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).
Check for obstacles: The obstacle is at (0,4). Since (4,1) is not (0,4), the move is valid.
Confirm action: Move up from (5,1) to (4,1).
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Track Current Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Reach (3,2) from (5,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,1) to (4,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,1) to (3,1).
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,1) to (3,2).
Current Goal: Move from (4,1) to (3,1).
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4: Execute Next Movement**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (4,1) to (3,1).
How to Achieve: Move up one step to reach the next subgoal coordinate.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute action: Move up from (4,1) to (3,1).
Verify: (3,1) is within the grid and not an obstacle (0,4). The move is valid.
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validate Path Progress**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,1) to (3,2).
How to Achieve: Check if moving right from (3,1) to (3,2) is valid by ensuring (3,2) is within the grid and not an obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify grid boundaries: (3,2) is within the 6x6 grid.
Check for obstacles: (3,2) is not (0,4).
Confirm action: Move right from (3,1) to (3,2).
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Track Goals and Confirm Completion**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Reach (3,2) from (5,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,1) to (4,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (4,1) to (3,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (completed).
Current Goal: None (destination reached).
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7: Recall Path Information**

[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Core Content: The sequence of coordinates forming the path from (5,1) to (3,2).
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Recalled Path: Based on previous steps, the path taken is:
- (5,1) → (4,1) (up)
- (4,1) → (3,1) (up)
- (3,1) → (3,2) (right)
Path in coordinate form: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)].
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (5,1) to (3,2) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)].
