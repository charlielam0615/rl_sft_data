**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to plan a path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point (0,1) to the destination (0,5). There is an obstacle at (2,1) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (0,5) from (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since there is an obstacle at (2,1), I need to plan a path that avoids this position. A possible approach is to move along row 0 if feasible, or detour through other rows if necessary. Subgoals will include reaching key points that guide the path toward (0,5).  
- Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (0,2).  
- Subgoal 2: Move from (0,2) to (0,3).  
- Subgoal 3: Move from (0,3) to (0,4).  
- Subgoal 4: Move from (0,4) to (0,5).

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,5) from (0,1) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,1) to (0,2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (0,2) to (0,3).

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Move from (0,1) to (0,2).  
How to Achieve: Use the 'right' action to move from (0,1) to (0,2) since it is a direct adjacent cell with no obstacles in between.

Successfully moved from (0,1) to (0,2) by taking the 'right' action. Current position is now (0,2). This completes Subgoal 1.

**Step 10:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the path taken from (0,1) to (0,5).  
How to Achieve: Check if the path avoids the obstacle at (2,1) and confirm that all moves are valid within the grid constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path taken is [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. This path avoids the obstacle at (2,1) as it stays entirely in row 0. All moves are valid 'right' actions within the 6x6 grid, and the path is the shortest possible with a length of 4 steps. The plan is complete and successful.  
[/IMP]

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (0,1) to (0,5) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)].
