**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,1) to the destination at (0,5), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,1) to (0,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, calculate the Manhattan distance: |4-0| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8 steps. Subgoals involve moving up 4 steps and right 4 steps while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1). Possible subgoals:  
1. Move up to row 2, avoiding column 1.  
2. Move right to column 5.  
3. Move up to row 0.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move up from (4,1) to row 2, staying in a safe column (e.g., column 2 to avoid (2,1)).  
How to Achieve: Move left to (4,2), then up through (3,2) to (2,2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,1), move left to (4,2), then up to (3,2), and up to (2,2). Path so far: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if the path to (2,2) is valid and avoids the obstacle.  
How to Achieve: Check coordinates against the obstacle at (2,1) and grid boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Path (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) is within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5). None of these coordinates match the obstacle at (2,1). All moves (left, up) are valid actions. The path is valid so far.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,5) from (4,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move up to row 2 (achieved at (2,2)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move right to column 5.  
  - Subgoal 3: Move up to row 0.  
Current Goal: Move right to column 5 from (2,2).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move right from (2,2) to column 5, reaching (2,5).  
How to Achieve: Move right through (2,3), (2,4), to (2,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,2), move right to (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5). Path so far: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the path from (2,2) to (2,5) is valid.  
How to Achieve: Check coordinates against the obstacle and grid boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Path (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) is within the grid. None of these coordinates match the obstacle at (2,1). All moves (right) are valid. The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,5) from (4,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move up to row 2 (achieved at (2,2)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move right to column 5 (achieved at (2,5)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move up to row 0.  
Current Goal: Move up from (2,5) to (0,5).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move up from (2,5) to (0,5).  
How to Achieve: Move up through (1,5) to (0,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,5), move up to (1,5), then up to (0,5). Final path: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5).  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the final path from (4,1) to (0,5) is valid and shortest.  
How to Achieve: Check all coordinates for obstacles, grid boundaries, and path length against Manhattan distance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Final path: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5).  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid.  
- None match the obstacle at (2,1).  
- Path length: 8 steps (1 left + 2 up + 3 right + 2 up).  
- Manhattan distance: 8 steps. The path is shortest and valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,5) from (4,1) (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move up to row 2 (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move right to column 5 (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move up to row 0 (achieved).  
Current Goal: None; all goals completed.  
Final Path: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (4,1) to (0,5) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is:  
(4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (0,5).
