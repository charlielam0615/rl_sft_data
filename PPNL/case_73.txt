--- Case 73 ---
**Problem Statement**:  
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,3) to the destination (0,2), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, and 2 and 3 mark the start and destination, respectively. The action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals to Reach the Destination
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,3) to (0,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one cell left of the starting point in the same row (y=3 to y=2, x=0), a direct move left seems feasible. However, we must ensure the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4). The subgoal is to move left from (0,3) to (0,2), checking for obstacles along the path.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validate the Direct Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,3) to (0,2). Validate if a direct left move from (0,3) to (0,2) is possible by checking for obstacles in the path.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the grid at position (0,2). The grid value at (0,2) is 3 (destination), indicating it is a valid cell to move into. There are no obstacles between (0,3) and (0,2) since they are adjacent cells in the same row, and the obstacle at (3,4) is not on this path. The direct move left is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach the Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,3) to (0,2). Achieve this by executing a left move, as it has been validated as obstacle-free.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (0,3), execute a left move to (0,2). The path is now [(0,3), (0,2)]. Since (0,2) is the destination, the goal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Move from (0,3) to (0,2) avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal: Move left from (0,3) to (0,2) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal was to reach (0,2), which has been achieved as confirmed in the previous step. The path [(0,3), (0,2)] is complete and avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,3) to (0,2) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(0,3), (0,2)]**
