--- Case 21 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (3,0) to the destination (3,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (3,0) to (3,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same row (y=3), a direct path along row 3 seems promising, but we must check for obstacles. The obstacle at (2,1) is not in row 3, so a straightforward path moving right from (3,0) to (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) may work. Subgoals:
1. Move from (3,0) to (3,1).
2. Move from (3,1) to (3,2).
3. Move from (3,2) to (3,3).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (3,0) to (3,1). Achieve this by performing a "right" move, as it increases the x-coordinate from 0 to 1 while staying in row 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute a "right" move from (3,0) to (3,1). Check the grid: position (3,1) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The move is successful, and the current position is now (3,1).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the current path by checking if the move to (3,1) aligns with the subgoals and avoids obstacles. The current position (3,1) should be empty, and the next subgoal is to reach (3,2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the current position (3,1) on the grid: it is 0 (empty), so the move is valid. The obstacle at (2,1) is not in the current path. The next subgoal is to move to (3,2), which is also in row 3 and has a grid value of 0, indicating no obstacles. The path remains valid.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (3,1) to (3,2). Achieve this by performing a "right" move, as it increases the x-coordinate from 1 to 2 while staying in row 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute a "right" move from (3,1) to (3,2). Check the grid: position (3,2) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The move is successful, and the current position is now (3,2).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (3,2) to (3,3). Achieve this by performing a "right" move, as it increases the x-coordinate from 2 to 3 while staying in row 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute a "right" move from (3,2) to (3,3). Check the grid: position (3,3) has a value of 3, indicating the destination. The move is successful, and the current position is now (3,3), reaching the destination.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current status.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Move from (3,0) to (3,3).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,0) to (3,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (3,2) to (3,3) [Completed].
**Current Goal**: Reach (3,3). The current position is (3,3), so the main goal is achieved. The path taken is (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the entire path to ensure it is the shortest and avoids obstacles. The path (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) should be checked for length and validity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path consists of three moves: (3,0) to (3,1), (3,1) to (3,2), and (3,2) to (3,3). All positions are in row 3, and the grid values are 0 (empty) for (3,1) and (3,2), and 3 (destination) for (3,3). The obstacle at (2,1) is not on the path. The path length is 3 moves, which is the Manhattan distance (|3-0| = 3) since both points are in the same row. No shorter path exists, as any deviation (e.g., moving up or down) would increase the number of moves. The path is valid and optimal.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,0) to (3,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:

**(3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**
