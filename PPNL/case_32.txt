**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to plan a path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at (1,3) to the destination at (2,2). The grid contains an obstacle at (0,4) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (2,2) from (1,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is small and the objective is to find the shortest path, I will consider moving directly towards the destination while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). The subgoals will be intermediate points that guide the path: first, move to (1,2), then to (2,2). This avoids the obstacle and minimizes the number of steps.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
After reviewing the initial subgoals, I realize that moving from (1,3) to (1,2) and then to (2,2) is feasible and direct. However, I will confirm if there are any overlooked constraints or alternative paths. Since the obstacle at (0,4) is not in the way of this path, no adjustment is needed at this stage. The subgoals remain: (1,2) as the first intermediate point, followed by (2,2) as the final goal.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,2) from (1,3)  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,2)  
Current Goal: Move to (1,2) from (1,3)  
This hierarchy provides context for the next steps in implementation, ensuring focus on the immediate subgoal while keeping the overall objective in mind.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (1,3) to (1,2)  
Description: To achieve this, I will move left by one step on the grid since (1,2) is directly to the left of (1,3). This move avoids the obstacle at (0,4) and aligns with the shortest path strategy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Implementing the movement from (1,3) to (1,2):  
- Current position: (1,3)  
- Action: Move left  
- New position: (1,2)  
This step successfully reaches the first subgoal. No obstacles are encountered, and the movement is valid within the grid boundaries.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm the validity of the current position at (1,2)  
Description: I will check if the current position (1,2) matches the first subgoal and ensures the path remains feasible to reach (2,2). I will also verify that no constraints are violated, such as hitting an obstacle or moving outside the grid.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the current position:  
- Current position: (1,2)  
- Matches Subgoal 1: Yes  
- Obstacle check: No obstacle at (1,2); obstacle at (0,4) is not relevant to this position.  
- Grid boundary check: Position (1,2) is within the 6x6 grid.  
- Feasibility to next subgoal (2,2): Moving down to (2,2) is a valid action with no obstacles in the way.  
The current path is valid, and I can proceed to the next subgoal.

**Step 6:**

Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,2) from (1,3)  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,2) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,2)  
Current Goal: Move to (2,2) from (1,2)  
This updated hierarchy reflects the completion of the first subgoal and shifts focus to the final subgoal, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (1,2) to (2,2)  
Description: To achieve this, I will move down by one step on the grid since (2,2) is directly below (1,2). This move avoids the obstacle at (0,4) and completes the path to the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Implementing the movement from (1,2) to (2,2):  
- Current position: (1,2)  
- Action: Move down  
- New position: (2,2)  
This step successfully reaches the final goal. No obstacles are encountered, and the movement is valid within the grid boundaries.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm the validity of the current position at (2,2)  
Description: I will check if the current position (2,2) matches the final goal and confirm that the entire path is valid and optimal. I will also ensure no constraints are violated.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the final position:  
- Current position: (2,2)  
- Matches Final Goal: Yes  
- Obstacle check: No obstacle at (2,2); obstacle at (0,4) was avoided throughout the path.  
- Grid boundary check: Position (2,2) is within the 6x6 grid.  
- Path review: The path taken is (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), which consists of 2 moves, making it the shortest possible path given the constraints and obstacle.  
The path is valid and optimal. The task is complete.

**Step 9:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,2) from (1,3) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,2) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,2) [Completed]  
Current Goal: None (All goals completed)  
This final hierarchy confirms the completion of all goals and subgoals. The path planning task is successfully concluded.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Path:**  
The shortest path from (1,3) to (2,2) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4) is:  
(1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)
