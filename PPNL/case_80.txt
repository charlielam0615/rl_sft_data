--- Case 80 ---
**Problem Restatement**: I need to plan a path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at coordinates (2,2) to the destination at (0,1). There is an obstacle at (3,4) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (0,1) from (2,2) into smaller subgoals by considering a forward approach. I aim to move closer to the target by reducing the row and column differences step by step while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Potential subgoals include moving towards intermediate points that are closer to (0,1), such as (1,2) or (2,1), and adjusting as needed based on grid constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will work backward from the destination (0,1) to identify necessary intermediate subgoals. Starting from (0,1), possible previous positions could be (0,2) or (1,1). Continuing backward, from (1,1), I could come from (1,2) or (2,1). This helps me visualize a rough path from (2,2) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (0,1), which I will refine in later steps while ensuring I avoid the obstacle at (3,4).

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,1) from (2,2) avoiding obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1 (from Forward Subgoaling): Move closer to (0,1), e.g., to (1,2) or (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 2 (from Backward Subgoaling): Reach (0,1) via intermediate points like (1,1) or (0,2).  

Current Goal: Reach (0,1) from (2,2) by identifying intermediate subgoals.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (2,2) to an intermediate point closer to (0,1).  
How to Achieve: I will attempt to move left from (2,2) to (2,1) as it reduces the column distance to the target (0,1) and aligns with the potential path identified in backward subgoaling.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (2,2), I move left to (2,1). This move is valid as there are no obstacles at (2,1), and it brings me closer to the column of the target (0,1). The current position is now (2,1).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (2,2) to (2,1).  
How to Achieve: Check if the current position (2,1) is on a feasible path to (0,1) and does not lead to any obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (2,1) is valid. It is not an obstacle, and from (2,1), I can still move towards (0,1) by going up to (1,1) and then to (0,1). The obstacle at (3,4) is not on this path, so the current position is acceptable.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,1) from (2,2) avoiding obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move closer to (0,1), currently at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (0,1) via intermediate points like (1,1).  

Current Goal: Move from (2,1) to the next intermediate point towards (0,1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (2,1) to the next intermediate point closer to (0,1).  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (2,1) to (1,1) to reduce the row distance to the target (0,1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,1), I move up to (1,1). This move is valid as there are no obstacles at (1,1), and it brings me closer to the target row of 0. The current position is now (1,1).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 8**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (2,1) to (1,1).  
How to Achieve: Confirm that (1,1) is a feasible position and on a path to (0,1) without encountering obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (1,1) is valid. There are no obstacles at (1,1), and from here, I can directly move up to (0,1), which is the target. The obstacle at (3,4) is irrelevant to this path. The current position remains (1,1).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (1,1) to the final destination at (0,1).  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (1,1) to (0,1) to complete the path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,1), I move up to (0,1). This move is valid as there are no obstacles at (0,1), and it is the target destination. The path is now complete. The full path taken is: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).  
[/IMP]

**Step 10**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (0,1) from (2,2) avoiding obstacle at (3,4) - Achieved.  
  - Subgoal 1: Move closer to (0,1) via (2,1) - Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (0,1) via intermediate point (1,1) - Completed.  

Current Goal: Path planning completed. Final path: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Result**: The shortest path from (2,2) to (0,1) avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) is: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).
