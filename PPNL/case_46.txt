--- Case 46 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, find the shortest path from the starting point (4,5) to the destination (0,2), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,5) to (0,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (0,2), the path needs to move left from column 5 to column 2 and up from row 4 to row 0, while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). Subgoals:  
1. Move left from (4,5) to (4,2) to align with the destination column.  
2. Move up from (4,2) to (0,2), ensuring the path avoids (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move left from (4,5) to (4,2). This can be achieved by executing a sequence of "left" moves along row 4, from column 5 to column 2, checking that no obstacles are encountered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting at (4,5), move left:  
- From (4,5) to (4,4): Grid[4][4] = 0 (no obstacle).  
- From (4,4) to (4,3): Grid[4][3] = 0 (no obstacle).  
- From (4,3) to (4,2): Grid[4][2] = 0 (no obstacle).  
Path so far: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (4,5) to (4,2). Check if the path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] is valid by confirming all coordinates are within the grid, contain no obstacles, and follow allowed moves (left).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]:  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).  
- Grid values: (4,5)=2 (start), (4,4)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,2)=0 (no obstacles).  
- Moves: (4,5) to (4,4) is left, (4,4) to (4,3) is left, (4,3) to (4,2) is left. All moves are valid.  
- No obstacle at (0,4) is encountered.  
The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move up from (4,2) to (0,2). This can be achieved by executing a sequence of "up" moves along column 2, from row 4 to row 0, checking that no obstacles are encountered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting at (4,2), move up:  
- From (4,2) to (3,2): Grid[3][2] = 0 (no obstacle).  
- From (3,2) to (2,2): Grid[2][2] = 0 (no obstacle).  
- From (2,2) to (1,2): Grid[1][2] = 0 (no obstacle).  
- From (1,2) to (0,2): Grid[0][2] = 3 (destination, no obstacle).  
Path so far: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (4,2) to (0,2). Check if the path [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)] is valid by confirming all coordinates are within the grid, contain no obstacles (except destination), and follow allowed moves (up).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the path [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]:  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid.  
- Grid values: (4,2)=0, (3,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (1,2)=0, (0,2)=3 (destination). No obstacles.  
- Moves: (4,2) to (3,2) is up, (3,2) to (2,2) is up, (2,2) to (1,2) is up, (1,2) to (0,2) is up. All moves are valid.  
- No obstacle at (0,4) is encountered.  
The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Move from (4,5) to (0,2) avoiding (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move left from (4,5) to (4,2) [Completed: Path = (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move up from (4,2) to (0,2) [Completed: Path = (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)].  
**Current Goal**: Combine subgoals to form the complete path and confirm completion.  
The complete path is [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)].  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the complete path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]. Check if the path is the shortest, avoids (0,4), and follows allowed moves.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the complete path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]:  
- **Grid bounds**: All coordinates are within 0-5 for rows and columns.  
- **Grid values**: (4,5)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,2)=0, (3,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (1,2)=0, (0,2)=3. No obstacles except the destination.  
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Path does not include (0,4).  
- **Moves**: (4,5) to (4,4) is left, (4,4) to (4,3) is left, (4,3) to (4,2) is left, (4,2) to (3,2) is up, (3,2) to (2,2) is up, (2,2) to (1,2) is up, (1,2) to (0,2) is up. All moves are valid.  
- **Shortest path**: Manhattan distance from (4,5) to (0,2) is |4-0| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves. The path has 7 moves, which is optimal.  
The path is valid and shortest.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,5) to (0,2) avoiding the obstacle at (0,4) is:  
[(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]
