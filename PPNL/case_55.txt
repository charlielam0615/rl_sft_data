--- Case 55 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (5,2) to the destination at (5,5) while avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,2) to (5,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since the movement is constrained to a 6x6 grid with an obstacle at (5,3), the path must avoid this coordinate. The shortest path in a grid without obstacles would be along row 5 from column 2 to column 5, but the obstacle at (5,3) blocks direct movement. Subgoals are:  
1. Move from (5,2) to a position that avoids (5,3).  
2. Navigate around the obstacle to reach (5,5).  
Possible initial moves from (5,2) are up to (4,2), down to (6,2) (out of bounds), left to (5,1), or right to (5,3) (obstacle). Moving up to (4,2) allows progress along row 4, then back to row 5 after passing the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (5,2) to (4,2) to avoid the obstacle at (5,3).  
How to Achieve: From (5,2), execute the "up" action to move to (4,2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (5,2), move up to (4,2). This is a valid move as (4,2) is within the grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 0).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,5) from (5,2) while avoiding (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,2) to (4,2) to avoid the obstacle (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate from (4,2) to (5,5) by moving along row 4, then back to row 5 after passing column 3.  
Current Goal: Navigate from (4,2) to (5,5).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From (4,2), continue along row 4 to bypass the obstacle at (5,3). Possible moves are right to (4,3), left to (4,1), down to (5,2), or up to (3,2). Moving right to (4,3) progresses toward column 5 while staying in row 4, avoiding the obstacle. Next, move to (4,4), then down to (5,4), and finally to (5,5). Subgoals:  
1. Move from (4,2) to (4,3).  
2. Move from (4,3) to (4,4).  
3. Move from (4,4) to (5,4).  
4. Move from (5,4) to (5,5).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (4,2) to (4,3).  
How to Achieve: From (4,2), execute the "right" action to move to (4,3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,2), move right to (4,3). This is a valid move as (4,3) is within the grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 0).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm the validity of the current path from (5,2) to (4,3).  
How to Achieve: Check if the moves from (5,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) are within bounds, avoid obstacles, and progress toward (5,5).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path so far: (5,2) → (4,2) → (4,3).  
- (5,2) to (4,2): Valid (within bounds, no obstacle).  
- (4,2) to (4,3): Valid (within bounds, no obstacle).  
- Progress: The path avoids (5,3) and is moving toward column 5. The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (4,3) to (4,4).  
How to Achieve: From (4,3), execute the "right" action to move to (4,4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,3), move right to (4,4). This is a valid move as (4,4) is within the grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 0).  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (4,4) to (5,4).  
How to Achieve: From (4,4), execute the "down" action to move to (5,4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,4), move down to (5,4). This is a valid move as (5,4) is within the grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 0).  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (5,4) to (5,5).  
How to Achieve: From (5,4), execute the "right" action to move to (5,5).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (5,4), move right to (5,5). This is a valid move as (5,5) is within the grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 3, indicating the destination).  
[/IMP]

**Step 10**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,5) from (5,2) while avoiding (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,2) to (4,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate from (4,2) to (5,5).  
    - Move from (4,2) to (4,3) (completed).  
    - Move from (4,3) to (4,4) (completed).  
    - Move from (4,4) to (5,4) (completed).  
    - Move from (5,4) to (5,5) (completed).  
Current Goal: None (destination (5,5) reached).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 11**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the entire path from (5,2) to (5,5).  
How to Achieve: Check if the path (5,2) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,5) is the shortest, avoids obstacles, and stays within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Path: (5,2) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,5).  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ row, col ≤ 5).  
- No coordinate is (5,3), the obstacle.  
- Path length: 5 moves.  
- Shortest path check: The Manhattan distance from (5,2) to (5,5) is 3 (column difference), but the obstacle at (5,3) requires a detour. The path takes 5 moves (up, right, right, down, right), which is minimal as it detours one row up and back.  
The path is valid and shortest.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
The shortest path from (5,2) to (5,5) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3) is:  
[(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]
