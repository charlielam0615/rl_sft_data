**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (3,1) to the destination at (3,3) while avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid layout is provided as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where '1' represents an obstacle, '2' represents the start, and '3' represents the destination. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of moving from (3,1) to (3,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is small and the destination is nearby, I can aim to find a direct path by moving right along row 3, as there are no obstacles between (3,1) and (3,3) based on the grid layout. The subgoals will be to move step-by-step from (3,1) to (3,2), and then to (3,3).

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,3) from (3,1)  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (3,3)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,1) to (3,2)  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,1) to (3,2)  
How to Achieve: I will use the action 'right' to move one step to the right along row 3, as the grid shows no obstacles in this path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I am applying the action 'right' to move from (3,1) to (3,2). Checking the grid, the cell at (3,2) is empty (value 0), so the move is valid. The current position is now updated to (3,2).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (3,1) to (3,2)  
How to Achieve: I will confirm that the new position (3,2) is correct and aligns with the subgoals set earlier.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (3,2) is successful. The grid confirms that (3,2) is not an obstacle, and this position aligns with Subgoal 1. The path so far is: [(3,1), (3,2)].

**Step 5:**

Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,3) from (3,1)  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (3,3)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to (3,3)  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to (3,3)  
How to Achieve: I will use the action 'right' to move one step to the right along row 3, as the grid shows no obstacles in this path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I am applying the action 'right' to move from (3,2) to (3,3). Checking the grid, the cell at (3,3) is the destination (value 3), so the move is valid. The current position is now updated to (3,3).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the move from (3,2) to (3,3)  
How to Achieve: I will confirm that the new position (3,3) is the destination and completes the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (3,3) is successful. The grid confirms that (3,3) is the destination, and this completes the main goal. The complete path is: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].  
[/IMP]

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,3) from (3,1) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (3,3) [Completed]  
Current Goal: None (All goals completed)  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (3,1) to (3,3) in the 6x6 grid world, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]. All planning, implementation, and review steps have been completed.
