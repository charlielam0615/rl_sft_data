--- Case 92 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,0) to the destination at (3,0), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 2 is the start, 3 is the goal, 1 is an obstacle, and 0 represents free cells. The objective is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (3,0) from (0,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (3,0), a straightforward approach is to move along the y=0 row (i.e., (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0)), as it minimizes steps and avoids the obstacle at (3,4). Subgoals: reach (1,0), then (2,0), then (3,0).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (1,0) from (0,0). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (1,0) is directly to the right of (0,0) and the cell is free (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Move right from (0,0) to (1,0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,0) from (0,0).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,0).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,0).  
**Current Goal**: Reach (2,0).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (2,0) from (1,0). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (2,0) is directly to the right of (1,0) and the cell is free (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Move right from (1,0) to (2,0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,0) from (0,0).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,0).  
**Current Goal**: Reach (3,0).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (3,0) from (2,0). Achieve this by moving right one step, as (3,0) is directly to the right of (2,0) and the cell is the goal (value 3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Move right from (2,0) to (3,0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path taken from (0,0) to (3,0). Check if the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] is valid by ensuring all cells are free (except the goal) and the obstacle at (3,4) is avoided.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] is valid:  
- (0,0) has value 2 (start), (1,0) and (2,0) have value 0 (free), and (3,0) has value 3 (goal).  
- The obstacle at (3,4) is not on the path.  
- All moves are valid (right movements within the 6x6 grid).  
- The path has 3 steps, which is the shortest possible (Manhattan distance from (0,0) to (3,0) is 3).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,0) from (0,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,0) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None (main goal achieved).  
The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] has been validated as the shortest path.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (0,0) to (3,0) is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)].
