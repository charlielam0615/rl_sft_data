### Problem Statement
We need to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point (3,5) to the destination (3,4), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Here, (3,5) is the start (marked as 2), (3,4) is the goal (marked as 3), and (2,1) is an obstacle (marked as 1). The path must be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the goal of moving from (3,5) to (3,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step left of the starting point in the same row, a direct move left seems feasible. However, we need to ensure the path is valid and avoids obstacles. Subgoals:
1. Move from (3,5) to (3,4) directly if no obstacles block the path.
2. If the direct path is blocked, explore alternative paths (e.g., moving up or down to bypass obstacles).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,5) to (3,4). Check if the direct move left from (3,5) to (3,4) is valid by verifying that (3,4) is within bounds, not an obstacle, and reachable via allowed actions.

[IMP]
Check the grid at (3,4): The value is 3 (destination), not an obstacle. The move from (3,5) to (3,4) is a single step left, which is within the action space (up, down, left, right). The coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0-based indexing). No obstacles are present between (3,5) and (3,4). The path [(3,5), (3,4)] is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (3,5) to (3,4) avoiding obstacles.
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,5) to (3,4) directly (completed, validated as feasible).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the path [(3,5), (3,4)] as the shortest path to the destination.

The validation step confirmed that the direct move left achieves the goal. No further subgoals are needed since the destination is reached.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (3,4) from (3,5). Since validation confirmed the path is clear, execute the move left to achieve the goal.

[IMP]
Starting at (3,5), move left to (3,4). The path is [(3,5), (3,4)]. This is the shortest path, as it involves only one move, and no obstacles are present.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,5) to (3,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:

**[(3,5), (3,4)]**

The plan is complete, as the destination has been reached in the minimum number of steps.
