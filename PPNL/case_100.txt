--- Case 100 ---
### Problem Restatement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (3,4) to the destination (5,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (2,3). The world is represented as a 6x6 grid with 0-based indexing, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the goal. The allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right, and the path should be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,3) from (3,4) into intermediate subgoals by identifying a sequence of valid moves that avoid the obstacle at (2,3) and move toward the destination. The subgoals will be key coordinates that guide the path, considering the constraints of the 4-directional action space (up, down, left, right).  
- Subgoal 1: Move from (3,4) to a nearby cell, e.g., (3,3), to approach the destination’s y-coordinate.  
- Subgoal 2: Move from (3,3) to (4,3), aligning with the destination’s y-coordinate.  
- Subgoal 3: Move from (4,3) to (5,3), reaching the destination’s x-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the proposed subgoals from (3,4) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3). This involves checking if each move is within the grid boundaries, avoids the obstacle at (2,3), and is achievable using the allowed actions (up, down, left, right).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate the path:  
- **Move from (3,4) to (3,3)**: This is a left move (y: 4 → 3). The cell (3,3) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5) and is marked as 0 (empty) in the grid, so it’s valid.  
- **Move from (3,3) to (4,3)**: This is a down move (x: 3 → 4). The cell (4,3) is within the grid and marked as 0 (empty), so it’s valid.  
- **Move from (4,3) to (5,3)**: This is a down move (x: 4 → 5). The cell (5,3) is the destination, marked as 3, and is valid.  
All moves are within bounds, use allowed actions, and avoid the obstacle at (2,3). The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (5,3) from (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (3,3).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (4,3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (5,3).  
**Current Goal**: Complete the path by reaching (5,3).  
The subgoals from the planning step remain unchanged and have been validated as feasible in the implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to execute the validated path from (3,4) to (5,3) via (3,3) and (4,3). This involves listing the sequence of coordinates that form the shortest path, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The validated path is:  
- Start at (3,4).  
- Move left to (3,3).  
- Move down to (4,3).  
- Move down to (5,3).  
The shortest path in coordinate form is: **[(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]**.  
This path has 3 moves, avoids the obstacle at (2,3), and uses only the allowed actions (left, down).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of confirming the shortest path from (3,4) to (5,3), focusing on the path’s validity and completeness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- **Path Information**: The path [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] was proposed in Step 1 (Forward Subgoaling) and validated in Step 2 (Validation).  
- **Grid Constraints**: The grid is 6x6, with an obstacle at (2,3), start at (3,4), and goal at (5,3). All coordinates in the path are within bounds (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5) and avoid the obstacle.  
- **Action Constraints**: The path uses only left and down moves, which are within the allowed action space (up, down, left, right).  
- **Shortest Path Confirmation**: The path has 3 moves (Manhattan distance from (3,4) to (5,3) is |5-3| + |3-4| = 3), which is optimal given the obstacle does not block this route.  
The path is complete and correct.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,4) to (5,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,3), is:  
**[(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]**.
