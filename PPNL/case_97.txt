--- Case 97 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,4) to the destination at (3,4) while avoiding an obstacle at (2,3). The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 0 represents an empty cell, 1 is an obstacle, 2 is the start, and 3 is the destination. The action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,4) to (3,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same column (y=4) but three rows down, a straightforward approach is to move downward while avoiding the obstacle at (2,3). Subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,4) to (1,4).  
2. Move from (1,4) to (2,4).  
3. Move from (2,4) to (3,4).  
Check if the obstacle at (2,3) affects this path. Since the path stays in column y=4, and the obstacle is in column y=3, this path appears feasible.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the proposed path from (0,4) to (3,4) via (1,4) and (2,4). Check if each step is valid by ensuring the coordinates are within the grid, are not obstacles, and are reachable using allowed moves (up, down, left, right).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate each step:  
- **(0,4) to (1,4)**: Move down. Grid[1][4] = 0 (empty), within bounds (6x6), valid move.  
- **(1,4) to (2,4)**: Move down. Grid[2][4] = 0 (empty), within bounds, valid move.  
- **(2,4) to (3,4)**: Move down. Grid[3][4] = 3 (destination), within bounds, valid move.  
The obstacle at (2,3) is not on the path. The path (0,4) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) is valid and uses three moves, which appears minimal since the Manhattan distance is |3-0| = 3.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,4) from (0,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (1,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (3,4) [Pending].  
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,4) to (3,4).  
The path has been validated as obstacle-free and minimal. The next step is to execute the final move to reach the destination.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,4) to (3,4). Achieve this by applying the allowed move (down) to reach the destination, as validated in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the move: From (2,4), move down to (3,4). Grid[3][4] = 3 (destination), which is reachable and valid. The path is now complete: (0,4) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4).  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**  
The shortest path from (0,4) to (3,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,3) is:  
**(0,4) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4)**
