**Problem Statement**:  
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world, where the goal is to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (4,0), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid is represented as [[2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 2 is the start, 3 is the destination, 1 is an obstacle, and 0 represents free cells. The action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned in coordinate form using 0-based indexing.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals to Reach the Destination
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,0) to (4,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (4,0), the primary subgoal is to increase the x-coordinate from 0 to 4 while keeping the y-coordinate at 0, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). Subgoals:  
1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,0).  
2. Move right from (1,0) to (2,0).  
3. Move right from (2,0) to (3,0).  
4. Move right from (3,0) to (4,0).  
These subgoals aim for the shortest path along y=0, as the obstacle at (0,4) does not block this route.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the recent planning. The hierarchy of goals is:  
- **Main Goal**: Reach (4,0) from (0,0).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move from (0,0) to (1,0).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Move from (1,0) to (2,0).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Move from (2,0) to (3,0).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Move from (3,0) to (4,0).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (0,0) to (1,0).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Move to the First Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,0) to (1,0). This can be achieved by taking a single "right" move, as the cell at (1,0) is free (value 0 in the grid).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (0,0), execute a "right" move. This results in the new position (1,0).  
Path so far: [(0,0), (1,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate the Current Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path from (0,0) to (1,0) is valid. Check that (1,0) is a free cell and no obstacles were crossed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The cell at (1,0) has a value of 0 in the grid, indicating it is free. The move from (0,0) to (1,0) does not pass through the obstacle at (0,4). The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Move to the Second Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,0) to (2,0). This can be achieved by taking a single "right" move, as the cell at (2,0) is free.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (1,0), execute a "right" move. This results in the new position (2,0).  
Path so far: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validate the Current Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path from (1,0) to (2,0) is valid. Check that (2,0) is a free cell and no obstacles were crossed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The cell at (2,0) has a value of 0 in the grid, indicating it is free. The move from (1,0) to (2,0) does not pass through the obstacle at (0,4). The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Move to the Third Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,0) to (3,0). This can be achieved by taking a single "right" move, as the cell at (3,0) is free.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (2,0), execute a "right" move. This results in the new position (3,0).  
Path so far: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validate the Current Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path from (2,0) to (3,0) is valid. Check that (3,0) is a free cell and no obstacles were crossed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The cell at (3,0) has a value of 0 in the grid, indicating it is free. The move from (2,0) to (3,0) does not pass through the obstacle at (0,4). The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Move to the Final Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,0) to (4,0). This can be achieved by taking a single "right" move, as the cell at (4,0) is the destination and is free.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (3,0), execute a "right" move. This results in the new position (4,0), which is the destination.  
Path so far: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validate the Final Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path from (3,0) to (4,0) is valid and that the destination has been reached. Check that (4,0) is the destination and no obstacles were crossed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The cell at (4,0) has a value of 3 in the grid, indicating it is the destination. The move from (3,0) to (4,0) does not pass through the obstacle at (0,4). The path is valid, and the destination has been reached.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Review the Entire Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals is:  
- **Main Goal**: Reach (4,0) from (0,0).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move from (0,0) to (1,0) (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Move from (1,0) to (2,0) (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Move from (2,0) to (3,0) (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Move from (3,0) to (4,0) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal has been achieved. The final path is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,0) to (4,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
**[(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)]**.
