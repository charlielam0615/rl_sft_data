**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to plan a path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at (5,5) to the destination at (3,1). There is an obstacle at (5,3) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and I can only move up, down, left, or right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (3,1) from (5,5) into intermediate subgoals. Considering the grid layout and the obstacle at (5,3), I need to move left and up while avoiding the obstacle. My initial subgoals will be:  
1. Move left from (5,5) to (5,4) to start heading towards the target column.  
2. Continue left to (5,2) to avoid the obstacle at (5,3).  
3. Move up towards row 3, aiming for (4,2) and then (3,2).  
4. Finally, move left to (3,1) to reach the destination.  
These subgoals form a tentative path that avoids the obstacle and moves efficiently.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After reviewing the initial subgoals, I notice that moving to (5,2) and then up to (4,2) might not be the most direct path. I will adjust the subgoals to explore a shorter route. New subgoals:  
1. Move left from (5,5) to (5,4).  
2. Move up to (4,4) to start reducing the row index earlier.  
3. Continue up to (3,4).  
4. Move left to (3,3), then (3,2), and finally (3,1).  
This adjusted path still avoids the obstacle at (5,3) and appears more direct by reducing row distance before moving left.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Executing the action "left" from position (5,5). The new position is (5,4). This move is successful as there are no obstacles in this path, and it aligns with the first subgoal.
