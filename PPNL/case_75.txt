### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point (1,1) to the destination (0,3), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Here, 0 represents an empty cell, 1 represents the obstacle at (3,4), 2 represents the start at (1,1), and 3 represents the destination at (0,3). The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (0,3) from (1,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid allows only up, down, left, and right moves, and we need the shortest path while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), we can plan a path by moving toward the destination. Possible subgoals include:
- Move from (1,1) toward row 0 (since the destination is in row 0).
- Move toward column 3 while staying in row 0.
- Avoid the obstacle at (3,4) by ensuring the path does not pass through it.
Subgoals:
1. Reach row 0, staying close to column 1 or 2.
2. Move to (0,3) along row 0.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach row 0 from (1,1), ideally staying close to column 1 or 2 to avoid the obstacle at (3,4). This can be achieved by moving up from (1,1) to (0,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,1), move up to (0,1). This is a valid move since (0,1) is an empty cell (value 0 in the grid). The path so far is [(1,1), (0,1)].
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (0,3) from (1,1) while avoiding (3,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach row 0, staying close to column 1 or 2 (achieved: reached (0,1)).
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (0,3) along row 0 (current goal).
**Current Goal**: Move from (0,1) to (0,3) along row 0.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,1) to (0,3) along row 0. This can be achieved by moving right twice: from (0,1) to (0,2), then from (0,2) to (0,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (0,1), move right to (0,2), which is an empty cell (value 0). Then, move right from (0,2) to (0,3), which is the destination (value 3). Both moves are valid, and the obstacle at (3,4) is avoided since the path stays in row 0. The complete path is [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)] to ensure it is the shortest path from (1,1) to (0,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the path:
- **Start and End**: The path starts at (1,1) and ends at (0,3), matching the requirements.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The path [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)] does not include (3,4), so it avoids the obstacle.
- **Move Validity**: Each move is either up or right, which is within the action space (up, down, left, right). The grid confirms:
  - (1,1) to (0,1): Up move, valid (0,1 is empty).
  - (0,1) to (0,2): Right move, valid (0,2 is empty).
  - (0,2) to (0,3): Right move, valid (0,3 is the destination).
- **Shortest Path**: The path has 3 moves (1 up, 2 right). The Manhattan distance from (1,1) to (0,3) is |1-0| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the number of moves, indicating it is the shortest possible path.
The path is valid and optimal.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (0,3) from (1,1) while avoiding (3,4) (achieved).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach row 0, staying close to column 1 or 2 (achieved: reached (0,1)).
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (0,3) along row 0 (achieved: reached (0,3)).
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.
The path [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)] has been validated as the shortest path, and all goals are completed.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,1) to (0,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:
**[(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)]**.
