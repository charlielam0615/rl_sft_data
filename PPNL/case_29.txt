--- Case 29 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,5) to the destination at (5,1), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  // Row 0, obstacle at (0,4)
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 1
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 2
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 3
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],  // Row 4, start at (4,5)
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  // Row 5, goal at (5,1)
```
where 1 is an obstacle, 2 is the start, 3 is the goal, and 0 represents free cells. The task is to compute the shortest path while adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (5,1) from (4,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid with an obstacle at (0,4), consider moving toward (5,1) while avoiding (0,4). Since the grid is mostly open, subgoals can be defined as reaching intermediate coordinates that reduce the Manhattan distance to (5,1). A possible subgoal is to move left toward column 1, then adjust vertically to row 5, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). Initial subgoal: reach (4,1) by moving left from (4,5).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (4,1) from (4,5). Achieve this by moving left along row 4, checking for obstacles and ensuring moves stay within the grid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,5), move left: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Check each step:  
- (4,4): Grid[4][4] = 0 (free).  
- (4,3): Grid[4][3] = 0 (free).  
- (4,2): Grid[4][2] = 0 (free).  
- (4,1): Grid[4][1] = 0 (free).  
No obstacles encountered. Subgoal (4,1) reached. Path so far: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
From (4,1), the final goal is (5,1). Since we are in the correct column (1), adjust the subgoal to move down from row 4 to row 5 at column 1, i.e., reach (5,1).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (5,1) from (4,1). Achieve this by moving down in column 1.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,1), move down to (5,1):  
- (5,1): Grid[5][1] = 3 (goal, reachable).  
Subgoal and final goal reached. Update path: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)] to ensure it is obstacle-free, within bounds, and connects the start to the goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check path:  
- **Start and end**: Path starts at (4,5) and ends at (5,1), matching requirements.  
- **Grid bounds**: All coordinates are within 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5.  
- **Obstacles**: Obstacle at (0,4) is not in the path.  
- **Moves**: Each step is a valid move (left or down):  
  - (4,5) to (4,4): left.  
  - (4,4) to (4,3): left.  
  - (4,3) to (4,2): left.  
  - (4,2) to (4,1): left.  
  - (4,1) to (5,1): down.  
- **Grid values**: All intermediate points are 0 (free) except (5,1), which is the goal.  
Path is valid and has 5 steps, consistent with the Manhattan distance |4-5| + |5-1| = 5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (5,1) from (4,5).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,1) from (4,5) by moving left [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (5,1) from (4,1) by moving down [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: Main goal achieved, path validated. No further subgoals needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,5) to (5,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
[(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]
