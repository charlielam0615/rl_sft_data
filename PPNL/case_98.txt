**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, find the shortest path from the starting point (0,3) to the destination (5,5), avoiding an obstacle at (2,3). The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]], where 0 represents an empty cell, 1 is an obstacle, 2 is the start, and 3 is the destination. Movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right, using 0-based indexing. Return the path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (0,3) to (5,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since this is a grid world with an obstacle at (2,3), define subgoals to move closer to (5,5) while avoiding (2,3). Initial subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,3) to (0,4) to approach the destination’s y-coordinate.  
2. Move downward to increase the x-coordinate, avoiding (2,3).  
3. Reach (5,5) by navigating through valid cells.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,3) to (0,4) to align closer to the destination’s y-coordinate. Achieve this by applying the "right" action, as (0,4) is directly right of (0,3) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,3), apply the "right" action. New position: (0,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (5,5) from (0,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,3) to (0,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move downward to increase x-coordinate, avoiding (2,3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (5,5) through valid cells.  
**Current Goal**: Move downward to increase x-coordinate, avoiding (2,3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoal of moving downward while avoiding (2,3). From (0,4), moving down to (1,4) is valid (cell value 0). Further subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,4) to (1,4).  
2. Continue downward to (4,4) to avoid the obstacle at (2,3).  
3. Move right to (4,5), then down to (5,5).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,4) to (1,4) to increase the x-coordinate. Achieve this by applying the "down" action, as (1,4) is below (0,4) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,4), apply the "down" action. New position: (1,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the path from (0,3) to (1,4) is valid. Check if the moves made avoid the obstacle and stay within grid boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Path so far: (0,3) → (0,4) → (1,4).  
- (0,3) to (0,4): Valid (cell value 0 at (0,4)).  
- (0,4) to (1,4): Valid (cell value 0 at (1,4)).  
- Obstacle at (2,3) not encountered.  
- All moves within 6x6 grid. Path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (1,4) to (2,4) to continue increasing the x-coordinate. Achieve this by applying the "down" action, as (2,4) is below (1,4) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,4), apply the "down" action. New position: (2,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,4) to (3,4) to continue downward, avoiding the obstacle at (2,3). Achieve this by applying the "down" action, as (3,4) is below (2,4) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,4), apply the "down" action. New position: (3,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (3,4) to (4,4) to approach the destination’s x-coordinate. Achieve this by applying the "down" action, as (4,4) is below (3,4) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,4), apply the "down" action. New position: (4,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (4,4) toward (5,5). Retrieve information about the remaining path and obstacle to ensure correct planning.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- Obstacle at (2,3) has been avoided (current position (4,4) is past the obstacle’s row).  
- Remaining path: From (4,4), need to reach (5,5).  
- Grid info: (4,5) and (5,5) are valid cells (values 0 and 3, respectively).  
- Planned subgoals from Step 4: Move to (4,5), then to (5,5).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (4,4) to (4,5) to align with the destination’s y-coordinate. Achieve this by applying the "right" action, as (4,5) is right of (4,4) and is a valid cell (value 0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,4), apply the "right" action. New position: (4,5).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (4,5) to (5,5) to reach the destination. Achieve this by applying the "down" action, as (5,5) is below (4,5) and is the destination (value 3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,5), apply the "down" action. New position: (5,5). Destination reached.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (5,5) from (0,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,3) to (0,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move downward to (4,4), avoiding (2,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (5,5) through (4,5) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None (destination (5,5) reached).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the entire path from (0,3) to (5,5). Check if the path avoids the obstacle, stays within the grid, and reaches the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Path: (0,3) → (0,4) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (5,5).  
- All cells valid: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) have value 0; (5,5) has value 3.  
- Obstacle at (2,3) avoided.  
- Path length: 7 moves (shortest possible, as Manhattan distance is 5+2=7).  
- All moves within 6x6 grid. Path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,3) to (5,5) avoiding the obstacle at (2,3) is:  
**(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)**.
