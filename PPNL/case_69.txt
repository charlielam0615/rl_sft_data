**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,2) to the destination at (4,1), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,2) to (4,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step left of the starting point and there are no obstacles between (4,2) and (4,1), a single subgoal is to move left from (4,2) to reach (4,1).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,2) to (4,1). This can be achieved by taking a single left move, as it is a valid action in the action space (up, down, left, right) and there are no obstacles at (4,1).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (4,2), move left to (4,1). The grid at (4,1) is marked as 0 (free space), and no obstacles block this path. The path so far is: [(4,2), (4,1)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if the path from (4,2) to (4,1) is valid. Check if (4,1) is the destination, the move adheres to the action space, and no obstacles are encountered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The move from (4,2) to (4,1) is a single left step, which is a valid action. The destination (4,1) is reached, and the grid at (4,1) is 0 (free space). The obstacle at (5,3) is not on the path. The path [(4,2), (4,1)] is valid and complete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Navigate from (4,2) to (4,1) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).  
  - Subgoal: Move left from (4,2) to (4,1) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the path [(4,2), (4,1)] is the shortest and complete.  
The goal hierarchy is updated. The subgoal of moving to (4,1) was achieved, and validation confirmed the pathâ€™s correctness. No further subgoals are needed, as the destination is reached.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,2) to (4,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is: **[(4,2), (4,1)]**.
