--- Case 60 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point (2,2) to the destination (1,5), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals to Reach Destination
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,2) to (1,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider the Manhattan distance (3 units up, 3 units right) and the obstacle at (5,3). Subgoals include:
1. Move from (2,2) toward (1,2) (same row, align vertically).
2. Move from (1,2) to (1,5) (same column, align horizontally).
3. Avoid the obstacle at (5,3), which is not on the direct path but may influence backtracking if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validate Initial Path Plan
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the planned path from (2,2) to (1,5) via subgoals (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,5). Check if the path avoids the obstacle and stays within grid boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path involves moving up from (2,2) to (1,2) (1 step) and right from (1,2) to (1,5) (3 steps). Total steps: 4. The obstacle at (5,3) is not on this path, and all coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 to 5). The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,5) from (2,2).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,2) to (1,2) (align vertically).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,2) to (1,5) (align horizontally).
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,2) to (1,2).  
The subgoals reflect the plan from Step 1, validated in Step 2. No adjustments needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Subgoal 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,2) to (1,2). Achieve this by moving up one step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,2), move up to (1,2). Action: Up. New position: (1,2).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Progress and Update Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,5) from (2,2).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,2) to (1,2) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,2) to (1,5) (align horizontally).
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,2) to (1,5).  
Subgoal 1 is complete. Focus shifts to Subgoal 2.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Subgoal 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,2) to (1,5). Achieve this by moving right three steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,2), move right to (1,3), then (1,4), then (1,5). Actions: Right, Right, Right. New position: (1,5).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validate Final Path
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path from (2,2) to (1,5): (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5). Check if it is the shortest path and avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] has 4 steps (1 up, 3 right), matching the Manhattan distance of 4. The obstacle at (5,3) is avoided, and all coordinates are within the grid. The path is optimal and valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Review Final Goal Achievement
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,5) from (2,2) (completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,2) to (1,2) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,2) to (1,5) (completed).
**Current Goal**: None (main goal achieved).  
The path [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] completes the task.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (2,2) to (1,5) is [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)].
