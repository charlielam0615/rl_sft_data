--- Case 10 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (1,4) to the destination (1,0) in a 6x6 grid world. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and there is an obstacle at position (2,1) that must be avoided. The allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The grid is represented as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- (1,4) is the starting point (marked as 2).
- (1,0) is the destination (marked as 3).
- (2,1) is an obstacle (marked as 1).
- 0 represents an empty, traversable cell.
- The path must be returned as a sequence of coordinates representing the shortest route from (1,4) to (1,0), avoiding the obstacle.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (1,4) to (1,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at y=0 and the start is at y=4 in the same x=1 column, a straightforward approach is to move left (decrement y) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1). Subgoals include:
1. Move from (1,4) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate.
2. Check for the obstacle at (2,1) and adjust the path if needed to avoid it.
3. Reach (1,0) via valid moves (up, down, left, right).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to start moving from (1,4) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate. Attempt to move left (from (1,4) to (1,3)) as it decreases y, and check if the move is valid (within bounds and not an obstacle).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the grid: (1,3) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The move from (1,4) to (1,3) is valid. Update the current position to (1,3). Record the path: [(1,4), (1,3)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (1,4) to (1,0) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate (in progress).
  - Subgoal 2: Check for the obstacle at (2,1) and adjust if needed (not yet relevant).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (1,0) via valid moves.
**Current Goal**: Continue moving from the current position (1,3) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,3) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate. Attempt to move left to (1,2) and verify if the move is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the grid: (1,2) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The move from (1,3) to (1,2) is valid. Update the current position to (1,2). Update the path: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,2) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate. Attempt to move left to (1,1) and verify if the move is valid, noting the obstacle at (2,1).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the grid: (1,1) has a value of 0, indicating it is a valid, empty cell. The obstacle at (2,1) is in the same y-column but a different x-row, so it does not block this move. The move from (1,2) to (1,1) is valid. Update the current position to (1,1). Update the path: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path taken so far [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] and ensure it avoids the obstacle at (2,1) and is on track to reach (1,0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the path:
- All coordinates [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).
- None of the coordinates match the obstacle at (2,1).
- Each move is a valid left move (y decreases by 1, x remains 1).
- Current position (1,1) is one step from the destination (1,0) via a left move.
The path is valid and on track.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,1) to the destination (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate. Attempt to move left to (1,0) and verify if the move is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the grid: (1,0) has a value of 3 (destination), which is a valid cell. The move from (1,1) to (1,0) is valid. Update the current position to (1,0). Update the path: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)]. The destination has been reached.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (1,4) to (1,0) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) (completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,4) toward (1,0) by reducing the y-coordinate (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Check for the obstacle at (2,1) and adjust if needed (completed, obstacle avoided).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (1,0) via valid moves (completed).
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved. The path [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)] is complete.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final path [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)] to ensure it is the shortest path, avoids the obstacle, and meets all constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the final path:
- **Path**: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].
- **Length**: 4 moves (from y=4 to y=0).
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The path stays in x=1 row, avoiding (2,1).
- **Constraints**: All moves are left (valid action), stay within the 6x6 grid, and connect (1,4) to (1,0).
- **Shortest Path**: The Manhattan distance from (1,4) to (1,0) is |1-1| + |4-0| = 4. The path uses 4 moves, which is optimal, and no shorter path exists since the obstacle at (2,1) does not block the x=1 row.
The path is valid and optimal.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,4) to (1,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:

**[(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)]**

This path consists of 4 left moves, is obstacle-free, and satisfies all constraints.
