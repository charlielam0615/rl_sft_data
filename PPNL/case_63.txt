--- Case 63 ---
### Problem Restatement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (1,0) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

Here, 2 is the starting point (0,0), 3 is the destination (1,0), 1 is the obstacle at (5,3), and 0 represents free cells. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (0,0) to (1,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is adjacent to the starting point (one step down), the shortest path likely involves a single move. However, we need to confirm that the direct path avoids the obstacle at (5,3). The subgoals are:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) if the path is valid.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (0,0) to (1,0). Validate if the direct move from (0,0) to (1,0) is feasible by checking for obstacles and ensuring the move is within the action space (up, down, left, right).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the grid to confirm that the cell at (1,0) is not an obstacle. The grid shows (1,0) contains a 3 (destination), and the obstacle is at (5,3), which is not on the path. The move from (0,0) to (1,0) is a single "down" action, which is within the action space. The path is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (1,0) from (0,0). Execute the valid move identified in the previous step by applying the "down" action to transition from (0,0) to (1,0).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting at (0,0), perform the "down" action to move to (1,0). This completes the path from the start to the destination. The path in coordinate form is: [(0,0), (1,0)].
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion and ensure alignment with the task.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (0,0) to (1,0) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).
  - Subgoal 1: Start at (0,0).
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (1,0) via a valid action.

**Current Goal**: Reach (1,0). This goal has been achieved, as the path [(0,0), (1,0)] was executed in the previous step. The obstacle at (5,3) was not encountered, and the path is complete.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,0) to (1,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:

**[(0,0), (1,0)]**

This path involves a single "down" move and satisfies all constraints.
