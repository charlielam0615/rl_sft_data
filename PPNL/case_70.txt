### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (1,1) to the destination (3,3) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates the obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates representing the shortest valid route from (1,1) to (3,3).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (3,3) from (1,1) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid with four possible moves (up, down, left, right) while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), we can define subgoals as key points along a potential path. Since the goal is to move from (1,1) to (3,3), we need to cover a Manhattan distance of |3-1| + |3-1| = 4 steps (2 right, 2 down) if no obstacles interfere. The obstacle at (5,3) is at row 5, which is below the destination row 3, so it may not directly block the path. Subgoals can be set as moving incrementally toward (3,3), such as reaching (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), and finally (3,3), ensuring each step avoids the obstacle and stays within grid boundaries.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,1) to the first subgoal at (2,1). This can be achieved by moving right from (1,1) to (2,1), as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and does not encounter the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,1), move right to (2,1). The grid at (2,1) is 0 (empty), and the move is valid as it stays within the 6x6 grid and avoids the obstacle.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (3,3) from (1,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (2,1) from (1,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,2) from (2,1).
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,2) from (2,2).
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (3,3) from (3,2).

**Current Goal**: Reach (2,2) from (2,1).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,1) to (2,2). This can be achieved by moving down from (2,1) to (2,2), as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and does not encounter the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,1), move down to (2,2). The grid at (2,2) is 0 (empty), and the move is valid as it stays within the 6x6 grid and avoids the obstacle.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,2) to (3,2). This can be achieved by moving right from (2,2) to (3,2), as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and does not encounter the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,2), move right to (3,2). The grid at (3,2) is 0 (empty), and the move is valid as it stays within the 6x6 grid and avoids the obstacle.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,2) to (3,3). This can be achieved by moving down from (3,2) to (3,3), as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,2), move down to (3,3). The grid at (3,3) is 3 (destination), and the move is valid as it stays within the 6x6 grid and avoids the obstacle.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (1,1) to (3,3). Check if the sequence of moves—(1,1) to (2,1), (2,1) to (2,2), (2,2) to (3,2), (3,2) to (3,3)—is valid, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path is: (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3).  
- Each move is valid (right, down, right, down) and stays within the 6x6 grid.
- The path avoids the obstacle at (5,3), as none of the coordinates are (5,3).
- The path starts at (1,1) and ends at (3,3), covering 4 steps, which matches the minimum Manhattan distance (|3-1| + |3-1| = 4).
- All intermediate cells ((2,1), (2,2), (3,2)) are 0 (empty) in the grid, and (3,3) is the destination.
The path is valid and optimal.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (3,3) from (1,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (2,1) from (1,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,2) from (2,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,2) from (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (3,3) from (3,2) [Completed].

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The path (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) has been validated as the shortest path.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,1) to (3,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:  
**[(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]**
