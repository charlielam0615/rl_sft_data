--- Case 77 ---
**Problem Statement**:  
In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at position (3,4), find the shortest path from the starting point (1,5) to the destination (4,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates, avoiding the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (1,5) to (4,3) into intermediate subgoals. To achieve this, define a sequence of feasible moves (up, down, left, right) that avoid the obstacle at (3,4) and stay within the 6x6 grid. Subgoals will be intermediate coordinates that guide the path toward the destination while minimizing the total number of moves.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,5) to an intermediate position closer to (4,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
**How to Achieve**: Use a pathfinding approach (e.g., Manhattan distance heuristic) to select valid moves (up, down, left, right) that reduce the distance to (4,3). Start by exploring possible first moves from (1,5): up to (1,4), down to (1,6) (out of bounds), left to (0,5), or right (out of bounds). Choose a move that keeps the path valid and progresses toward (4,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,5), the valid moves are:  
- Up: (1,4)  
- Left: (0,5)  
- Down: (1,6) (out of bounds)  
- Right: (2,5) (out of bounds)  

Calculate Manhattan distance to (4,3) for each valid move:  
- For (1,4): |1-4| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4  
- For (0,5): |0-4| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6  

Moving to (1,4) has a lower Manhattan distance and is a valid move. Thus, the first step is to move up from (1,5) to (1,4).

### Step 3: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (4,3) from (1,5) while avoiding obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,5) to (1,4) (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 2: Continue from (1,4) to (4,3).  

**Current Goal**: Move from (1,4) to (4,3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,4) to an intermediate position closer to (4,3).  
**How to Achieve**: From (1,4), explore valid moves (up, down, left, right) that avoid the obstacle at (3,4) and reduce the Manhattan distance to (4,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,4), the valid moves are:  
- Up: (1,3)  
- Down: (1,5)  
- Left: (0,4)  
- Right: (2,4)  

Check for obstacle: (3,4) is not among the options.  
Calculate Manhattan distance to (4,3):  
- For (1,3): |1-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3  
- For (1,5): |1-4| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5  
- For (0,4): |0-4| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5  
- For (2,4): |2-4| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3  

Both (1,3) and (2,4) have the lowest Manhattan distance (3). To prioritize progress toward (4,3), choose (2,4) as it increases the x-coordinate toward 4. Move right from (1,4) to (2,4).

- Up: (2,3)  
- Down: (2,5)  
- Left: (1,4)  
- Right: (3,4) (obstacle, invalid)  

Calculate Manhattan distance to (4,3):  
- For (2,3): |2-4| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2  
- For (2,5): |2-4| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4  
- For (1,4): |1-4| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4  

Move to (2,3) has the lowest Manhattan distance and is valid. Move up from (2,4) to (2,3).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Path**: (1,5) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3)  
- **Length**: 5 moves.  
- **Obstacle Check**: None of the coordinates are (3,4).  
- **Boundary Check**: All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 to 5 for both x and y).  
- **Shortest Path**: Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (4,3) is |1-4| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5. The path uses 5 moves, matching the minimum possible moves for a grid with obstacles (verified by avoiding (3,4)).  

The path is valid and optimal.
