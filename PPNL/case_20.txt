### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (3,5) to the destination (1,1) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Here, (3,5) is the start (marked as 2), (1,1) is the destination (marked as 3), and (2,1) is an obstacle (marked as 1). The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the shortest path from (3,5) to (1,1), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid allows only up, down, left, and right movements, and we must avoid the obstacle at (2,1), we can aim to move toward the destination by reducing the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in x and y coordinates) while ensuring valid moves. A reasonable subgoal is to move left and down to approach (1,1), checking for the obstacle. Let’s set an initial subgoal to reach a point closer to (1,1), such as (3,4), by moving left from (3,5).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,5) to (3,4).
How to Achieve: From (3,5), execute a left move (x remains 3, y decreases from 5 to 4). Verify that (3,4) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,5), moving left to (3,4) is valid since (3,4) is within the 6x6 grid (0-based indexing) and the grid value at (3,4) is 0 (no obstacle). The move reduces the y-coordinate by 1, bringing us closer to the destination’s y-coordinate of 1. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4)].
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,1) from (3,5).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (3,4) from (3,5) [Completed].
Current Goal: Continue moving toward (1,1) from (3,4).
The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4)]. The next step is to plan the next move to further reduce the distance to (1,1).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (3,4), we need to move closer to (1,1). The destination requires x=1 (2 units down from x=3) and y=1 (3 units left from y=4). A possible next subgoal is to move left to (3,3), continuing to decrease the y-coordinate while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,4) to (3,3).
How to Achieve: From (3,4), execute a left move (x remains 3, y decreases from 4 to 3). Verify that (3,3) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,4), moving left to (3,3) is valid since (3,3) is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle). The move reduces the y-coordinate by 1. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the current path from (3,5) to (3,3).
How to Achieve: Check if the path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] is valid by ensuring all positions are within the grid, avoid the obstacle at (2,1), and form a connected sequence of allowed moves.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] is valid:
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).
- None of the positions (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) are at (2,1), the obstacle.
- Each step is a valid left move: (3,5) to (3,4) (y: 5→4), (3,4) to (3,3) (y: 4→3).
The path is connected and adheres to the action constraints.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (3,3), we need to reach (1,1). We can either move down to reduce x (to 2,3) or left to reduce y (to 3,2). Moving left to (3,2) keeps us clear of the obstacle at (2,1) and continues reducing the y-coordinate toward 1. Set the next subgoal as reaching (3,2).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,3) to (3,2).
How to Achieve: From (3,3), execute a left move (x remains 3, y decreases from 3 to 2). Verify that (3,2) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,3), moving left to (3,2) is valid since (3,2) is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle). The move reduces the y-coordinate by 1. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)].
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (3,2), we need to reach (1,1). Now, x=3 needs to become x=1 (2 units down), and y=2 needs to become y=1 (1 unit left). Moving left to (3,1) is risky since the next move down could hit the obstacle at (2,1). Instead, move down to (2,2) to reduce x while staying clear of the obstacle. Set the next subgoal as reaching (2,2).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (3,2) to (2,2).
How to Achieve: From (3,2), execute a down move (x decreases from 3 to 2, y remains 2). Verify that (2,2) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,2), moving down to (2,2) is valid since (2,2) is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle). The move reduces the x-coordinate by 1. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2)].
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (2,2), we need to reach (1,1). We can move left to (2,1), but (2,1) is the obstacle. Instead, move down to (1,2) to reduce x to the destination’s x-coordinate of 1, avoiding the obstacle. Set the next subgoal as reaching (1,2).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (2,2) to (1,2).
How to Achieve: From (2,2), execute a down move (x decreases from 2 to 1, y remains 2). Verify that (1,2) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,2), moving down to (1,2) is valid since (1,2) is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle). The move reduces the x-coordinate by 1. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)].
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
From (1,2), we need to reach (1,1). Only one move is needed: move left to reduce y from 2 to 1. Set the final subgoal as reaching (1,1).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Move from (1,2) to (1,1).
How to Achieve: From (1,2), execute a left move (x remains 1, y decreases from 2 to 1). Verify that (1,1) is not an obstacle and is within the grid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (1,2), moving left to (1,1) is valid since (1,1) is within the grid and has a value of 3 (destination, not an obstacle). The move reduces the y-coordinate by 1. The path is now [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)].
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the complete path from (3,5) to (1,1).
How to Achieve: Check if the path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)] is valid by ensuring all positions are within the grid, avoid the obstacle at (2,1), form a connected sequence, and confirm it is the shortest path.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)] is valid:
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).
- None of the positions are at (2,1), the obstacle.
- Each step is a valid move:
  - (3,5) to (3,4): left (y: 5→4).
  - (3,4) to (3,3): left (y: 4→3).
  - (3,3) to (3,2): left (y: 3→2).
  - (3,2) to (2,2): down (x: 3→2).
  - (2,2) to (1,2): down (x: 2→1).
  - (1,2) to (1,1): left (y: 2→1).
- The path has 6 moves. The Manhattan distance from (3,5) to (1,1) is |3-1| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6, indicating the shortest possible path since each move reduces the distance by 1 and the obstacle is avoided.
The path is connected, valid, and optimal.
[/IMP]

### Step 16
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,1) from (3,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (3,4) from (3,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,3) from (3,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,2) from (3,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,2) from (3,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 5: Reach (1,2) from (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 6: Reach (1,1) from (1,2) [Completed].
Current Goal: None (main goal achieved).
The final path is [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)].
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,5) to (1,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:
**[(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)]**.
