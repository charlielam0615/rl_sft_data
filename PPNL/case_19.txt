--- Case 19 ---
### Problem Restatement
The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (2,3) to the destination (3,4) in a 6x6 grid world, avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
where 1 indicates the obstacle, 2 is the starting point, 3 is the destination, and 0 represents free cells. The path should be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,3) to (3,4) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider the Manhattan distance (requiring 1 right and 1 down move, assuming no obstacles). Since there’s an obstacle at (2,1), plan a path that avoids it. Possible subgoals:
- Move from (2,3) to (2,4) (right).
- Move from (2,4) to (3,4) (down).
This path avoids (2,1) and seems direct. Alternatively, consider moving down first to (3,3), then right to (3,4).

### Step 2: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the proposed path from (2,3) to (2,4) to (3,4). Check if each move is within the grid, avoids the obstacle, and progresses toward (3,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Move from (2,3) to (2,4)**: Right move. Check: (2,4) is within the 6x6 grid, not an obstacle (grid[2][4] = 0), and closer to (3,4) (Manhattan distance reduces from 2 to 1).
- **Move from (2,4) to (3,4)**: Down move. Check: (3,4) is the destination (grid[3][4] = 3), within bounds, not an obstacle, and completes the path.
The path [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)] is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Move from (2,3) to (3,4) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,3) to (2,4) (right).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,4) to (3,4) (down).
**Current Goal**: Complete the path to (3,4), which has been reached via the validated path [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)].
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the path from (2,3) to (3,4). Apply the validated path [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)] as the solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The shortest path from (2,3) to (3,4), avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:
- Start at (2,3).
- Move right to (2,4).
- Move down to (3,4).
**Final Path**: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the path’s correctness by reviewing relevant information, such as grid constraints, obstacle location, and path validity.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- **Grid Constraints**: 6x6 grid, 0-based indexing, movements limited to up, down, left, right.
- **Obstacle**: Located at (2,1), which the path [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)] avoids.
- **Path Validity**: The path has 2 moves (Manhattan distance = 2), all coordinates are within bounds, and no obstacles are encountered.
The path [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)] is confirmed as the shortest and valid.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,3) to (3,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:  
**[(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)]**
