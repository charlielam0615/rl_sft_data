--- Case 42 ---
### Problem Statement
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at (0,4). Find the shortest path from the starting point (2,3) to the destination (1,3) using only four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the path should be returned in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle.

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Break Down the Problem
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (2,3) to (1,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is one step upward in the grid (from row 2 to row 1, same column), a direct move up seems feasible. However, we need to ensure the path avoids the obstacle at (0,4) and stays within the grid boundaries. Subgoals include:
1. Move from (2,3) to a position closer to (1,3).
2. Verify that the chosen move avoids the obstacle and is valid within the grid.
3. Reach the destination (1,3).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Plan the First Move
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,3) to a position closer to (1,3). Since (1,3) is directly above (2,3), attempt to move up to (1,3) directly. This move will be validated for grid boundaries and obstacle avoidance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (2,3), moving up changes the row from 2 to 1, keeping the column at 3, resulting in (1,3). Check if (1,3) is within the 6x6 grid: 0 ≤ 1 < 6 and 0 ≤ 3 < 6, which is valid. Check if (1,3) is an obstacle: the obstacle is at (0,4), so (1,3) is free. This move reaches the destination directly.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validate the Path
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (2,3) to (1,3). Ensure the move is within bounds, avoids the obstacle, and confirms that (1,3) is the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path consists of one move: (2,3) to (1,3). The move is upward, which is allowed in the action space (up, down, left, right). The destination (1,3) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ 1 < 6, 0 ≤ 3 < 6). The obstacle at (0,4) is not on this path. Since (1,3) is the target destination, the path is valid and complete.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Review the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (2,3) to (1,3) avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,3) to a position closer to (1,3) [Completed: Moved to (1,3)].
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the move avoids obstacles and is within bounds [Completed: Validated].
  - Subgoal 3: Reach the destination (1,3) [Completed: Reached in Step 2].

**Current Goal**: Confirm the path is complete and optimal. The path [(2,3), (1,3)] is one step, directly upward, and meets all constraints.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Finalize the Path
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the shortest path by recalling all relevant information about the grid, obstacles, and moves made.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- Grid: 6x6, obstacle at (0,4).
- Start: (2,3), Destination: (1,3).
- Actions: Up, down, left, right.
- Path taken: (2,3) to (1,3) via one upward move.
- Validation: Move is within bounds, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the destination.
The path [(2,3), (1,3)] is the shortest possible, as it takes one step to move from row 2 to row 1 in the same column, and no shorter path exists.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,3) to (1,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is: **[(2,3), (1,3)]**.
