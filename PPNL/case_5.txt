--- Case 5 ---
### Problem Restatement
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at position (2,1). The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (3,2) to the destination at (5,5). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four directions: up, down, left, and right. The path must avoid the obstacle and be returned in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)
I will break down the goal of reaching (5,5) from (3,2) into intermediate subgoals. The grid is 6x6, with an obstacle at (2,1). My initial plan is to move towards the destination by increasing both the row and column indices while avoiding the obstacle. Possible subgoals could be reaching intermediate points like (4,2), then (4,3), and so on, ensuring I stay clear of (2,1). I will prioritize a path that minimizes the total steps, likely moving diagonally towards (5,5) as much as possible with the given constraints of up, down, left, and right movements.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)
After considering the grid layout, I realize that moving directly towards (4,2) and beyond might not be the most efficient without a clear path. I will adjust the subgoals to first move right to (3,3), then down to (4,3), then right to (4,4), and finally down to (5,4) and (5,5). This avoids the obstacle at (2,1) and seems to offer a direct route. I will refine this if needed during implementation.

Action: Track Goals (Review Category)

[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Reach (5,5) from (3,2)
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (3,3)
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (4,3)
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (4,4)
  - Subgoal 4: Move to (5,4)
  - Subgoal 5: Move to (5,5)

Current Goal: Move to (3,3)
The hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals from the previous planning step. This structure provides context for the subsequent implementation steps.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)
Implementation Meta-Data: The current goal is to move from (3,2) to (3,3). I will achieve this by taking a single step to the right, as it directly increases the column index towards the subgoal.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting at (3,2), I execute the action "right" to move to (3,3). This step aligns with the first subgoal and keeps me on track towards the destination. No obstacles are encountered in this move, as (3,3) is a valid and empty position on the grid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)
Implementation Meta-Data: The current goal is to validate the move from (3,2) to (3,3). I will check if the new position is within the grid boundaries, free of obstacles, and consistent with the planned path.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
I confirm that the move to (3,3) is valid. The position is within the 6x6 grid (row 3, column 3). There are no obstacles at (3,3) as per the given grid information (obstacle is only at (2,1)). This move aligns with the first subgoal in the path towards (5,5).
