**Problem Statement**:  
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (3,1), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid is represented as [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 2 is the start, 3 is the destination, 1 is the obstacle, and 0 represents free cells. The agent can only move up, down, left, or right, and the path should be returned in coordinate form using 0-based indexing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (3,1) from (0,0) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, we need to move 3 units right and 1 unit down, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). A possible subgoal is to reach an intermediate point closer to (3,1), such as (2,1), which positions us one step away from the destination while avoiding the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach the intermediate subgoal at (2,1) from (0,0). This will be achieved by moving right 2 units and down 1 unit, ensuring we stay within the grid and avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To reach (2,1) from (0,0), we can take the following steps:  
- Move right: (0,0) → (1,0)  
- Move right: (1,0) → (2,0)  
- Move down: (2,0) → (2,1)  
This path is valid as it avoids the obstacle at (3,4) and stays within the 6x6 grid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path from (0,0) to (2,1). We need to check if the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)] is valid by ensuring all coordinates are within the grid, avoid the obstacle, and follow the allowed actions (up, down, left, right).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the path:  
- (0,0) to (1,0): Right move, valid (within grid, no obstacle).  
- (1,0) to (2,0): Right move, valid (within grid, no obstacle).  
- (2,0) to (2,1): Down move, valid (within grid, no obstacle).  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).  
- None of the coordinates are (3,4), the obstacle.  
The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoal at (2,1) is valid, but we need to reach the final destination (3,1). Adjust the subgoal to include the final step from (2,1) to (3,1) by moving right.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach the final destination (3,1) from (2,1). This will be achieved by moving right one unit, ensuring the move is within the grid and avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To reach (3,1) from (2,1):  
- Move right: (2,1) → (3,1)  
This move is valid as it stays within the grid and does not encounter the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,1) from (0,0).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (2,1) from (0,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,1) from (2,1) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that the destination (3,1) has been reached.  
The path taken is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path from (0,0) to (3,1). We need to check if the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)] is the shortest possible, avoids the obstacle, and adheres to the movement constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the complete path:  
- Path: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)]  
- Moves: Right, Right, Down, Right (4 moves total).  
- Check grid boundaries: All coordinates (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1) are within 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5.  
- Check obstacle: None of the coordinates are (3,4).  
- Check movement: All moves are either right or down, which are allowed.  
- Shortest path check: To move from (0,0) to (3,1) requires 3 right moves and 1 down move (Manhattan distance = 4). The path has 4 moves, so it is optimal.  
The path is valid and shortest.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the final path. Retrieve all relevant information about the path and its validation to ensure completeness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- The goal was to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,1) in a 6x6 grid, avoiding an obstacle at (3,4).  
- Subgoals: Reach (2,1) [Step 2], then (3,1) [Step 5].  
- Path: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)] with 4 moves (Right, Right, Down, Right).  
- Validation [Step 7]: Path is within grid, avoids (3,4), uses allowed moves, and is shortest (Manhattan distance = 4).  
The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)] is complete and correct.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The shortest path from (0,0) to (3,1) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
[(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)]
