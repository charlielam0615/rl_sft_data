**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,1) to the destination at (3,4), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (3,4) from (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is 6x6 and the obstacle is at (2,1), identify a sequence of intermediate positions that move closer to (3,4) while avoiding (2,1). Possible subgoals include moving right to increase the x-coordinate and down to increase the y-coordinate, ensuring the path avoids (2,1). Initial subgoals: reach (1,1), then (2,2), then (3,3), and finally (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals from Step 1 to ensure the path is feasible and avoids the obstacle at (2,1). From (0,1), moving to (1,1) is valid. From (1,1), moving to (2,2) avoids (2,1). From (2,2), adjust to (3,2) instead of (3,3) to stay closer to the shortest path, then proceed to (3,3) and (3,4). Updated subgoals: (1,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

### Step 3

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,4) from (0,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (3,3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Reach (3,4).  
**Current Goal**: Reach (1,1) from (0,1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (1,1) from (0,1). Achieve this by moving right one step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,1), move right to (1,1). This is a valid move as (1,1) is not an obstacle and is within the grid boundaries. Path so far: [(0,1), (1,1)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the move to (1,1). Check if (1,1) is a valid position and aligns with the subgoals.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The position (1,1) is within the 6x6 grid, is not an obstacle (obstacle is at (2,1)), and matches the first subgoal. The move is valid.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,1) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (2,2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (3,2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (3,3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Reach (3,4).  
**Current Goal**: Reach (2,2) from (1,1).

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (2,2) from (1,1). Achieve this by moving down to (1,2) and then right to (2,2), avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,1), move down to (1,2), then right to (2,2). Both positions are within the grid and not obstacles. Path so far: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the moves to (1,2) and (2,2). Check if these positions are valid and avoid the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Positions (1,2) and (2,2) are within the 6x6 grid and are not obstacles (obstacle at (2,1)). The moves align with the subgoal of reaching (2,2). The path is valid.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to reach (3,4) from (3,3). Achieve this by moving down one step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,3), move down to (3,4). This position is within the grid and not an obstacle. Path so far: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the final path to (3,4). Check if the path is the shortest and avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] has 6 moves. It avoids the obstacle at (2,1) and stays within the grid. The Manhattan distance from (0,1) to (3,4) is |3-0| + |4-1| = 6, indicating the path is optimal. All moves are valid (up, down, left, or right). The path is correct and complete.  
[/IMP]

**Final Path**: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]
