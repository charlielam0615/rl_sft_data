--- Case 53 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (1,2) to the destination at (2,5), avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```
Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents an obstacle at (5,3).
- 2 represents the start at (1,2).
- 3 represents the destination at (2,5).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of navigating from (1,2) to (2,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid allows only up, down, left, and right movements, and we must avoid the obstacle at (5,3), we can define subgoals based on moving closer to the destination while ensuring valid moves. The Manhattan distance from (1,2) to (2,5) is |2-1| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4, suggesting a minimum of 4 moves if unobstructed. Subgoals will involve moving right towards column 5 and down towards row 2, checking for obstacles.

Subgoals:
1. Move from (1,2) to (1,5) by moving right (increase y-coordinate).
2. Move from (1,5) to (2,5) by moving down (increase x-coordinate).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (1,2) to (1,5) by moving right. Check if the path (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) is obstacle-free and within grid bounds.

The path involves:
- (1,2) to (1,3): Grid[1][3] = 0 (empty).
- (1,3) to (1,4): Grid[1][4] = 0 (empty).
- (1,4) to (1,5): Grid[1][5] = 0 (empty).

All cells are empty and within the 6x6 grid, so the path is valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The path from (1,2) to (1,5) via right moves is obstacle-free. The coordinates are:
- (1,2) → (1,3)
- (1,3) → (1,4)
- (1,4) → (1,5)
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the move from (1,5) to (2,5) by moving down. Check if the move (1,5) → (2,5) is obstacle-free and within grid bounds.

The destination cell (2,5) has Grid[2][5] = 3 (destination, valid to enter). The move is within the 6x6 grid and does not encounter the obstacle at (5,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The move from (1,5) to (2,5) is valid, as the destination cell is empty of obstacles and within bounds.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain and list the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the current state.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Navigate from (1,2) to (2,5).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,2) to (1,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,5) to (2,5) [Completed].

Current Goal: Combine validated subgoals to form the complete path.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The path consists of:
- Subgoal 1: (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) [Validated].
- Subgoal 2: (1,5) → (2,5) [Validated].

The complete path is (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to finalize the shortest path from (1,2) to (2,5). Combine the validated subgoals into a coordinate sequence, ensuring it avoids the obstacle at (5,3).

The path from (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5) has been validated, with a length of 4 moves, matching the minimum Manhattan distance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The shortest path from (1,2) to (2,5), avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is:
**[(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]**
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (1,2) to (2,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is **[(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]**.
