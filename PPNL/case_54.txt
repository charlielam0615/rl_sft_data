**Problem Statement**: I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to navigate from the starting point at (4,0) to the destination at (2,3), while avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (2,3) from (4,0) into intermediate subgoals. Considering the grid layout and the obstacle at (5,3), I aim to move upwards and rightwards while avoiding the obstacle. Potential subgoals could be reaching intermediate points like (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), and finally (2,3). These points help me progress towards the destination in a structured way.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After reviewing the initial subgoals, I realize that a more efficient path might exist by minimizing the number of steps. I will adjust the subgoals to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and then (2,3). This path seems more direct while still avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,3) from (4,0)  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,1)  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,1)  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (2,1)  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,3)  
Current Goal: Reach (4,1) from (4,0)  
This hierarchy reflects the updated subgoals after adjustment and provides context for the next steps.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (4,1) from (4,0)  
How to Achieve: Move right from (4,0) to (4,1) as it is a direct step towards the first subgoal and there are no obstacles in the way.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (4,0), I execute the action "right" to move to (4,1). This step is successful as the grid position (4,1) is unoccupied and within the grid boundaries. Current position updated to (4,1).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move to (4,1)  
How to Achieve: Check if the current position (4,1) matches the first subgoal and ensure the path remains feasible for reaching the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (4,1) is valid as it matches the first subgoal. The path forward to (3,1) is clear with no obstacles, and the trajectory still aligns with reaching the main goal at (2,3).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (2,3) from (4,0)  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,1) [Achieved]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,1)  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (2,1)  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,3)  
Current Goal: Reach (3,1) from (4,1)  
This updated hierarchy shows the completion of the first subgoal and focuses on the next target.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (3,1) from (4,1)  
How to Achieve: Move up from (4,1) to (3,1) as it is a direct step towards the second subgoal with no obstacles in the path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (4,1), I execute the action "up" to move to (3,1). This step is successful as the grid position (3,1) is unoccupied and within the grid boundaries. Current position updated to (3,1).  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move to (3,1)  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the current position (3,1) matches the second subgoal and assess the feasibility of the remaining path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (3,1) is valid as it matches the second subgoal. The path forward to (2,1) is clear, and there are no obstacles blocking progress towards the main goal at (2,3).  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,1) [Achieved]  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (2,1)  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,3)  
Current Goal: Reach (2,1) from (3,1)  
This hierarchy reflects the completion of the second subgoal and shifts focus to the next target.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 10**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (2,1) from (3,1)  
How to Achieve: Move up from (3,1) to (2,1) as it is a direct step towards the third subgoal with no obstacles in the way.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (3,1), I execute the action "up" to move to (2,1). This step is successful as the grid position (2,1) is unoccupied and within the grid boundaries. Current position updated to (2,1).  
[/IMP]

**Step 11**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move to (2,1)  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the current position (2,1) matches the third subgoal and evaluate the remaining path to the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (2,1) is valid as it matches the third subgoal. The path forward to (2,3) is clear with no obstacles, ensuring feasibility to reach the main goal at (2,3).

  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,1) [Achieved]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,1) [Achieved]  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach (2,1) [Achieved]  
  - Subgoal 4: Reach (2,3)  
Current Goal: Reach (2,3) from (2,1)  
This hierarchy shows progress with the third subgoal achieved and focuses on the final target.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 13**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (2,3) from (2,1)  
How to Achieve: Move right from (2,1) to (2,2), and then to (2,3) as these are direct steps towards the final goal with no obstacles in the path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (2,1), I execute the action "right" to move to (2,2). This step is successful as the grid position (2,2) is unoccupied. Then, I execute another "right" move to (2,3). This step is also successful as (2,3) is unoccupied and within the grid boundaries. Current position updated to (2,3). The main goal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

**Step 14**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the move to (2,3)  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the current position (2,3) matches the main goal and verify that the path taken is complete and obstacle-free.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The move to (2,3) is valid as it matches the main goal. The path taken—(4,0) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3)—avoids the obstacle at (5,3) and adheres to the movement constraints. The shortest path has been successfully completed.
