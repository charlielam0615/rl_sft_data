**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at position (3,4), find the shortest path from the starting point (1,3) to the destination (1,0), using only the actions up, down, left, and right. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the path should be returned in coordinate form. The grid is represented as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, and the numbers 2 and 3 likely represent the start (1,3) and destination (1,0) respectively.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (1,3) to (1,0) into intermediate subgoals. The destination is in the same row (y=1), so the primary movement is along the x-axis from x=3 to x=0, while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Possible subgoals include:
- Move left from (1,3) to (1,2).
- Continue left to (1,1).
- Reach the destination at (1,0).
These subgoals assume staying in row y=1 to minimize steps, but we must validate the path to avoid the obstacle at (3,4).

### Step 2: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the proposed path from (1,3) to (1,0) via (1,2) and (1,1). Check if this path is feasible by ensuring all coordinates are within the grid, do not encounter the obstacle at (3,4), and adhere to the action constraints (up, down, left, right).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the path:
- Starting at (1,3), moving left to (1,2) is valid (grid[1][2] = 0, empty).
- Moving left from (1,2) to (1,1) is valid (grid[1][1] = 0, empty).
- Moving left from (1,1) to (1,0) is valid (grid[1][0] = 3, destination).
- The obstacle at (3,4) is not on this path.
- All moves are left, which is within the action space.
The path (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) is valid and uses 3 steps.

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Move from (1,3) to (1,0).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (1,3) to (1,2) (achieved).
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,2) to (1,1) (achieved).
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (1,1) to (1,0) (achieved).
**Current Goal**: Reach (1,0), which is the final destination.
The path (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) has been validated and aligns with the subgoals.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Backward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To ensure the shortest path, work backward from (1,0) to (1,3). From (1,0):
- Possible previous position: (1,1) (move right).
- From (1,1): Possible previous position is (1,2) (move right).
- From (1,2): Possible previous position is (1,3) (move right).
This confirms the path (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) in reverse, suggesting it is optimal since it uses the minimum steps (3) to move from x=3 to x=0 in the same row, avoiding the obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (1,0) from (1,3) using the validated path (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0). Execute the sequence of moves to confirm the solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting at (1,3):
- Move left to (1,2): Valid (grid[1][2] = 0).
- Move left to (1,1): Valid (grid[1][1] = 0).
- Move left to (1,0): Valid (grid[1][0] = 3, destination).
The path is: (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the shortest path from (1,3) to (1,0). Retrieve information from previous steps related to path validation and optimality.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- From Step 1: Forward subgoaling proposed the path (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0).
- From Step 2: Validation confirmed the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4) and uses valid moves (left).
- From Step 4: Backward subgoaling verified the path as the reverse sequence, indicating optimality.
- The path requires 3 steps, which is the minimum possible since the Manhattan distance from (1,3) to (1,0) is |3-0| = 3, and no shorter path was found.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,3) to (1,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**(1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0)**.
