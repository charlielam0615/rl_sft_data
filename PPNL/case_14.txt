--- Case 14 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (4,0) to the destination at (3,2), while avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The world is represented as a 6x6 grid where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates an obstacle, 2 indicates the starting point, and 3 indicates the destination. The path should be returned in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the overall goal of reaching (3,2) from (4,0) into intermediate subgoals by considering the grid layout and the obstacle at (2,1). The subgoals will be potential waypoints that guide the path while avoiding the obstacle. I aim to move upwards towards row 3 and adjust columns to reach column 2, ensuring the path remains short and feasible.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will work backward from the destination at (3,2) to identify necessary intermediate subgoals. Starting from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (4,2) as potential previous positions. Given the obstacle at (2,1), I must ensure the path does not pass through row 2, column 1. A potential subgoal could be reaching (3,1) or (4,2) before the final step to (3,2). I will prioritize a path that minimizes steps, likely through (4,2) since itâ€™s closer to the starting row.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After considering both forward and backward subgoaling, I will adjust the subgoals for clarity and efficiency. The initial subgoals are to move from (4,0) to (4,2), as a safe waypoint near the destination column, and then to (3,2), avoiding the obstacle at (2,1). This adjustment avoids unnecessary detours and focuses on a direct path in the grid.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,2) from (4,0) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,2) from (4,0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,2) from (4,2).  

Current Goal: Reach (4,2) from (4,0).  
This hierarchy provides context for the next steps, focusing on moving along row 4 to column 2 as the immediate priority.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (4,2) from (4,0).  
How to Achieve: I will plan a sequence of moves along row 4, moving right from column 0 to column 2. This involves two right moves: from (4,0) to (4,1), then to (4,2). This path avoids the obstacle and aligns with the subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (4,0), I execute the following moves:  
- Move right to (4,1).  
- Move right to (4,2).  

I have now reached the intermediate subgoal at (4,2). This position is directly below the destination row and in the correct column for the next move.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the path from (4,0) to (4,2).  
How to Achieve: I will check if the path taken adheres to the constraints of the grid, avoids the obstacle, and confirm that I am at the correct position for the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I review the path: (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2).  
- All moves are within the 6x6 grid boundaries.  
- No move passes through the obstacle at (2,1).  
- Current position is (4,2), which matches the subgoal.  

The path is valid, and I can proceed to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,2) from (4,0) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,2) from (4,0). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,2) from (4,2).  

Current Goal: Reach (3,2) from (4,2).  
This updated hierarchy reflects the completion of the first subgoal and shifts focus to the final move to the destination.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (3,2) from (4,2).  
How to Achieve: I will move up from row 4 to row 3 while staying in column 2. This involves a single up move from (4,2) to (3,2), which is the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (4,2), I execute the following move:  
- Move up to (3,2).  

I have now reached the destination at (3,2). The path taken is complete.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the complete path from (4,0) to (3,2).  
How to Achieve: I will review the entire path to ensure it is the shortest possible, avoids the obstacle, and adheres to the movement constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I review the complete path: (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2).  
- Total steps: 3, which appears to be the shortest path given the grid layout (Manhattan distance is 3, and no shorter path exists due to movement constraints).  
- No position in the path is (2,1), so the obstacle is avoided.  
- All moves are valid (up, down, left, right) and within grid boundaries.  
- Starting point is (4,0), and ending point is (3,2), as required.  

The path is valid and meets all criteria.  
[/IMP]

**Step 10:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (3,2) from (4,0) while avoiding obstacle at (2,1). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,2) from (4,0). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (3,2) from (4,2). (Completed)  

Current Goal: None (All goals completed).  
This final update confirms that all goals and subgoals have been achieved, and the path planning task is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (4,0) to (3,2) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is:  
(4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)
