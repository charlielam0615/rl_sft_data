--- Case 87 ---
### Problem Statement
Simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at coordinates (2,2) to the destination at (3,5), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Where:
- 2 represents the starting point (2,2),
- 3 represents the destination (3,5),
- 1 represents the obstacle (3,4),
- 0 represents free cells.

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,2) to (3,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path, consider the Manhattan distance (|3-2| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4), suggesting a path of at least 4 moves. Subgoals involve moving right (to increase y-coordinate) and down (to increase x-coordinate) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Possible subgoals:
- Move to (2,3) to progress toward y=5.
- Move to (2,4) to further approach y=5.
- Move to (3,4) is not possible due to the obstacle, so consider (3,3) or (2,5).
- Reach (3,5) from a valid adjacent cell like (2,5) or (3,3).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,2) to (2,3) as the first step toward y=5. Achieve this by applying the "right" action, as it increases the y-coordinate from 2 to 3 without hitting the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,2), move right to (2,3). This is a valid move since (2,3) is a free cell (value 0 in the grid). Current position: (2,3).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (3,5) from (2,2).
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (2,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,4).
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (2,5).
  - Subgoal 4: Move to (3,5).  
**Current Goal**: Move to (2,4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,3) to (2,4) to continue progressing toward y=5. Achieve this by applying the "right" action to increase the y-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,3), move right to (2,4). This is a valid move since (2,4) is a free cell (value 0). Current position: (2,4).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify if the path to (2,4) is valid and progresses toward (3,5). Check if (2,4) is a free cell and if the next move avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Position (2,4) has a grid value of 0, confirming it is free. Possible next moves:
- Right to (2,5): Valid (grid value 0).
- Down to (3,4): Invalid (obstacle, grid value 1).
- Up to (1,4): Valid but increases distance from x=3.
- Left to (2,3): Valid but backtracks.  
The move to (2,5) aligns with the subgoal to reach y=5. The current path [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,4) to (2,5) to reach y=5. Achieve this by applying the "right" action.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,4), move right to (2,5). This is a valid move since (2,5) is a free cell (value 0). Current position: (2,5).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,5) to (3,5) to reach the destination. Achieve this by applying the "down" action to increase the x-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,5), move down to (3,5). This is a valid move since (3,5) is the destination (value 3). Current position: (3,5). The destination is reached.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (3,5) from (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (2,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move to (2,4) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move to (2,5) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Move to (3,5) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The path taken is [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify the entire path [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)] for correctness. Check if all moves are valid, avoid the obstacle, and form the shortest path.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the path:
- (2,2) to (2,3): Right, valid (grid value 0 at (2,3)).
- (2,3) to (2,4): Right, valid (grid value 0 at (2,4)).
- (2,4) to (2,5): Right, valid (grid value 0 at (2,5)).
- (2,5) to (3,5): Down, valid (grid value 3 at (3,5)).  
The path avoids the obstacle at (3,4). Total moves: 4, matching the Manhattan distance, confirming it is the shortest path.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,2) to (3,5) avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) is:  
**[(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]**
