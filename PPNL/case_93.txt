**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (1,5) while avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid is represented with 0-based indexing, and the possible actions are up, down, left, and right. The grid layout is provided as [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where '2' marks the start, '3' marks the destination, '1' marks the obstacle, and '0' represents free cells. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the main goal of reaching (1,5) from (0,0) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is small, I can aim to find a path that moves towards the target while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). My initial subgoals will be to move eastward towards column 5 and then adjust to row 1, keeping in mind the obstacle. Tentative subgoals are: (0,0) -> (0,5) -> (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
After considering the grid layout, I realize that moving directly to (0,5) and then to (1,5) is feasible since there are no obstacles in this path. However, I will confirm if this is the shortest path by exploring alternatives later if needed. For now, the subgoals remain: (0,0) -> (0,5) -> (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (0,0) to (0,5).  
How to Achieve: I will move right along row 0 from column 0 to column 5, as there are no obstacles in this row.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (0,0), I will execute the following moves:  
- Move right to (0,1)  
- Move right to (0,2)  
- Move right to (0,3)  
- Move right to (0,4)  
- Move right to (0,5)  
I have now reached the intermediate subgoal (0,5).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the path taken from (0,0) to (0,5).  
How to Achieve: I will check if the path avoids the obstacle and confirm that I am at (0,5).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path from (0,0) to (0,5) is [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Checking the grid, there are no obstacles in row 0, and the obstacle at (3,4) is not on this path. I confirm that I am at (0,5) as intended. The path is valid so far.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (1,5) from (0,0)  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (0,5) from (0,0) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (1,5) from (0,5) [Current]  
Current Goal: Move from (0,5) to (1,5).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (0,5) to (1,5).  
How to Achieve: I will move down from row 0 to row 1 in column 5, as there are no obstacles in this transition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (0,5), I will execute the following move:  
- Move down to (1,5)  
I have now reached the final destination (1,5).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the complete path from (0,0) to (1,5).  
How to Achieve: I will verify the entire path for obstacles and confirm that I have reached the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The complete path is [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]. Checking the grid, there are no obstacles along this path (the obstacle at (3,4) is avoided). I confirm that I am at (1,5), the destination. The path is valid and appears to be the shortest, with a total of 6 moves.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Reach (1,5) from (0,0) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (0,5) from (0,0) [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (1,5) from (0,5) [Completed]  
Current Goal: None (Task completed).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (0,0) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) is: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)].  
The planning process is complete as the destination has been reached with a valid and shortest path.
