--- Case 88 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,0) to the destination at (3,3) while avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space consists of four moves: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,0) to (3,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is 6x6 and the obstacle is at (3,4), identify a sequence of moves to reach (3,3) while avoiding (3,4). Possible subgoals include moving upward to reduce the row index from 4 to 3 and moving rightward to increase the column index from 0 to 3, ensuring the path avoids the obstacle.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (4,0) to an intermediate position closer to (3,3), such as (3,0), by moving up one step. This reduces the row index from 4 to 3, aligning with the destination’s row while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,0), move up to (3,0). Check the grid: position (3,0) has a value of 0, indicating it is free of obstacles. This move is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,3) from (4,0).  
- Subgoal 1: Move from (4,0) to (3,0) (completed).  
- Subgoal 2: Move from (3,0) to (3,3).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,0) to (3,3).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,0) to (3,3) by moving right three steps along row 3 to avoid the obstacle at (3,4). This involves moving to (3,1), (3,2), and finally (3,3).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (3,0), move right to (3,1), then to (3,2), and finally to (3,3). Check the grid: positions (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) have values of 0, indicating they are free of obstacles. The obstacle at (3,4) is avoided. The path is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the entire path from (4,0) to (3,3): (4,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). Ensure all moves are within the grid, avoid the obstacle, and form the shortest path.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the path:  
- (4,0) to (3,0): Up move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (3,0) to (3,1): Right move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (3,1) to (3,2): Right move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (3,2) to (3,3): Right move, valid (grid value 0).  
The path avoids (3,4) (obstacle, grid value 1). Total moves: 4 (1 up, 3 right). This is the shortest path, as the Manhattan distance from (4,0) to (3,3) is |4-3| + |0-3| = 4, and no shorter path exists due to the grid constraints and obstacle.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (3,3) from (4,0) (completed).  
- Subgoal 1: Move from (4,0) to (3,0) (completed).  
- Subgoal 2: Move from (3,0) to (3,3) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved. The path is (4,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (4,0) to (3,3) is [(4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].
