**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (0,5) to the destination at (2,3), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

The grid is represented as:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Where:
- 2 represents the start (0,5).
- 3 represents the destination (2,3).
- 1 represents an obstacle at (0,4).
- 0 represents free cells.
The task is to compute the shortest path from (0,5) to (2,3) while avoiding (0,4), using only up, down, left, or right moves.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (2,3) from (0,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is 6x6 and the only obstacle is at (0,4), consider moving from (0,5) downward to row 1 to avoid the obstacle, then move toward column 3 and row 2. Possible subgoals:  
1. Move from (0,5) to (1,5) to avoid the obstacle.  
2. Move from (1,5) to (1,3) to align with the destination’s column.  
3. Move from (1,3) to (2,3) to reach the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,5) to (1,5). Achieve this by performing a "down" move, as it progresses toward the first subgoal while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (0,5), execute a "down" move. This changes the row from 0 to 1, keeping the column at 5, resulting in the new position (1,5). The cell (1,5) is free (0 in the grid), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (2,3) from (0,5).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,5) to (1,5) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,5) to (1,3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (1,3) to (2,3).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,5) to (1,3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (1,5) to (1,3). Achieve this by moving left from column 5 to column 3 along row 1, which requires two left moves via (1,4) to (1,3). Plan to move to (1,4) first.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (1,5), execute a "left" move. This changes the column from 5 to 4, keeping the row at 1, resulting in the new position (1,4). The cell (1,4) is free (0 in the grid), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the path from (1,5) to (1,4) is valid and aligns with reaching (1,3). Verify that (1,4) is a valid step toward (1,3) and check for obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The move from (1,5) to (1,4) is valid since (1,4) is a free cell (0 in the grid). This position is one step closer to (1,3), as it reduces the column distance from 2 to 1. No obstacles are encountered, and the path aligns with the subgoal of reaching (1,3).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (1,4) to (1,3). Achieve this by performing a "left" move to reach the target column 3.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (1,4), execute a "left" move. This changes the column from 4 to 3, keeping the row at 1, resulting in the new position (1,3). The cell (1,3) is free (0 in the grid), so the move is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (2,3) from (0,5).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (0,5) to (1,5) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,5) to (1,3) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (1,3) to (2,3).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,3) to (2,3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (1,3) to (2,3). Achieve this by performing a "down" move to reach the target row 2.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (1,3), execute a "down" move. This changes the row from 1 to 2, keeping the column at 3, resulting in the new position (2,3). The cell (2,3) is the destination (3 in the grid), so the move is valid and completes the path.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to confirm the path taken from (0,5) to (2,3). Retrieve all steps taken to ensure the path is correct and avoids the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The path taken is:  
- Step 2: (0,5) to (1,5) via "down".  
- Step 4: (1,5) to (1,4) via "left".  
- Step 6: (1,4) to (1,3) via "left".  
- Step 8: (1,3) to (2,3) via "down".  
The path is (0,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (2,3). All cells are free (0 or 3 in the grid), and the obstacle at (0,4) is avoided. The path uses 4 moves, which is optimal given the Manhattan distance (|2-0| + |3-5| = 4) and the obstacle constraint.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (0,5) to (2,3) avoiding the obstacle at (0,4) is:  
**[(0,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]**
