**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to plan a path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting position (2,2) to the destination (1,3). There is an obstacle at (5,3) that must be avoided. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

---

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (1,3) from (2,2) into intermediate subgoals. Since the grid is small and movement is restricted to four directions, I will aim to move closer to the target by reducing the Manhattan distance with each step, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3). The initial subgoals are:  
1. Move from (2,2) towards (1,3) by prioritizing a direct path.  
2. If a direct path is not possible due to obstacles or grid boundaries, adjust the path accordingly.  
3. Reach the final position (1,3).

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (1,3) from (2,2) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,2) towards (1,3) by prioritizing a direct path.  
  - Subgoal 2: Adjust the path if a direct route is blocked by obstacles or grid boundaries.  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach the final position (1,3).  

Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Move from (2,2) towards (1,3) by prioritizing a direct path.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (2,2) towards (1,3) by prioritizing a direct path.  
How to Achieve: I will calculate the Manhattan distance and try moving either up (to reduce row index) or right (to increase column index) since (1,3) is up and to the right of (2,2). I will test possible moves and select the one that gets me closer to the target.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (2,2), the target is (1,3). Possible moves are:  
- Up: (1,2)  
- Down: (3,2)  
- Left: (2,1)  
- Right: (2,3)  

Calculating Manhattan distance to (1,3):  
- From (1,2): |1-1| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 = 1  
- From (3,2): |3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3  
- From (2,1): |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3  
- From (2,3): |2-1| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1  

Both (1,2) and (2,3) have the smallest Manhattan distance of 1. Since moving up to (1,2) aligns directly with the row of the target (row 1), I will choose to move up to (1,2).  
Current path: [(2,2), (1,2)]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the current path from (2,2) to (1,2).  
How to Achieve: Check if the move to (1,2) is within grid boundaries, avoids obstacles, and still progresses towards the target (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the move to (1,2):  
- Grid boundaries: (1,2) is within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).  
- Obstacle check: (1,2) is not the obstacle location (5,3).  
- Progress towards target: (1,2) is closer to (1,3) with a Manhattan distance of 1 compared to the initial distance of 2 from (2,2).  
The current path [(2,2), (1,2)] is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Move from (1,2) towards (1,3).  
How to Achieve: Since I am already in the correct row (row 1), I will attempt to move right to increase the column index from 2 to 3, reaching the target (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (1,2), the target is (1,3). Possible moves are:  
- Up: (0,2)  
- Down: (2,2)  
- Left: (1,1)  
- Right: (1,3)  

Calculating Manhattan distance to (1,3):  
- From (0,2): |0-1| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2  
- From (2,2): |2-1| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2  
- From (1,1): |1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2  
- From (1,3): |1-1| + |3-3| = 0 + 0 = 0  

Moving right to (1,3) results in a Manhattan distance of 0, meaning I have reached the target.  
Updated path: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]  
[/IMP]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the final move from (1,2) to (1,3).  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the move to (1,3) is within grid boundaries, avoids obstacles, and achieves the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the move to (1,3):  
- Grid boundaries: (1,3) is within the 6x6 grid (rows 0-5, columns 0-5).  
- Obstacle check: (1,3) is not the obstacle location (5,3).  
- Goal achievement: (1,3) is the target destination.  
The current path [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] is valid and completes the task.

  - Subgoal 2: Adjust the path if a direct route is blocked by obstacles or grid boundaries. (Not needed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Reach the final position (1,3). (Completed)

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (2,2) to (1,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3), is: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)].  
This path consists of two moves: up from (2,2) to (1,2), then right from (1,2) to (1,3). All planning steps are completed.
