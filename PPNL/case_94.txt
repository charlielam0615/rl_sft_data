**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,1) to the destination at (1,5), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and valid moves are up, down, left, or right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1: Define the overall goal and break it into subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of navigating from (4,1) to (1,5) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), we can aim to move closer to the destination by reducing the Manhattan distance (vertical and horizontal differences). Subgoals include:  
1. Move upward to reduce the row index from 4 to 1.  
2. Move rightward to increase the column index from 1 to 5.  
3. Avoid the obstacle at (3,4) by adjusting the path when nearing row 3, column 4.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Organize and track the hierarchy of goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Navigate from (4,1) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward from row 4 to row 1.  
  - Subgoal 2: Move rightward from column 1 to column 5.  
  - Subgoal 3: Avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
**Current Goal**: Move upward from row 4 to row 1, as the starting point (4,1) is in row 4, and the destination (1,5) requires reaching row 1.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Execute the first move toward the current goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move upward from row 4 to row 1, starting at (4,1). To achieve this, take the "up" action to move from (4,1) to (3,1), reducing the row index by 1.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the current position (4,1), the valid action is to move up, resulting in the new position (3,1). This move is valid as (3,1) is within the 6x6 grid and contains no obstacle (grid value is 0).  
**New Position**: (3,1)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate the current path

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path from (4,1) to (3,1) is valid. Check that the move to (3,1) is within bounds, avoids the obstacle, and progresses toward the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The move to (3,1) is valid:  
- (3,1) is within the 6x6 grid (rows 0–5, columns 0–5).  
- The grid at (3,1) has a value of 0, indicating no obstacle.  
- The obstacle is at (3,4), and (3,1) is not adjacent to it yet.  
- The move reduces the row index from 4 to 3, aligning with the subgoal of reaching row 1.  
**Path Status**: Valid  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Continue moving upward

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to continue moving upward from row 3 to row 1, currently at (3,1). Take the "up" action to move from (3,1) to (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (3,1), move up to (2,1). This position is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
**New Position**: (2,1)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Continue moving upward

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move upward from row 2 to row 1, currently at (2,1). Take the "up" action to move from (2,1) to (1,1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,1), move up to (1,1). This position is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
**New Position**: (1,1)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Adjust subgoals for horizontal movement

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoal of moving upward to row 1 is complete, as the current position is (1,1). Adjust the focus to the next subgoal: move rightward from column 1 to column 5 to reach (1,5). The obstacle at (3,4) is not a concern since the current row is 1, away from row 3. New subgoal:  
- Move right from column 1 to column 5 along row 1.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8: Track updated goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Navigate from (4,1) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward from row 4 to row 1 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move rightward from column 1 to column 5 (active).  
  - Subgoal 3: Avoid the obstacle at (3,4) (not a concern in row 1).  
**Current Goal**: Move rightward from column 1 to column 5, starting from (1,1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Move right toward the destination

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move rightward from column 1 to column 5, currently at (1,1). Take the "right" action to move from (1,1) to (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,1), move right to (1,2). This position is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
**New Position**: (1,2)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Continue moving right

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move rightward from column 2 to column 5, currently at (1,2). Take the "right" action to move from (1,2) to (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,2), move right to (1,3). This position is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
**New Position**: (1,3)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Continue moving right

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move rightward from column 3 to column 5, currently at (1,3). Take the "right" action to move from (1,3) to (1,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,3), move right to (1,4). This position is within the grid and has a value of 0 (no obstacle).  
**New Position**: (1,4)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach the destination

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move rightward from column 4 to column 5, currently at (1,4). Take the "right" action to move from (1,4) to (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,4), move right to (1,5). This position is within the grid and has a value of 3 (destination).  
**New Position**: (1,5)  
**Path So Far**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validate the final path

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path from (4,1) to (1,5). Check that all moves are within bounds, avoid the obstacle at (3,4), and reach the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The path [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] is valid:  
- All coordinates are within the 6x6 grid (rows 0–5, columns 0–5).  
- None of the coordinates match the obstacle at (3,4).  
- The path starts at (4,1) and ends at (1,5).  
- The path has 7 moves (3 upward, 4 rightward), which is optimal for a Manhattan distance of 7 (|4-1| + |1-5|).  
**Final Path**: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Review the goal hierarchy and confirm completion

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Navigate from (4,1) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward from row 4 to row 1 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move rightward from column 1 to column 5 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Avoid the obstacle at (3,4) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from (4,1) to (1,5) avoiding the obstacle at (3,4) is:  
[(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]
