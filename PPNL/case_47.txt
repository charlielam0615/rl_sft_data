**Problem Restatement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (2,3) to the destination at (2,0), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

The grid is represented as:
- 0: empty cell
- 1: obstacle at (0,4)
- 2: destination at (2,0)
- 3: starting point at (2,3)

I will solve this path planning problem by applying one meta-cognitive action per step, following the provided structure with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the shortest path from (2,3) to (2,0), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is in the same row (y=2) and we need to move from x=3 to x=0, a straightforward approach is to move left along row 2, checking for obstacles. The obstacle at (0,4) is in row 0, so it does not block row 2. Subgoals:
1. Move from (2,3) to (2,2).
2. Move from (2,2) to (2,1).
3. Move from (2,1) to (2,0).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,3) to (2,2). Achieve this by moving left one step, as there are no obstacles in row 2 between x=3 and x=2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Move left from (2,3) to (2,2). Update the current position to (2,2).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the move from (2,3) to (2,2). Check if the new position (2,2) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and aligns with the subgoal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Position (2,2) is within the 6x6 grid (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 5).
- Grid[2][2] = 0, indicating an empty cell, not an obstacle.
- The move aligns with the subgoal of reaching (2,2).
The path so far is valid: (2,3) → (2,2).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,3).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,3) to (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,2) to (2,1) [Current].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,1) to (2,0).
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,2) to (2,1).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,2) to (2,1). Achieve this by moving left one step, as there are no obstacles in row 2 between x=2 and x=1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Move left from (2,2) to (2,1). Update the current position to (2,1).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the move from (2,2) to (2,1). Check if the new position (2,1) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and aligns with the subgoal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Position (2,1) is within the 6x6 grid.
- Grid[2][1] = 0, indicating an empty cell.
- The move aligns with the subgoal of reaching (2,1).
The path so far is valid: (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1).
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,3).
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,3) to (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,2) to (2,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,1) to (2,0) [Current].
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,1) to (2,0).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,1) to (2,0). Achieve this by moving left one step, as there are no obstacles in row 2 between x=1 and x=0, and (2,0) is the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Move left from (2,1) to (2,0). Update the current position to (2,0).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the move from (2,1) to (2,0). Check if the new position (2,0) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and is the destination.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Position (2,0) is within the 6x6 grid.
- Grid[2][0] = 2, indicating the destination.
- The move completes the main goal.
The path is valid: (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0).
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Reach (2,0) from (2,3) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,3) to (2,2) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (2,2) to (2,1) [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,1) to (2,0) [Completed].
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,3) to (2,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:
**[(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)]**

All planning steps are complete, and the path has been validated as the shortest possible, requiring three left moves with no obstacles in row 2.
