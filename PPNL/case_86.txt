### Problem Restatement
The task is to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point at (4,4) to the destination at (4,0), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents an obstacle at (3,4).
- 2 represents the starting point at (4,4).
- 3 represents the destination at (4,0).

The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and avoid the obstacle.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the shortest path from (4,4) to (4,0) in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. The destination is on the same row (row 4), so the primary movement is leftward along row 4. However, the obstacle at (3,4) blocks the direct path. Subgoals:
1. Move left from (4,4) to (4,3), checking for obstacles.
2. Navigate around the obstacle at (3,4), possibly by moving up or down to an adjacent row (e.g., row 3 or row 5).
3. Continue leftward to reach (4,0).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the feasibility of moving left from (4,4) to (4,3) and assess the impact of the obstacle at (3,4).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the grid to ensure (4,3) is not an obstacle and evaluate if the obstacle at (3,4) affects the path. Use the grid data to confirm valid moves.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The grid shows (4,4) = 2 (start) and (4,3) = 0 (empty), so moving left from (4,4) to (4,3) is valid. The obstacle at (3,4) is in row 3, not row 4, so it does not block the move to (4,3). However, moving further left to (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,4) is invalid due to the obstacle. The path must avoid row 3, column 4, possibly by staying in row 4 or moving to row 5 or row 2 temporarily.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on validation, moving left along row 4 hits the obstacle at (3,4). Adjust the subgoals to navigate around the obstacle:
1. Move left from (4,4) to (4,3).
2. Move up to row 3 (e.g., (3,3)) or down to row 5 (e.g., (5,3)) to avoid (3,4).
3. Continue leftward through a safe row (e.g., row 3 or 5) until column 0.
4. Return to row 4 at column 0 to reach (4,0).

### Step 4: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the shortest path from (4,4) to (4,0).
  - Subgoal 1: Move left from (4,4) to (4,3).
  - Subgoal 2: Move to a safe row (e.g., row 3 or row 5) to avoid the obstacle at (3,4).
  - Subgoal 3: Continue leftward to column 0.
  - Subgoal 4: Return to row 4 to reach (4,0).
**Current Goal**: Move to a safe row to avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move from (4,3) to a safe row (row 3 or row 5) to avoid the obstacle at (3,4).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the grid for valid moves from (4,3) to (3,3) (up) or (5,3) (down). Choose the move that supports the shortest path.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,3), possible moves are:
- Up to (3,3): Grid shows (3,3) = 0 (empty), so valid.
- Down to (5,3): Grid shows (5,3) = 0 (empty), so valid.
Since the destination is (4,0), moving up to row 3 (3,3) or down to row 5 (5,3) both require returning to row 4 later. Moving up to (3,3) avoids the obstacle at (3,4) directly. Let’s try (3,3) for now. Path so far: (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the path from (3,3) leftward to ensure it avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the grid for obstacles along row 3 from (3,3) to (3,0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check row 3 from column 3 to 0:
- (3,3) = 0 (empty).
- (3,2) = 0 (empty).
- (3,1) = 0 (empty).
- (3,0) = 0 (empty).
The obstacle is at (3,4), which is avoided since we’re moving from (3,3) leftward. The path (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,3) to (3,0), then return to (4,0).  
**How to Achieve**: Move left along row 3 from (3,3) to (3,0), then move down to (4,0). Verify all moves are obstacle-free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (3,3), move left:
- (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0). All cells are 0 (empty), so valid.
From (3,0), move down:
- (3,0) → (4,0). Grid shows (4,0) = 3 (destination), which is valid.
Path so far: (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) → (4,0).
Total steps: 6.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information about alternative paths (e.g., using row 5) to ensure the current path is optimal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
An alternative path was considered in Step 5, moving from (4,3) to (5,3) (row 5) to avoid (3,4). From (5,3), move left to (5,0), then up to (4,0):
- (4,4) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (5,0) → (4,0).
This path also takes 6 steps and avoids the obstacle. Both paths (via row 3 or row 5) are equivalent in length. The current path via row 3 is valid and shortest.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the complete path (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) → (4,0) is the shortest and obstacle-free.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify each step against the grid and check for shorter alternatives.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Path: (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) → (4,0).
- Grid check: All cells are 0 except (4,4) = 2 (start), (4,0) = 3 (destination), and (3,4) = 1 (obstacle, avoided).
- Length: 6 steps.
- Alternative check: Direct left along row 4 is blocked by (3,4). The path via row 5 (6 steps, per Step 8) is equally short. No path with fewer than 6 steps is possible due to the obstacle forcing a detour.
The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,4) to (4,0) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**(4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) → (4,0)**.
