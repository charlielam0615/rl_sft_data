--- Case 85 ---
**Problem Statement**:  
In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at position (3,4), find the shortest path from the starting point (4,1) to the destination (1,5). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates, avoiding the obstacle.

The grid is represented as:  
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Where:
- 0 represents an empty cell.
- 1 represents the obstacle at (3,4).
- 2 represents the starting point at (4,1).
- 3 represents the destination at (1,5).

The goal is to compute the shortest path in coordinate form, ensuring all moves are valid and the obstacle is avoided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the shortest path from (4,1) to (1,5) into intermediate subgoals. To reach (1,5), we need to move from (4,1) by reducing the x-coordinate from 4 to 1 (3 steps left) and increasing the y-coordinate from 1 to 5 (4 steps up), while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). Subgoals:
1. Move left from (4,1) to reduce the x-coordinate, staying clear of the obstacleâ€™s x=3 row.
2. Move up to increase the y-coordinate toward y=5, ensuring the path avoids (3,4).
3. Reach the destination (1,5) with valid moves (up, down, left, right) on the grid.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the recent planning:
- **Main Goal**: Find the shortest path from (4,1) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move left from (4,1) to reduce the x-coordinate, avoiding x=3 where the obstacle lies.
  - **Subgoal 2**: Move up to increase the y-coordinate toward y=5, avoiding (3,4).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reach the destination (1,5) with valid moves.
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (4,1) to reduce the x-coordinate, ensuring the path avoids the obstacle.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (4,1) to reduce the x-coordinate.  
- **How to Achieve**: From (4,1), execute a left move to (4,0), as it is a valid move within the grid boundaries and does not encounter the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute a left move from (4,1) to (4,0). The grid at (4,0) is 0 (empty), so the move is valid.  
Current position: (4,0).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the current position (4,0) and the path so far.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if (4,0) is within the grid, not an obstacle, and on a feasible path toward (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Position Check**: (4,0) is within the 6x6 grid (x=4, y=0). The grid value at (4,0) is 0 (empty), not the obstacle (3,4).  
- **Path Feasibility**: From (4,0), the x-coordinate has decreased from 4 to 4, and y remains at 0. The obstacle at (3,4) is still avoidable by continuing left or up. The path [(4,1), (4,0)] is valid so far.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From the current position (4,0), refine subgoals to reach (1,5):
1. Continue moving left to x=1 (3 more steps: x=4 to x=1).
2. Move up to y=5 (5 steps: y=0 to y=5), avoiding (3,4).
3. Ensure the path remains shortest by minimizing total moves (Manhattan distance is 7, but the obstacle may require detours).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Updated goal hierarchy:
- **Main Goal**: Find the shortest path from (4,1) to (1,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Move left from current position (4,0) to x=1 (3 steps).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Move up to y=5 (5 steps), avoiding (3,4).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reach (1,5) with minimal moves.
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (4,0) to x=1.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (4,0) to reduce the x-coordinate.  
- **How to Achieve**: Execute a left move to (3,0), as it is within bounds and not an obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move left from (4,0) to (3,0). The grid at (3,0) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (3,0).  
Path so far: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the current position (3,0) and path.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm (3,0) is valid and the path remains feasible toward (1,5), avoiding (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Position Check**: (3,0) is within the grid, and the grid value is 0 (empty).  
- **Path Feasibility**: The path [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0)] has reduced x from 4 to 3. The obstacle at (3,4) is at y=4, so moving up from (3,0) must avoid y=4. The path is still valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From (3,0), refine subgoals:
1. Move left to x=1 (2 steps: x=3 to x=1).
2. Move up to y=5 (5 steps: y=0 to y=5), avoiding (3,4).
3. Optimize to minimize total moves, considering the obstacle may force a detour around (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (3,0) to reduce x-coordinate.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move left to (2,0), as it is a valid move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move left from (3,0) to (2,0). The grid at (2,0) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (2,0).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate position (2,0) and path feasibility.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if (2,0) is valid and the path can proceed to (1,5) while avoiding (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Position Check**: (2,0) is within the grid, and the grid value is 0.  
- **Path Feasibility**: The path has reduced x to 2. From (2,0), we need x=1 (1 step left) and y=5 (5 steps up). The obstacle at (3,4) is avoidable by moving left to x=1 before moving up. The path remains valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move left from (2,0) to reach x=1.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move left to (1,0), completing the x-coordinate reduction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move left from (2,0) to (1,0). The grid at (1,0) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (1,0).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
From (1,0), refine subgoals:
1. Move up to y=5 (5 steps: y=0 to y=5), ensuring the path avoids (3,4).
2. Reach (1,5) to complete the path.
3. Verify the path is minimal (current path has 4 moves, need 5 more to reach y=5).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 14: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move up from (1,0) to increase y-coordinate.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move up to (1,1), as it is a valid move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move up from (1,0) to (1,1). The grid at (1,1) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (1,1).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate position (1,1) and path.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm (1,1) is valid and the path can reach (1,5) while avoiding (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Position Check**: (1,1) is valid (grid value is 0).  
- **Path Feasibility**: The path has x=1, and y has increased to 1. Need 4 more steps up to y=5. The obstacle at (3,4) is not in the x=1 column, so moving up is safe. Path is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move up from (1,1) to y=2.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move up to (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move up from (1,1) to (1,2). The grid at (1,2) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (1,2).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move up from (1,2) to y=3.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move up to (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move up from (1,2) to (1,3). The grid at (1,3) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (1,3).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 18: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move up from (1,3) to y=4.  
- **How to Achieve**: Move up to (1,4).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move up from (1,3) to (1,4). The grid at (1,4) is 0 (empty).  
Current position: (1,4).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 19: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Move up from (1,4) to reach (1,5).  
- **How to Achieve**: Move up to (1,5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Move up from (1,4) to (1,5). The grid at (1,5) is 3 (destination).  
Current position: (1,5).  
Path: [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 20: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the final position (1,5) and the path.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm (1,5) is the destination, the path avoids (3,4), and the number of moves is minimal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Position Check**: (1,5) is the destination (grid value is 3).  
- **Path Feasibility**: The path [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] has 9 moves. It avoids (3,4) (never enters x=3, y=4). The Manhattan distance is 7 (3 left + 4 up), but the obstacle at (3,4) was avoided by moving left first, adding 2 extra moves (total 9). No shorter path exists, as moving up earlier risks hitting the obstacle.  
- **Conclusion**: The path is valid and shortest.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,1) to (1,5) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**[(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]**.
