--- Case 79 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world with an obstacle at (3,4), find the shortest path from the starting point (3,1) to the destination (1,3) using only the actions up, down, left, and right. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the path should be returned in coordinate form, avoiding the obstacle.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of reaching (1,3) from (3,1) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), we can move from (3,1) towards (1,3) by reducing the Manhattan distance (difference in x and y coordinates). The subgoals will be to move step-by-step, prioritizing moves that decrease the distance to (1,3) while avoiding the obstacle. Possible intermediate points include moving up or left from (3,1) to approach (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,1) to an adjacent cell that reduces the Manhattan distance to (1,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). The Manhattan distance from (3,1) to (1,3) is |3-1| + |1-3| = 4. Possible moves are up to (2,1), down to (4,1), left to (3,0), or right to (3,2). Moving up to (2,1) reduces the y-coordinate difference to 2, and moving right to (3,2) reduces the x-coordinate difference to 2. Since both are valid and (3,2) keeps us further from the obstacle, we choose to move right to (3,2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,1), move right to (3,2). This move is valid as (3,2) is within the 6x6 grid and has no obstacle (grid value is 0). The new position is (3,2).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (1,3) from (3,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Continue moving towards (1,3) from current position (3,2).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,2) to (1,3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,2) to an adjacent cell that reduces the Manhattan distance to (1,3) while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). The Manhattan distance from (3,2) to (1,3) is |3-1| + |2-3| = 3. Possible moves are up to (2,2), down to (4,2), left to (3,1), or right to (3,3). Moving up to (2,2) reduces the y-coordinate difference to 1, and moving right to (3,3) keeps the x-coordinate difference at 2. Since (3,3) is closer to the obstacle, we choose to move up to (2,2) to stay safer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,2), move up to (2,2). This move is valid as (2,2) is within the grid and has no obstacle (grid value is 0). The new position is (2,2).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (1,3) from (3,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (2,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Continue moving towards (1,3) from current position (2,2).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (2,2) to (1,3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,2) to an adjacent cell that reduces the Manhattan distance to (1,3). The Manhattan distance from (2,2) to (1,3) is |2-1| + |2-3| = 2. Possible moves are up to (1,2), down to (3,2), left to (2,1), or right to (2,3). Moving up to (1,2) reduces the y-coordinate difference to 0, and moving right to (2,3) reduces the x-coordinate difference to 0. Since we need to reach x=1, we choose to move up to (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,2), move up to (1,2). This move is valid as (1,2) is within the grid and has no obstacle (grid value is 0). The new position is (1,2).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (1,2) to (1,3). The Manhattan distance from (1,2) to (1,3) is |1-1| + |2-3| = 1. Possible moves are up to (0,2), down to (2,2), left to (1,1), or right to (1,3). Moving right to (1,3) achieves the goal directly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,2), move right to (1,3). This move is valid as (1,3) is within the grid and has no obstacle (grid value is 0). The new position is (1,3), which is the destination.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path taken from (3,1) to (1,3). The path is (3,1) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,3). Check that all moves are valid, avoid the obstacle at (3,4), and reach the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validate the path:  
- (3,1) → (3,2): Right move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (3,2) → (2,2): Up move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (2,2) → (1,2): Up move, valid (grid value 0).  
- (1,2) → (1,3): Right move, valid (grid value 0).  
The path avoids (3,4) (obstacle, grid value 1), stays within the 6x6 grid, and reaches (1,3). The path length is 4 moves, which is optimal given the Manhattan distance of 4 and obstacle avoidance.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (1,3) from (3,1) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (3,1) to (3,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,2) to (2,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move from (2,2) to (1,2) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Move from (1,2) to (1,3) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,1) to (1,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (3,4), is:  
**(3,1) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,3)**
