**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (5,2) to the destination at (5,3) while avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the only allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (5,2) to (5,3) into intermediate subgoals. Since the start and destination are in the same row (y=5) and the destination is one column to the right (x=2 to x=3), a direct move from (5,2) to (5,3) seems feasible. The obstacle at (0,4) is far from the path, suggesting a straightforward subgoal: move right one step to reach (5,3).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate if moving from (5,2) to (5,3) is possible in one step. Check if the destination (5,3) is within the grid, free of obstacles, and reachable via a right move.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the path:  
- **Grid boundaries**: (5,3) is within the 6x6 grid (0 to 5 for both x and y).  
- **Obstacle check**: The obstacle is at (0,4), which is not at (5,3).  
- **Action feasibility**: Moving right from (5,2) to (5,3) is allowed since "right" is a valid action, and the grid shows (5,3) as free (value 3 indicates the destination).  
The move is valid.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Navigate from (5,2) to (5,3).  
  - Subgoal: Move right from (5,2) to (5,3) (identified in Step 1, validated in Step 2).  
**Current Goal**: Reach (5,3) by moving right from (5,2).  
All subgoals are aligned, and the plan is complete since the validated move achieves the destination.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (5,3) from (5,2). This will be achieved by executing the validated move: move right one step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the move:  
- From (5,2), move right to (5,3).  
The path is: [(5,2), (5,3)].  
This is the shortest path since it takes exactly one move to reach the destination, and no obstacles or grid boundaries are violated.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (5,2) to (5,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is: **[(5,2), (5,3)]**.
