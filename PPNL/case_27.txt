**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (4,5) to the destination at (1,3), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (4,5) to (1,3) into intermediate subgoals. To find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), consider Manhattan distance as a heuristic. The direct distance is |4-1| + |5-3| = 5 steps, but the obstacle may require detours. Subgoals include:
1. Move left from (4,5) to reduce the y-coordinate toward 3.
2. Move up from (4,y) to reduce the x-coordinate toward 1, ensuring to avoid (0,4).
3. Adjust the path if the obstacle blocks a direct route.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the recent planning. The hierarchy of goals is:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,3) from (4,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - Subgoal 1: Move left to reduce y-coordinate from 5 to 3.
  - Subgoal 2: Move up to reduce x-coordinate from 4 to 1, avoiding (0,4).
  - Subgoal 3: Adjust path if needed to bypass the obstacle.  
**Current Goal**: Move left to reduce y-coordinate from 5 to 3.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move left from (4,5) to reduce the y-coordinate toward 3. This can be achieved by taking left movements until y=3, checking that each step is within the grid and not an obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at (4,5), move left:
- From (4,5) to (4,4): Valid move (no obstacle, within grid).
- From (4,4) to (4,3): Valid move (no obstacle, within grid).  
The y-coordinate is now 3. Path so far: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path taken so far [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)]. Check if the path is valid, within the grid, avoids the obstacle at (0,4), and progresses toward (1,3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path:
- All coordinates [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)] are within the 6x6 grid (x: 0-5, y: 0-5).
- None of the coordinates are (0,4), the obstacle.
- The path reduces the y-coordinate from 5 to 3, matching the subgoal.
- The current position (4,3) is 3 steps away from (1,3) in x-coordinate (|4-1|=3).  
The path is valid and progresses toward the goal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The y-coordinate is now 3, so the subgoal to reduce y is complete. Adjust the subgoals to focus on reducing the x-coordinate from 4 to 1. New subgoal: Move up from (4,3) to (1,3), ensuring the path avoids (0,4). Since (0,4) has a different y-coordinate (4), moving up along y=3 should be safe.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Updated goal hierarchy based on recent planning:
- Main Goal: Reach (1,3) from (4,5) while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).
  - Subgoal 1 (Completed): Move left to reduce y-coordinate from 5 to 3.
  - Subgoal 2 (Adjusted): Move up to reduce x-coordinate from 4 to 1, avoiding (0,4).  
**Current Goal**: Move up to reduce x-coordinate from 4 to 1.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move up from (4,3) to reduce the x-coordinate to 1, reaching (1,3). This can be achieved by moving up three times, checking each step for validity and obstacles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (4,3), move up:
- From (4,3) to (3,3): Valid (no obstacle, within grid).
- From (3,3) to (2,3): Valid (no obstacle, within grid).
- From (2,3) to (1,3): Valid (no obstacle, within grid).  
The destination (1,3) is reached. Full path: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the complete path [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]. Check if it is the shortest path, avoids the obstacle, and stays within the grid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path:
- Path length: 5 steps (Manhattan distance = 5, so shortest possible).
- Coordinates: All within 6x6 grid (x: 0-5, y: 0-5).
- Obstacle: None of the coordinates are (0,4).
- Start and end: Path starts at (4,5) and ends at (1,3).
- Moves: All transitions are valid (left or up).  
The path is valid and optimal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the pathâ€™s correctness by recalling relevant information about the grid, obstacle, and constraints to ensure no details were missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Recalling relevant information:
- Grid: 6x6, 0-based indexing.
- Obstacle: (0,4).
- Constraints: Moves limited to up, down, left, right.
- Path: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].
- Previous validations confirmed the path avoids (0,4), stays within bounds, and uses only allowed moves.
No discrepancies found. The path satisfies all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (4,5) to (1,3) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
[(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]
