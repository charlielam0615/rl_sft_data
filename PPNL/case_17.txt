--- Case 17 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at (5,1) to the destination at (0,1), while avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The world is represented as a 6x6 grid with the following values: [[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], where the obstacle is at (2,1), the start is at (5,1), and the destination is at (0,1). The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the main goal of reaching (0,1) from (5,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since there is an obstacle at (2,1), a direct vertical path upwards is blocked. I need to find a way around it. My forward subgoals will be:  
1. Move from (5,1) to a position that allows bypassing the obstacle, such as moving left or right first.  
2. Navigate around the obstacle to reach a point above (2,1), such as (1,0) or (1,2).  
3. Move from that point to the destination at (0,1).  
These subgoals will guide the path planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To refine the path, I will work backward from the destination (0,1) to identify necessary intermediate positions while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1). Starting from (0,1):  
1. The previous position could be (1,1), (0,0), or (0,2), as these are adjacent to (0,1).  
2. Since (2,1) is an obstacle, moving directly down from (1,1) to (2,1) is not possible. Thus, from (1,1), I must come from (1,0) or (1,2).  
3. Continue backward to connect to the start at (5,1), likely through positions like (5,0) or (5,2) to avoid the obstacle.  
This backward approach helps confirm that I need to move around the obstacle via adjacent columns (x=0 or x=2).  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After considering both forward and backward subgoaling, I will adjust the subgoals for clarity and efficiency. The obstacle at (2,1) forces a detour. I will prioritize moving left or right early on to avoid the obstacle. Updated subgoals are:  
1. Move from (5,1) to (5,0) or (5,2) to start the detour.  
2. Proceed upwards along the chosen column (x=0 or x=2) to reach row y=1 or y=0.  
3. Finally, move to the destination (0,1) by adjusting the x-coordinate if needed.  
This plan focuses on efficiency by testing the shortest detour.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (5,1) to (5,0) as the first step of the detour to avoid the obstacle at (2,1).  
How to Achieve: I will move left from (5,1) to (5,0), as this is a valid move within the grid boundaries and avoids immediate conflict with the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (5,1), I execute the action "left" to reach (5,0). This position is within the grid (row 5, column 0) and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (5,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (5,0) to (4,0) as part of the upward movement along column x=0 to bypass the obstacle.  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (5,0) to (4,0), as this is a valid move within the grid and continues the detour path.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (5,0), I execute the action "up" to reach (4,0). This position is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (4,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (4,0) to (3,0) to continue progressing upwards along column x=0.  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (4,0) to (3,0), as this is a valid and direct move within the grid.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (4,0), I execute the action "up" to reach (3,0). This position is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (3,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (3,0) to (2,0) to continue upwards along column x=0.  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (3,0) to (2,0), staying in the same column to avoid the obstacle at (2,1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (3,0), I execute the action "up" to reach (2,0). This position is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (2,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (2,0) to (1,0) to continue upwards toward the destination row.  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (2,0) to (1,0), as this is a valid move and keeps me on track to reach near the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,0), I execute the action "up" to reach (1,0). This position is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (1,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (1,0) to (0,0) to reach the top row, close to the destination.  
How to Achieve: I will move up from (1,0) to (0,0), as this is a valid move and positions me one step away from (0,1).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (1,0), I execute the action "up" to reach (0,0). This position is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,0). The path so far is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 10:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move from (0,0) to (0,1) to reach the final destination.  
How to Achieve: I will move right from (0,0) to (0,1), as this is a valid move and completes the path to the target.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,0), I execute the action "right" to reach (0,1). This position is within the grid boundaries, is not an obstacle, and is the destination. The move is successful, and the current position is updated to (0,1). The complete path is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)].  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 11:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the path from (5,1) to (0,1) is valid and shortest.  
How to Achieve: I will check each step of the path to ensure no obstacles are encountered and confirm the path length against possible alternatives.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reviewing the path [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]:  
- Each step is a valid move (up, down, left, or right) within the 6x6 grid.  
- The obstacle at (2,1) is avoided, as the path stays in column x=0 after the initial move.  
- Path length is 7 steps. An alternative path via column x=2 (e.g., (5,1) to (5,2) to (0,2) to (0,1)) would also take 7 steps, confirming this is one of the shortest paths.  
The path is valid and meets the criteria for being the shortest.  
[/IMP]

**Step 12:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach the destination at (0,1) from (5,1) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,1).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (5,1) to (5,0) to start the detour (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Proceed upwards along column x=0 to reach row y=0 (Completed via steps to (0,0)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move to the destination (0,1) by adjusting the x-coordinate (Completed).  
Current Goal: Since all subgoals and the main goal are achieved, the task is complete. The final path is [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Result:**  
The shortest path from (5,1) to (0,1) avoiding the obstacle at (2,1) is: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)].
