**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a path planning case in a 6x6 grid world. The task is to find the shortest path from the starting point at coordinates (1,0) to the destination at (4,5), while avoiding an obstacle at (5,3). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid layout is provided as [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], where '2' marks the start, '3' marks the destination, '1' marks the obstacle, and '0' represents free cells. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the goal of reaching (4,5) from (1,0) into intermediate subgoals. Given the grid layout and the obstacle at (5,3), I will aim to move towards the destination by identifying key waypoints that avoid the obstacle. My subgoals will be to first move towards a safe intermediate point closer to the destination, such as (1,4), which aligns horizontally with the starting row and moves closer to the target column, and then adjust vertically towards (4,5).  
Subgoals:  
- Reach (1,4) from (1,0) by moving right.  
- Reach (4,5) from (1,4) by moving down and right, avoiding the obstacle at (5,3).

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,0) avoiding obstacle at (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,4) from (1,0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
Current Goal: Reach (1,4) from (1,0).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (1,4) from (1,0).  
How to Achieve: I will move right along row 1 from column 0 to column 4, as there are no obstacles in this path based on the grid layout.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (1,0), I will execute the following moves:  
- Move right to (1,1).  
- Move right to (1,2).  
- Move right to (1,3).  
- Move right to (1,4).  
I have now reached the intermediate subgoal at (1,4). Path so far: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,0) avoiding obstacle at (5,3).  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,4) from (1,0). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
Current Goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,4).  
How to Achieve: I will move down from row 1 to row 4, then adjust right to column 5, ensuring I avoid the obstacle at (5,3). I will first move down to (4,4), then right to (4,5), as this path avoids the obstacle.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting at (1,4), I will execute the following moves:  
- Move down to (2,4).  
- Move down to (3,4).  
- Move down to (4,4).  
- Move right to (4,5).  
I have now reached the destination at (4,5). Path so far: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)].  
[/IMP]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the path from (1,0) to (4,5).  
How to Achieve: I will check if the path [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] avoids the obstacle at (5,3) and adheres to the movement constraints (up, down, left, right).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Validating the path:  
- Path: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)].  
- Obstacle Check: The obstacle is at (5,3). None of the coordinates in the path match (5,3).  
- Movement Check: Each step differs by exactly one unit in either row or column, adhering to the allowed actions (up, down, left, right).  
- Start and End Check: Path starts at (1,0) and ends at (4,5), matching the requirements.  
- Shortest Path Check: The path has 8 moves (9 coordinates). Given the grid size and obstacle position, moving right to column 4 and then down to row 4 before a final right move is efficient, totaling a Manhattan distance of 8 (3 right, 3 down, 1 right, 1 down effectively). No shorter path is apparent due to grid constraints.  
The path is valid and appears to be the shortest possible.

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Reach (4,5) from (1,0) avoiding obstacle at (5,3). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (1,4) from (1,0). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (4,5) from (1,4). [Completed]  
Current Goal: None (All goals completed).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Solution:**  
The shortest path from (1,0) to (4,5) avoiding the obstacle at (5,3) in the 6x6 grid world is:  
[(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)].  
All planning steps are complete, and the path has been validated as correct and efficient.
