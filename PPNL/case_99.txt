### Problem Statement
We need to find the shortest path from the starting point (1,5) to the destination (4,4) in a 6x6 grid world. The grid uses 0-based indexing, and there is an obstacle at (2,3) that must be avoided. The allowed actions are moving up, down, left, or right. The grid is represented as follows, where 0 indicates an empty cell, 1 indicates the obstacle, 2 indicates the start, and 3 indicates the destination:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The path should be returned as a sequence of coordinates representing the shortest route from (1,5) to (4,4), avoiding the obstacle at (2,3).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reaching (4,4) from (1,5) into intermediate subgoals. Since we need the shortest path in a grid with up, down, left, and right movements, we can define subgoals as key positions that move us closer to (4,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,3). From (1,5), we can move to adjacent cells (1,4), (2,5), or (0,5). The obstacle at (2,3) suggests we should avoid moving toward row 2, column 3. A reasonable subgoal is to move downward toward row 4 and leftward toward column 4. Let’s set an initial subgoal to reach (4,5), which is close to the destination and avoids the obstacle.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach the subgoal at (4,5) from (1,5). To achieve this, we will apply a pathfinding approach, considering the allowed moves (up, down, left, right) and avoiding the obstacle at (2,3). We can move directly down from (1,5) to (2,5), (3,5), and then to (4,5), as this path is clear of obstacles.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting at (1,5), we can move:
- Down to (2,5).
- Down to (3,5).
- Down to (4,5).  
This path avoids the obstacle at (2,3). The sequence of coordinates to reach (4,5) is: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain and list the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the current state.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (4,4) from (1,5).
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,5) from (1,5) [Achieved in Step 2].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (4,4) from (4,5) [Next step].  
**Current Goal**: Reach (4,4) from (4,5).  
The path so far is [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]. The next step is to move from (4,5) to (4,4).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reach (4,4) from (4,5). To achieve this, we will move left from (4,5) to (4,4), as it is an adjacent cell and there are no obstacles in the way (the cell at (4,4) is marked as 3, the destination, which is accessible).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From (4,5), move left to (4,4). The path segment is [(4,5), (4,4)]. Combining with the previous path, the full path is [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)].
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)] to ensure it is the shortest path from (1,5) to (4,4) while avoiding the obstacle at (2,3). We will check if the path is valid (all moves are allowed, avoids obstacles, and reaches the destination) and if it is the shortest possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Validation Check**:
- **Path Validity**:
  - Moves: (1,5) → (2,5) (down), (2,5) → (3,5) (down), (3,5) → (4,5) (down), (4,5) → (4,4) (left). All are valid actions (up, down, left, right).
  - Obstacle Avoidance: The path does not include (2,3), the obstacle.
  - Start and End: Starts at (1,5) and ends at (4,4), matching the requirements.
- **Shortest Path**:
  - The path has 4 moves (3 down, 1 left).
  - To confirm it’s the shortest, consider the Manhattan distance from (1,5) to (4,4): |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4 moves. The path takes exactly 4 moves, suggesting it is optimal.
  - Alternative paths, e.g., moving left to (1,4) then down, would pass near (2,3) but still require at least 4 moves (e.g., (1,5) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4)). No shorter path exists, as the obstacle at (2,3) doesn’t block the direct downward-then-left route significantly.
The path [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)] is valid and appears to be the shortest.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain and list the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Reach (4,4) from (1,5) [Achieved].
  - Subgoal 1: Reach (4,5) from (1,5) [Achieved in Step 2].
  - Subgoal 2: Reach (4,4) from (4,5) [Achieved in Step 4].  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The complete path is [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)], validated as the shortest path avoiding the obstacle at (2,3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (1,5) to (4,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,3), is:  
**[(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]**.
