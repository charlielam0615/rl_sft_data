--- Case 74 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at coordinates (2,0) to the destination at (0,1), avoiding an obstacle at (3,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and the action space is limited to four moves: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,0) to (0,1) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (0,1), the path requires moving 2 steps up (from y=2 to y=0) and 1 step right (from x=0 to x=1), while avoiding the obstacle at (3,4). A possible subgoal is to first move upward to reach row y=0, then adjust horizontally to column x=1, checking for obstacles along the way.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move upward from (2,0) toward row y=0, aiming for an intermediate position like (0,0) before moving right to (0,1). Use valid moves (up, down, left, right) and check that the path avoids the obstacle at (3,4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (2,0), move up to (1,0): The move is valid since (1,0) is within the grid and not an obstacle. Next, move up again to (0,0): This is also valid, as (0,0) is free. This reaches row y=0, aligning with the subgoal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Move from (2,0) to (0,1), avoiding obstacle at (3,4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move upward to reach row y=0 (completed, reached (0,0)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move right to reach column x=1 to arrive at (0,1).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (0,0) to (0,1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (0,0) to (0,1). This requires a single right move, which should be checked for validity and obstacle avoidance.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From (0,0), move right to (0,1): The move is valid since (0,1) is within the grid and not an obstacle. This reaches the destination.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the path from (2,0) to (0,1). Check that the sequence of moves—(2,0) to (1,0), (1,0) to (0,0), (0,0) to (0,1)—is the shortest, avoids the obstacle, and adheres to the action space.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The path is: (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0) → (0,1).  
- **Length**: 3 moves (2 up, 1 right). The Manhattan distance from (2,0) to (0,1) is |2-0| + |0-1| = 3, so this is optimal.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The path does not pass through (3,4).  
- **Action Space**: All moves are either up or right, which are allowed.  
The path is valid and shortest.  
[/IMP]

### Final Path
The shortest path from (2,0) to (0,1) is: **[(2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]**.
