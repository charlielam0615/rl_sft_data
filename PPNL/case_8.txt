### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path in a 6x6 grid world from the starting point (2,0) to the destination (1,2), avoiding an obstacle at (2,1). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The grid is represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Here, 0 represents an empty cell, 1 represents an obstacle, 2 represents the start, and 3 represents the destination. The goal is to return the shortest path in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of moving from (2,0) to (1,2) into intermediate subgoals. From (2,0), possible moves are up to (1,0), down to (3,0), or right to (2,1). However, (2,1) is an obstacle, so valid moves are up or down. To approach (1,2), moving up to (1,0) reduces the row distance to the target row (1). From (1,0), the next step would be to move right toward column 2. Subgoals:  
1. Move from (2,0) to (1,0).  
2. Move from (1,0) to (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (2,0) to (1,0). This can be achieved by taking the "up" action, as it moves from row 2 to row 1 while staying in column 0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (2,0), execute the "up" action. This moves the position to (1,0). The path so far is: [(2,0), (1,0)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Move from (2,0) to (1,2).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,0) to (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,0) to (1,2) [Current].  
**Current Goal**: Move from (1,0) to (1,2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to move from (1,0) to (1,2). This can be achieved by moving right twice: from (1,0) to (1,1), then from (1,1) to (1,2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From (1,0), execute the "right" action to move to (1,1), then execute the "right" action again to move to (1,2). The path is updated to: [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify if the path [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)] is valid. Check that each move is within the grid, avoids obstacles, and reaches the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the path:  
- (2,0) to (1,0): Up move, valid (within grid, no obstacle at (1,0)).  
- (1,0) to (1,1): Right move, valid (within grid, no obstacle at (1,1)).  
- (1,1) to (1,2): Right move, valid (reaches destination at (1,2)).  
The path avoids the obstacle at (2,1) and stays within the 6x6 grid. The path is valid and reaches the destination.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Move from (2,0) to (1,2) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move from (2,0) to (1,0) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (1,0) to (1,2) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The final path is [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)].  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (2,0) to (1,2) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (2,1), is:  
**[(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)]**.
