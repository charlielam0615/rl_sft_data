--- Case 26 ---
**Problem Statement**: In a 6x6 grid world, navigate from the starting point at (3,5) to the destination at (1,4), avoiding an obstacle at (0,4). The grid uses 0-based indexing, and movement is restricted to four actions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find the shortest path and return it in coordinate form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of moving from (3,5) to (1,4) into intermediate subgoals. Since the destination is at (1,4), the agent needs to move 2 units left (from x=3 to x=1) and 1 unit down (from y=5 to y=4), while avoiding the obstacle at (0,4). A possible subgoal is to first move to a position closer to the destination, such as (3,4), then adjust the x-coordinate to reach (1,4), ensuring the path avoids (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,5) to (3,4) as a first step toward (1,4). This can be achieved by moving down one step, as it reduces the y-coordinate from 5 to 4 and keeps the path clear of the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (3,5), move down to (3,4). This is a valid move since (3,4) is within the grid and contains a 0 (free cell) in the grid representation. The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (1,4) from (3,5).  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (3,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,4) to (1,4).  
**Current Goal**: Move from (3,4) to (1,4).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To move from (3,4) to (1,4), the agent needs to move 2 units left (from x=3 to x=1). A direct path along y=4 (i.e., (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4)) is possible, but we must ensure it avoids the obstacle at (0,4). Since (0,4) is not on this path, the subgoal is to move left to (2,4), then to (1,4).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (3,4) to (2,4). This can be achieved by moving left one step, as it reduces the x-coordinate from 3 to 2 and stays on y=4, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (3,4), move left to (2,4). This is a valid move since (2,4) is within the grid and contains a 0 (free cell). The path so far is [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if the path from (2,4) to (1,4) is valid. This involves checking if moving left from (2,4) to (1,4) is possible and avoids the obstacle at (0,4).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the move from (2,4) to (1,4): The cell at (1,4) is a 0 (free cell), and the move does not pass through (0,4). The move is valid. The next step can proceed to (1,4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to move from (2,4) to (1,4). This can be achieved by moving left one step, as it reduces the x-coordinate from 2 to 1, reaching the destination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From (2,4), move left to (1,4). This is a valid move since (1,4) is the destination, contains a 3 in the grid (indicating the goal), and avoids the obstacle at (0,4). The complete path is [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)].  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Reach (1,4) from (3,5) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 1: Move to (3,4) [Completed].  
  - Subgoal 2: Move from (3,4) to (1,4) [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None (destination reached).  
The path [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] has been achieved, and the goal is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The shortest path from (3,5) to (1,4) in the 6x6 grid, avoiding the obstacle at (0,4), is:  
[(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]
