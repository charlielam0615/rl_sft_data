### Problem Restatement
The goal is to plan logistics for transporting packages within and between cities, using trucks for intra-city transport and airplanes for inter-city transport. Each city has one truck and one airport. Locations within a city are directly connected, and cities are connected via their airports. The available actions are: load/unload packages into/from trucks or airplanes, drive trucks between locations in the same city, and fly airplanes between city airports. Actions have specific restrictions (e.g., a package can only be loaded if it’s at the same location as the vehicle).

**Initial Conditions:**
- Airports: `location_0_0` (city_0), `location_1_0` (city_1), `location_2_0` (city_2).
- Airplanes: `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`, `airplane_1` at `location_2_0`.
- Packages: `package_0` at `location_2_0`, `package_1` at `location_1_0`.
- Trucks: `truck_0` at `location_0_0`, `truck_1` at `location_1_0`, `truck_2` at `location_2_0`.
- Locations: `location_0_0` in `city_0`, `location_1_0` in `city_1`, `location_2_0` in `city_2`.

**Goal:**
- `package_0` is at `location_2_0` (already satisfied).
- `package_1` is at `location_0_0`.

Since `package_0` is already at `location_2_0`, the task is to transport `package_1` from `location_1_0` (city_1) to `location_0_0` (city_0).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To achieve the goal of having `package_1` at `location_0_0` in `city_0`, we break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. Since `package_1` is currently at `location_1_0` in `city_1`, it needs to be transported to `city_0`. This requires inter-city transport via an airplane, as trucks are limited to intra-city movement. The subgoals are:
1. Load `package_1` into an airplane at `location_1_0` (city_1’s airport).
2. Fly the airplane with `package_1` to `location_0_0` (city_0’s airport).
3. Unload `package_1` at `location_0_0`.

An airplane must be at `location_1_0` to load `package_1`. Currently, `airplane_0` is at `location_1_0`, which is convenient, while `airplane_1` is at `location_2_0`.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data:**
- **Current Goal**: Load `package_1` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`.
- **How to Achieve**: Since `package_1` and `airplane_0` are both at `location_1_0`, we can directly load `package_1` into `airplane_0`.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Load `package_1` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`. This satisfies the restriction that the package and airplane are at the same location. After this action, `package_1` is in `airplane_0` and no longer at `location_1_0`.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data:**
- **Current Goal**: Verify that `package_1` is loaded into `airplane_0` and that the current path aligns with the goal of getting `package_1` to `location_0_0`.
- **How to Achieve**: Check the state after the load action and ensure it supports the next subgoal (flying to `location_0_0`).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After loading, `package_1` is in `airplane_0`, and `airplane_0` is still at `location_1_0`. This state is valid because:
- `package_1` is now in a vehicle capable of inter-city transport.
- `airplane_0` is at `location_1_0` (an airport), ready to fly to `location_0_0` (another airport).
The path aligns with the next subgoal: flying `airplane_0` to `city_0`.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data:**
- **Current Goal**: Fly `airplane_0` with `package_1` from `location_1_0` to `location_0_0`.
- **How to Achieve**: Since `airplane_0` is at `location_1_0` (city_1’s airport) and `location_0_0` is an airport in `city_0`, fly `airplane_0` to `location_0_0`.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Fly `airplane_0` from `location_1_0` to `location_0_0`. This satisfies the restriction that the from- and to-locations are airports and the airplane is at the from-location. After this action, `airplane_0` (with `package_1`) is at `location_0_0`.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data:**
- **Current Goal**: Unload `package_1` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`.
- **How to Achieve**: Since `package_1` is in `airplane_0` and `airplane_0` is at `location_0_0`, unload `package_1` to place it at `location_0_0`.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Execute the action: Unload `package_1` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`. This satisfies the restriction that the package is in the airplane. After this action, `package_1` is at `location_0_0` and no longer in `airplane_0`.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: `package_0` is at `location_2_0` and `package_1` is at `location_0_0`.
  - Subgoal: `package_0` is at `location_2_0` (already satisfied in initial state).
  - Subgoal: Transport `package_1` from `location_1_0` to `location_0_0`.
    - Subgoal 1: Load `package_1` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0` (completed in Step 2).
    - Subgoal 2: Fly `airplane_0` with `package_1` to `location_0_0` (completed in Step 4).
    - Subgoal 3: Unload `package_1` at `location_0_0` (completed in Step 5).

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as `package_0` is at `location_2_0` (initial condition) and `package_1` is now at `location_0_0` (after Step 5).

The goal hierarchy reflects the completed actions, and no further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The logistics plan to achieve the goal is:

1. Load `package_1` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`.
2. Fly `airplane_0` from `location_1_0` to `location_0_0`.
3. Unload `package_1` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`.

This sequence ensures `package_1` is at `location_0_0`, while `package_0` remains at `location_2_0`, satisfying the goal.
