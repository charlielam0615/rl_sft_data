**Problem Statement**: I need to arrange a set of blocks into stacks to achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the red block. The initial conditions are: the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table. I can perform the following actions: pick up a block, unstack a block from another block, put down a block, or stack a block on another block, subject to the given restrictions (e.g., I can only pick up or unstack a clear block with an empty hand, stack a held block on a clear block, etc.).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the red block, I need to break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. The orange block is currently under the yellow block, so I must first make the orange block clear by removing the yellow block. Then, I need to ensure the red block is clear and on the table (or accessible) to stack the orange block on it. The red block is currently on the blue block, so it may need to be unstacked. Subgoals:
1. Make the orange block clear by removing the yellow block.
2. Ensure the red block is clear and accessible.
3. Stack the orange block on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Make the orange block clear by removing the yellow block.
How to Achieve: Since the yellow block is clear, on top of the orange block, and the hand is empty, I can unstack the yellow block from the orange block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This action is valid because the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. After unstacking, I am holding the yellow block, and the orange block becomes clear.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Place the yellow block somewhere to free the hand.
How to Achieve: Since I am holding the yellow block, I can put it down on the table, which is a valid action as it clears my hand for further actions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Put down the yellow block on the table. This action is valid because I am holding the yellow block. After putting it down, the yellow block is on the table, clear, and my hand is empty.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Make the orange block clear (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the red block is clear and accessible (in progress).
  - Subgoal 3: Stack the orange block on the red block.
Current Goal: Ensure the red block is clear and accessible.
The red block is currently on the blue block and clear, so it is accessible for picking up or unstacking.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Ensure the red block is clear and accessible.
How to Achieve: The red block is already clear and on the blue block. To make it accessible for stacking the orange block, I need to unstack the red block from the blue block to hold it, then place it on the table to ensure it is clear and on a stable base.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Unstack the red block from the blue block. This action is valid because the red block is clear, the hand is empty, and the red block is on top of the blue block. After unstacking, I am holding the red block, and the blue block becomes clear.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Place the red block on the table to make it clear and accessible.
How to Achieve: Since I am holding the red block, I can put it down on the table to make it clear and ready for stacking the orange block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Put down the red block on the table. This action is valid because I am holding the red block. After putting it down, the red block is on the table, clear, and my hand is empty.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Stack the orange block on the red block.
How to Achieve: The orange block is clear and on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and my hand is empty. I can pick up the orange block and stack it on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pick up the orange block. This action is valid because the orange block is clear, on the table, and my hand is empty. Then, stack the orange block on the red block. This is valid because I am holding the orange block, and the red block is clear. After stacking, the orange block is on the red block, the red block is no longer clear, and my hand is empty.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the goal of having the orange block on top of the red block is achieved.
How to Achieve: Check the current state against the goal state.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The current state is: the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, and the hand is empty. The goal of having the orange block on top of the red block is achieved.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sequence of actions to achieve the goal is:
1. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.
2. Put down the yellow block on the table.
3. Unstack the red block from the blue block.
4. Put down the red block on the table.
5. Pick up the orange block.
6. Stack the orange block on the red block.
