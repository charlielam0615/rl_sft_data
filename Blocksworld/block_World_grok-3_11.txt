### Problem Statement
The goal is to transport package_0 from location_1_0 (an airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (an airport in city_0). Each city has one truck, and cities are connected by airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected by trucks, and each city has one airport. The initial conditions are:
- location_0_0 is an airport in city_0.
- location_1_0 is an airport in city_1.
- airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0.
- package_0 is at location_1_0.
- truck_0 is at location_0_0.
- truck_1 is at location_1_0.
The actions available are loading/unloading packages to/from trucks or airplanes, driving trucks within a city, and flying airplanes between city airports, with restrictions as specified.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the required format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, work backward from the final state. The final state requires package_0 to be at location_0_0 (airport in city_0). Since package_0 is initially at location_1_0 (airport in city_1), it must be transported from city_1 to city_0. This requires:
1. Loading package_0 onto an airplane at location_1_0.
2. Flying the airplane from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
3. Unloading package_0 at location_0_0.
However, no airplane is initially at location_1_0 (both airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0). Thus, an additional subgoal is needed:
4. Fly an airplane from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
The subgoals, in reverse order, are:
- Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0.
- Subgoal 2: Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0.
- Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.
- Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0.
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0.
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal:** Fly an airplane to location_1_0.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fly an airplane to location_1_0. This can be achieved by selecting an airplane at location_0_0 (either airplane_0 or airplane_1) and flying it to location_1_0, which is an airport.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose airplane_0 (since either airplane can be used) and perform the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.  
- **Action**: Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
- **Result**: Airplane_0 is now at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0.
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal:** Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0. Since package_0 and airplane_0 are both at location_1_0, load package_0 into airplane_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform the action: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
- **Action**: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
- **Result**: Package_0 is now in airplane_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal:** Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0. Since package_0 is in airplane_0 at location_1_0, fly airplane_0 to location_0_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
- **Action**: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
- **Result**: Airplane_0 (with package_0) is now at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 onto the airplane at location_1_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0 (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal:** Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to unload package_0 at location_0_0. Since package_0 is in airplane_0 at location_0_0, unload package_0 from airplane_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform the action: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
- **Action**: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.
- **Result**: Package_0 is now at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that package_0 is at location_0_0, as required by the main goal. Check the current state against the goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Current State**: Package_0 is at location_0_0 (from Step 9).
- **Goal State**: Package_0 is at location_0_0.
- **Validation Result**: The goal is achieved, as package_0 is at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The goal of having package_0 at location_0_0 has been achieved. The sequence of actions is:
1. Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
2. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
3. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
4. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.
