Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M)
We define a set of meta-cognitive actions M, divided into three subsets: Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R).
- Planning $$P \subset M$$
  - Forward Subgoaling: Breaking down the current goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.
  - Backward Subgoaling: Defining necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the current goal.
  - Adjust Subgoals: Adjusting or changing previously set intermediate subgoals.
  - Backtrack: Returning to an earlier state.
- Implementation $$I \subset M$$
  - Reach Goal: Identifying the goal of this step, and applying reasoning or using tools to achieve it.
  - Validation: Checking the current path's validity.
- Review $$R \subset M$$
  - Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated by previous subgoaling methods, highlighting the current one.
  - Recall Info: Retrieve past information relevant to the current step.

I want you to solve problems by selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list. Your response must adhere to the following format: enclose all planning-related content within [PLANNING] and [/PLANNING] tags, all implementation-related content within [IMP] and [/IMP] tags, and all review-related content within [REVIEW] and [/REVIEW] tags. The details of the requirement will be given below.
- The [PLANNING], [IMP] and [REVIEW] blocks
The meta-cognitive action list divides actions into three categories: "planning", "implementation" and "Review". If the selected action is from the "planning" category, include all content for that step in the [PLANNING] block. If the action is from the "implementation" category, place the action name and action meta-data (defined below) and in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as implementation details and should be placed in the [IMP] block. If the action is from the "review" category, place the action name in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as reviewed details, and should be placed in the [REVIEW] block.

- Additional remarks on the [PLANNING] block
For actions from the "planning" category, put all the generated content of the action in the [PLANNING] block.
For actions from the "implementation" category, put the action name and implementation-action meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The implementation-action meta-data includes details about the current goal, and a concise description about how to achieve it. Present the meta-data in clear, natural language.
For actions from the "review" category, when the action is "recall info" include the action name and its meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The meta-data should concisely describe the core content serving as the foundation for the information retrieval process, with retrieved information being relevant to this content. When is the action is not "recall info", just put the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

- Additional remarks on the [REVIEW] block
For actions belong to the review category, we provide detailed instructions below:
Track Goals: Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format by integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block. The aim of this action is to provide an overall as well as focused context to future [IMP] block. You should also state the current goal. Ensure the goals reflect the most recent updates, particularly if they have just been modified by actions from the "planning" category.
Recall Info: Identify the current goal, go through all previous contents, and extract information related to the current goal. Your summarized information should be concise, such that it should serve as pointers to previous related materials.

Start your solution by restating the problem clearly. Then, for each step, include the following blocks based on the action's category:

Case 1: Planning action — Include only the [PLANNING] block.
Case 2: Implementation action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [IMP] block.
Case 3: Review action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [REVIEW] block.

Append which category the selected action belongs to after the action name in the [PLANNING] block.
===========
Solve the user's problems by following the previous requirements.

I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via
airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two
such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city
has one location that serves as an airport.
Here are the actions that can be performed:
Load a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.
Load a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Drive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1  to location_1_2 in city_1. Fly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.
Once a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.
A package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same  location.
Once a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the  airplane.
A package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.
Once a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of  the truck.
A package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.
Once a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the  location of the airplane.
A truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both  from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.
Once a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the  to-location.
An airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are  airports and the airplane is at the from-location.
Once an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is  at the to-location.
[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport,
airplane_0 is at location_0_0, airplane_1 is at location_0_0, package_0 is at location_1_0,
truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and
location_1_0 is in the city city_1. 
My goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.
