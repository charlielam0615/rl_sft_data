**Problem Restatement:**  
I am working with a set of blocks and need to arrange them into specific stacks by performing actions such as picking up a block, unstacking a block from another, putting down a block, or stacking a block on top of another. There are restrictions on these actions: I can only handle one block at a time, my hand must be empty to pick up or unstack a block, a block must be clear (no blocks on top of it and not picked up) to be picked up or unstacked, and specific conditions must be met for stacking or putting down blocks. The initial state is as follows: the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, my hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table. The goal is to achieve a state where the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, my hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the main goal into intermediate subgoals to achieve the desired configuration. The final state requires the blue block on the table, the red block on the blue block, the orange block on the red block, and the yellow block on the table. Currently, the red block is already on the blue block, but the orange block is under the yellow block, and the yellow block needs to be moved to the table. A logical sequence of subgoals is:  
1. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear.  
2. Move the yellow block to the table.  
3. Move the orange block on top of the red block, which is already on the blue block.  
These subgoals will guide the actions needed to reach the final configuration.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Achieve the configuration where the blue block is on the table, the red block is on the blue block, the orange block is on the red block, the yellow block is on the table, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty.  
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear.  
  - Subgoal 2: Move the yellow block to the table.  
  - Subgoal 3: Move the orange block on top of the red block.  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.  
How to Achieve: Since my hand is empty and the yellow block is clear, I can pick up the yellow block directly from the orange block by unstacking it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I unstack the yellow block from the orange block. My hand is now holding the yellow block, and the orange block is clear.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move the yellow block to the table.  
How to Achieve: Since I am holding the yellow block, I can put it down directly on the table to achieve this subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I put down the yellow block on the table. My hand is now empty, and the yellow block is on the table and clear.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Achieve the configuration where the blue block is on the table, the red block is on the blue block, the orange block is on the red block, the yellow block is on the table, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty.  
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Move the yellow block to the table. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Move the orange block on top of the red block.  
Current Goal: Subgoal 3 - Move the orange block on top of the red block.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move the orange block on top of the red block.  
How to Achieve: Since my hand is empty and the orange block is clear and on the table, I can pick up the orange block and then stack it on top of the red block, which is clear.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I pick up the orange block from the table. My hand is now holding the orange block. Then, I stack the orange block on top of the red block. My hand is now empty, the orange block is on the red block, and the orange block is clear.

Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Achieve the configuration where the blue block is on the table, the red block is on the blue block, the orange block is on the red block, the yellow block is on the table, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty.  
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Move the yellow block to the table. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Move the orange block on top of the red block. (Completed)  
Current Goal: Main Goal - Verify that all conditions of the final configuration are met.

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the final configuration matches the goal state.  
How to Achieve: Check the current state of all blocks and the hand against the desired goal state to ensure all conditions are satisfied.

[IMP]  
Current State:  
- Blue block is on the table.  
- Red block is on the blue block.  
- Orange block is on the red block.  
- Yellow block is on the table.  
- Orange block is clear (no blocks on top).  
- Yellow block is clear (no blocks on top).  
- Hand is empty.  
All conditions of the goal state are satisfied. The goal is achieved.
