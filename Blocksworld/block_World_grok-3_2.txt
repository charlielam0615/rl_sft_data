**Problem Restatement:**  
I have a set of blocks (red, blue, yellow, orange) and need to arrange them into stacks to achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the blue block. The initial conditions are: the red block is clear and on the table, the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block, the yellow block is clear and on the table, the orange block is on the table, and my hand is empty. I can perform the following actions with restrictions:  
- **Pick up a block**: Only if my hand is empty and the block is clear and on the table.  
- **Unstack a block**: Only if my hand is empty, the block is clear, and it is on top of another block.  
- **Put down a block**: Only if I am holding the block; afterward, my hand becomes empty.  
- **Stack a block**: Only if I am holding the block and the block to stack on is clear; afterward, my hand becomes empty.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block, I will work backward. The final action must be to stack the orange block on the blue block. For this, I need: (1) the orange block in my hand, (2) the blue block to be clear, and (3) the blue block to be on the table or in a stable position. Currently, the blue block is on the orange block, so I must first unstack the blue block to make the orange block clear and pickable. Then, I can pick up the orange block and stack it on the blue block. Subgoals: (1) unstack the blue block from the orange block, (2) pick up the orange block, (3) stack the orange block on the blue block.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Unstack the blue block from the orange block.  
**How to Achieve:** My hand is empty, and the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block, satisfying the conditions for unstacking. I will unstack the blue block, which will result in holding the blue block.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I unstack the blue block from the orange block. Now, I am holding the blue block, the orange block is clear and on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear and on the table.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Put down the blue block to clear my hand for picking up the orange block.  
**How to Achieve:** I am holding the blue block, so I can put it down on the table. This will make my hand empty and the blue block clear and on the table, setting up the next step to pick up the orange block.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I put down the blue block on the table. Now, my hand is empty, the blue block is clear and on the table, the orange block is clear and on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear and on the table.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Pick up the orange block to prepare for stacking it on the blue block.  
**How to Achieve:** My hand is empty, and the orange block is clear and on the table, satisfying the conditions for picking up. I will pick up the orange block, resulting in holding the orange block.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I pick up the orange block. Now, I am holding the orange block, the blue block is clear and on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear and on the table.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Stack the orange block on top of the blue block to achieve the final goal.  
**How to Achieve:** I am holding the orange block, and the blue block is clear and on the table, satisfying the conditions for stacking. I will stack the orange block on the blue block, completing the goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I stack the orange block on top of the blue block. Now, my hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear and on the table. The goal is achieved.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Have the orange block on top of the blue block.  
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the orange block (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Put down the blue block on the table (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Pick up the orange block (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Stack the orange block on the blue block (completed).  
**Current Goal:** The main goal (orange block on top of the blue block) has been achieved, as confirmed by the final state: the orange block is on the blue block. No further actions are needed.
