**Problem Statement**: The goal is to transport package_0 from location_1_0 (an airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (an airport in city_0). The logistics involve using trucks within cities and airplanes between cities. Initially, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, and airplane_1 is at location_1_0. Locations within a city are directly connected, each city has one truck, and each city has one airport. The actions available are loading/unloading packages to/from trucks or airplanes, driving trucks within cities, and flying airplanes between city airports, subject to the given restrictions.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. Since package_0 is at location_1_0 (city_1’s airport) and needs to be at location_0_0 (city_0’s airport), the package must be transported from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane, as trucks cannot move between cities. The subgoals are:  
1. Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
2. Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
3. Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0. This can be achieved by selecting an available airplane (airplane_0 or airplane_1, both at location_1_0) and loading package_0 into it, ensuring the package and airplane are at the same location (they are).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
This satisfies the restriction that the package and airplane must be at the same location (both are at location_1_0). After this action, package_0 is in airplane_0 and no longer at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate that the action of loading package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0 was correct and aligns with the subgoal. Check if package_0 is now in airplane_0 and if this progresses toward the next subgoal (flying to location_0_0).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The action is valid: package_0 and airplane_0 were both at location_1_0, satisfying the loading restriction. Package_0 is now in airplane_0, which is a necessary condition for the next subgoal of flying airplane_0 to location_0_0. The current state aligns with the plan.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fly airplane_0 with package_0 from location_1_0 (city_1’s airport) to location_0_0 (city_0’s airport). This can be achieved by flying airplane_0, which now contains package_0, to location_0_0, ensuring the from- and to-locations are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
This satisfies the restrictions: location_1_0 and location_0_0 are airports, and airplane_0 is at location_1_0. After this action, airplane_0 (with package_0 inside) is at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0 (current goal).  
The current goal is to unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0 to achieve the main goal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0. This can be achieved by unloading package_0 from airplane_0, which is now at location_0_0, ensuring the package is in the airplane.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
This satisfies the restriction that the package must be in the airplane (package_0 is in airplane_0). After this action, package_0 is at location_0_0 and no longer in airplane_0, achieving the main goal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate that unloading package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0 achieves the main goal and that all actions were correctly executed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The action is valid: package_0 was in airplane_0 at location_0_0, and unloading places package_0 at location_0_0, satisfying the main goal. All previous actions (loading, flying, unloading) adhered to the restrictions and followed the subgoals. The goal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The sequence of actions to achieve the goal is:  
1. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
2. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
3. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
This results in package_0 being at location_0_0, as required.
