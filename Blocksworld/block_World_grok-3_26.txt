**Problem Statement**: The goal is to transport package_0 from location_1_0 in city_1 to location_0_0 in city_0, where location_0_0 and location_1_0 are airports. There is one truck per city (truck_0 in city_0 at location_0_0, truck_1 in city_1 at location_1_0), and airplanes (airplane_0 and airplane_1 at location_1_0) can fly between airports. Packages can be loaded/unloaded into/from trucks or airplanes when at the same location, trucks can drive between locations within a city, and airplanes can fly between airports of different cities.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, work backward from the goal. Since location_0_0 is an airport in city_0 and package_0 is currently at location_1_0 (airport in city_1), the package needs to be transported from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane, as trucks cannot move between cities. For package_0 to be at location_0_0, it must be unloaded from an airplane at location_0_0. This requires the airplane carrying package_0 to be at location_0_0, which in turn requires loading package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0 and flying it to location_0_0. Thus, the subgoals are:
1. Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.
2. Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
3. Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0. This can be achieved by performing the "Load a package into an airplane" action, as package_0 and airplanes (airplane_0 and airplane_1) are both at location_1_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
- **Verification**: Package_0 is at location_1_0, and airplane_0 is at location_1_0, satisfying the condition for loading. After this action, package_0 is in airplane_0 and no longer at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0. This can be achieved by performing the "Fly an airplane from one city to another" action, using airplane_0 (which contains package_0) from location_1_0 (airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (airport in city_0).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
- **Verification**: Airplane_0 is at location_1_0, and both location_1_0 and location_0_0 are airports, satisfying the condition for flying. After this action, airplane_0 (with package_0) is at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0 (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Unload package_0 from the airplane at location_0_0.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0. This can be achieved by performing the "Unload a package from an airplane" action, as package_0 is in airplane_0, and airplane_0 is at location_0_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
- **Verification**: Package_0 is in airplane_0, and airplane_0 is at location_0_0, satisfying the condition for unloading. After this action, package_0 is at location_0_0 and no longer in airplane_0.  
- **Conclusion**: The main goal is achieved, as package_0 is now at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sequence of actions to achieve the goal is:  
1. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
2. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
3. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  

This results in package_0 being at location_0_0, satisfying the goal.
