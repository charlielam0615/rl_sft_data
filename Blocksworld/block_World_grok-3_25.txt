### Problem Restatement
I need to arrange a set of blocks into stacks to achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the red block. The initial conditions are:
- The red block is clear.
- The yellow block is clear.
- The hand is empty.
- The red block is on top of the blue block.
- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.
- The blue block is on the table.
- The orange block is on the table.

The allowed actions are:
- Pick up a block.
- Unstack a block from on top of another block.
- Put down a block.
- Stack a block on top of another block.

The restrictions on actions are:
- Only one block can be picked up or unstacked at a time.
- The hand must be empty to pick up or unstack a block.
- A block can only be picked up if it is on the table and clear (no blocks on top and not picked up).
- A block can only be unstacked if it is on top of another block and clear.
- After picking up or unstacking, the block is held.
- A block can only be put down if it is being held.
- A block can only be stacked if it is being held and the target block is clear.
- After putting down or stacking a block, the hand becomes empty.
- Stacking a block on another makes the second block no longer clear.

I will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal (orange block on top of red block) into forward-looking intermediate subgoals. To stack orange on red, the orange block must be clear, the red block must be clear, and the hand must be holding the orange block. Currently, the yellow block is on the orange block, so yellow must be unstacked first. The red block is clear, which is good. Subgoals:
1. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make orange clear.
2. Pick up the orange block.
3. Stack the orange block on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear. To achieve this, since the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, and yellow is on orange, I will unstack the yellow block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This results in:
- The hand holding the yellow block.
- The orange block becoming clear.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Pick up the orange block (current goal).
  - Subgoal 3: Stack the orange block on the red block.

**Current goal**: Pick up the orange block.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pick up the orange block. Since the orange block is now clear (after unstacking yellow), on the table, and the hand is holding the yellow block, I must first put down the yellow block to free the hand, then pick up the orange block. First, I will put down the yellow block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Put down the yellow block on the table. This results in:
- The yellow block on the table and clear.
- The hand empty.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pick up the orange block. Now that the hand is empty, the orange block is clear and on the table, I can pick up the orange block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pick up the orange block. This results in:
- The hand holding the orange block.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Pick up the orange block (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Stack the orange block on the red block (current goal).

**Current goal**: Stack the orange block on the red block.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to stack the orange block on the red block. The hand is holding the orange block, and the red block is clear, so I can stack the orange block on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Stack the orange block on the red block. This results in:
- The orange block on top of the red block.
- The red block no longer clear.
- The hand empty.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the orange block is on top of the red block. I will check if the final state meets the goal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The orange block is on top of the red block, as achieved in the previous step. The goal is satisfied.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The sequence of actions to achieve the goal (orange block on top of red block) is:
1. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.
2. Put down the yellow block on the table.
3. Pick up the orange block.
4. Stack the orange block on the red block.

This results in the orange block on top of the red block, satisfying the goal.
