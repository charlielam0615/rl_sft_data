### Problem Statement
The Blocks World task involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand, where the goal is to create specific vertical stacks of blocks using the operations: Pickup, Putdown, Stack, and Unstack. The blocks can be placed on the table or stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand performing the operations under the constraints that a block must be clear (nothing on top) to be picked up or stacked upon, and the robot hand can only hold one block at a time. The task is to simulate a Blocks World planning case and create a plan to achieve a specified goal configuration.

For this simulation, letâ€™s define a specific Blocks World scenario:
- **Initial State**: Three blocks (A, B, C). Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table, and Block C is on top of Block A. The robot hand is empty.
- **Goal State**: Create a single vertical stack with Block C on the table, Block B on Block C, and Block A on Block B (i.e., C on table, B on C, A on B).
- **Constraints**: The robot hand can only pick up a block that is clear and on the table (Pickup), place a held block on the table (Putdown), stack a held block on a clear block (Stack), or pick up a clear block from another block (Unstack).

The task is to create a plan by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided set (Planning: Forward Subgoaling, Backward Subgoaling, Adjust Subgoals, Backtrack; Implementation: Reach Goal, Validation; Review: Track Goals, Recall Info) to achieve the goal state.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating the stack (C on table, B on C, A on B) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Ensure Block C is on the table and clear.  
2. Place Block B on Block C, ensuring both are clear before stacking.  
3. Place Block A on Block B, ensuring Block B is clear before stacking.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Achieve stack (C on table, B on C, A on B).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Ensure Block C is on the table and clear.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Place Block B on Block C.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Place Block A on Block B.  
- **Current Goal**: Subgoal 1 (Ensure Block C is on the table and clear).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure Block C is on the table and clear.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the initial state, Block C is on Block A, and Block A is on the table. To make Block C clear and on the table, unstack Block C from Block A and place it on the table.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Perform the following operations:  
1. **Unstack(C, A)**: Since Block C is clear (nothing on top) and on Block A, the robot hand picks up Block C.  
2. **Putdown(C)**: Place Block C on the table.  
**Resulting State**: Block A on table, Block B on table, Block C on table, robot hand empty.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure Block C is on the table and clear.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that Block C is on the table and has no blocks on top of it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the resulting state from Step 3:  
- Block C is on the table.  
- No blocks are on top of Block C (it is clear).  
**Conclusion**: The current goal (Block C on table and clear) is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Achieve stack (C on table, B on C, A on B).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Ensure Block C is on the table and clear (achieved).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Place Block B on Block C.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Place Block A on Block B.  
- **Current Goal**: Subgoal 2 (Place Block B on Block C).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Place Block B on Block C.  
- **How to Achieve**: Block B is on the table and clear, and Block C is on the table and clear. Pick up Block B and stack it on Block C.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Perform the following operations:  
1. **Pickup(B)**: Since Block B is on the table and clear, the robot hand picks up Block B.  
2. **Stack(B, C)**: Place Block B on Block C, which is clear.  
**Resulting State**: Block A on table, Block C on table, Block B on Block C, robot hand empty.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Place Block B on Block C.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that Block B is on Block C and both blocks are in the correct configuration.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the resulting state from Step 6:  
- Block B is on Block C.  
- Block C is on the table.  
**Conclusion**: The current goal (Block B on Block C) is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Achieve stack (C on table, B on C, A on B).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Ensure Block C is on the table and clear (achieved).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Place Block B on Block C (achieved).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Place Block A on Block B.  
- **Current Goal**: Subgoal 3 (Place Block A on Block B).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Place Block A on Block B.  
- **How to Achieve**: Block A is on the table and clear, and Block B is on Block C and clear. Pick up Block A and stack it on Block B.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Perform the following operations:  
1. **Pickup(A)**: Since Block A is on the table and clear, the robot hand picks up Block A.  
2. **Stack(A, B)**: Place Block A on Block B, which is clear.  
**Resulting State**: Block C on table, Block B on Block C, Block A on Block B, robot hand empty.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Place Block A on Block B.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that Block A is on Block B, and the entire stack matches the goal state (C on table, B on C, A on B).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the resulting state from Step 9:  
- Block C is on the table.  
- Block B is on Block C.  
- Block A is on Block B.  
**Conclusion**: The current goal (Block A on Block B) is achieved, and the entire goal state (C on table, B on C, A on B) is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Final Plan
The Blocks World plan to achieve the goal state (Block C on table, Block B on Block C, Block A on Block B) from the initial state (Block A on table, Block B on table, Block C on Block A) is:  
1. Unstack(C, A)  
2. Putdown(C)  
3. Pickup(B)  
4. Stack(B, C)  
5. Pickup(A)  
6. Stack(A, B)  

This sequence ensures all constraints are met, and the goal configuration is achieved.
