### Problem Restatement
I need to arrange a set of blocks into stacks to achieve a specific goal configuration, starting from given initial conditions. The blocks are red, yellow, blue, and orange, and I can perform the following actions: pick up a block, unstack a block from another block, put down a block, or stack a block on another block. These actions are subject to restrictions, such as only handling one block at a time, requiring an empty hand to pick up or unstack, and ensuring blocks are clear (no blocks on top and not picked up) for certain actions. 

**Initial State:**
- Red block is clear.
- Yellow block is clear.
- Hand is empty.
- Red block is on blue block.
- Yellow block is on orange block.
- Blue block is on the table.
- Orange block is on the table.

**Goal State:**
- Orange block is clear.
- Yellow block is clear.
- Hand is empty.
- Red block is on blue block.
- Orange block is on red block.
- Blue block is on the table.
- Yellow block is on the table.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To achieve the goal state, I need to break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. The goal requires:
- Orange block clear (nothing on top).
- Yellow block clear (nothing on top and on the table).
- Hand empty.
- Red block on blue block (already true in initial state).
- Orange block on red block.
- Blue block on the table (already true).
- Yellow block on the table.

Key observations:
- Currently, yellow is on orange, but orange needs to be clear and stacked on red. Thus, I must unstack yellow from orange and place yellow on the table.
- Orange needs to be moved from the table to on top of red, which requires orange to be clear first.
- Red is already on blue, and blue is on the table, which aligns with the goal.
- The hand must end up empty.

Subgoals:
1. Unstack yellow from orange to make orange clear and place yellow on the table.
2. Pick up orange and stack it on red.
3. Ensure the hand is empty (achieved after stacking orange).

I will start with subgoal 1: unstack yellow from orange and place it on the table.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Unstack yellow from orange to make orange clear.
How to Achieve: Since yellow is clear, the hand is empty, and yellow is on orange, I can unstack yellow from orange by performing the unstack action, which results in holding yellow.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Unstack yellow from orange.
- Check restrictions: Hand is empty, yellow is clear, yellow is on orange. All conditions are met.
- Action result: I am now holding yellow, yellow is no longer on orange, orange becomes clear.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Place yellow on the table to achieve "yellow block is on the table" and make the hand empty.
How to Achieve: I am holding yellow. I can put down yellow on the table, which will place yellow on the table and empty my hand.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Put down yellow.
- Check restrictions: I am holding yellow. Condition is met.
- Action result: Yellow is now on the table, my hand is empty, yellow is clear.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Achieve the goal state (orange clear, yellow clear, hand empty, red on blue, orange on red, blue on table, yellow on table).
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack yellow from orange and place yellow on the table (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Pick up orange and stack it on red.
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure the hand is empty (to be achieved after stacking orange).

Current Goal: Pick up orange and stack it on red.

Status:
- Subgoal 1 is complete: Yellow is on the table, orange is clear.
- Subgoal 2 is next: Orange is clear and on the table, red is clear and on blue, so I can proceed to pick up orange.
- Subgoal 3 will follow naturally after stacking orange, as stacking empties the hand.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Pick up orange to prepare for stacking it on red.
How to Achieve: Orange is clear, on the table, and the hand is empty. I can pick up orange.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Pick up orange.
- Check restrictions: Hand is empty, orange is clear, orange is on the table. All conditions are met.
- Action result: I am now holding orange, orange is no longer on the table.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Stack orange on red to achieve "orange block is on red block" and make orange clear.
How to Achieve: I am holding orange, red is clear (since red was initially clear and no blocks have been stacked on it), and red is on blue. I can stack orange on red.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Stack orange on red.
- Check restrictions: I am holding orange, red is clear. Conditions are met.
- Action result: Orange is now on red, my hand is empty, red is no longer clear, orange is clear.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the goal state has been achieved.
How to Achieve: Check each condition of the goal state against the current configuration.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the current state:
- Goal: Orange block is clear. **Satisfied**: Orange has nothing on top after being stacked on red.
- Goal: Yellow block is clear. **Satisfied**: Yellow is on the table with nothing on top.
- Goal: Hand is empty. **Satisfied**: Hand became empty after stacking orange.
- Goal: Red block is on blue block. **Satisfied**: Red was initially on blue and hasn’t been moved.
- Goal: Orange block is on red block. **Satisfied**: Orange was just stacked on red.
- Goal: Blue block is on the table. **Satisfied**: Blue was initially on the table and hasn’t been moved.
- Goal: Yellow block is on the table. **Satisfied**: Yellow was placed on the table in Step 3.

All goal conditions are met. The goal state has been achieved.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sequence of actions to achieve the goal state is:
1. Unstack yellow from orange.
2. Put down yellow (on the table).
3. Pick up orange.
4. Stack orange on red.

This sequence satisfies all restrictions and transforms the initial state into the goal state: orange block clear, yellow block clear, hand empty, red block on blue block, orange block on red block, blue block on the table, and yellow block on the table.
