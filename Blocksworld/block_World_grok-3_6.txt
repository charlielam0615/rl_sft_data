**Problem Statement**:  
The goal is to transport package_0 from location_1_0 (in city_1) to location_0_0 (in city_0), minimizing the total time taken. The logistics system involves trucks for intra-city transport and airplanes for inter-city transport. Each city has one truck and one airport. The available actions are:  
- Load a package into a truck (1 minute).  
- Load a package into an airplane (1 minute).  
- Unload a package from a truck (1 minute).  
- Unload a package from an airplane (1 minute).  
- Drive a truck between locations in the same city (2 minutes).  
- Fly an airplane between cities (5 minutes).  
Constraints ensure that loading/unloading and movement actions can only occur when the package, truck, or airplane are at the appropriate locations. The initial conditions are:  
- location_0_0 is an airport in city_0.  
- location_1_0 is an airport in city_1.  
- airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0.  
- package_0 is at location_1_0.  
- truck_0 is at location_0_0.  
- truck_1 is at location_1_0.  

The task is to devise a sequence of actions to achieve the goal in the least amount of time, following the meta-cognitive action framework (Planning, Implementation, Review).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Load package_0 into a vehicle (truck or airplane) in city_1 at location_1_0.  
2. Transport package_0 from city_1 (location_1_0) to city_0 (location_0_0).  
3. Unload package_0 at location_0_0 to achieve the final goal.  
These subgoals account for the need to move the package across cities, using the available truck in city_1 and an airplane for inter-city transport.

**Step 2: Track Goals**

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: package_0 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Load package_0 into a vehicle (truck or airplane) in city_1 at location_1_0.  
  - Subgoal 2: Transport package_0 from city_1 (location_1_0) to city_0 (location_0_0).  
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Load package_0 into a vehicle at location_1_0.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to load package_0 into a vehicle at location_1_0. Since package_0 and truck_1 are both at location_1_0, and location_1_0 is an airport, we can load package_0 into truck_1 or an airplane (if one is available). However, airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0, so loading into an airplane requires flying one to location_1_0, which takes 5 minutes. Loading into truck_1 is immediate since truck_1 is already at location_1_0 and takes only 1 minute. To minimize time, choose to load package_0 into truck_1.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Load package_0 into truck_1 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
**Result**: package_0 is now in truck_1 at location_1_0.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: package_0 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Load package_0 into a vehicle at location_1_0 (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 2: Transport package_0 from city_1 (location_1_0) to city_0 (location_0_0).  
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Transport package_0 from city_1 (location_1_0) to city_0 (location_0_0).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Adjust Subgoals**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The current subgoal is to transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0. Since package_0 is in truck_1 at location_1_0 (an airport), refine the subgoal:  
1. Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0 (requires an airplane at location_1_0).  
2. Fly the airplane with package_0 to location_0_0.  
This adjustment accounts for the need to use an airplane for inter-city transport, as trucks cannot move between cities.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0, which requires an airplane at location_1_0. Since airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0, fly airplane_0 to location_1_0 to enable loading. This action takes 5 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0 (5 minutes).  
**Result**: airplane_0 is now at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0. Since package_0 is in truck_1 at location_1_0 and airplane_0 is now at location_1_0, unload package_0 from truck_1 and load it into airplane_0. Unloading takes 1 minute, and loading takes 1 minute.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the actions:  
1. Unload package_0 from truck_1 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
**Result**: package_0 is at location_1_0.  
2. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
**Result**: package_0 is in airplane_0 at location_1_0.

**Step 9: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fly airplane_0 with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0. Since package_0 is in airplane_0 at location_1_0, fly airplane_0 to location_0_0. This action takes 5 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

Perform the action: Fly airplane_0 with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (5 minutes).  
**Result**: airplane_0 and package_0 are at location_0_0.

**Step 10: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to unload package_0 at location_0_0. Since package_0 is in airplane_0 at location_0_0, unload package_0 from airplane_0. This action takes 1 minute.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the action: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0 (1 minute).  
**Result**: package_0 is at location_0_0.

**Step 11: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to have package_0 at location_0_0. Verify if the current state satisfies this goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the current state: package_0 is at location_0_0.  
**Result**: The goal is achieved.  
Total time:  
- Step 3: Load package_0 into truck_1 (1 minute).  
- Step 6: Fly airplane_0 to location_1_0 (5 minutes).  
- Step 7: Unload package_0 from truck_1 (1 minute) + Load package_0 into airplane_0 (1 minute).  
- Step 9: Fly airplane_0 with package_0 to location_0_0 (5 minutes).  
- Step 10: Unload package_0 at location_0_0 (1 minute).  
Total = 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 14 minutes.

**Final Answer**:  
The sequence of actions to transport package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0, minimizing time, is:  
1. Load package_0 into truck_1 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
2. Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0 (5 minutes).  
3. Unload package_0 from truck_1 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
4. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0 (1 minute).  
5. Fly airplane_0 with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (5 minutes).  
6. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0 (1 minute).  
**Total time**: 14 minutes.  
This solution is optimal, as it uses the fastest available transport (airplane) for inter-city movement and minimizes unnecessary actions.
