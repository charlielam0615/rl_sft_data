**Problem Statement**: The goal is to plan logistics for transporting packages within and between cities using trucks and airplanes. Each city has one truck and one airport. Packages can be loaded/unloaded into/from trucks or airplanes and transported within cities by trucks or between cities by airplanes, subject to specific restrictions (e.g., packages and vehicles must be at the same location for loading, trucks move within cities, airplanes move between city airports). The initial conditions are: location_0_0 (airport in city_0), location_1_0 (airport in city_1), and location_2_0 (airport in city_2) are airports; airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_2_0, package_0 is at location_2_0, package_1 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, truck_2 is at location_2_0. The goal is to ensure package_0 is at location_2_0 and package_1 is at location_0_0.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Ensure package_0 is at location_2_0 and package_1 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify package_0 is at location_2_0.  
  - Subgoal 2: Move package_1 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Verify package_0 is at location_2_0 and plan for package_1's transport.  
**Details**: The initial conditions state that package_0 is already at location_2_0, satisfying Subgoal 1. The focus is now on Subgoal 2: transporting package_1 from location_1_0 (city_1’s airport) to location_0_0 (city_0’s airport). This requires moving package_1 between cities, likely using an airplane, as trucks are restricted to intra-city movement.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]  
To achieve the main goal (package_0 at location_2_0, package_1 at location_0_0), break down Subgoal 2 (move package_1 from location_1_0 to location_0_0) into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Load package_1 into a vehicle (airplane) at location_1_0 for inter-city transport.  
2. Transport package_1 to location_0_0 (city_0’s airport).  
3. Unload package_1 at location_0_0 to achieve the goal.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Load package_1 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use airplane_0, which is already at location_1_0, to load package_1, as both are at the same location (per initial conditions).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Load package_1 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
- **Action Details**: Since package_1 and airplane_0 are both at location_1_0, and location_1_0 is an airport, the action satisfies the restriction that a package can be loaded into an airplane if both are at the same location. After loading, package_1 is in airplane_0 and no longer at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Transport package_1 to location_0_0.  
- **How to Achieve**: Fly airplane_0 (with package_1 loaded) from location_1_0 (city_1’s airport) to location_0_0 (city_0’s airport).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
- **Action Details**: Location_1_0 and location_0_0 are airports in city_1 and city_0, respectively. Airplane_0 is at location_1_0 with package_1 loaded. Flying airplane_0 to location_0_0 is valid per the restriction that an airplane can fly between airports. After this action, airplane_0 and package_1 are at location_0_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Unload package_1 at location_0_0.  
- **How to Achieve**: Unload package_1 from airplane_0 at location_0_0 to place package_1 at the destination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Execute the action: Unload package_1 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
- **Action Details**: Package_1 is in airplane_0, which is now at location_0_0 (after flying). The restriction allows unloading a package from an airplane if the package is in it. After unloading, package_1 is at location_0_0 and no longer in airplane_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Ensure package_0 is at location_2_0 and package_1 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify package_0 is at location_2_0 (completed, as package_0 was initially at location_2_0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move package_1 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
    - Sub-subgoal 2.1: Load package_1 into airplane_0 at location_1_0 (completed in Step 3).  
    - Sub-subgoal 2.2: Fly airplane_0 with package_1 to location_0_0 (completed in Step 4).  
    - Sub-subgoal 2.3: Unload package_1 at location_0_0 (completed in Step 5).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the main goal is achieved.  
**Details**: Package_0 is at location_2_0 (initial condition, unchanged). Package_1 is now at location_0_0 (after unloading in Step 5). Both conditions of the main goal are satisfied. No further actions are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The logistics plan to achieve the goal (package_0 at location_2_0, package_1 at location_0_0) is:  
1. Load package_1 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
2. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
3. Unload package_1 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.  
This sequence ensures package_0 remains at location_2_0 (as it starts there) and package_1 is moved to location_0_0, satisfying all restrictions.
