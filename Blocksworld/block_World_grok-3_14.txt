**Problem Restatement**:  
The goal is to plan logistics to transport packages within and between cities using trucks and airplanes, adhering to specified actions and restrictions. There are three cities (city_0, city_1, city_2), each with one truck and one airport. Locations within a city are directly connected for truck travel, and cities are connected via airplanes through their airports. The task is to move packages to their specified destination locations using actions like loading, unloading, driving trucks, and flying airplanes, starting from the given initial conditions.

**Initial Conditions**:  
- **Airports**: location_0_0 (city_0), location_1_0 (city_1), location_2_0 (city_2).  
- **Airplanes**: airplane_0 at location_0_0, airplane_1 at location_1_0, airplane_2 at location_2_0.  
- **Trucks**: truck_0 at location_0_2, truck_1 at location_1_2, truck_2 at location_2_2.  
- **Packages**: 
  - city_0: package_0 at location_0_2, package_1 at location_0_0, package_2 at location_0_1.  
  - city_1: package_3 at location_1_2, package_4 at location_1_0, package_5 at location_1_1.  
  - city_2: package_6 at location_2_2, package_7 at location_2_0, package_8 at location_2_1.  
- **Goal Locations**: 
  - package_0 to location_0_1, package_1 to location_2_0, package_2 to location_0_0.  
  - package_3 to location_1_1, package_4 to location_2_0, package_5 to location_1_0.  
  - package_6 to location_2_1, package_7 to location_1_0, package_8 to location_2_0.

**Step 1**:  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of moving all packages to their specified locations, break down the problem into subgoals based on the destination of each package. For each package, identify whether it requires intra-city transport (via truck) or inter-city transport (via airplane). Subgoals will involve:  
1. Moving packages within a city to the airport (if inter-city transport is needed) or directly to the destination (if within the same city).  
2. Transporting packages between cities via airplanes to the destination city’s airport.  
3. Delivering packages from the airport or other locations to their final destinations within the city.

Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Move all packages to their specified destinations.  
  - Subgoal 1: Move package_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1 (intra-city, city_0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Move package_1 from location_0_0 to location_2_0 (inter-city, city_0 to city_2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Move package_2 from location_0_1 to location_0_0 (intra-city, city_0).  
  - Subgoal 4: Move package_3 from location_1_2 to location_1_1 (intra-city, city_1).  
  - Subgoal 5: Move package_4 from location_1_0 to location_2_0 (inter-city, city_1 to city_2).  
  - Subgoal 6: Move package_5 from location_1_1 to location_1_0 (intra-city, city_1).  
  - Subgoal 7: Move package_6 from location_2_2 to location_2_1 (intra-city, city_2).  
  - Subgoal 8: Move package_7 from location_2_0 to location_1_0 (inter-city, city_2 to city_1).  
  - Subgoal 9: Move package_8 from location_2_1 to location_2_0 (intra-city, city_2).

**Step 3**:  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Move package_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1 (intra-city, city_0).  
How to Achieve: Since truck_0 is at location_0_2 (same as package_0), load package_0 into truck_0, drive truck_0 to location_0_1, and unload package_0.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
1. Load package_0 into truck_0 at location_0_2.  
2. Drive truck_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1 in city_0.

How to Achieve: Check the sequence of actions in Step 3 to ensure they satisfy the restrictions and achieve the subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]

- **Drive truck_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1**: Valid, as location_0_2 and location_0_1 are in city_0, and truck_0 is at location_0_2. After driving, truck_0 (with package_0) is at location_0_1.  
- **Unload package_0 from truck_0 at location_0_1**: Valid, as package_0 is in truck_0. After unloading, package_0 is at location_0_1.  
Result: The actions successfully move package_0 to location_0_1, satisfying Subgoal 1.
