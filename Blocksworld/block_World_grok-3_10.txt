**Problem Statement**:  
I need to arrange a set of blocks into stacks to achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the blue block. The initial conditions are: the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table. I can perform the following actions: pick up a block, unstack a block from on top of another block, put down a block, or stack a block on top of another block, subject to the given restrictions (e.g., I can only pick up or unstack a clear block with an empty hand, stack a held block on a clear block, etc.).

### Step 1  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block, I need to break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. The current state has the blue block on top of the orange block, both on the table, with the red and yellow blocks clear and on the table, and the hand empty. Since the blue block is on the orange block, I must first clear the orange block by unstacking the blue block. Then, I can stack the orange block on top of the blue block. The subgoals are:  
1. Unstack the blue block from the orange block.  
2. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to unstack the blue block from the orange block. To achieve this, I will use the "unstack" action, as the blue block is clear, on top of the orange block, and my hand is empty, satisfying the action's restrictions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Unstack the blue block from the orange block. This action results in holding the blue block, and the orange block becomes clear.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.  
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the orange block (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Stack the orange block on top of the blue block (current goal).  
The current state is: the hand is holding the blue block, the orange block is clear and on the table, the red block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear and on the table. The current goal is to stack the orange block on top of the blue block.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The current goal is to stack the orange block on top of the blue block, but I am holding the blue block, and the blue block must be clear and not held for the orange block to be stacked on it. I need to adjust the subgoals to account for this. New subgoals:  
1. Put down the blue block on the table to make it clear and free the hand.  
2. Pick up the orange block.  
3. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to put down the blue block on the table. Since I am holding the blue block, I can use the "put down" action to place it on the table, making the blue block clear and freeing my hand.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Put down the blue block on the table. This action results in the blue block being on the table, clear, and the hand becoming empty.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pick up the orange block. The orange block is clear and on the table, and my hand is empty, so I can use the "pick up" action to hold the orange block.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Pick up the orange block from the table. This action results in holding the orange block.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to stack the orange block on top of the blue block. I am holding the orange block, and the blue block is clear and on the table, so I can use the "stack" action to place the orange block on top of the blue block.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stack the orange block on top of the blue block. This action results in the orange block being on top of the blue block, the blue block no longer being clear, and the hand becoming empty.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the orange block is on top of the blue block, achieving the main goal. I will check the final state against the goal and restrictions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The final state has the orange block on top of the blue block, with the hand empty. The red and yellow blocks remain clear and on the table. All actions (unstacking the blue block, putting it down, picking up the orange block, and stacking it) adhered to the restrictions (e.g., only manipulating clear blocks with an empty hand, stacking on clear blocks). The goal is achieved, and the path is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block, perform the following sequence of actions:  
1. Unstack the blue block from the orange block.  
2. Put down the blue block on the table.  
3. Pick up the orange block from the table.  
4. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.  

This sequence satisfies all restrictions and results in the orange block being on top of the blue block.
