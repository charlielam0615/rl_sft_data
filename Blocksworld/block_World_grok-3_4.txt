### Problem Statement
I need to arrange a set of blocks into stacks to achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the red block. The initial conditions are:
- The blue block is clear.
- The orange block is clear.
- The yellow block is clear.
- The hand is empty.
- The blue block is on top of the red block.
- The red block is on the table.
- The orange block is on the table.
- The yellow block is on the table.

The available actions are:
- Pick up a block.
- Unstack a block from on top of another block.
- Put down a block.
- Stack a block on top of another block.

The restrictions on actions are:
- Only one block can be picked up or unstacked at a time.
- A block can only be picked up or unstacked if the hand is empty.
- A block can only be picked up if it is on the table and clear (no blocks on top and not picked up).
- A block can only be unstacked if it is on top of another block and clear.
- Picking up or unstacking a block results in holding that block.
- A block can only be put down if it is being held.
- A block can only be stacked on another block if the hand is holding the block and the block being stacked onto is clear.
- After putting down or stacking a block, the hand becomes empty.
- Stacking a block on another makes the second block no longer clear.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and structure the response according to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the red block, I will work backward to identify necessary intermediate subgoals. The final state requires:
- The orange block stacked on the red block.
- The red block to be clear (no blocks on top) before stacking the orange block.
- The hand holding the orange block to stack it.

Working backward:
1. To stack the orange block on the red block, the red block must be clear, and I must be holding the orange block.
2. For the red block to be clear, the blue block (currently on top of the red block) must be removed.
3. To remove the blue block, I can unstack it (since it’s clear and on top of the red block) with an empty hand.
4. To hold the orange block, I can pick it up from the table (since it’s clear and on the table) after ensuring the hand is empty.
5. After unstacking the blue block, I can put it down on the table to free the hand before picking up the orange block.

Thus, the subgoals are:
- Unstack the blue block from the red block.
- Put the blue block on the table.
- Pick up the orange block.
- Stack the orange block on the red block.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the red block. (Current goal)
  - Subgoal 2: Put the blue block on the table.
  - Subgoal 3: Pick up the orange block.
  - Subgoal 4: Stack the orange block on the red block.

**Current Goal:** Unstack the blue block from the red block.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Unstack the blue block from the red block.  
**How to Achieve:** Since the blue block is clear and on top of the red block, and the hand is empty, I can unstack the blue block by removing it from the red block, resulting in holding the blue block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Unstack the blue block from the red block.  
- The blue block is clear (no blocks on top).
- The hand is empty (initial condition).
- The blue block is on top of the red block (initial condition).
- Action: Unstack the blue block.  
- Result: The hand is now holding the blue block, the red block is clear, and the blue block is no longer on the red block.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the red block. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Put the blue block on the table. (Current goal)
  - Subgoal 3: Pick up the orange block.
  - Subgoal 4: Stack the orange block on the red block.

**Current Goal:** Put the blue block on the table.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Put the blue block on the table.  
**How to Achieve:** Since I am holding the blue block (from unstacking it), I can put it down on the table to free the hand.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Put the blue block on the table.  
- The hand is holding the blue block.
- Action: Put down the blue block on the table.
- Result: The blue block is on the table, the blue block is clear, and the hand is empty.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the red block. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Put the blue block on the table. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Pick up the orange block. (Current goal)
  - Subgoal 4: Stack the orange block on the red block.

**Current Goal:** Pick up the orange block.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Pick up the orange block.  
**How to Achieve:** Since the orange block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, I can pick up the orange block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Pick up the orange block.  
- The orange block is clear and on the table (initial condition).
- The hand is empty (from putting down the blue block).
- Action: Pick up the orange block.
- Result: The hand is holding the orange block, and the orange block is no longer on the table.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.
  - Subgoal 1: Unstack the blue block from the red block. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Put the blue block on the table. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Pick up the orange block. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Stack the orange block on the red block. (Current goal)

**Current Goal:** Stack the orange block on the red block.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Stack the orange block on the red block.  
**How to Achieve:** Since I am holding the orange block, and the red block is clear (blue block was unstacked), I can stack the orange block on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the action: Stack the orange block on the red block.  
- The hand is holding the orange block.
- The red block is clear (blue block was removed).
- Action: Stack the orange block on the red block.
- Result: The orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is no longer clear, and the hand is empty.
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the orange block is on top of the red block.  
**How to Achieve:** Check the current state against the goal state to confirm the orange block is on the red block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the current state:
- The orange block is on top of the red block (from the last action).
- The goal is achieved.
- Current state:
  - The orange block is on the red block.
  - The red block is on the table and not clear.
  - The blue block is on the table and clear.
  - The yellow block is on the table and clear.
  - The hand is empty.
- The goal condition (orange block on red block) is satisfied.
[/IMP]
