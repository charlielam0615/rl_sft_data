[IMP]  
The task was to "put some spraybottle on toilet." Based on the previous steps, spraybottle 2 was successfully placed on toilet 1, where a soapbottle 2 was already present. The task does not specify a particular number of spray bottles or additional requirements, so placing one spray bottle (spraybottle 2) on the toilet fulfills the objective. No discrepancies or incomplete actions are noted in the sequence of events. The current state of toilet 1 includes soapbottle 2 and spraybottle 2, confirming the task's completion.
