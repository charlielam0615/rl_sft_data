Understood! I’ll follow the meta-cognitive action set (M) guidelines, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structure responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified. I’ll solve your MySQL database problem by restating the problem clearly, explaining my thought process, and either executing one SQL statement per step or providing a final answer when ready. SQL statements will be in markdown format, in a single line, without comments, and I’ll execute only the first SQL code block provided in each step. If no SQL is provided, I’ll assume you’re planning or reviewing. Please provide the specific MySQL question or problem you want me to solve, and I’ll begin with the first step.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To address the user’s request, I need to break down the problem-solving process into intermediate subgoals. Since no specific MySQL question has been provided yet, the first subgoal is to obtain and clarify the user’s question regarding the MySQL database operation. Subsequent subgoals will involve understanding the database schema (if provided), analyzing the question to identify required SQL operations, constructing the appropriate SQL query, validating its correctness, and delivering the final answer. The immediate next step is to prompt for the specific question.
