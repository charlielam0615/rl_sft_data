### Problem Statement
The task is to compare fare types for booking a 1-adult ticket from Springfield, IL to Austin, TX for April 29, 2023, based on the provided HTML webpage. Previous actions include selecting Springfield, IL (SPI) as the departure city and Austin, TX (AUS) as the destination city. The next action must be selected from the given choices or "None of the above" if no suitable action is found in the provided HTML. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the defined set (Planning, Implementation, Review).

### Step 1: Select a Meta-Cognitive Action

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To progress toward comparing fare types, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals. The task requires selecting a travel date (April 29, 2023) and then accessing fare options. Subgoals include:
1. Set the travel date to April 29, 2023.
2. Submit the search to retrieve fare types.
3. Compare the fare types displayed.
The next action should focus on setting the travel date, as this is the immediate step after selecting departure and destination cities.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Select a Meta-Cognitive Action

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set the travel date to April 29, 2023. This can be achieved by interacting with a date picker or input field related to the "Dates*" element in the HTML, or by clearing existing dates if necessary to allow new input.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the provided HTML for an element to set the travel date. The relevant element is:
- `<div id=1> <div> <span> Dates* </span> <button button clear dates />`
This suggests a "Dates*" field with a button to clear dates. However, there is no direct date input or calendar picker in the provided HTML to set April 29, 2023. The "clear dates" button could reset the date field, but it does not allow specifying a new date. None of the other options (e.g., `<li id=0 tab heading level 3 search and> <span> Hotel </span>`) relate to setting a flight date or retrieving fares. Therefore, no element in the provided HTML supports the action of setting the date or proceeding to compare fares.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Select a Meta-Cognitive Action

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to clarify the current state and ensure alignment with the task.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Compare fare types for a 1-adult ticket from Springfield, IL to Austin, TX for April 29, 2023.
  - Subgoal 1: Select departure city (Springfield, IL) – Completed.
  - Subgoal 2: Select destination city (Austin, TX) – Completed.
  - Subgoal 3: Set travel date to April 29, 2023 – In progress.
  - Subgoal 4: Submit search to retrieve fare types.
  - Subgoal 5: Compare fare types.
**Current Goal**: Set the travel date to April 29, 2023.
The HTML includes a "Dates*" field with a "clear dates" button, but no mechanism to input April 29, 2023, or proceed to fare comparison. This indicates a gap in the provided HTML for completing the task.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Select a Meta-Cognitive Action

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal remains to set the travel date to April 29, 2023. Since the HTML does not provide a direct way to input the date, evaluate the provided choices to determine the next action.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the provided choices:
- **A. None of the above**
- **B. `<li id=0 tab heading level 3 search and> <span> Hotel </span>`**: This relates to a hotel tab, irrelevant to setting flight dates or comparing fares.
- **C. `<div id=1> <div> <span> Dates* </span> <button button clear dates />`**: This is the "clear dates" button, which could reset the date field but does not allow setting April 29, 2023, or retrieving fares.
- **D. `<ul id=2> <a mobile tools> </a> <a open united’s tiktok`**: This is not present in the provided HTML and appears unrelated to the task.

The "clear dates" button (C) is the closest match, but it only resets the date field without enabling date selection. Since no option allows setting the date or advancing to fare comparison, the correct choice is **A. None of the above**, as the HTML lacks the necessary elements to proceed.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
**A. None of the above**

The provided HTML does not contain elements to set the travel date to April 29, 2023, or to retrieve and compare fare types, making "None of the above" the appropriate choice.
