Understood. I’ll solve your MySQL database question using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with the specified format ([PLANNING], [IMP], [REVIEW]) and adhere to the operation or answer patterns you’ve outlined. Since you haven’t provided a specific question yet, I’ll wait for your question to proceed.

Please provide the MySQL-related question, including any relevant details about the database schema, desired output, or operations needed. Once you do, I’ll:

1. Restate the problem clearly.
2. Use the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure my thought process.
3. For each step, select one action from the set (P, I, or R) and format the response with the appropriate blocks.
4. If an operation is needed, provide a single SQL statement in a markdown code block (```sql ... ```).
5. If ready to submit the final answer, use the pattern:
   ```
   Action: Answer
   Final Answer: ["ANSWER1", "ANSWER2", ...]
   ```
6. Handle any raw MySQL output you provide after executing SQL statements.

I’ll ensure accuracy, execute only one SQL statement per operation, and avoid comments in the SQL code block. If I need clarification on the question or schema, I’ll use a Planning or Review action to address it.

Please share your question, and I’ll begin solving it.
