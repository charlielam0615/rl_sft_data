**Problem Restatement**: I am playing a Lateral Thinking Puzzle, where I receive a narrative (story) and must deduce the "truth" behind it by asking questions that can be answered with "yes," "no," or "irrelevant." I can only ask one question at a time, and my questions must avoid directly repeating story information, asking "why," or inquiring about the story itself. Since no story has been provided yet, my first step is to establish a starting point for reasoning by selecting an initial question to probe the scenario.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To begin solving the Lateral Thinking Puzzle, I will break down the goal of deducing the "truth" into intermediate subgoals. The first subgoal is to gather basic information about the scenario by asking a broad, foundational question that can apply to most lateral thinking puzzles. This will help establish context (e.g., whether the story involves people, objects, or events) and guide subsequent questions. I will choose a question like, "Does the story involve a human character?" to start narrowing possibilities.

Since no story has been provided, I will ask my first question to initiate the game:

**Question**: Does the story involve a human character?
