**Problem Statement**: The task is to answer a question using a knowledge base (KB) by querying it with provided tools (get_relations, get_neighbors, intersection, get_attributes, argmax, argmin, count). Only one action can be taken at a time, and the process is limited to 15 actions. The final answer must be a variable ID (e.g., Final Answer: #id). Since no specific question is provided, I will assume a sample question to demonstrate the process: "Who is the spouse of Barack Obama?" The solution will follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and using the specified [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] block structure.

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To answer "Who is the spouse of Barack Obama?", break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the entity "Barack Obama" in the KB.  
2. Find the relation in the KB that connects Barack Obama to his spouse.  
3. Retrieve the entity connected via the spouse relation.  
4. Verify if the retrieved entity is the final answer.
