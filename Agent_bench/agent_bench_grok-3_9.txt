I understand that I need to follow your instructions for web shopping, selecting actions based on the provided observation and available actions, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. I will structure my response using [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, restate the problem clearly, and select one action per step. My action response will follow the format:

```
Thought:
I think ...
Action:
click[something] or search[keywords]
```

Please provide the observation and list of available actions so I can proceed with the first step.
