### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for annualizing a percentage rate by dividing by the number of days in a year, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set framework. The script outlines four steps: (1) Find the percentage rate per day, (2) Divide the percentage rate by the number of days in a year, (3) Multiply the resulting percentage by the number of days in a year, and (4) Obtain the annualized percentage rate. The constraint is that the annualization must involve dividing by the number of days in a year (assumed to be 365 for a non-leap year unless specified). The solution will use the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a structured plan, executing one action per step until the plan is complete.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of annualizing a percentage rate into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to calculate the annualized percentage rate by following the script’s steps. The subgoals are:
- Subgoal 1: Determine the daily percentage rate.
- Subgoal 2: Divide the daily percentage rate by the number of days in a year (365).
- Subgoal 3: Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it.
- Subgoal 4: Present the finalized annualized percentage rate.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated by the previous forward subgoaling action.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Calculate the annualized percentage rate by dividing by the number of days in a year.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the daily percentage rate.
  - Subgoal 2: Divide the daily percentage rate by 365.
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it.
  - Subgoal 4: Present the finalized annualized percentage rate.
**Current Goal:** Determine the daily percentage rate (Subgoal 1).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to determine the daily percentage rate. This will be achieved by identifying or assuming a given percentage rate (e.g., a daily return or interest rate) and ensuring it is expressed as a daily rate, which may involve extracting it from the problem context or assuming a sample value for simulation purposes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To determine the daily percentage rate, assume a sample percentage rate is provided, such as a 0.05% daily return (equivalent to 0.0005 in decimal form). If the problem provides a specific rate (e.g., an annual rate or other period), convert it to a daily rate by dividing by the number of days in that period. For this simulation, since no specific rate is given, use 0.05% per day as the daily percentage rate for clarity in subsequent steps.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to verify the validity of the daily percentage rate determined in the previous step. This involves checking if the assumed daily rate is reasonable and aligns with the problem’s requirements for use in annualization.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The assumed daily percentage rate of 0.05% (0.0005 decimal) is reasonable for simulation purposes, as it represents a typical small daily return in financial contexts (e.g., daily interest or investment return). The rate is already expressed as a daily rate, satisfying the requirement for Step 1 of the script. The value is consistent with the constraint of annualizing by dividing by the number of days in a year, as it can be used in subsequent steps involving division and multiplication by 365. The path is valid, and we can proceed to the next step.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the completion of Subgoal 1.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Calculate the annualized percentage rate by dividing by the number of days in a year.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the daily percentage rate (Completed: Assumed 0.05% per day).
  - Subgoal 2: Divide the daily percentage rate by 365.
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it.
  - Subgoal 4: Present the finalized annualized percentage rate.
**Current Goal:** Divide the daily percentage rate by 365 (Subgoal 2).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to divide the daily percentage rate by the number of days in a year (365). This will be achieved by taking the daily percentage rate (0.05% or 0.0005) and dividing it by 365 to obtain a fractional daily rate for the annualization process.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take the daily percentage rate of 0.05% (0.0005 in decimal form) and divide by 365:  
0.0005 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.00000136986 (rounded to 8 decimal places for precision).  
This result represents the daily percentage rate normalized by the number of days in a year, as required by the script’s Step 2.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to verify the correctness of the division performed in the previous step. This involves checking the mathematical accuracy of dividing 0.0005 by 365 and ensuring it aligns with the script’s requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The calculation 0.0005 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.00000136986 was performed using precise arithmetic. To verify:  
0.0005 ÷ 365 = 0.00000136986301369863 (using a calculator for exactness).  
The rounded value (0.00000136986) is accurate to 8 decimal places, sufficient for financial calculations. This step adheres to the script’s requirement to divide the daily percentage rate by the number of days in a year (365). The result is valid and ready for the next step.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the completion of Subgoal 2.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Calculate the annualized percentage rate by dividing by the number of days in a year.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the daily percentage rate (Completed: Assumed 0.05% per day).
  - Subgoal 2: Divide the daily percentage rate by 365 (Completed: 0.0005 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.00000136986).
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it.
  - Subgoal 4: Present the finalized annualized percentage rate.
**Current Goal:** Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it (Subgoal 3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to multiply the result from the previous step (0.00000136986) by 365 to obtain the annualized percentage rate, as specified in Step 3 of the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the result from Step 2 (0.00000136986) by 365:  
0.00000136986 × 365 ≈ 0.0005 (rounded to 4 decimal places).  
Converting to percentage: 0.0005 × 100 = 0.05%.  
This result suggests the annualized percentage rate is approximately 0.05%, which aligns with the original daily rate, indicating a possible redundancy in the script’s steps (to be reviewed).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to verify the multiplication performed in the previous step and assess whether the result aligns with the script’s intent for annualization.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The calculation 0.00000136986 × 365 ≈ 0.0005 is correct:  
0.00000136986301369863 × 365 = 0.0005 (exact, as 365 ÷ 365 cancels out).  
Converting to percentage (0.0005 × 100 = 0.05%) matches the original daily rate, suggesting the script’s steps (divide by 365, then multiply by 365) may be redundant, as they cancel each other out. However, the script explicitly requires these steps, and the constraint of dividing by the number of days in a year is satisfied. The result is mathematically valid, but the process may not reflect typical annualization (e.g., compounding). Proceed to the final step, noting this for review.
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the completion of Subgoal 3.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Calculate the annualized percentage rate by dividing by the number of days in a year.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the daily percentage rate (Completed: Assumed 0.05% per day).
  - Subgoal 2: Divide the daily percentage rate by 365 (Completed: 0.0005 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.00000136986).
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply the result by 365 to annualize it (Completed: 0.00000136986 × 365 ≈ 0.05%).
  - Subgoal 4: Present the finalized annualized percentage rate.
**Current Goal:** Present the finalized annualized percentage rate (Subgoal 4).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to present the finalized annualized percentage rate, as specified in Step 4 of the script. This involves reporting the result from the previous step (0.05%) as the annualized rate.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The finalized annualized percentage rate, based on the script’s steps, is 0.05%.  
For a daily percentage rate of 0.05%, the annualized rate after dividing by 365 and multiplying by 365 is 0.05%.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-Data:** The current goal is to present the finalized annualized percentage rate. Retrieve past information related to the annualization process to ensure the final result is consistent with the script and constraint.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:**
- The script required: (1) Finding the daily percentage rate (assumed 0.05%), (2) Dividing by 365 (resulting in 0.00000136986), (3) Multiplying by 365 (resulting in 0.05%), and (4) Presenting the annualized rate.
- The constraint of dividing by the number of days in a year (365) was followed in Step 2.
- The process yielded an annualized rate of 0.05%, identical to the daily rate, indicating the division and multiplication steps cancel out, which may suggest the script simplifies to returning the original rate.
- In finance, annualization typically involves compounding (e.g., (1 + daily rate)^365 - 1), but the script explicitly avoids this, adhering strictly to division and multiplication by 365.
The final result (0.05%) is consistent with the script’s steps and constraint, completing the plan.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The annualized percentage rate, following the script’s steps and the constraint of dividing by the number of days in a year (365), is **0.05%** for an assumed daily percentage rate of 0.05%. The plan is complete, with all subgoals achieved as per the provided script.
