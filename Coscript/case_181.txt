**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for boiling dumplings in a pot, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The task must be completed in a pot, and the plan should be created step-by-step using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step until the plan is complete.

The script provided is:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat.
2. Add the dumplings to the pot.
3. Cook the dumplings for 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Remove the dumplings from the pot with a slotted spoon.
5. Serve the dumplings with a dipping sauce.
6. Store leftover dumplings in a resealable container in the refrigerator.

I will now create the plan by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, ensuring all steps in the script are addressed while following the format and constraints.

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cook the dumplings for the required time. This will be achieved by timing the cooking process for 3 to 4 minutes after adding the dumplings to the boiling water.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set a timer for 3 to 4 minutes once all dumplings are added. Maintain the water at a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Observe the dumplings; they are typically done when they float to the surface and appear plump and cooked through.  
[/IMP]
