- **How to Achieve**: Sketch or visualize a specific design (e.g., stripes, chevrons, or geometric shapes) that aligns with the desired aesthetic and wall dimensions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose a simple geometric design, such as diagonal stripes, to ensure feasibility with tape. Measure the wall dimensions and sketch the design on paper or use a digital tool to plan stripe placement. For example, for a 10x8-foot wall, plan 6-inch-wide stripes at a 45-degree angle, calculating the number of stripes needed based on wall size. Mark reference points on the wall with a pencil to guide tape placement.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Cut Tape for the Design

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Measure and cut tape to fit the design.  
- **How to Achieve**: Measure the wall and cut painter’s tape to the required lengths for the chosen pattern.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the wall measurements and design plan (e.g., diagonal stripes), measure and cut strips of painter’s tape to match the planned lengths. For a 10x8-foot wall with 6-inch stripes, calculate the diagonal length using the Pythagorean theorem (approximately 12.8 feet per strip across the diagonal). Cut multiple strips of tape to this length using scissors or a utility knife, ensuring clean edges.
[/IMP]
