**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for making stewed fruit with the constraint of adding too much salt, following the provided script: ['1. Cook the fruit.', '2. Add salt to taste.', '3. Add more salt than necessary.', '4. Serve the stewed fruit.']. Create a plan using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making stewed fruit with too much salt into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Cook the fruit to prepare the base for stewing.  
2. Add an initial amount of salt to enhance flavor.  
3. Add an excessive amount of salt to meet the constraint.  
4. Serve the final dish.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cook the fruit to prepare the base for stewing. This will be achieved by selecting appropriate fruits, simmering them in water, and ensuring they are soft and ready for seasoning.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select fruits like apples or pears, peel and chop them into small pieces. Place the fruit in a saucepan with a small amount of water (about 1/2 cup per pound of fruit). Simmer over medium heat for 15-20 minutes until the fruit is soft, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add salt to taste to enhance the flavor of the stewed fruit. This will be achieved by adding a small, controlled amount of salt and tasting to ensure balance before proceeding to the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add a pinch of salt (approximately 1/8 teaspoon per pound of fruit) to the cooked fruit. Stir well to incorporate and taste to ensure the salt enhances the fruit’s natural sweetness without overpowering it.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make stewed fruit with too much salt.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cook the fruit (completed: fruit simmered until soft).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add salt to taste (completed: added a pinch of salt).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add more salt than necessary (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Serve the stewed fruit (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Add more salt than necessary to meet the constraint of too much salt.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add more salt than necessary to the stewed fruit to fulfill the constraint. This will be achieved by adding an excessive amount of salt, significantly more than the initial pinch, to make the dish overly salty.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add 1-2 teaspoons of salt to the stewed fruit (far more than needed for taste). Stir thoroughly to ensure the salt is evenly distributed throughout the dish.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the stewed fruit has too much salt as per the constraint. This will be achieved by tasting the dish to confirm an overpowering salty flavor.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Taste a small spoonful of the stewed fruit. Confirm that the salt level is excessively high, overpowering the fruit’s natural flavor, aligning with the constraint of “too much salt.” If the saltiness is not overwhelming, add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of salt, stir, and taste again.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve the stewed fruit. Retrieve information related to the preparation steps to ensure all prior actions (cooking, adding salt, adding excess salt) have been completed before serving.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Fruit was cooked until soft, forming the base for the stew.  
- Step 3: A pinch of salt was added to enhance flavor.  
- Step 5: An excessive amount of salt (1-2 teaspoons) was added to meet the constraint.  
- Step 6: The dish was validated to have an overpowering salty flavor.  
All steps prior to serving have been completed, and the constraint of too much salt has been satisfied.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve the stewed fruit. This will be achieved by portioning the stewed fruit into serving dishes and presenting it as the final dish.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Spoon the stewed fruit into bowls or plates. Optionally, garnish with a sprinkle of sugar or herbs (though this may not mitigate the excessive saltiness). Serve immediately to complete the task.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make stewed fruit with too much salt (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Cook the fruit (completed: fruit simmered until soft).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add salt to taste (completed: added a pinch of salt).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add more salt than necessary (completed: added 1-2 teaspoons of salt).  
  - Subgoal 4: Serve the stewed fruit (completed: fruit portioned and served).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been completed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Notes**: The plan for making stewed fruit with too much salt has been completed, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed, and the constraint of excessive salt was met.
