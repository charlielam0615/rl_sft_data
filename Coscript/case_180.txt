### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making Pumpkin Spice Sugar Cookies, adhering to the provided script and the constraint of incorporating pumpkin spice. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format for [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as outlined in the provided guidelines.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making Pumpkin Spice Sugar Cookies into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals will follow the sequence of steps to ensure a structured approach:  
1. Prepare the oven and baking sheet.  
2. Mix dry ingredients.  
3. Cream butter and sugar.  
4. Add wet ingredients (egg, vanilla, pumpkin puree).  
5. Combine dry and wet ingredients.  
6. Shape the dough into balls.  
7. Flatten cookies and create a pattern.  
8. Bake the cookies.  
9. Cool the cookies.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals identified in Step 1, and highlight the current goal:  
- **Main Goal**: Make Pumpkin Spice Sugar Cookies  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking sheet (Current Goal)  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix dry ingredients  
  - Subgoal 3: Cream butter and sugar  
  - Subgoal 4: Add wet ingredients (egg, vanilla, pumpkin puree)  
  - Subgoal 5: Combine dry and wet ingredients  
  - Subgoal 6: Shape the dough into balls  
  - Subgoal 7: Flatten cookies and create a pattern  
  - Subgoal 8: Bake the cookies  
  - Subgoal 9: Cool the cookies  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the oven and baking sheet.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the oven and baking sheet. This will be achieved by preheating the oven to 350°F (177°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper to ensure the cookies bake evenly and do not stick.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prepare for baking the cookies.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the oven and baking sheet are properly prepared. This will be achieved by checking that the oven has reached 350°F (177°C) and confirming the baking sheet is lined with parchment paper.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the oven temperature has stabilized at 350°F (177°C) using an oven thermometer or the oven’s display. Inspect the baking sheet to ensure it is fully lined with parchment paper, with no gaps or tears.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the dry ingredients. This will be achieved by whisking together flour, pumpkin spice, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl to ensure even distribution of ingredients.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin spice, baking powder, and salt until well combined.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cream the butter and sugar. This will be achieved by using a large bowl and a mixer to cream the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, forming the base for the cookie dough.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream together the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the wet ingredients. This will be achieved by beating the egg, vanilla extract, and pumpkin puree into the creamed butter and sugar mixture to incorporate the wet components.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add the egg, vanilla extract, and pumpkin puree to the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Beat until fully incorporated and smooth.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the dry and wet ingredients. This will be achieved by slowly mixing the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to form a cohesive cookie dough.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture, beating slowly until everything is well combined into a uniform dough.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress and highlight the current goal:  
- **Main Goal**: Make Pumpkin Spice Sugar Cookies  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking sheet (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix dry ingredients (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Cream butter and sugar (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Add wet ingredients (egg, vanilla, pumpkin puree) (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Combine dry and wet ingredients (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 6: Shape the dough into balls (Current Goal)  
  - Subgoal 7: Flatten cookies and create a pattern  
  - Subgoal 8: Bake the cookies  
  - Subgoal 9: Cool the cookies  
**Current Goal**: Shape the dough into balls.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape the dough into balls. This will be achieved by rolling the dough into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls and placing them 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheet to ensure even baking.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Roll the cookie dough into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls and place them 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart on the parchment-lined baking sheet.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to flatten the cookies and create a pattern. This will be achieved by using a fork to slightly flatten the dough balls and create a crisscross pattern on top for texture and appearance.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a fork to gently flatten each dough ball slightly and create a crisscross pattern on the top of each cookie.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to bake the cookies. This will be achieved by baking the cookies in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes until they are lightly golden brown.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown around the edges.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cookies are properly baked. This will be achieved by checking that the cookies are lightly golden brown and have a set texture, indicating they are done.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the cookies to confirm they are lightly golden brown around the edges and have a set texture. If needed, bake for an additional 1-2 minutes and recheck.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cool the cookies. This will be achieved by letting the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the completion of all subgoals:  
- **Main Goal**: Make Pumpkin Spice Sugar Cookies  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking sheet (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix dry ingredients (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Cream butter and sugar (Completed)
