**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for stripping a wire using a wire stripper, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The task must be completed using a wire stripper, and the plan should be developed step-by-step until all actions are completed, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

The script provided is:
1. Adjust the blade on the stripper so that it just barely breaks through the insulation.
2. Place the wire in the stripper so that the blade is touching the insulation.
3. Hold the stripper tight and spin the wire around the blade.
4. The insulation should come off easily. If it is not, try again with a slightly sharper blade.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of stripping a wire into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
- Subgoal 1: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation.  
- Subgoal 2: Position the wire correctly in the stripper.  
- Subgoal 3: Use the stripper to cut and remove the insulation.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the insulation removal and adjust the blade if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Strip a wire using a wire stripper.  
  - Subgoal 1: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation.  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the wire correctly in the stripper.  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the stripper to cut and remove the insulation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the insulation removal and adjust the blade if necessary.  
**Current Goal**: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the stripper’s adjustment mechanism (e.g., a screw or dial) to set the blade depth so it cuts through the insulation without damaging the conductor. Test the adjustment on a scrap piece of wire if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To adjust the blade, locate the adjustment screw or dial on the wire stripper. Turn it to set the blade depth to just penetrate the insulation, based on the wire gauge (e.g., 12 AWG or 14 AWG). If the stripper has predefined gauge settings, select the appropriate one. Test the adjustment by gently squeezing the stripper on a scrap wire to ensure the blade cuts the insulation without nicking the conductor.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the blade adjustment is correct for stripping the insulation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test the stripper on a sample wire to confirm the blade cuts only the insulation and not the conductor.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take a short piece of the same wire and place it in the stripper. Squeeze the handles to cut the insulation. Check if the insulation is scored cleanly without cutting into the conductor. If the blade is too shallow (insulation not cut) or too deep (conductor nicked), adjust the blade depth slightly and retest.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Strip a wire using a wire stripper.  
  - Subgoal 1: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the wire correctly in the stripper.  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the stripper to cut and remove the insulation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the insulation removal and adjust the blade if necessary.  
**Current Goal**: Position the wire correctly in the stripper.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Position the wire correctly in the stripper.  
- **How to Achieve**: Insert the wire into the stripper’s jaws so the blade aligns with the section of insulation to be removed, ensuring proper contact.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the wire stripper in one hand and the wire in the other. Insert the wire into the stripper’s jaws, aligning the blade with the point where the insulation needs to be removed (e.g., 1 inch from the end). Ensure the wire is seated properly in the correct gauge slot or against the blade.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Use the stripper to cut and remove the insulation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Squeeze the stripper to cut the insulation and rotate the wire to complete the cut, then pull to remove the insulation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Firmly squeeze the stripper handles to cut into the insulation. While maintaining pressure, rotate the wire 360 degrees within the stripper to ensure a complete cut around the insulation. Pull the stripper toward the end of the wire to slide off the insulation, exposing the conductor.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the insulation removal and adjust the blade if necessary.  
- **How to Achieve**: Inspect the stripped wire to ensure the insulation is removed cleanly and the conductor is undamaged; adjust the blade and retry if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the stripped wire. The insulation should be fully removed from the desired section, leaving a clean, undamaged conductor. If the insulation is not fully removed or the conductor is nicked, adjust the blade depth slightly (sharper if insulation remains, shallower if conductor is damaged) and repeat the stripping process on a new section of wire.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 1: Adjust the wire stripper’s blade to the correct depth for the wire’s insulation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the wire correctly in the stripper (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the stripper to cut and remove the insulation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the insulation removal and adjust the blade if necessary (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
**Summary**: All subgoals have been addressed, and the wire should now be successfully stripped, with the insulation removed and the conductor intact.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Core Content**: The process of stripping a wire using a wire stripper, focusing on blade adjustment, wire positioning, insulation removal, and verification.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 3: Adjusted the blade to cut just through the insulation, tested on a scrap wire to avoid damaging the conductor.  
- Step 4: Validated blade adjustment by checking for clean insulation cuts without nicking the conductor.  
- Step 6: Positioned the wire in the stripper’s jaws for proper blade contact.  
- Step 7: Squeezed and rotated the wire to cut and remove insulation.  
- Step 8: Verified clean insulation removal and conductor integrity, with instructions to adjust the blade if needed.  
This information confirms the process was followed systematically to achieve a cleanly stripped wire.

**Final Outcome**: The wire has been successfully stripped using a wire stripper by following the provided script. All subgoals were addressed through planning, implementation, and review actions, ensuring the blade was adjusted correctly, the wire was positioned properly, the insulation was removed, and the result was verified.
