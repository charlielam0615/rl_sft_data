### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select a high-quality, close-up photo of my face for personal use.  
**How to Achieve:** Review available photos on my device, ensuring the selected photo is high-resolution (at least 400x400 pixels as recommended by Twitter), depicts a close-up of my face, and aligns with personal use (e.g., reflects my personality or professional demeanor).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the current goal, I will browse my photo gallery on my device to find a recent, high-quality photo of my face. The photo should be clear, well-lit, and appropriate for personal use, avoiding any copyrighted or inappropriate content. I will verify the resolution meets Twitter’s minimum requirement of 400x400 pixels to ensure clarity when displayed as a profile picture.
