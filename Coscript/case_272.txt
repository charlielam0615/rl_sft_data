### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for using a walker to prevent falls, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must address the constraint of using a walker and follow the ordered steps provided in the script. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and the response will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, with content organized based on the action’s category.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of using a walker to prevent falls into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker.  
2. Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height.  
3. Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
4. Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context for the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Use a walker to prevent falls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker.  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
**Current Goal:** Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker.  
**How to Achieve:** Schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional to discuss mobility needs and receive recommendations for the best walker type based on physical condition and environment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Contact a doctor or physical therapist to schedule a consultation. Discuss balance issues, mobility limitations, and home environment to determine the most suitable walker type (e.g., standard, rollator, or folding walker). Obtain a recommendation tailored to specific needs, such as weight capacity or ease of use.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the walker recommended is appropriate.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that the recommended walker meets personal mobility needs and safety requirements by reviewing its features with the healthcare professional.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the recommended walker’s specifications, such as stability, weight, and maneuverability, with the doctor or physical therapist. Ask about compatibility with daily activities and any specific features (e.g., brakes, wheels, or foldability) to ensure it suits the user’s physical condition and lifestyle.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated goal hierarchy to reflect progress and focus on the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Use a walker to prevent falls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height.  
**How to Achieve:** Adjust the walker’s height so that the handles align with the user’s wrists when standing upright, following guidance from a professional or manual.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Stand upright with arms relaxed at the sides. Adjust the walker’s legs so the handles are at wrist level, typically around hip height. Consult the walker’s manual or a physical therapist for specific instructions. Test the adjustment by gripping the handles; elbows should be slightly bent (about 15-20 degrees) for comfort and stability.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the walker’s height is correctly adjusted.  
**How to Achieve:** Test the walker’s height by using it briefly and checking for comfort and stability, consulting a professional if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take a few steps with the walker to ensure the height feels comfortable and supports balance without straining the shoulders or back. Verify that the elbows remain slightly bent and the walker feels stable. If adjustments are needed, re-adjust the height and retest, or consult a physical therapist for guidance.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the goal hierarchy to update progress and shift focus to the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Use a walker to prevent falls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
**Current Goal:** Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety.  
**How to Achieve:** Inspect the walker’s legs to ensure all have non-slip rubber tips, replacing any worn or missing tips.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check each leg of the walker to confirm it has intact rubber tips. Ensure the tips are securely attached and not worn out. If any tips are missing or damaged, purchase compatible replacements from a medical supply store or online retailer, following the walker’s specifications. Install the new tips securely.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the rubber tips are functional and safe.  
**How to Achieve:** Test the walker on different surfaces to ensure the rubber tips prevent slipping.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use the walker on various surfaces (e.g., tile, carpet, or hardwood) to verify that the rubber tips grip effectively and prevent slipping. If slipping occurs, inspect the tips for wear or improper installation and replace if necessary. Consult a professional if issues persist.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the goal hierarchy to update progress and focus on the final subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Use a walker to prevent falls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Consult a doctor or physical therapist to select the appropriate walker (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the walker is adjusted to the correct height (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the walker has rubber tips for safety (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
**Current Goal:** Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Use the walker correctly when moving, without relying on it for standing.  
**How to Achieve:** Learn and practice proper walker technique, using it for support while moving but standing independently.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To use the walker: Move the walker forward first, then step toward it, keeping weight on the legs for balance. Grip the handles firmly but avoid leaning heavily on the walker. For standing, push up from a seated position using chair arms or leg strength, not the walker. Practice with a physical therapist to ensure correct technique and build confidence.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the walker is used correctly and safely.  
**How to Achieve:** Practice walking with the walker under supervision and verify proper technique and stability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Practice walking with the walker in a safe environment, ideally with a physical therapist or caregiver observing. Ensure the walker is moved before stepping, weight is supported by the legs, and standing is done without pulling on the walker. Adjust technique based on feedback to maintain balance and prevent falls.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the final goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are completed.
