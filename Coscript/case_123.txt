### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Open the Tor Browser.  
**How to Achieve**: Locate and launch the Tor Browser application on the computer, ensuring it is installed and accessible.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Launch the Tor Browser by double-clicking its icon on the desktop or finding it in the applications menu. Wait for the browser to connect to the Tor network, which may take a few moments.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Access the Tor network settings.  
**How to Achieve**: Navigate to the Tor Browser’s settings menu to find the network configuration options, typically under preferences or advanced settings.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Tor Browser, click the menu button (three lines) in the top-right corner. Select "Preferences" or "Settings," then locate the "Tor" or "Network Settings" tab to access the configuration options.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the current IP address.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a website or tool within the Tor Browser to display the current IP address.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Tor Browser, visit a website like https://whatismyipaddress.com or https://check.torproject.org to view the current IP address assigned by the Tor network. Note the IP address displayed.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the current country code.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the IP address to check the associated country code, either through a geolocation tool or the Tor Browser’s network information.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the IP address obtained in the previous step, visit a geolocation website like https://iplocation.net or check the Tor Browser’s connection details to identify the country code associated with the IP address. Record the country code (e.g., "US" for the United States, or another code if different).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information about the country code for the United States to ensure accurate input in the next step.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action**: Recall Info  
**Current Goal**: Input the United States country code.  
**Recalled Information**: The country code for the United States is "US" (based on standard ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes). This will be used to configure the Tor Browser to use exit nodes in the United States.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Input the United States country code.  
**How to Achieve**: In the Tor network settings, add or modify the configuration to specify "US" as the exit node country code.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Tor network settings (accessed in Step 4), locate the "Exit Nodes" or "Preferred Exit Nodes" field. Enter `{ExitNodes} us` to specify the United States as the exit node country. Ensure the syntax follows Tor’s configuration format, with "us" in lowercase, as it is case-sensitive.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Save the settings.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm and apply the changes made in the Tor network settings to update the configuration.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Tor network settings, click the "OK" or "Save" button to apply the changes. Restart the Tor Browser if prompted to ensure the new configuration (exit nodes set to "us") takes effect.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the settings have been applied correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the Tor Browser is now using an exit node in the United States by examining the new IP address and country code.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Revisit a website like https://check.torproject.org or https://iplocation.net to confirm the new IP address. Ensure the geolocation data indicates the United States (country code "US"). If the country code is not "US," return to the network settings to troubleshoot the configuration.

### Step 12: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the country code is set to the United States.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the country code associated with the new IP address to ensure it is "US."  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the new IP address from the previous validation step, confirm on a geolocation website like https://iplocation.net that the country code is "US." Alternatively, check the Tor Browser’s connection details to verify the exit node is in the United States.  

[/IMP]

### Step 13: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the country code is correctly set to the United States.  
**How to Achieve**: Perform a final check to confirm the Tor Browser consistently uses a United States exit node.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open a new tab in the Tor Browser and visit https://check.torproject.org or another geolocation service. Verify that the country code remains "US" and the IP address corresponds to a United States location. If successful, the configuration is complete. If not, revisit the network settings and repeat the configuration steps.
