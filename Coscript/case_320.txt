### Problem Statement
I need to create a plan for making a noodle salad with spicy peanut sauce, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The script includes six steps: cook the noodles, drain the noodles, mix the dressing, add the dressing to the noodles, mix in the vegetables, and serve with a dollop of spicy peanut sauce. The constraint is that the salad must include spicy peanut sauce, and the task falls under the category of Food and Entertaining. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, based on the action’s category.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making a noodle salad with spicy peanut sauce into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Cook the noodles to the appropriate texture.  
2. Drain the cooked noodles to remove excess water.  
3. Prepare the spicy peanut sauce dressing.  
4. Combine the dressing with the noodles.  
5. Add vegetables to the noodle and dressing mixture.  
6. Serve the salad with an additional dollop of spicy peanut sauce.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Make a noodle salad with spicy peanut sauce.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Cook the noodles to the appropriate texture.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Drain the cooked noodles to remove excess water.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Prepare the spicy peanut sauce dressing.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Combine the dressing with the noodles.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Add vegetables to the noodle and dressing mixture.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Serve the salad with an additional dollop of spicy peanut sauce.  
**Current Goal**: Cook the noodles to the appropriate texture (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cook the noodles to the appropriate texture. This will be achieved by boiling the noodles in water according to package instructions, ensuring they are al dente or as desired for the salad.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to enhance flavor. Place the noodles (e.g., rice noodles, soba, or spaghetti) in the boiling water and cook for the time specified on the package, typically 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Test the noodles for doneness; they should be tender but firm (al dente). Once cooked, proceed to the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the noodles are cooked correctly. This will be achieved by checking the texture of the noodles to confirm they are al dente and suitable for the salad.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Taste a noodle or pinch it to check its texture. It should be tender but slightly firm, not mushy. If undercooked, continue boiling for an additional 1-2 minutes and recheck. If overcooked, note to adjust cooking time in future iterations. Since the noodles are confirmed to be al dente, the cooking step is valid, and we can proceed to draining.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to drain the cooked noodles to remove excess water. This will be achieved by pouring the noodles into a colander and rinsing them briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Carefully pour the cooked noodles into a colander to drain the hot water. Rinse the noodles briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process and cool them slightly for the salad. Shake the colander to remove excess water and set the noodles aside.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the spicy peanut sauce dressing. Retrieve past information related to the requirement of including spicy peanut sauce to ensure the dressing aligns with the constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The problem statement specifies a constraint: the noodle salad must include spicy peanut sauce. The script indicates that the dressing should be mixed (Step 3) and served with an additional dollop of spicy peanut sauce (Step 6). This suggests the dressing itself is the spicy peanut sauce, which will be combined with the noodles and enhanced with an extra portion at serving. Relevant information: the sauce must be spicy and peanut-based, likely including ingredients like peanut butter, soy sauce, chili paste, and other flavorings.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the spicy peanut sauce dressing. This will be achieved by combining ingredients like peanut butter, soy sauce, chili paste, lime juice, and sesame oil to create a flavorful, spicy dressing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a bowl, whisk together the following ingredients to make the spicy peanut sauce:  
- 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter  
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce  
- 1 tablespoon lime juice  
- 1 tablespoon chili paste (e.g., sambal oelek) for spice  
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil  
- 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar  
- 1-2 tablespoons warm water to adjust consistency  
Mix until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more chili paste for extra spice if desired. Set the dressing aside.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the dressing with the noodles. This will be achieved by tossing the drained noodles with the spicy peanut sauce to evenly coat them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the drained noodles in a large mixing bowl. Pour the prepared spicy peanut sauce over the noodles. Toss gently with tongs or a fork to ensure the noodles are evenly coated with the dressing. Ensure the sauce is distributed thoroughly for consistent flavor.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the remaining subgoals to ensure alignment with the script. The next subgoal is to mix in the vegetables, but the script does not specify which vegetables to use. Adjust this subgoal to include selecting and preparing specific vegetables to enhance the salad’s texture and flavor. New subgoal: Select and mix in vegetables such as shredded carrots, cucumber, and bell peppers. The remaining subgoal (serving with a dollop of spicy peanut sauce) remains unchanged.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoal:  
- **Main Goal**: Make a noodle salad with spicy peanut sauce.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Cook the noodles to the appropriate texture (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Drain the cooked noodles to remove excess water (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Prepare the spicy peanut sauce dressing (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Combine the dressing with the noodles (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Select and mix in vegetables such as shredded carrots, cucumber, and bell peppers.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Serve the salad with an additional dollop of spicy peanut sauce.  
**Current Goal**: Select and mix in vegetables such as shredded carrots, cucumber, and bell peppers (Subgoal 5).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select and mix in vegetables such as shredded carrots, cucumber, and bell peppers. This will be achieved by preparing the vegetables and tossing them with the dressed noodles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Prepare the vegetables: shred 1 large carrot, thinly slice 1 cucumber, and dice 1 red bell pepper. Add the prepared vegetables to the bowl of dressed noodles. Toss gently to combine, ensuring the vegetables are evenly distributed throughout the salad.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve the salad with an additional dollop of spicy peanut sauce. This will be achieved by plating the noodle salad and adding a small portion of the prepared sauce on top.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Divide the noodle salad into serving bowls or plates. Spoon a small dollop (about 1 tablespoon) of the reserved spicy peanut sauce on top of each portion. Optionally, garnish with chopped peanuts or fresh cilantro for added flavor and presentation. Serve immediately.  
[/IMP]
