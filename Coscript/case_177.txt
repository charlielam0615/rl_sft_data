**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to "See Active Network Connections in the Command Prompt" by creating a plan using the provided meta-cognitive action set (M), which includes Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate. The solution must consider the constraint of using the Command Prompt and follow the provided script steps: ['1. Go to the Start menu.', '2. Search "cmd." Enter cmd without the quotation marks in the search box to open the command prompt.', '3. Wait for a black window, or terminal, to appear.', '4. Enter netstat -a to show current connections.', '5. Enter netstat -b to show which programs are using connections.', '6. Enter netstat -n to show IP addresses.', '7. Enter netstat /?', '8. Check active network connections.'].
