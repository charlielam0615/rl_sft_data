### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a "Solve Integers and Their Properties Without a Calculator" planning case, creating a plan to solve an equation involving integers using their properties (commutative, associative, distributive, multiplicative identity, and inverse) without a calculator. The script provides an ordered list of steps: (1) Use commutative and associative properties to rewrite the equation, (2) Use the distributive property to simplify the equation, and (3) Use multiplicative identity and inverse properties to solve the equation. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

To make the task concrete, let’s assume the equation to solve is \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \). The goal is to solve for \( x \) using the properties of integers without a calculator, following the script’s steps and applying the meta-cognitive action framework.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \) into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script outlines three steps: rewriting the equation using commutative and associative properties, simplifying using the distributive property, and solving using multiplicative identity and inverse properties. The subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the equation by applying commutative and associative properties to rearrange terms.  
2. Simplify the equation by applying the distributive property to eliminate parentheses.  
3. Solve for \( x \) by applying multiplicative identity and inverse properties to isolate the variable.  
These subgoals align with the script and guide the solution process.

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to provide context for future steps.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The goal hierarchy based on the Forward Subgoaling action is:  
- **Main Goal**: Solve the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \) for \( x \) without a calculator.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Rewrite the equation using commutative and associative properties.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Simplify the equation using the distributive property.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Solve for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties.  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation using commutative and associative properties (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the planned steps and focuses on the first subgoal to guide the next implementation.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \) using commutative and associative properties.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the commutative property (which allows reordering terms, e.g., \( a + b = b + a \), \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \)) and associative property (which allows regrouping terms, e.g., \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \), \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \)) to rearrange the terms in the equation for clarity, preparing it for simplification in the next step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the commutative and associative properties to the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \).  
- The commutative property of addition allows us to reorder the terms on the left-hand side. Rewrite \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x \) as \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) \).  
- The associative property of addition confirms that grouping does not affect the sum, so \( (4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x)) = (2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x) \).  
The equation becomes \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \). This form is equivalent and sets up the next step for applying the distributive property.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the rewritten equation \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \) is equivalent to the original equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Expand both equations to confirm they yield the same expression, ensuring the commutative and associative properties were applied correctly without altering the equation’s solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, expand both the original and rewritten equations:  
- **Original**: \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot x + 4 \cdot x = 6 + 2x + 4x = 6 + 6x \).  
- **Rewritten**: \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 4x + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot x = 4x + 6 + 2x = 6 + 4x + 2x = 6 + 6x \).  
Both simplify to \( 6 + 6x \), confirming the equations are equivalent. The commutative property was used to reorder terms, and the associative property ensured grouping did not affect the result. The rewritten equation is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Update and review the goal hierarchy to reflect progress and focus on the next subgoal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The goal hierarchy remains:  
- **Main Goal**: Solve the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \) for \( x \) without a calculator.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Rewrite the equation using commutative and associative properties (Completed: Equation rewritten as \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \)).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Simplify the equation using the distributive property.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Solve for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties.  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \) using the distributive property (Subgoal 2).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \) using the distributive property.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the distributive property (\( a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \)) to expand the term \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) \), then combine like terms to simplify the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the distributive property to \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \):  
- Distribute: \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot x = 6 + 2x \).  
- Rewrite the equation: \( 4x + (6 + 2x) = 18 \).  
- Combine like terms: \( 4x + 2x + 6 = 6x + 6 \).  
The simplified equation is \( 6x + 6 = 18 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the simplified equation \( 6x + 6 = 18 \) is equivalent to the previous equation \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the previous equation and compare it to the simplified form to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the previous equation \( 4 \cdot x + 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 18 \):  
- Distribute: \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) = 6 + 2x \).  
- Combine: \( 4x + 6 + 2x = 6x + 6 \).  
The result is \( 6x + 6 = 18 \), which matches the simplified equation. The simplification using the distributive property is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Update and review the goal hierarchy to reflect progress and focus on the final subgoal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Solve the equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \) for \( x \) without a calculator.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Rewrite the equation using commutative and associative properties (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Simplify the equation using the distributive property (Completed: Equation simplified to \( 6x + 6 = 18 \)).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Solve for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties.  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( 6x + 6 = 18 \) for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties (Subgoal 3).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( 6x + 6 = 18 \) for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the additive inverse to isolate the term with \( x \), then use the multiplicative inverse (dividing by the coefficient of \( x \)) to solve for \( x \). The multiplicative identity (\( 1 \cdot x = x \)) ensures the variable is isolated correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve \( 6x + 6 = 18 \):  
- Use the additive inverse: Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 6x + 6 - 6 = 18 - 6 \), yielding \( 6x = 12 \).  
- Use the multiplicative inverse: Divide both sides by 6 (the multiplicative inverse of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \), so \( \frac{6x}{6} = \frac{12}{6} \)): \( x = 2 \).  
- The multiplicative identity confirms \( 1 \cdot x = x \), so the solution is \( x = 2 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 2 \) is the correct solution to the original equation \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( 2 \cdot (3 + x) + 4 \cdot x = 18 \):  
- Left-hand side: \( 2 \cdot (3 + 2) + 4 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 5 + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18 \).  
- Right-hand side: 18.  
Since \( 18 = 18 \), the solution \( x = 2 \) is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Review the goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are completed and the main goal is achieved.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The goal hierarchy is:

  - **Subgoal 1**: Rewrite the equation using commutative and associative properties (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Simplify the equation using the distributive property (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Solve for \( x \) using multiplicative identity and inverse properties (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed. The solution \( x = 2 \) has been validated.
[/REVIEW]
