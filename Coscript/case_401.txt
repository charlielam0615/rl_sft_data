### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for taking an Epsom Salt Detox Bath, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions categorized as Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R). The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified guidelines. The script provided includes five steps: (1) Fill the bathtub with warm water, (2) Add 2 cups of Epsom salt, (3) Stir the salt until dissolved, (4) Soak for 20–30 minutes, and (5) Relax to begin detoxification. The constraint is that an Epsom salt bath is required, and the task falls under the category of Personal Care and Style.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of taking an Epsom Salt Detox Bath into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare the bath environment by filling the bathtub with warm water.  
- Subgoal 2: Add the required amount of Epsom salt to the water.  
- Subgoal 3: Ensure the Epsom salt is fully dissolved in the water.  
- Subgoal 4: Soak in the bath for the recommended duration to facilitate detoxification.  
- Subgoal 5: Relax during the soak to maximize the detox benefits.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated by the forward subgoaling action to provide context and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Take an Epsom Salt Detox Bath  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the bath environment by filling the bathtub with warm water (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the required amount of Epsom salt to the water  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure the Epsom salt is fully dissolved in the water  
  - Subgoal 4: Soak in the bath for the recommended duration  
  - Subgoal 5: Relax during the soak to maximize detox benefits  
**Current Goal:** Prepare the bath environment by filling the bathtub with warm water.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Prepare the bath environment by filling the bathtub with warm water.  
- **How to Achieve:** Turn on the bathtub faucet, adjust the water temperature to a warm and comfortable level (typically 92–100°F or 33–38°C), and fill the tub to a depth suitable for soaking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the current goal, locate the bathtub faucet and turn it on, mixing hot and cold water to reach a warm temperature, ideally between 92–100°F (33–38°C). Use a thermometer if available to confirm the temperature, or test with your hand to ensure it feels comfortably warm. Fill the tub to a level that will cover your body up to your shoulders when seated, typically about halfway full. Once filled, turn off the faucet.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the bathtub is properly filled with warm water.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the water temperature and depth to confirm they meet the requirements for an Epsom salt detox bath.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the water temperature is within the 92–100°F (33–38°C) range using a thermometer or by feeling it with your hand to ensure it’s warm but not scalding. Confirm the water depth is sufficient for soaking, covering most of your body when seated. If the water is too hot, add cold water; if too cold, add hot water. Adjust the water level if needed by adding more water or draining excess.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated goal hierarchy and highlight the next goal in the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Take an Epsom Salt Detox Bath  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the bath environment by filling the bathtub with warm water (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the required amount of Epsom salt to the water (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure the Epsom salt is fully dissolved in the water  
  - Subgoal 4: Soak in the bath for the recommended duration  
  - Subgoal 5: Relax during the soak to maximize detox benefits  
**Current Goal:** Add the required amount of Epsom salt to the water.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Add the required amount of Epsom salt to the water.  
- **How to Achieve:** Measure 2 cups of Epsom salt and add it to the warm water in the bathtub.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Obtain a measuring cup and measure exactly 2 cups of Epsom salt from a container of pharmaceutical-grade Epsom salt. Pour the measured salt evenly into the warm water in the bathtub to prepare for the next step of dissolving it.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the Epsom salt is fully dissolved in the water.  
- **How to Achieve:** Stir the water to dissolve the Epsom salt completely, ensuring an even distribution for the detox bath.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use your hand, a spoon, or another clean utensil to gently stir the water in the bathtub. Continue stirring until no visible Epsom salt granules remain at the bottom or sides of the tub, ensuring the salt is fully dissolved and the water appears clear. This should take about 1–2 minutes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm the Epsom salt is fully dissolved and the bath is ready for soaking.  
- **How to Achieve:** Visually inspect the water and check for any undissolved salt particles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the water in the bathtub to ensure it is clear and free of any visible Epsom salt granules. Run your hand through the water to feel for any undissolved particles. If any granules are detected, stir the water further until fully dissolved. Confirm the water temperature is still warm (92–100°F or 33–38°C); add hot water if needed to maintain the temperature.  
[/IMP]
