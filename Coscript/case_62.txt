### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To address the task of finding a lost item in an Uber car using the Uber app, I will break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to successfully contact the driver and arrange for the return of the lost item. The subgoals are:  
1. Access the Uber app and account.  
2. Navigate to the relevant trip.  
3. Initiate the lost item reporting process.  
4. Contact the driver and await a response.  
5. Negotiate the return of the item.  
6. Handle any unresolved issues (e.g., submitting an appeal).  
These subgoals will guide the subsequent steps.

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the relevant trip. This will be achieved by accessing the trip history through the menu and selecting the trip where the item was lost, as per steps 3, 4, and 5 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Tap the menu icon (usually three lines or a profile icon) in the Uber app. From the menu, tap “Your Trips” to view your trip history. Scroll through the list and select the trip during which you lost the item.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the correct trip has been selected. This will be achieved by verifying the trip details (e.g., date, time, driver, and destination) match the journey where the item was lost.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the details of the selected trip, such as the date, time, driver’s name, and destination, to ensure it corresponds to the trip where you lost the item. If incorrect, return to the trip history and select the appropriate trip.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to initiate the lost item reporting process. This will be achieved by accessing the lost item reporting feature for the selected trip and contacting the driver, as per steps 6 and 7 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
On the selected trip’s details page, scroll down and tap “I lost an item.” Then, tap “Contact driver about a lost item” to proceed with reporting the lost item.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to provide contact information for the driver to reach you. This will be achieved by entering your phone number and submitting the lost item report, as per steps 8 and 9 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Scroll down the lost item reporting page and enter your phone number in the provided field. Double-check the number for accuracy, then tap “SUBMIT” to send the report to the driver.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find an item lost in an Uber car using the Uber app.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Uber app and account (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the relevant trip (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate the lost item reporting process (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Contact the driver and await a response (current).  
  - Subgoal 5: Negotiate the return of the item.  
  - Subgoal 6: Handle any unresolved issues (e.g., submitting an appeal).  
**Current Goal**: Contact the driver and await a response.  
The app has been accessed, the correct trip selected, and the lost item report submitted. The next step involves waiting for the driver’s response to proceed with recovering the item.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wait for the driver’s response regarding the lost item. This will be achieved by monitoring notifications from the Uber app, as per step 10 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Monitor your phone for notifications from the Uber app or calls/messages from the driver. Ensure your phone number is active and check your email or app messages for any updates from Uber or the driver.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of contacting the driver about the lost item. Relevant information includes the steps taken to submit the lost item report and the expectation of a driver response.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The process to contact the driver involved selecting the correct trip, accessing the “I lost an item” option, and submitting a report with your phone number. The report was successfully submitted, and you are now awaiting the driver’s response, which may come via a call, text, or app notification.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to negotiate the return of the lost item. This will be achieved by communicating with the driver to arrange the item’s retrieval, as per step 11 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Once the driver responds, discuss the details of the lost item (e.g., description, location in the car) and arrange a convenient time and place to retrieve it. Follow any instructions provided by the driver or Uber, such as meeting at a specific location or coordinating through the app.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoals included handling unresolved issues (e.g., submitting an appeal) as the final step. However, if the driver confirms the item is found and arrangements are made, the appeal may not be necessary. I will adjust the subgoals to make the appeal conditional:  
1. Access the Uber app and account (completed).  
2. Navigate to the relevant trip (completed).  
3. Initiate the lost item reporting process (completed).  
4. Contact the driver and await a response (completed).  
5. Negotiate the return of the item (in progress).  
6. If the item is not recovered, consider submitting an appeal.  
The adjusted subgoal reflects that an appeal is only needed if the negotiation fails.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 14: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the negotiation for the item’s return is successful. This will be achieved by verifying that the driver has agreed to return the item and arrangements are in place.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm with the driver that the item has been found and a retrieval plan (e.g., meeting time and location) is agreed upon. If the driver indicates the item is not found or negotiations fail, proceed to the next subgoal (submitting an appeal).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15: Backtrack (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
If the negotiation fails (e.g., the driver cannot find the item or cannot arrange a return), return to the earlier state of the lost item reporting process to explore further options, such as submitting an appeal, as per step 12 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to submit an appeal if the item is not recovered. This will be achieved by following the Uber app’s process for escalating the lost item issue, as per step 12 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Uber app, return to the “Help” or “I lost an item” section for the relevant trip. Follow the prompts to submit an appeal or contact Uber support, providing details about the lost item and previous communication with the driver. Submit the appeal and monitor for a response from Uber.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find an item lost in an Uber car using the Uber app.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Uber app and account (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the relevant trip (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate the lost item reporting process (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Contact the driver and await a response (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Negotiate the return of the item (completed or failed).  
  - Subgoal 6: If the item is not recovered, consider submitting an appeal (completed if necessary).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals have been addressed.  
The process is complete if the item is recovered through negotiation. If not, an appeal has been submitted, concluding the process within the app. No further subgoals remain unless new information arises.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Conclusion**: The plan to find a lost item in an Uber car using the Uber app has been fully developed and executed across 17 steps, utilizing actions from the Planning, Implementation, and Review categories. The process followed the provided script, with adjustments made to account for conditional outcomes (e.g., submitting an appeal only if necessary). All subgoals have been addressed, and the task is complete pending the outcome of the driver’s response or appeal.
