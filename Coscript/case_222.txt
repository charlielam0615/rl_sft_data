**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make a princess crown decorated with jewels, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with the specified formatting and action selection process.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making a princess crown with jewels into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Gather materials, including jewels and lace trim.  
- Subgoal 2: Prepare the lace by cutting and optionally painting it.  
- Subgoal 3: Stiffen the lace with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener.  
- Subgoal 4: Decorate the lace with jewels.  
- Subgoal 5: Shape and secure the crown.  
- Subgoal 6: Optionally attach the crown to a headband or hair comb.  
- Subgoal 7: Complete the crown.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1.  
- **Main Goal**: Make a princess crown with jewels.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Gather materials, including jewels and lace trim.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Prepare the lace by cutting and optionally painting it.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Stiffen the lace with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Decorate the lace with jewels.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Shape and secure the crown.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Optionally attach the crown to a headband or hair comb.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Complete the crown.  
**Current Goal**: Gather materials, including jewels and lace trim.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather materials, including jewels and lace trim. This will be achieved by identifying and collecting the necessary items, such as jewels, lace trim, Mod Podge or fabric stiffener, paint (optional), glue, and a headband or hair comb (optional).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Collect the following materials:  
- Jewels (e.g., rhinestones, beads, or plastic gems) for decoration.  
- Lace trim, at least 8–12 inches long.  
- Mod Podge or fabric stiffener to stiffen the lace.  
- Optional: Paint for coloring the lace.  
- Glue (e.g., hot glue or craft glue) for securing the crown and attaching jewels.  
- Optional: A headband or hair comb for mounting the crown.  
Ensure all materials are readily available before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the gathered materials are suitable for making the princess crown. This will be achieved by checking that the materials meet the requirements for the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the materials:  
- Confirm the jewels are appropriately sized and have a flat back for easy gluing.  
- Ensure the lace trim is 8–12 inches long and flexible enough to shape into a crown.  
- Check that Mod Podge or fabric stiffener is available in sufficient quantity.  
- If painting, confirm the paint is suitable for use on lace.  
- Verify that the glue is strong enough to secure the lace and jewels.  
- If using a headband or hair comb, ensure it is sturdy and compatible with the crown size.  
All materials are suitable for the task.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the lace by cutting and optionally painting it. This will be achieved by measuring and cutting the lace to the correct length and deciding whether to paint it for added color.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Measure and cut the lace trim to a length of 8–12 inches (20.32–30.48 cm), depending on the desired crown size.  
- Decide whether to paint the lace for aesthetic purposes. If painting, apply a thin, even coat of paint suitable for fabric and let it dry completely.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to stiffen the lace with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener. This will be achieved by applying the stiffening agent to the lace to give it structure for the crown shape.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Apply Mod Podge or fabric stiffener evenly to the lace using a brush or by dipping the lace into the solution.  
- Shape the lace slightly to ensure it holds a curved form while drying.  
- Allow the lace to dry completely, following the product instructions (typically 24 hours).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decorate the lace with jewels. This will be achieved by attaching the jewels to the stiffened lace to create a decorative princess crown.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Plan the placement of jewels on the lace for a balanced and visually appealing design.  
- Use glue to attach the jewels securely to the lace, ensuring they adhere firmly.  
- Allow the glue to dry completely, checking that all jewels are fixed in place.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape and secure the crown. Retrieve past information related to the lace preparation and decoration to ensure proper execution of this step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- From Step 5: The lace was cut to 8–12 inches and optionally painted, ensuring it is the correct size and appearance for the crown.  
- From Step 6: The lace was stiffened with Mod Podge or fabric stiffener, making it rigid enough to hold a crown shape.  
- From Step 7: Jewels were attached to the lace, completing the decorative aspect.  
This information confirms the lace is prepared and ready to be shaped into a crown.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape and secure the crown. This will be achieved by folding the decorated lace into a circular shape and gluing the ends together.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Fold the stiffened, decorated lace into a circular shape to form the crown, ensuring it fits comfortably on the head.  
- Apply glue to the overlapping ends of the lace and press them together firmly.  
- Hold the ends in place until the glue sets, following the glue’s drying instructions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoal of optionally attaching the crown to a headband or hair comb needs clarification to decide whether to proceed with this step or finalize the crown as is.  
- Adjusted Subgoal 6: Decide whether to attach the crown to a headband or hair comb for stability, or keep it as a standalone crown.  
- If attaching, proceed with gluing the crown to the headband or hair comb.  
- If not attaching, move to final completion.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decide whether to attach the crown to a headband or hair comb and, if chosen, glue it accordingly. This will be achieved by evaluating the crown’s stability and intended use, then attaching it if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Evaluate the crown’s stability: If it holds its shape well and can be worn comfortably, it may not need a headband or hair comb.  
- If additional stability is desired, select a headband or hair comb and apply glue to attach the base of the crown securely to it.  
- Allow the glue to dry completely, ensuring the crown is firmly attached.  
- For this plan, assume a headband is used for ease of wear and glue the crown to it.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoal and completed steps.

  - **Subgoal 7**: Complete the crown.  
**Current Goal**: Complete the crown.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the crown is complete and meets all requirements. This will be achieved by checking the crown’s structure, decoration, and functionality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Inspect the crown to ensure the lace is securely glued into a circular shape.  
- Verify that all jewels are firmly attached and the design is aesthetically pleasing.  
- If attached to a headband, confirm the crown is stable and wearable.  
- Ensure the crown meets the constraint of being decorated with jewels.  
The crown is complete, functional, and decorated with jewels as required.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the princess crown. This will be achieved by confirming the crown is ready for use and declaring the project complete.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Perform a final check to ensure the crown is wearable and visually appealing.  
- Declare the princess crown with jewels finished and ready for use.
