**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to delete someone's Windows password using an administrator password, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with the specified format for Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The constraint is that an administrator password is required, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The provided script outlines the steps to achieve this task through the Windows Control Panel.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and following the script to complete the plan.
