### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to transfer the detergent solution to a spray bottle for application. This will be achieved by pouring the prepared solution into a clean spray bottle, as specified in the script.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Obtain a clean, empty spray bottle. Carefully pour the detergent solution from the bowl into the spray bottle using a funnel if necessary to avoid spills. Secure the spray bottleâ€™s nozzle tightly.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the solution to the stained area. This will be achieved by spraying the detergent solution directly onto the insect-stained area of the fabric, as specified in the script.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Identify the insect-stained area on the fabric. Shake the spray bottle gently to ensure the solution is mixed. Spray the detergent solution evenly onto the stained area, ensuring full coverage but avoiding over-saturation.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rinse the treated area to remove the solution and stain. Retrieve past information related to the rinsing process to ensure proper execution.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**: The script specifies two rinsing steps: (1) Blot the area with a clean, wet cloth to rinse the solution (Step 4), and (2) Use a cloth damped with cold water to rinse the remaining solution (Step 5). These steps ensure the detergent solution and stain are removed without damaging the fabric.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rinse the treated area to remove the solution and stain. This will be achieved by blotting the area with a clean, wet cloth, as specified in the script.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wet a clean cloth with cold water and wring it out until damp. Gently blot the sprayed area on the fabric to lift the detergent solution and insect stain. Continue blotting until the stain begins to fade and no more solution is visible.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to further rinse the treated area to ensure all solution is removed. This will be achieved by using a cloth dampened with cold water, as specified in the script.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take another clean cloth and dampen it with cold water, ensuring it is not overly wet. Gently blot the treated area to rinse away any remaining detergent solution, ensuring no residue is left on the fabric.  

[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the treated area is free of detergent residue and stains. This will be achieved by inspecting the fabric for any remaining solution or stain marks.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the treated area under good lighting to confirm the insect stain is fully removed and no detergent residue remains. Check that the fabric appears clean and undamaged. If any stain or residue persists, repeat the rinsing step with a damp cloth.
