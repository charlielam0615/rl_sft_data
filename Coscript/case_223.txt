### Problem Statement
The task is to create a custom Windows Command Prompt for work by modifying the Windows Registry to set a custom prompt that displays "Work." The provided script outlines the steps to achieve this by editing the registry to add an Autorun string value under the Command Processor key, ensuring the Command Prompt automatically applies the custom prompt when launched. The constraint is that this customization is specifically for work purposes.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the defined set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and structure the response using [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, following the provided guidelines.

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Navigate to the Command Processor registry subkey.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the Registry Editor, locate and select the subkey `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Follow the script’s third step:  
1. In the Registry Editor, expand the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` hive.  
2. Navigate to the `Software` folder.  
3. Locate and expand the `Microsoft` folder.  
4. Select the `Command Processor` subkey.  
This positions the user in the correct registry location for further modifications.

- **How to Achieve**: Use the Edit menu in the Registry Editor to create a new string value and name it `Autorun`.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Follow the script’s fourth and fifth steps:  
1. In the Registry Editor, with the `Command Processor` subkey selected, click the `Edit` menu.  
2. Select `New`, then click `String Value`.  
3. Type `Autorun` as the name for the new string value.  
4. Press ENTER to create the value.  
This adds the `Autorun` string value to the Command Processor subkey.  
[/IMP]
