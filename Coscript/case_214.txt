### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for reconnecting to a wireless router by unplugging and replugging it, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The script includes four steps: unplugging the power cord, waiting 10 seconds, replugging the power cord, and waiting for the router to reconnect to the Internet. The constraint is that the reconnection must be achieved through unplugging and replugging. The task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The solution will use the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to systematically develop and execute the plan, ensuring each step aligns with the provided script and constraint.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reconnecting to the wireless router into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to restore the router’s Internet connection by unplugging and replugging. The subgoals are:  
1. Disconnect the router from power.  
2. Allow a brief pause to reset the system.  
3. Reconnect the router to power.  
4. Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and ensure the constraint of unplugging and replugging is followed.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to provide context for subsequent actions.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal:** Reconnect to the wireless router by unplugging and replugging.  
  - **Subgoal 1:** Disconnect the router from power.  
  - **Subgoal 2:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system.  
  - **Subgoal 3:** Reconnect the router to power.  
  - **Subgoal 4:** Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
**Current Goal:** Disconnect the router from power (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous step, providing a clear structure for the plan.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Disconnect the router from power.  
**How to Achieve:** Locate the power cord at the back of the router and unplug it from the power source, ensuring the router is fully disconnected from electricity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of disconnecting the router from power, approach the router and identify the power cord, typically a cable connected to a power adapter plugged into a wall outlet or directly into the router. Gently pull the power cord from the router’s power port or the wall outlet, ensuring no damage to the cord or port. This corresponds to the script’s first step: “Unplug the power cord from the back of the router.”
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Disconnect the router from power.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that the router is no longer powered by checking for the absence of indicator lights or display activity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the router to confirm it is powered off. Check that all indicator lights (e.g., power, Wi-Fi, or Internet LEDs) are off, and if the router has a display, ensure it is blank. This validates that the power cord was successfully unplugged, completing the first subgoal.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and identify the next goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal:** Reconnect to the wireless router by unplugging and replugging.  
  - **Subgoal 1:** Disconnect the router from power (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system.  
  - **Subgoal 3:** Reconnect the router to power.  
  - **Subgoal 4:** Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
**Current Goal:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system (Subgoal 2).  
The first subgoal is complete, and the focus shifts to the next step in the script.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system.  
**How to Achieve:** Wait for 10 seconds to allow the router’s internal systems to fully reset, as specified in the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After unplugging the router, use a timer or count to 10 seconds to ensure a sufficient pause. This aligns with the script’s second step: “Wait for 10 seconds.” This pause allows any residual power in the router’s circuits to dissipate, preparing it for reconnection.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that at least 10 seconds have elapsed since unplugging the router.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify that the waiting period has reached or exceeded 10 seconds by checking the timer or mentally confirming the count. This ensures the reset pause is complete, adhering to the script’s requirement.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and identify the next goal.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal:** Reconnect to the wireless router by unplugging and replugging.  
  - **Subgoal 1:** Disconnect the router from power (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2:** Allow a brief pause to reset the system (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3:** Reconnect the router to power.  
  - **Subgoal 4:** Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
**Current Goal:** Reconnect the router to power (Subgoal 3).  
The second subgoal is complete, and the plan progresses to replugging the router.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Reconnect the router to power.  
**How to Achieve:** Plug the power cord back into the router’s power port or wall outlet to restore power.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take the power cord that was unplugged and insert it firmly back into the router’s power port or the wall outlet, ensuring a secure connection. This corresponds to the script’s third step: “Plug the power cord back into the router.”
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Reconnect the router to power.  
**How to Achieve:** Check that the router is receiving power by observing indicator lights or display activity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Observe the router to confirm it is powered on. Look for indicator lights (e.g., power LED) to illuminate or for a display to activate, indicating that the power cord is properly connected and the router is operational.
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
**How to Achieve:** Wait for the router to boot up and connect to the Internet, then test the connection using a device.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Allow the router time to fully boot up, which may take 1–2 minutes, as specified in the script’s fourth step: “Wait for the router to connect to the Internet.” Observe the router’s Internet or WAN light to confirm it is active (typically solid or blinking green). Then, use a device (e.g., a phone or computer) to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi and test Internet access by loading a webpage or running a speed test.
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the router reestablishes an Internet connection.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that a device connected to the router can access the Internet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm that the device successfully connects to the Internet by checking if a webpage loads or a speed test completes without errors. If the Internet is accessible, the router has successfully reconnected, completing the final subgoal and the main goal.
