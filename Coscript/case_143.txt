**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to remove a jar label using vinegar, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The process should use vinegar as a constraint and follow the script: ['1. Fill a bowl with vinegar.', '2. Submerge the label in vinegar.', '3. Wait 30 minutes to an hour.', '4. Remove the jar from the vinegar and try to peel off the label.', '5. If the label is still stuck, repeat steps 2-4.', '6. Rinse the jar off using clean water, then pat it dry.'].

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of removing a jar label with vinegar into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Prepare vinegar solution.  
2. Soak the jar label in vinegar.  
3. Allow sufficient soaking time.  
4. Attempt to remove the label.  
5. Repeat soaking if necessary.  
6. Clean and dry the jar.

### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove jar label using vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare vinegar solution.  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the jar label in vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow sufficient soaking time.  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to remove the label.  
  - Subgoal 5: Repeat soaking if necessary.  
  - Subgoal 6: Clean and dry the jar.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare vinegar solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the vinegar solution. This will be achieved by filling a bowl with vinegar as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fill a bowl with enough vinegar to fully submerge the jar label. Ensure the bowl is large enough to accommodate the jar.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to soak the jar label in vinegar. This will be achieved by submerging the jar in the vinegar-filled bowl.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the jar in the bowl, ensuring the label is fully submerged in the vinegar.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to allow sufficient soaking time. This will be achieved by waiting 30 minutes to an hour as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set a timer and wait for 30 minutes to an hour to allow the vinegar to loosen the label adhesive.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attempt to remove the label. This will be achieved by removing the jar from the vinegar and peeling off the label.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the jar from the vinegar and try to peel off the label using your fingers or a soft tool like a sponge.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check if the label has been successfully removed. This will be achieved by inspecting the jar to see if the label is fully removed or still stuck.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the jar to determine if the label has been completely removed. If any adhesive or label remnants remain, the label is considered still stuck.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
If the label is still stuck, adjust the plan to repeat the soaking process (subgoals 2-4: soak the jar label in vinegar, allow soaking time, attempt to remove the label). If the label is removed, proceed to the final cleaning step.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 9: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove jar label using vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare vinegar solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the jar label in vinegar (Completed, may repeat).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow sufficient soaking time (Completed, may repeat).  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to remove the label (Completed, may repeat).  
  - Subgoal 5: Repeat soaking if necessary (In progress if label is stuck).  
  - Subgoal 6: Clean and dry the jar (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Repeat soaking if necessary, or proceed to clean and dry the jar if the label is removed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Conditional)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal depends on the validation outcome. If the label is still stuck, repeat the soaking process by submerging the jar in vinegar again. If the label is removed, proceed to clean and dry the jar by rinsing with water and patting dry.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
If the label is still stuck, place the jar back in the vinegar, wait another 30 minutes to an hour, and attempt to peel the label again. If the label is fully removed, rinse the jar with clean water to remove any vinegar or adhesive residue, then pat it dry with a clean towel.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove jar label using vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare vinegar solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the jar label in vinegar (Completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow sufficient soaking time (Completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to remove the label (Completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 5: Repeat soaking if necessary (Completed if label is removed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Clean and dry the jar (In progress or completed).  
**Current Goal**: Complete the cleaning and drying of the jar, or confirm all subgoals are completed.

### Step 12: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the jar is clean and free of label and adhesive residue. This will be achieved by inspecting the jar after rinsing and drying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the jar to ensure the label and any adhesive residue are completely removed and the jar is clean and dry. If any residue remains, repeat the soaking process. If clean, the task is complete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove jar label using vinegar (Completed if validation confirms).  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare vinegar solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the jar label in vinegar (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow sufficient soaking time (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to remove the label (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Repeat soaking if necessary (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Clean and dry the jar (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm task completion.
