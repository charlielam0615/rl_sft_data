[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the SUV’s manual transmission system.  
**How to Achieve**: Familiarize yourself with the SUV’s gear layout, clutch pedal, and controls by reviewing the owner’s manual or physically inspecting the gear shift pattern (e.g., 5-speed or 6-speed) and clutch operation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the SUV’s owner’s manual to identify the gear shift pattern (typically a 5- or 6-speed layout with reverse). Sit in the driver’s seat, locate the clutch pedal (left), brake (middle), and gas pedal (right), and practice moving the gear stick through each gear without starting the engine to understand the shift pattern and clutch feel. Ensure the parking brake is engaged for safety during this familiarization.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated goal hierarchy and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Drive an SUV with a manual transmission.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the SUV’s manual transmission system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Start the vehicle by engaging the clutch and first gear.  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate movement by balancing clutch release and gas application.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fully release the clutch while increasing engine RPMs.  
  - Subgoal 5: Release the brake to begin driving.  
  - Subgoal 6: Accelerate and shift gears as needed to maintain smooth driving.  
**Current Goal**: Start the vehicle by engaging the clutch and first gear.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Start the vehicle by engaging the clutch and first gear.  
**How to Achieve**: Depress the clutch pedal fully, turn on the ignition, and shift the gear stick into first gear while ensuring the vehicle is in a safe starting condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Ensure the SUV is in neutral with the parking brake engaged. Depress the clutch pedal fully with your left foot, turn the key or press the start button to ignite the engine, and move the gear stick into first gear (typically up and left in most manual SUVs). Verify the vehicle remains stationary and the clutch is fully depressed to prevent stalling.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Start the vehicle by engaging the clutch and first gear.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the vehicle is in first gear, the clutch is fully depressed, and the engine is running smoothly without stalling.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm the gear stick is in first gear by feeling the engagement and checking the shift pattern. Ensure the clutch pedal is fully depressed to the floor and the engine is running steadily (listen for a consistent idle). Check that the parking brake is still engaged and the vehicle is not moving unexpectedly. If any issues (e.g., engine stalling), return to neutral, restart the engine, and re-engage first gear.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Initiate movement by balancing clutch release and gas application.  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the clutch and gas pedal interaction from previous steps to ensure smooth initiation of movement.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**: From Step 3, the clutch pedal is the leftmost pedal, and the gas pedal is the rightmost. The clutch must be depressed fully when shifting gears (Step 5). The gear stick is currently in first gear, and the engine is running (Steps 5 and 6). Smooth movement requires gradually releasing the clutch while applying gas to avoid stalling or jerking.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Initiate movement by balancing clutch release and gas application.  
**How to Achieve**: Gradually release the clutch pedal while simultaneously pressing the gas pedal lightly to engage the engine and begin moving the SUV.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With the clutch fully depressed and the gear in first, slowly release the clutch pedal (over 2-3 seconds) while gently pressing the gas pedal to increase engine RPMs to around 1,500-2,000. Feel for the clutch’s “bite point” where the vehicle starts to move. If the engine begins to stall (RPMs drop significantly), depress the clutch slightly and add more gas. Maintain steady foot pressure to avoid jerky motion.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Fully release the clutch while increasing engine RPMs.  
**How to Achieve**: Continue releasing the clutch pedal smoothly while increasing gas input to maintain appropriate RPMs for smooth acceleration.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
As the SUV begins moving, continue releasing the clutch pedal fully over the next 1-2 seconds while steadily pressing the gas pedal to keep RPMs in the 1,500-2,500 range. Monitor the engine sound and tachometer to avoid over-revving or stalling. Once the clutch is fully released, the left foot rests off the pedal, and the vehicle should be moving smoothly in first gear.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Fully release the clutch while increasing engine RPMs.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the clutch is fully released, the vehicle is moving smoothly, and the RPMs are within the optimal range for first gear.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check that the clutch pedal is completely up and your left foot is off the pedal. Ensure the SUV is moving forward without jerking or stalling, and the tachometer shows RPMs between 1,500-2,500. Listen for smooth engine operation. If the vehicle stalls, depress the clutch, return to neutral, restart the engine, and repeat Steps 5, 8, and 9. If RPMs are too high, ease off the gas slightly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Release the brake to begin driving.  
**How to Achieve**: Release the parking brake and foot brake to allow the SUV to move freely while maintaining control with the gas pedal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With the clutch fully released and the vehicle moving in first gear, slowly release the parking brake (if engaged) and gently lift your right foot off the brake pedal. Apply light pressure to the gas pedal to maintain steady movement. Ensure the vehicle accelerates smoothly without rolling backward (if on a hill, use the handbrake technique to prevent rollback).  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated goal hierarchy and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 2: Start the vehicle by engaging the clutch and first gear (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate movement by balancing clutch release and gas application (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Fully release the clutch while increasing engine RPMs (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Release the brake to begin driving (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Accelerate and shift gears as needed to maintain smooth driving.  
**Current Goal**: Accelerate and shift gears as needed to maintain smooth driving.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Accelerate and shift gears as needed to maintain smooth driving.  
**How to Achieve**: Monitor the tachometer and engine sound to determine when to shift gears, depress the clutch, shift to the next gear, and release the clutch while applying gas.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Accelerate in first gear until the RPMs reach approximately 2,500-3,000 (or when the engine sounds labored). Fully depress the clutch pedal, move the gear stick to second gear (typically down and left), and slowly release the clutch while gently pressing the gas pedal to maintain RPMs around 1,500-2,000. Repeat this process for subsequent gears (third, fourth, etc.) as speed increases, ensuring smooth transitions by matching clutch release with gas input. Monitor traffic and road conditions to adjust speed and gear accordingly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Accelerate and shift gears as needed to maintain smooth driving.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that gear shifts are smooth, the vehicle maintains appropriate speed, and the engine operates within the correct RPM range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify that each gear shift (e.g., from first to second) occurs without jerking or stalling, and the vehicle accelerates smoothly. Check the tachometer to ensure RPMs stay within 1,500-2,500 after each shift. Listen for consistent engine performance and ensure the SUV responds appropriately to road conditions (e.g., upshifting for higher speeds, downshifting for hills or slowing). If shifts are rough, practice smoother clutch release and gas application, or revisit Step 8 for clutch-gas coordination.  
[/IMP]
