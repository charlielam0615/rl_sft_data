### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a "Wait for the Uber car" planning case by creating a plan to successfully identify and board the correct Uber vehicle. The plan must adhere to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the given script while respecting the constraint of waiting for the car. The process will involve selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and continuing until all steps in the script are completed.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of waiting for and boarding the Uber car into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Access and review the Uber app information to identify the vehicle and driver details.  
- Subgoal 2: Verify the vehicle’s license plate, make, and model against the app’s information.  
- Subgoal 3: Confirm the vehicle’s authenticity by checking for an Uber sticker.  
- Subgoal 4: Wait for the car to arrive and board it safely.  
Current subgoal: Access and review the Uber app information.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access and review the Uber app information to identify the vehicle and driver details. This will be achieved by opening the Uber app and checking the relevant information displayed on the screen.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open the Uber app on the smartphone and navigate to the ride details section. Look at the information displayed at the top of the app, which includes the driver’s name, photo, vehicle make, model, and license plate number. Note these details for use in subsequent steps.  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Successfully wait for and board the correct Uber car.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access and review the Uber app information to identify the vehicle and driver details (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the vehicle’s license plate, make, and model against the app’s information (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Confirm the vehicle’s authenticity by checking for an Uber sticker.  
  - Subgoal 4: Wait for the car to arrive and board it safely.  
**Current Goal**: Verify the vehicle’s license plate, make, and model against the app’s information.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the vehicle and the driver’s name and photo, and read the license plate number and make of the car. This will be achieved by comparing the vehicle approaching with the details noted from the Uber app.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe the approaching vehicle. Check the driver’s name and photo on the Uber app against the driver in the vehicle. Read the license plate number and identify the make of the car, ensuring they match the details provided in the app.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the car model and make match the photo and details provided in the Uber app. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the vehicle and comparing it to the app’s information.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the vehicle’s model and make. Compare these with the photo and details shown in the Uber app to ensure they are consistent. Confirm that the vehicle matches the expected appearance and specifications.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the car has an Uber sticker on the front or back windshield. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the vehicle’s windshields for the Uber sticker.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Look at the front and back windshields of the vehicle. Confirm the presence of an Uber sticker, which indicates the vehicle is an authorized Uber car.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wait for the car to arrive. Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure all verification steps have been completed before waiting.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Accessed the Uber app and noted the driver’s name, photo, vehicle make, model, and license plate number.  
- Step 4: Confirmed the driver’s identity and vehicle’s license plate and make match the app’s details.  
- Step 5: Verified the vehicle’s model and make against the app’s photo and details.  
- Step 6: Confirmed the presence of an Uber sticker on the vehicle’s windshield.  
All verification steps are complete, ensuring the car is the correct Uber vehicle. The current goal is to wait for the car to arrive.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wait for the car to arrive. This will be achieved by staying in a visible, safe location and monitoring the vehicle’s approach.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stand in a visible and safe location as indicated in the Uber app for pickup. Monitor the surroundings and wait for the verified Uber vehicle to arrive at the designated spot.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to hop in the car when it arrives. This will be achieved by approaching the vehicle, confirming with the driver, and safely entering the car.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
When the verified Uber vehicle stops at the pickup location, approach the car. Greet the driver and confirm the ride details (e.g., your name or destination). Safely enter the vehicle and prepare for the ride.  

[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Successfully wait for and board the correct Uber car (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Access and review the Uber app information to identify the vehicle and driver details (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the vehicle’s license plate, make, and model against the app’s information (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Confirm the vehicle’s authenticity by checking for an Uber sticker (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Wait for the car to arrive and board it safely (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been achieved.  
The process of waiting for and boarding the Uber car is complete.  

[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
All steps in the provided script have been addressed, and the plan to wait for and board the Uber car has been successfully completed using the meta-cognitive action set. The process involved planning subgoals, implementing verification steps, and reviewing progress to ensure accuracy and safety.
