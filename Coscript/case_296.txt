**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, with content organized according to the action's category.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Apply petroleum jelly to the match head.  
2. Ensure the match head is fully coated by rolling it in petroleum jelly.  
3. Allow the coated match to dry.  
4. Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively.  
These subgoals will guide the process to achieve waterproof matches.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly.  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply petroleum jelly to the match head.  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the match head is fully coated by rolling it in petroleum jelly.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the coated match to dry.  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively.  
**Current Goal**: Apply petroleum jelly to the match head (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply petroleum jelly to the match head.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a small tool (e.g., a toothpick or gloved finger) to scoop a small amount of petroleum jelly and carefully spread it onto the match head, ensuring minimal mess and even application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To apply petroleum jelly to the match head, take a clean toothpick or wear a glove to avoid direct contact. Scoop a small amount of petroleum jelly from the container, about the size of a pea, and gently dab it onto the match head. Spread it lightly to cover the tip without smothering it, ensuring the match remains functional.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the petroleum jelly is applied correctly to the match head.  
**How to Achieve**: Visually inspect the match head to confirm it has a thin, even layer of petroleum jelly without excess buildup that could prevent striking.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the match head under good lighting. The petroleum jelly should form a thin, translucent layer over the match head, covering it evenly without clumps or thick patches. If the coating appears uneven or too thick, remove excess jelly with a clean cloth or toothpick and reapply as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the match head is fully coated by rolling it in petroleum jelly.  
**How to Achieve**: Gently roll the match head in a small amount of petroleum jelly to ensure complete coverage, focusing on even distribution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place a small amount of petroleum jelly on a clean, flat surface (e.g., a piece of wax paper). Hold the match by its stick and gently roll the head in the petroleum jelly, rotating it to coat all sides. Ensure the coating is uniform and not excessively thick, maintaining the match head’s shape.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the match head is fully and evenly coated with petroleum jelly.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the match head to verify complete coverage and check that the coating is not too thick, ensuring the match can still ignite.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Hold the match up to a light source and rotate it to check for full coverage. The entire match head should have a consistent, glossy appearance from the petroleum jelly. If any areas are uncoated, roll the match head again in petroleum jelly. If the coating is too thick, gently wipe off excess with a clean cloth.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Allow the coated match to dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Place the match in a dry, well-ventilated area for a few minutes to let the petroleum jelly set on the match head.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the coated match upright in a match holder or lay it flat on a clean, dry surface, such as wax paper, in a well-ventilated area. Avoid touching the match head. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes to allow the petroleum jelly to settle and adhere to the match head, ensuring it forms a stable waterproof layer.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly.  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply petroleum jelly to the match head (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the match head is fully coated by rolling it in petroleum jelly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the coated match to dry (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively.  
**Current Goal**: Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively (Subgoal 4).  
This hierarchy updates the status of completed subgoals and highlights the final subgoal as the current focus.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively.  
**How to Achieve**: Strike the coated match on a strike-anywhere surface to verify it ignites and burns properly, confirming its waterproofing does not impair functionality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the dried, coated match and strike it gently but firmly on a strike-anywhere surface (e.g., a matchbox striker or sandpaper). Observe if the match ignites smoothly and burns steadily. If it fails to ignite, check for excessive petroleum jelly and repeat the coating process with a thinner layer.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the testing of the waterproof match to ensure it aligns with the goal of confirming functionality and waterproofing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- The script specifies testing the match by striking it on a strike-anywhere surface (Step 4 of the script).  
- Previous implementation steps (Steps 3, 5, 7, 9) focused on applying a thin, even layer of petroleum jelly, ensuring full coverage, and allowing it to dry to maintain ignition capability.  
- Validation steps (Steps 4, 6) confirmed the coating was not too thick, which could prevent ignition.  
This information ensures the match was prepared correctly for testing, with a focus on achieving a balance between waterproofing and functionality.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the match is waterproof and functional.  
**How to Achieve**: Submerge the match in water briefly, dry the stick, and attempt to strike it to confirm it still ignites, validating the waterproofing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Submerge the coated match head in water for 5–10 seconds, then remove it and gently dry the wooden stick with a cloth, avoiding the coated head. Strike the match on a strike-anywhere surface. If it ignites, the waterproofing is successful. If it fails, review the coating thickness and drying time, and repeat the process with adjustments.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply petroleum jelly to the match head (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the match head is fully coated by rolling it in petroleum jelly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the coated match to dry (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the match to confirm it strikes and burns effectively (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been achieved, and the main goal of making waterproof matches using petroleum jelly is complete, with the final validation confirming both functionality and waterproofing.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Conclusion**: The plan to make waterproof matches using petroleum jelly has been completed by following the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed through planning, implementation, and review actions, resulting in a functional waterproof match.
