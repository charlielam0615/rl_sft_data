**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for using "yet" as an adverb and create a plan following the meta-cognitive action set principles, ensuring all steps in the script are completed while adhering to the constraint that "yet" must be used as an adverb.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of using "yet" as an adverb into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script outlines three steps: (1) Modify a verb with "yet," (2) Modify an adjective or adverb with "yet," and (3) Compare two things using "yet." These will form the subgoals to guide the planning process.  
- Subgoal 1: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence.  
- Subgoal 2: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence.  
- Subgoal 3: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals and highlight the current focus.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use "yet" as an adverb in various contexts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence.  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence.  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence. This will be achieved by constructing a sentence where "yet" is used as an adverb to indicate that an action denoted by a verb has not occurred up to the present moment.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Construct a sentence: "She has not finished her homework yet." In this sentence, "yet" modifies the verb "finished," indicating that the action of finishing has not occurred up to now.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that "yet" is correctly used as an adverb modifying a verb in the sentence "She has not finished her homework yet." This will be achieved by checking if "yet" describes the timing or extent of the verb and adheres to the adverbial constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In the sentence "She has not finished her homework yet," "yet" is an adverb modifying the verb "finished." It indicates that the action of finishing has not occurred up to the present moment, which aligns with the adverbial use of "yet" as specified in the constraint. The sentence is grammatically correct and fulfills Subgoal 1.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use "yet" as an adverb in various contexts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence.  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence. This will be achieved by constructing a sentence where "yet" intensifies or qualifies an adjective or adverb, adhering to its adverbial role.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Construct a sentence: "The solution is not yet fully clear." In this sentence, "yet" modifies the adverb "fully," indicating that the extent of clarity is still incomplete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that "yet" is correctly used as an adverb modifying an adverb in the sentence "The solution is not yet fully clear." This will be achieved by checking if "yet" appropriately qualifies the adverb "fully" and adheres to the constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In the sentence "The solution is not yet fully clear," "yet" is an adverb modifying the adverb "fully," which in turn modifies the adjective "clear." "Yet" indicates that the degree of clarity is still incomplete, satisfying the adverbial use of "yet." The sentence is grammatically correct and fulfills Subgoal 2.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use "yet" as an adverb in various contexts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence. (Current)  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence. This will be achieved by constructing a sentence where "yet" functions as an adverb to contrast or compare two entities or situations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Construct a sentence: "This puzzle is challenging, yet it is easier than the previous one." In this sentence, "yet" functions as an adverb to contrast the difficulty of the current puzzle with the previous one, facilitating a comparison.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that "yet" is correctly used as an adverb to compare two things in the sentence "This puzzle is challenging, yet it is easier than the previous one." This will be achieved by checking if "yet" appropriately contrasts the two clauses and adheres to the adverbial constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In the sentence "This puzzle is challenging, yet it is easier than the previous one," "yet" is used as an adverb to contrast the two clauses, comparing the difficulty of the current puzzle with the previous one. This aligns with the adverbial use of "yet" for comparison, and the sentence is grammatically correct, fulfilling Subgoal 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use "yet" as an adverb in various contexts. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 1: Demonstrate "yet" modifying a verb in a sentence. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Demonstrate "yet" modifying an adjective or adverb in a sentence. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate "yet" used to compare two things in a sentence. (Completed)  
**Current Status**: All subgoals have been completed, achieving the main goal of using "yet" as an adverb in various contexts.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The plan to use "yet" as an adverb has been completed, with the following results:  
1. "Yet" modifying a verb: "She has not finished her homework yet."  
2. "Yet" modifying an adverb: "The solution is not yet fully clear."  
3. "Yet" used to compare two things: "This puzzle is challenging, yet it is easier than the previous one."  
All subgoals were validated as grammatically correct and adherent to the constraint of using "yet" as an adverb.
