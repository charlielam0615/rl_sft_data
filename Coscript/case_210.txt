### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate respect toward others to establish a foundation for mutual respect.  
**How to Achieve**: Actively show respect by valuing others’ opinions, addressing them courteously, and acknowledging their contributions in conversations or collaborative settings.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To demonstrate respect, engage in behaviors such as:  
- Using polite language (e.g., "please" and "thank you") in all interactions.  
- Acknowledging others’ ideas by summarizing or referencing their points in discussions.  
- Avoiding interruptions and giving others space to express themselves.  
- Showing appreciation for others’ efforts, such as thanking colleagues for their work or recognizing their achievements.  
For example, in a team meeting, listen attentively to a colleague’s input, nod to show understanding, and respond with, “I appreciate your perspective; that’s a great point to consider.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate respect toward others to establish a foundation for mutual respect.  
**How to Achieve**: Assess whether actions taken to show respect are effective by observing others’ responses and adjusting behavior if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate the effectiveness of respectful actions by:  
- Observing verbal and non-verbal feedback (e.g., do others respond positively, such as with smiles, agreement, or reciprocated respect?).  
- Asking for feedback indirectly, such as, “Did I address your concerns adequately?”  
- Reflecting on whether interactions feel collaborative and valued by all parties.  
For instance, if a colleague responds warmly or engages more openly after you acknowledge their input, it indicates success. If responses seem neutral or disengaged, consider increasing efforts to show respect, such as asking more questions to clarify their views.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Maintain reliability by keeping promises to build credibility.  
**How to Achieve**: Honor commitments, follow through on promises, and communicate proactively if delays occur.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To maintain reliability:  
- Keep track of promises using a calendar or task list to ensure timely follow-through.  
- Deliver on commitments, such as completing a task by the agreed deadline.  
- If unable to meet a promise, inform others promptly and propose solutions, e.g., “I need an extra day for this; can we adjust the timeline?”  
- Be consistent in meeting expectations over time to build trust.  
For example, if you promise to review a colleague’s work by Friday, ensure it’s done or communicate early if there’s a delay.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Act with fairness and justice to gain trust and admiration.  
**How to Achieve**: Make decisions impartially, treat everyone equitably, and resolve conflicts with transparency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To act with fairness and justice:  
- Make decisions based on objective criteria, e.g., allocating tasks based on skills rather than favoritism.  
- Treat all individuals equally, regardless of status or relationship.  
- When resolving conflicts, listen to all sides and explain your reasoning, e.g., “I’ve considered both perspectives, and here’s why I’m choosing this approach.”

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Practice honesty in all interactions to establish trustworthiness.  
**How to Achieve**: Be truthful in communications, admit when you don’t know something, and avoid exaggeration or deception.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To practice honesty:  
- Share accurate information, even if it’s inconvenient, e.g., “I made an error in the report; let’s correct it.”  
- Admit when you lack knowledge, e.g., “I’m not sure about that, but I’ll find out and get back to you.”  
- Avoid making promises you can’t keep or exaggerating achievements.  
- Be transparent about intentions, such as explaining your reasoning for a decision.  
For example, if asked about a project’s progress, say, “We’re slightly behind, but here’s our plan to catch up,” rather than overstating progress.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Uphold integrity by aligning actions with values.  
**How to Achieve**: Consistently act in accordance with personal and ethical values, even under pressure, to demonstrate reliability and principle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To uphold integrity:  
- Define core values (e.g., honesty, fairness, respect) and reflect on them before acting.  
- Stand by principles, even when inconvenient, e.g., refusing to cut corners on a project despite tight deadlines.  
- Correct actions that deviate from values, such as apologizing for a lapse in judgment.  
- Be consistent in behavior across different contexts, whether with colleagues or strangers.  
For example, if pressured to overlook a mistake, say, “I can’t do that; it’s important to me to maintain our standards.”  
[/IMP]

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Be authentic in behavior to earn genuine respect.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To be authentic:  
- Express your true opinions respectfully, even if they differ from the group’s.  
- Avoid mimicking others’ behaviors to fit in; instead, act in line with your personality and values.  
- Share personal experiences when relevant to build genuine connections, e.g., “I faced a similar challenge last year.”

For example, in a discussion, share your perspective sincerely, saying, “I believe this approach works best because it aligns with my experience.”  
[/IMP]
