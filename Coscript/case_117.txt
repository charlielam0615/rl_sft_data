### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the stew base by sautéing onion and garlic.  
**How to Achieve**: In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat, then sauté chopped onion and minced garlic until softened and fragrant.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, add 1 chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the onion and garlic are properly sautéed.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant without being burnt.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the saucepan to confirm the onion is soft and translucent and the garlic is golden and aromatic. If the mixture appears browned or burnt, discard and restart to avoid a bitter flavor in the stew.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make fish stew without potatoes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the stew base by sautéing onion and garlic (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Build the stew base with tomatoes.  
  - Subgoal 3: Add clam juice, white wine, and fish to simmer.  
  - Subgoal 4: Season the stew to complete the dish.  
**Current Goal**: Build the stew base with tomatoes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Build the stew base with tomatoes.  
**How to Achieve**: Add diced tomatoes to the sautéed onion and garlic and simmer to create a cohesive stew base.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add 1 can (28 oz) of diced tomatoes (or 4 fresh diced tomatoes) to the saucepan with the sautéed onion and garlic. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and form a thickened base.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the tomato stew base is properly simmered.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the tomatoes have broken down and the mixture has thickened into a cohesive base.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check that the tomatoes have softened and integrated with the onion and garlic, forming a thick, cohesive stew base. The mixture should have a rich, slightly reduced consistency. If still watery, simmer for an additional 5 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add clam juice, white wine, and fish to simmer.  
**How to Achieve**: Stir in clam juice and white wine, add fish pieces, and simmer until the fish is cooked through.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Pour in 2 cups of clam juice and 1/2 cup of dry white wine, stirring to combine with the tomato base. Add 1.5 lbs of firm white fish (e.g., cod or halibut), cut into bite-sized pieces. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
