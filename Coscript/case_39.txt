**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to simulate using a Theraband for ballet practice at home, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint that all actions must be performed at home. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of using a Theraband for ballet practice at home into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Secure the Theraband to a sturdy object.  
2. Perform pliés with the Theraband around thighs.  
3. Untie the Theraband.  
4. Secure the Theraband around ankles.  
5. Perform tendus with the Theraband around ankles.  
6. Remove the Theraband and perform foot stretches.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use a Theraband for ballet practice at home.  
  - Subgoal 1: Secure the Theraband to a sturdy object.  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform pliés with the Theraband around thighs.  
  - Subgoal 3: Untie the Theraband.  
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the Theraband around ankles.  
  - Subgoal 5: Perform tendus with the Theraband around ankles.  
  - Subgoal 6: Remove the Theraband and perform foot stretches.  
**Current Goal**: Secure the Theraband to a sturdy object.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the Theraband to a sturdy object at home. This will be achieved by identifying a stable, fixed object in the home environment, such as a heavy piece of furniture or a door frame, and tying the Theraband securely to it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find a sturdy object in your home, such as a heavy table leg or a low, fixed railing. Ensure it is stable and won’t move during exercise. Tie one end of the Theraband around the object using a secure knot, like a double knot, ensuring it is tight and won’t slip. Test the setup by gently pulling the Theraband to confirm stability.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the Theraband is securely attached to the sturdy object. This will be achieved by checking the knot’s tightness and the object’s stability under tension.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pull the Theraband with moderate force to test the knot’s security. Observe if the object moves or if the Theraband slips. If either occurs, re-tie the Theraband or select a more stable object. Confirm the setup allows safe movement for the upcoming pliés exercise.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform pliés with the Theraband around thighs. This will be achieved by positioning the Theraband around both thighs and executing controlled pliés while maintaining proper ballet form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the Theraband around both thighs, just above the knees, ensuring it is snug but not overly tight. Stand in first position (heels together, toes turned out). Perform 8–12 slow pliés, bending your knees while keeping your back straight and hips aligned. Use the Theraband’s resistance to engage your thigh muscles. Rest briefly and repeat for 2–3 sets.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to untie the Theraband. Retrieve information from previous steps about how the Theraband was secured to ensure it is untied safely and efficiently.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
In Step 3, the Theraband was tied to a sturdy object (e.g., a table leg or railing) using a secure knot, such as a double knot, and tested for stability. This indicates the knot may be tight and requires careful untying to avoid damaging the Theraband or the object.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to untie the Theraband from the sturdy object. This will be achieved by carefully undoing the knot used to secure the Theraband, ensuring it remains undamaged for the next exercise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Approach the sturdy object and locate the knot securing the Theraband. Gently undo the double knot (or other knot used) by pulling the loose end and loosening the loops. Remove the Theraband carefully to avoid stretching or tearing it. Set the Theraband aside for the next exercise.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use a Theraband for ballet practice at home.  
  - Subgoal 1: Secure the Theraband to a sturdy object (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform pliés with the Theraband around thighs (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Untie the Theraband (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the Theraband around ankles.  
  - Subgoal 5: Perform tendus with the Theraband around ankles.  
  - Subgoal 6: Remove the Theraband and perform foot stretches.  
**Current Goal**: Secure the Theraband around ankles.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the Theraband around ankles. This will be achieved by looping the Theraband around both ankles to create resistance for the tendus exercise, ensuring it is comfortable and secure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the Theraband and loop it around both ankles, forming a continuous band. Adjust the tension so it provides resistance but allows full range of motion. Ensure the band sits comfortably above the ankle bones to avoid discomfort during movement. Test the setup by gently moving one foot outward to confirm the band stays in place.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform tendus with the Theraband around ankles. This will be achieved by executing controlled tendus in multiple directions while using the Theraband’s resistance to strengthen foot and leg muscles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Stand in first position with the Theraband around your ankles. Perform 8–12 tendus by pointing one foot forward, side, and back, keeping the leg straight and toes pointed. Move slowly to maintain control against the Theraband’s resistance. Switch to the other foot and repeat. Complete 2–3 sets per side, ensuring proper ballet alignment throughout.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoal to “remove the Theraband and perform foot stretches” can be split into two distinct subgoals for clarity: (1) remove the Theraband from the ankles, and (2) perform foot stretches without the Theraband. This adjustment ensures each action is clearly defined.  
Updated subgoals:  
- Subgoal 6: Remove the Theraband from the ankles.  
- Subgoal 7: Perform foot stretches.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the Theraband from the ankles. This will be achieved by carefully slipping the Theraband off the ankles, ensuring it remains undamaged for future use.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sit down for safety and ease. Gently slide the Theraband off one ankle, then the other, being careful not to overstretch or snap the band. Inspect the Theraband for any signs of wear and store it properly for future use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform foot stretches. This will be achieved by executing a series of foot stretches to improve flexibility and relax the muscles after Theraband exercises.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sit on the floor with legs extended. Point and flex each foot slowly for 8–10 repetitions to stretch the arches and calves. Then, use your hands to gently massage and stretch the toes and arches, holding each stretch for 15–20 seconds. Repeat for both feet. Finish with circular ankle rotations, 8 per direction per foot, to release tension.  
[/IMP]
