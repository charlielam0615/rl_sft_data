**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Prepare the tile saw for cutting.
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm the tile saw is properly set up and operational.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test the tile saw by running it briefly to ensure the blade spins correctly and water flows for cooling. Verify the saw is stable and all components are secure before cutting.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to cutting tiles to fit around the toilet flange, focusing on the script’s steps about cutting and ensuring proper fit.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Summarize relevant information for the current goal (cut tiles to fit around the toilet flange):
- Script specifies: “Use a tile saw to cut through the ceramic tiles,” “Cut through the tile one at a time,” and “Make sure the cuts are straight and even.”
- Previous steps confirmed safety gear and tile saw readiness, which are prerequisites for cutting.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Cut tiles to fit around the toilet flange.
- **How to Achieve**: Measure the toilet flange, mark tiles, and use the tile saw to cut them one at a time, ensuring straight and even cuts.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure the toilet flange’s dimensions and mark the ceramic tiles with a pencil or marker for precise cuts. Use the tile saw to cut one tile at a time, following the marked lines. Keep the tile steady and move it slowly through the saw to ensure straight and even cuts, as specified in the script.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Cut tiles to fit around the toilet flange.
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the cuts are straight, even, and match the toilet flange’s shape.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect each cut tile for straightness and uniformity using a straightedge or ruler. Ensure the cut edges are smooth and free of chips. Compare the cut tile to the flange’s shape to confirm it aligns correctly.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Verify the fit of cut tiles.
- **How to Achieve**: Dry-fit the cut tiles around the toilet flange to ensure they fit properly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place the cut tiles around the toilet flange without adhesive to dry-fit them, as per the script’s step: “Dry-fit the tile over the flange to make sure it fits.” Check for proper alignment and minimal gaps between the tiles and the flange.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
If the dry-fit reveals issues (e.g., gaps or misalignments), adjust the subgoal to include re-cutting or trimming tiles for a better fit. Otherwise, proceed to the final subgoal of ensuring cuts are straight and even.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Verify the fit of cut tiles.
