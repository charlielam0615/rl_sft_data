**Problem Statement**: I need to buy an exercise ball from a personal trainer, ensuring it meets my needs and is the correct size. The process involves consulting the trainer about the best type of ball, selecting the appropriate size with their guidance, and purchasing the ball directly from them.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of buying an exercise ball from a personal trainer into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Consult with a personal trainer to determine the best type of exercise ball for my needs.  
- Subgoal 2: Work with the trainer to select the correct size of the exercise ball.  
- Subgoal 3: Purchase the exercise ball from the trainer.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to consult with a personal trainer to determine the best type of exercise ball for my needs. This will be achieved by discussing my fitness goals, physical condition, and intended use of the ball with the trainer to get their expert recommendation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To achieve the first subgoal, I will schedule a meeting or conversation with a certified personal trainer. During the discussion, I will explain my fitness objectives (e.g., core strengthening, flexibility, or balance training) and any relevant physical conditions (e.g., height, weight, or injuries). I will ask the trainer to recommend an exercise ball type (e.g., stability ball, anti-burst, or specific material) that aligns with my needs. I will also inquire about brands or features they trust based on their experience.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to work with the trainer to select the correct size of the exercise ball. This will be achieved by discussing sizing guidelines with the trainer and possibly testing different sizes to ensure the ball is appropriate for my height and intended exercises.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will ask the personal trainer for guidance on choosing the right size exercise ball, typically based on my height (e.g., 55 cm for heights under 5’6”, 65 cm for 5’6”–6’, or 75 cm for taller individuals). I will also request to test the ball, if possible, by sitting on it to ensure my knees are at a 90-degree angle when seated. The trainer’s expertise will help confirm the size is suitable for my intended exercises, such as core workouts or stability training.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the selected exercise ball type and size before purchase. This will be achieved by confirming with the trainer that the recommended ball type and size align with my needs and are appropriate for safe use.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will review the trainer’s recommendations for the exercise ball type and size. I will confirm that the ball’s material (e.g., anti-burst) and size (e.g., 65 cm) are suitable for my fitness goals and physical attributes. I will ask the trainer if there are any additional considerations, such as weight capacity or specific exercises, to ensure the ball is safe and effective for my use. If needed, I will test the ball again or ask for a demonstration to verify its suitability.
