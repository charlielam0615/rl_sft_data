[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Open the Downloads folder on a Windows computer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Start menu (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Search for the Downloads folder (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Open the Downloads folder (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: View the contents of the Downloads folder.  
**Current Goal**: View the contents of the Downloads folder.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to view the contents of the Downloads folder. This can be achieved by observing the files and folders displayed in the opened Downloads folder.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With the Downloads folder open, view the list of files and folders displayed in the File Explorer window.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that all steps to open and view the Downloads folder have been correctly followed. Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure the process aligns with the provided script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 1 defined subgoals aligning with the script: open Start menu, search for Downloads, open the folder, and view contents.  
- Step 2 completed opening the Start menu (Subgoal 1).  
- Step 4 completed searching for "downloads" (Subgoal 2).  
- Step 5 validated the search results.  
- Step 6 opened the Downloads folder (Subgoal 3).  
- Step 8 viewed the folder contents (Subgoal 4).
