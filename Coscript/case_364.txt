### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals from the previous planning step. The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Turn off lights and appliances when not in use.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Maximize natural lighting to reduce reliance on artificial lights.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Ensure appliances are unplugged when not in use to eliminate standby power.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Use task-specific lighting to minimize unnecessary light usage.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Turn off lights in rooms that are not occupied.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Replace existing bulbs with energy-efficient ones to reduce energy consumption.  

**Current Goal**: Maximize natural lighting to reduce reliance on artificial lights (Subgoal 1).  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Maximize natural lighting to reduce reliance on artificial lights.  
**How to Achieve**: Open curtains or blinds during the day, rearrange furniture to avoid blocking windows, and use reflective surfaces to enhance natural light distribution.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, take the following actions:  
- Open all curtains and blinds in the morning to allow sunlight into rooms.  
- Check furniture placement and move any items blocking windows to ensure maximum light entry.  
- Consider adding mirrors or light-colored decor to reflect and amplify natural light.  
This reduces the need for artificial lighting during daylight hours, aligning with the constraint of turning off lights when not in use.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Maximize natural lighting to reduce reliance on artificial lights.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the actions taken (opening curtains, rearranging furniture, using reflective surfaces) effectively increase natural light and reduce the need for artificial lighting.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each room during the day to confirm that:  
- Curtains and blinds are fully open, allowing maximum sunlight.  
- Furniture is positioned to avoid obstructing windows.  
- Reflective surfaces (e.g., mirrors) are enhancing light distribution.  
Observe whether artificial lights remain off during daylight hours. If lights are still needed, identify areas with insufficient natural light for further adjustment in later steps.

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure appliances are unplugged when not in use.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify appliances that are frequently left plugged in, unplug them after use, and consider using power strips to simplify switching off multiple devices.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 2:  
- Conduct a home walkthrough to identify appliances (e.g., chargers, kitchen appliances, entertainment systems) that are often left plugged in.  
- Unplug these appliances immediately after use or when they are not needed.  
- Install power strips for devices like TVs and computers to easily cut power to multiple appliances at once.  
This eliminates standby power consumption, aligning with the constraint of turning off appliances when not in use.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure appliances are unplugged when not in use.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that appliances are unplugged or powered off via power strips when not in use, and check for any missed appliances.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform a follow-up walkthrough to verify:  
- All identified appliances are unplugged or powered off via power strips when not in use.  
- No appliances are consuming standby power (e.g., check for indicator lights on devices).  
- Power strips are being used effectively for grouped devices.  
If any appliances are still plugged in unnecessarily, unplug them and add them to the routine check.

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use task-specific lighting to minimize unnecessary light usage.  
**How to Achieve**: Use focused lighting (e.g., desk lamps, under-cabinet lights) for specific tasks instead of illuminating entire rooms.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 3:  
- Identify tasks requiring lighting (e.g., reading, cooking, working).  
- Use task-specific lighting such as desk lamps for workspaces or under-cabinet lights for kitchen counters.  
- Ensure overhead or general room lights are turned off when task lighting is sufficient.  
This reduces the number of lights in use, aligning with the constraint of turning off lights when not needed.  

[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check task areas to verify:  
- Task-specific lighting (e.g., desk lamps, under-cabinet lights) is in use for activities like reading or cooking.  
- Overhead or general room lights are off when task lighting is sufficient.  
- No additional lights are unnecessarily illuminated in task areas.  
If general lights are still on, turn them off and rely solely on task lighting where possible.

### Step 12: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Turn off lights in rooms that are not occupied.  
**How to Achieve**: Establish a routine to check and turn off lights in unoccupied rooms and consider motion-sensor lights for automatic control.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 4:  
- Walk through the home to identify and turn off lights in unoccupied rooms.  
- Create a habit of checking rooms before leaving them to ensure lights are off.  
- Consider installing motion-sensor lights in areas like hallways or bathrooms to automatically turn off lights when no one is present.  
This ensures lights are off in unused rooms, directly addressing the constraint.  

[/IMP]

### Step 13: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Turn off lights in rooms that are not occupied.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that lights are off in all unoccupied rooms and that motion-sensor lights (if installed) are functioning correctly.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform a check to confirm:  
- All unoccupied rooms have lights turned off.  
- Motion-sensor lights (if installed) activate only when someone is present and turn off when rooms are empty.  
- The routine of checking rooms is being followed consistently.  
Address any instances where lights are left on in empty rooms by reinforcing the habit or installing additional sensors.
