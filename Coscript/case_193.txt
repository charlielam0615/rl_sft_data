### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a vegetarian hot pot with Chinese ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the cooking equipment by preheating the pot.  
  - Subgoal 2: Sauté foundational aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add primary vegetables (Chinese broccoli, mushrooms, bok choy).  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate noodles and broth.  
  - Subgoal 5: Simmer and add tofu.  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize with remaining ingredients and serve.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the cooking equipment by preheating the pot.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the cooking equipment by preheating the pot.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a suitable hot pot or large pot, place it on the stove, and heat it over medium heat to prepare for sautéing ingredients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a hot pot or a large, deep pot suitable for communal dining. Place it on the stove and set the heat to medium, allowing the pot to warm up evenly for about 3-5 minutes. Ensure the pot is clean and dry before heating.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the pot is properly preheated.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the pot is warm to the touch or if a drop of water sizzles upon contact, indicating it’s ready for sautéing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the pot’s temperature by carefully hovering your hand above the surface to feel the heat or sprinkle a few drops of water into the pot. If the water sizzles and evaporates quickly, the pot is adequately preheated and ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Sauté foundational aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger).  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the ingredients and process for sautéing onion, garlic, and ginger from the script and previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies sautéing onion, garlic, and ginger as the second step. These are foundational aromatics commonly used in Chinese cuisine to build flavor. From Step 3, the pot has been preheated, which is a prerequisite for sautéing. The sautéing process involves cooking these ingredients in a small amount of oil until fragrant, setting the flavor base for the hot pot.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sauté foundational aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger).  
**How to Achieve**: Add oil to the preheated pot, then cook finely chopped onion, garlic, and ginger until they release their aroma and turn golden.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the preheated pot. Once the oil is shimmering, add 1 finely chopped onion, 2-3 minced garlic cloves, and 1 tablespoon of minced ginger. Sauté over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is fragrant and the onions are translucent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Revise the subgoals to ensure clarity and specificity for the remaining steps, particularly for adding vegetables, based on the progress made. Adjusted subgoals:  
1. (Completed) Prepare the cooking equipment by preheating the pot.  
2. (Completed) Sauté foundational aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger).  
3. Add Chinese broccoli, shiitake mushrooms, and bok choy, ensuring they are washed and chopped appropriately.  
4. Add pre-soaked noodles and vegetable broth to form the hot pot base.  
5. Simmer for 30 minutes, then add cubed tofu for protein.  
6. Add seasonings (e.g., soy sauce, sesame oil) and serve immediately.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add Chinese broccoli, shiitake mushrooms, and bok choy.  
**How to Achieve**: Wash and chop the vegetables, then add them to the pot with the sautéed aromatics to soften slightly before adding broth.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wash 1 bunch of Chinese broccoli, 8-10 shiitake mushrooms, and 2 heads of bok choy. Chop the Chinese broccoli into 2-inch pieces, slice the mushrooms, and separate the bok choy leaves. Add these vegetables to the pot with the sautéed aromatics, stirring for 2-3 minutes over medium heat until they begin to soften.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add noodles and broth to form the hot pot base.  
**How to Achieve**: Add pre-soaked noodles and vegetable broth to the pot, ensuring enough liquid to cover the ingredients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Soak 8 oz of dried rice noodles or glass noodles in warm water for 10-15 minutes until softened, then drain. Add the noodles to the pot with the vegetables. Pour in 6-8 cups of vegetable broth, ensuring all ingredients are submerged. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simmer for 30 minutes and add tofu.  
**How to Achieve**: Reduce heat to low, simmer the hot pot for 30 minutes, then add cubed tofu to heat through.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lower the heat to a gentle simmer and let the hot pot cook for 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Cube 1 block (14 oz) of firm tofu into bite-sized pieces and gently add to the pot. Continue simmering for an additional 5-7 minutes until the tofu is heated through.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add seasonings and serve the hot pot.  
**How to Achieve**: Stir in Chinese-inspired seasonings like soy sauce and sesame oil, adjust to taste, and serve the hot pot directly from the pot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1-2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the hot pot. Stir gently and taste, adjusting with additional soy sauce or a pinch of white pepper if desired. Serve the hot pot in the pot for communal dining, with small bowls for individual portions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the hot pot is ready to serve.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the flavor balance, ingredient texture, and temperature to confirm the dish is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Taste the broth to ensure a balanced flavor, checking for saltiness and depth from the seasonings. Verify that the vegetables and noodles are tender, the tofu is heated through, and the hot pot is piping hot. If adjustments are needed, add more seasoning or simmer briefly. The hot pot is now ready to serve.  
[/IMP]
