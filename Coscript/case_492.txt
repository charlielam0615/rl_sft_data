**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to set up a network for computers in a home office, ensuring all steps are completed systematically while adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the provided script.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of setting up a home office network into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Connect the computer to the network (wired or wireless).  
2. Configure the network settings on the computer.  
3. Set up a new network if needed.  
4. Finalize and verify the network setup.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to connect the computer to the network (wired or wireless). This will be achieved by following the script steps for connecting via Ethernet or selecting a wireless network and entering the password.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To connect the computer to the network:  
- For a wired connection, plug an Ethernet cable from the modem or router into the computer’s Ethernet port.  
- For a wireless connection, ensure the wireless adapter is connected to the computer, then select the desired wireless network from the list of available networks and enter the network password when prompted.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the computer is successfully connected to the network. This will be achieved by checking the network status in the operating system to confirm connectivity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the network status:  
- Open the network settings or system tray on the computer.  
- Confirm that the computer shows an active connection (e.g., “Connected” status for wired or wireless network).  
- Test connectivity by accessing a website or pinging the router.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Set up a home office network.  
  - Subgoal 1: Connect the computer to the network (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the network settings on the computer (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up a new network if needed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize and verify the network setup.  
**Current Goal**: Configure the network settings on the computer.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to configure the network settings on the computer. This will be achieved by accessing the Control Panel, navigating to the Network and Sharing Center, and initiating the setup process as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To configure network settings:  
- Open the Start menu and select “Control Panel.”  
- Click “Network and Internet,” then select “Network and Sharing Center.”  
- Click “Set up a new connection or network.”  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a new network. This will be achieved by selecting the option to set up a new network, naming it, choosing the network type, and following the remaining prompts as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To set up a new network:  
- In the “Set up a new connection or network” window, select “Set up a new network” and click “Next.”  
- Enter a name for the network in the “Network Name” field and choose the appropriate network type (e.g., Home network).  
- Follow the remaining prompts to complete the setup process.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the new network is set up correctly. This will be achieved by checking the Network and Sharing Center to ensure the network is active and correctly configured.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the network setup:  
- Return to the “Network and Sharing Center” in the Control Panel.  
- Confirm that the new network appears in the list of active networks with the correct name and type.  
- Test the network by connecting another device or accessing shared resources.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Set up a home office network.  
  - Subgoal 1: Connect the computer to the network (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the network settings on the computer (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up a new network if needed (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize and verify the network setup (in progress).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize and verify the network setup.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize and verify the network setup. Retrieve information from previous steps related to network connectivity and configuration to ensure all steps were followed correctly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Connected the computer to the network (wired or wireless) and entered the password if needed.  
- Step 3: Validated the connection by checking the network status.  
- Step 5: Accessed the Control Panel and navigated to the Network and Sharing Center.  
- Step 6: Set up a new network with a specified name and type.  
- Step 7: Verified the new network’s configuration in the Network and Sharing Center.  
This confirms that all necessary steps for network setup have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform a final validation of the home office network setup. This will be achieved by ensuring all computers in the home office are connected and can communicate over the network.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Perform final validation:  
- Ensure all intended computers in the home office are connected to the network (wired or wireless).  
- Test network functionality by sharing files or accessing a shared printer between computers.  
- Confirm internet access on all devices and check for stable connectivity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Set up a home office network (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Connect the computer to the network (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the network settings on the computer (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up a new network if needed (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize and verify the network setup (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all goals completed).  
The home office network setup is complete, with all computers connected and network functionality verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Conclusion**: The home office network setup plan has been completed by following the provided script and the meta-cognitive action framework. All subgoals were addressed, and the network is fully operational.
