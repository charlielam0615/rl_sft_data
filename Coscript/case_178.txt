### Problem Statement
I need to create a plan to make appointments with a mechanic by simulating a planning case. The task involves researching mechanics, gathering recommendations, checking reviews, listing potential mechanics, and contacting them to schedule appointments. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with each step adhering to the specified format: [PLANNING] for planning actions, [PLANNING] and [IMP] for implementation actions, and [PLANNING] and [REVIEW] for review actions. The provided script and constraints must guide the process.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making appointments with a mechanic into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Identify potential mechanics through research.  
2. Gather recommendations from friends or family.  
3. Evaluate mechanics using online reviews.  
4. Compile a list of potential mechanics.  
5. Contact mechanics to schedule appointments.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify potential mechanics through research. This will be achieved by searching online for mechanics in the local area, focusing on those offering relevant services (e.g., general auto repair).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I will use a web search to find mechanics in the local area. Assuming a generic location (since no specific location is provided), I’ll search for “auto mechanics near me” to compile a list of at least three mechanics with contact information and service details.  

**Search Results (simulated)**:  
- **Mike’s Auto Repair**: Offers general repairs, open 9 AM–5 PM, phone: (555) 123-4567.  
- **City Garage**: Specializes in diagnostics and maintenance, open 8 AM–6 PM, phone: (555) 987-6543.  
- **Precision Auto**: Full-service repairs, open 10 AM–4 PM, phone: (555) 456-7890.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather recommendations from friends or family. This will be achieved by simulating a process of asking trusted contacts for their preferred mechanics.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I’ll simulate reaching out to friends and family to ask for mechanic recommendations.  

**Simulated Recommendations**:  
- Friend 1: Recommends **Mike’s Auto Repair** for quick service and fair pricing.  
- Friend 2: Suggests **City Garage** for their reliable diagnostics.  
- Family Member: Mentions **Precision Auto** but notes their limited hours.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make appointments with a mechanic.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify potential mechanics through research (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather recommendations from friends or family (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Evaluate mechanics using online reviews (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compile a list of potential mechanics (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Contact mechanics to schedule appointments (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate mechanics using online reviews.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate mechanics using online reviews. This will be achieved by checking simulated online review platforms for ratings and feedback on the identified mechanics.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I’ll simulate checking online reviews for the three mechanics identified earlier.  

**Simulated Reviews**:  
- **Mike’s Auto Repair**: 4.5/5 stars (50 reviews), praised for quick service but some mention long wait times.  
- **City Garage**: 4.8/5 stars (75 reviews), highly rated for professionalism and diagnostics.  
- **Precision Auto**: 4.2/5 stars (30 reviews), good service but limited hours noted as a drawback.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the reviews, adjust the subgoal of compiling a list to prioritize mechanics with higher ratings and better availability.  
**Adjusted Subgoal**: Compile a list of potential mechanics, prioritizing **City Garage** and **Mike’s Auto Repair** due to higher ratings and better hours, with **Precision Auto** as a backup.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compile a list of potential mechanics. This will be achieved by organizing the information gathered from research, recommendations, and reviews into a prioritized list.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**List of Potential Mechanics**:  
1. **City Garage**: High ratings (4.8/5), recommended for diagnostics, open 8 AM–6 PM, phone: (555) 987-6543.  
2. **Mike’s Auto Repair**: Good ratings (4.5/5), recommended for quick service, open 9 AM–5 PM, phone: (555) 123-4567.  
3. **Precision Auto** (Backup): Decent ratings (4.2/5), limited hours, open 10 AM–4 PM, phone: (555) 456-7890.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the compiled list of mechanics. This will be achieved by ensuring the list includes all necessary details (contact info, hours, ratings) and aligns with the goal of scheduling appointments.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The compiled list includes contact information, operating hours, and review ratings for all three mechanics. **City Garage** and **Mike’s Auto Repair** are prioritized due to higher ratings and better hours, while **Precision Auto** is a viable backup. The list is valid and ready for the next step of contacting mechanics.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to contact mechanics to schedule appointments. Retrieve information from previous steps relevant to contacting the mechanics, such as their phone numbers and operating hours.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Relevant Information**:  
- **City Garage**: Phone: (555) 987-6543, open 8 AM–6 PM, high ratings (4.8/5).  
- **Mike’s Auto Repair**: Phone: (555) 123-4567, open 9 AM–5 PM, good ratings (4.5/5).  
- **Precision Auto**: Phone: (555) 456-7890, open 10 AM–4 PM, decent ratings (4.2/5).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to contact each mechanic to schedule an appointment. This will be achieved by simulating phone calls to the prioritized mechanics to book an appointment for a general car checkup.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I’ll simulate contacting the mechanics in order of priority:  

1. **City Garage**: Called (555) 987-6543, appointment scheduled for May 28, 2025, at 10 AM for a general checkup.  
2. **Mike’s Auto Repair**: Called (555) 123-4567, appointment scheduled for May 29, 2025, at 2 PM as a backup.  
3. **Precision Auto**: Not contacted, as appointments with higher-priority mechanics were secured.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make appointments with a mechanic (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify potential mechanics through research (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather recommendations from friends or family (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Evaluate mechanics using online reviews (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compile a list of potential mechanics (Completed, adjusted to prioritize City Garage and Mike’s Auto Repair).  
  - Subgoal 5: Contact mechanics to schedule appointments (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
**Summary**: Appointments are scheduled with **City Garage** (May 28, 2025, 10 AM) and **Mike’s Auto Repair** (May 29, 2025, 2 PM).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The plan to make appointments with a mechanic has been completed. Two appointments are scheduled:  
- **City Garage** on May 28, 2025, at 10 AM.  
- **Mike’s Auto Repair** on May 29, 2025, at 2 PM (backup).  
All subgoals were addressed through research, recommendations, reviews, list compilation, and contacting mechanics, following the meta-cognitive action set and specified format.
