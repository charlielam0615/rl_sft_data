**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan to remove tree sap from a car using vinegar, following a structured meta-cognitive approach. The process must adhere to the provided script: (1) Wash the car with soap and hot water, (2) Make a solution of one part white vinegar to one part water, (3) Use a clean rag to apply the vinegar solution to the sap, (4) Rub in a circular motion to lift the sap, and (5) Finish by washing and waxing the car. The constraint is that vinegar must be used. The plan will be developed step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action and following the specified format.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of removing tree sap from the car using vinegar into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare the car surface by cleaning it to remove dirt and debris.  
- Subgoal 2: Create a vinegar-based solution for sap removal.  
- Subgoal 3: Apply the vinegar solution to the tree sap.  
- Subgoal 4: Remove the sap by rubbing it with the solution.  
- Subgoal 5: Clean and protect the car surface after sap removal.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step, highlighting the current goal.

  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the car surface by cleaning it to remove dirt and debris.  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a vinegar-based solution for sap removal.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the vinegar solution to the tree sap.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the sap by rubbing it with the solution.  
  - Subgoal 5: Clean and protect the car surface after sap removal.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the car surface by cleaning it to remove dirt and debris (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the car surface by cleaning it to remove dirt and debris.  
**How to Achieve**: Wash the car using soap and hot water to ensure a clean surface, making it easier for the vinegar solution to work effectively on the sap.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following the script, wash the car with soap and hot water. Use a car wash soap suitable for automotive finishes and hot water to loosen any dirt or grime. Apply the soap with a sponge or microfiber cloth, scrub the car thoroughly, and rinse it with clean water to ensure no residue remains. Dry the car with a clean towel to prepare for the next step.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the car surface is properly prepared for sap removal.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the car is clean and free of dirt or debris that could interfere with the vinegar solution’s effectiveness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the car’s surface, particularly areas with tree sap, to confirm that all dirt and grime have been removed after washing. Ensure the surface is dry and smooth. If any dirt remains, repeat the washing process with soap and hot water to achieve a clean surface.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove tree sap from the car using vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the car surface by cleaning it to remove dirt and debris (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a vinegar-based solution for sap removal.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the vinegar solution to the tree sap.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the sap by rubbing it with the solution.  
  - Subgoal 5: Clean and protect the car surface after sap removal.  
**Current Goal**: Create a vinegar-based solution for sap removal (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create a vinegar-based solution for sap removal.  
**How to Achieve**: Mix one part white vinegar with one part water to create a solution that can effectively break down tree sap.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following the script, prepare a solution by mixing equal parts of white vinegar and water (e.g., 1 cup vinegar with 1 cup water) in a clean container. Stir the mixture to ensure it is well-combined. This solution will be used to soften and remove the tree sap.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Apply the vinegar solution to the tree sap.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a clean rag to apply the vinegar solution directly to the sap-affected areas on the car.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Dip a clean, soft rag (preferably microfiber) into the vinegar-water solution. Apply the solution generously to the tree sap spots on the car’s surface, ensuring the sap is fully saturated. Allow the solution to sit on the sap for a few minutes to soften it.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Remove the sap by rubbing it with the solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Rub the sap in a circular motion using the rag with the vinegar solution to lift it from the car’s surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the rag soaked with the vinegar solution, rub the tree sap in a circular motion. Apply gentle but firm pressure to lift the sap from the surface. If the sap is stubborn, reapply the solution and let it sit for a few more minutes before rubbing again. Continue until all sap is removed.  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure all tree sap has been removed from the car’s surface.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the treated areas to confirm that no sap remains and the surface is clean.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visually inspect and feel the car’s surface where the sap was applied. Ensure no sticky residue or sap remains. If any sap is still present, reapply the vinegar solution and rub again as needed. Once all sap is removed, proceed to the final cleaning step.
