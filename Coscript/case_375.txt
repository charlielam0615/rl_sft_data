### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for signing letters using a marker, following the provided script and constraint. The script includes four steps: using a black or dark-colored marker for contrast, writing clearly in print or cursive, using Chapman stick letters for a personal touch, and decorating with embellishments like hearts or stars. The constraint specifies that a marker must be used. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Signing Letters
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for signing letters with a marker, break down the task into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast.  
2. Write the signature clearly in a chosen style (print or cursive).  
3. Incorporate Chapman stick letters to add a personal touch.  
4. Add decorative embellishments to enhance the signature’s appearance.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the implementation process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Organize and Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Sign letters using a marker.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast.  
  - Subgoal 2: Write the signature clearly in print or cursive.  
  - Subgoal 3: Incorporate Chapman stick letters for a personal touch.  
  - Subgoal 4: Add decorative embellishments to enhance the signature’s appearance.  
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous step, providing context for the next implementation action.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Select a Marker
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast. This will be achieved by choosing a black or dark-colored marker, as specified in the script, to ensure the signature is visually clear on the letter.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose a black or dark-colored marker, such as a black Sharpie or a dark blue felt-tip marker, to ensure high contrast against the paper. Verify that the marker is functional by testing it on a scrap piece of paper to confirm ink flow and clarity.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Verify Marker Selection
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the marker selection. This will be achieved by checking if the chosen marker provides sufficient contrast and functionality for signing the letter.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the selected black or dark-colored marker on a piece of paper similar to the letter’s material. Confirm that the ink is bold, does not smudge, and stands out clearly against the paper. If the marker does not meet these criteria, select an alternative dark-colored marker and repeat the test.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Review Progress on Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Sign letters using a marker.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Write the signature clearly in print or cursive (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Incorporate Chapman stick letters for a personal touch.  
  - Subgoal 4: Add decorative embellishments to enhance the signature’s appearance.  
**Current Goal**: Write the signature clearly in print or cursive.  
Subgoal 1 has been completed with the selection and validation of a suitable marker. The focus now shifts to writing the signature clearly.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Write the Signature
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the signature clearly in print or cursive. This will be achieved by practicing the signature style on scrap paper and then applying it to the letter with the selected marker.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose either print or cursive based on personal preference or the letter’s tone (e.g., print for formal, cursive for personal). Practice the signature on scrap paper to ensure legibility and consistency. Once satisfied, use the selected marker to sign the letter clearly, ensuring the text is neat and readable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Information on Chapman Stick Letters
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate Chapman stick letters for a personal touch. Retrieve information from the script about using Chapman stick letters to understand their role in the task.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies using Chapman stick letters to add a personal touch to the signature. This suggests that Chapman stick letters are a stylized or artistic lettering technique, likely involving bold or decorative letterforms, to make the signature unique and visually appealing. This information will guide the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Incorporate Chapman Stick Letters
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate Chapman stick letters for a personal touch. This will be achieved by researching or designing a Chapman stick letter style and integrating it into the signature.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Research Chapman stick letters, which are likely a bold, hand-drawn lettering style (based on the script’s emphasis on personal touch). Sketch a few letter designs on scrap paper, focusing on bold, stylized forms that complement the signature. Use the selected marker to incorporate these stylized letters into the signature, ensuring they blend with the print or cursive style while adding a unique flair.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals for Decoration
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoal for decoration involves adding embellishments like hearts or stars. To ensure alignment with the personal touch of Chapman stick letters, adjust this subgoal to focus on embellishments that complement the stylized signature, such as small flourishes or symbols that enhance the artistic effect without overwhelming the signature.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Add Decorative Embellishments
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add decorative embellishments to enhance the signature’s appearance. This will be achieved by adding small, tasteful decorations like flourishes, hearts, or stars that complement the Chapman stick letters and signature style.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the selected marker, add small embellishments such as hearts, stars, or subtle flourishes around the signature. Ensure the decorations are proportionate and do not obscure the signature’s legibility. Practice on scrap paper first to confirm the design enhances the overall appearance. Apply the final embellishments to the letter.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Final Review of Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Sign letters using a marker (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate marker for optimal contrast (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Write the signature clearly in print or cursive (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Incorporate Chapman stick letters for a personal touch (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Add decorative embellishments to enhance the signature’s appearance (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the task of signing letters with a marker has been completed according to the script and constraint.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Validate Final Output
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final signed letter. This will be achieved by checking that the signature meets all script requirements (contrast, clarity, Chapman stick letters, embellishments) and the constraint (using a marker).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the signed letter to ensure:  
1. The signature is written with a black or dark-colored marker for high contrast.  
2. The signature is clear and legible in print or cursive.  
3. Chapman stick letters are incorporated for a personal touch.  
4. Embellishments like hearts or stars enhance the appearance without compromising legibility.  
If any aspect is lacking, revisit the relevant step (e.g., re-sign or adjust embellishments). If all criteria are met, the task is complete.  
[/IMP]
