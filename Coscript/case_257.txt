### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for styling hair into a side braid using a comb, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions categorized as Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R). The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The script provided is: 1. Wet your hair, 2. Comb your hair to the side, 3. Gather the hair, 4. Part the hair into 3 sections, 5. Begin braiding by going over the middle strand, 6. Finish with a standard 3-strand braid, 7. Secure the end. The constraint is that a comb must be used.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating a side braid with a comb into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare the hair by wetting it.  
2. Use a comb to position the hair to one side.  
3. Gather the hair into a single section.  
4. Divide the gathered hair into three equal sections using the comb.  
5. Start the braiding process by crossing strands over the middle.  
6. Complete the braid using a standard 3-strand technique.  
7. Secure the braid’s end to maintain the style.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to provide context for the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Create a side braid with a comb.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the hair by wetting it.  
  - Subgoal 2: Use a comb to position the hair to one side.  
  - Subgoal 3: Gather the hair into a single section.  
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the gathered hair into three equal sections using the comb.  
  - Subgoal 5: Start the braiding process by crossing strands over the middle.  
  - Subgoal 6: Complete the braid using a standard 3-strand technique.  
  - Subgoal 7: Secure the braid’s end to maintain the style.  
**Current Goal:** Prepare the hair by wetting it.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare the hair by wetting it. This will be achieved by applying water to the hair to make it more manageable for combing and braiding.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the hair, wet it thoroughly using a spray bottle filled with water or by rinsing it under a faucet. Ensure the hair is damp but not dripping, as this facilitates smooth combing and braiding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the hair is properly prepared (wetted) for the next steps. This will be achieved by checking the hair’s dampness and manageability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the hair is evenly damp by running your fingers through it. It should feel moist but not overly wet, and there should be no dry patches. If necessary, apply more water using the spray bottle to achieve uniform dampness.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals to maintain focus on the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Create a side braid with a comb.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the hair by wetting it (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use a comb to position the hair to one side.  
  - Subgoal 3: Gather the hair into a single section.  
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the gathered hair into three equal sections using the comb.  
  - Subgoal 5: Start the braiding process by crossing strands over the middle.  
  - Subgoal 6: Complete the braid using a standard 3-strand technique.  
  - Subgoal 7: Secure the braid’s end to maintain the style.  
**Current Goal:** Use a comb to position the hair to one side.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to use a comb to position the hair to one side. This will be achieved by combing all the hair to the desired side (left or right) to prepare for gathering and braiding.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a wide-tooth comb, gently comb all the hair to one side (e.g., the right side). Start from the scalp and work through to the ends, ensuring the hair is smooth and tangle-free, positioned neatly to the chosen side.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to gather the hair into a single section. This will be achieved by collecting all the combed hair into a cohesive bundle on the chosen side.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the combed hair with one hand on the chosen side (e.g., right side) near the scalp or lower, depending on where you want the braid to start. Use the comb to smooth any loose strands into the bundle, creating a neat, single section of hair.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to divide the gathered hair into three equal sections using the comb. Retrieve information from previous steps related to ensuring the hair is prepared for this division.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The hair has been wetted (Step 3) to make it manageable, validated for even dampness (Step 4), combed to one side (Step 6), and gathered into a single section (Step 7). These steps ensure the hair is smooth, tangle-free, and properly positioned, which facilitates dividing it into three equal sections using the comb.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to divide the gathered hair into three equal sections using the comb. This will be achieved by using the comb to separate the gathered hair into three even parts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the gathered hair in one hand. Use the comb to divide the hair into three equal sections by creating two partings. Ensure each section is roughly the same thickness by visually checking and adjusting with the comb as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to start the braiding process by crossing strands over the middle. This will be achieved by beginning the standard 3-strand braiding technique.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Label the three sections as left, middle, and right. Take the right section and cross it over the middle section, so the right section becomes the new middle section. Then, take the left section and cross it over the new middle section. Use the comb to smooth the sections if they become uneven during crossing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the remaining subgoals to ensure clarity for the final steps, particularly focusing on completing and securing the braid.  
[/PLANNING]  
The remaining subgoals are clear but can be refined for precision:  
- Subgoal 6: Complete the braid by continuing the 3-strand braiding technique until reaching the desired length.  
- Subgoal 7: Secure the braid’s end using a hair tie or clip to maintain the style.  

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to complete the braid using a standard 3-strand technique. This will be achieved by continuing the braiding process started in the previous step until the desired length is reached.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Continue braiding by alternately crossing the right section over the middle, then the left section over the new middle, maintaining even tension. Use the comb occasionally to smooth any loose strands or maintain section alignment. Braid until the hair reaches the desired length or the end of the hair.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to secure the braid’s end to maintain the style. This will be achieved by using a hair tie or clip to fasten the end of the braid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Once the braid is complete, secure the end with a hair tie or clip. Ensure the tie is tight enough to hold the braid in place but not so tight as to damage the hair. Use the comb to tidy any loose ends or flyaways for a polished look.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been completed.  
[/PLANNING]

  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the hair by wetting it (completed).

### Conclusion
The plan for creating a side braid with a comb has been completed by following the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals from the provided script have been addressed, and the constraint of using a comb has been incorporated throughout the process.
