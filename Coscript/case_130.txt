**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan to remove Babylon Search from a browser, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint of removing it directly from the browser. The solution must use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, until the plan is completed.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Removing Babylon Search

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of removing Babylon Search from the browser into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Open the browser and navigate to the Babylon Search homepage.  
2. Locate and click the "Uninstall" link on the homepage.  
3. Follow the uninstallation prompts to remove Babylon Search.

### Step 2: Organize and Track Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove Babylon Search from the browser.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the browser and navigate to the Babylon Search homepage.  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate and click the "Uninstall" link on the homepage.  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the uninstallation prompts to remove Babylon Search.  

**Current Goal**: Open the browser and navigate to the Babylon Search homepage.  
The goal hierarchy is based on the subgoals defined in the previous step, ensuring all steps align with the provided script and the constraint of removing Babylon Search via the browser.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Execute the First Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the browser and navigate to the Babylon Search homepage. This will be achieved by launching the browser application and entering the Babylon Search URL or accessing it via the browser’s search settings.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Launch your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) by clicking its icon on your desktop or start menu. Once the browser is open, type the URL for the Babylon Search homepage (typically www.babylon.com or a related address) into the address bar and press Enter. Alternatively, if Babylon Search is set as the default search engine, trigger a search to be redirected to its homepage. Ensure the homepage loads correctly to proceed.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Verify Navigation to the Homepage

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the browser has successfully navigated to the Babylon Search homepage. This will be achieved by checking the webpage’s title, URL, or visual elements to ensure it is the correct page.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the browser displays the Babylon Search homepage. Check the URL in the address bar to confirm it matches www.babylon.com or a related Babylon Search domain. Look for visual indicators such as the Babylon Search logo or search bar on the page. If the page does not load or displays an error, try refreshing the page or re-entering the URL.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Execute the Second Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate and click the "Uninstall" link on the Babylon Search homepage. This will be achieved by scrolling to the bottom of the homepage and identifying the link labeled "Uninstall."  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
On the Babylon Search homepage, scroll to the bottom of the page using the mouse wheel or scrollbar. Look for a link labeled "Uninstall" or similar (e.g., "Remove Babylon" or "Uninstall Instructions"). Click the link to initiate the uninstallation process. If the link is not visible, check the footer menu or search the page using Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) with the keyword "uninstall."  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Verify the Uninstall Link Action

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that clicking the "Uninstall" link directs to the correct uninstallation instructions or process. This will be achieved by checking the resulting page or prompt for uninstallation content.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After clicking the "Uninstall" link, verify that the browser redirects to a page or displays a prompt with instructions for removing Babylon Search. Look for text or options related to uninstallation, such as a downloadable tool, browser settings changes, or further links. If the page does not load correctly or lacks uninstallation details, return to the homepage and recheck for the correct link.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Execute the Final Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to follow the uninstallation prompts to remove Babylon Search from the browser. This will be achieved by carefully following the instructions provided after clicking the "Uninstall" link, which may involve browser settings changes or running an uninstaller tool.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Follow the instructions provided on the uninstallation page or prompt. This may include steps such as:  
- Changing the browser’s default search engine to another option (e.g., Google) via the browser’s settings menu.  
- Removing any Babylon Search extensions or add-ons from the browser’s extensions menu.  
- Running a downloadable uninstaller tool if provided, following its prompts to complete the removal.  
Ensure each step is completed carefully, confirming changes in the browser settings or verifying that Babylon Search no longer appears as the default search engine or extension.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8: Review Completed Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove Babylon Search from the browser (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the browser and navigate to the Babylon Search homepage (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate and click the "Uninstall" link on the homepage (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the uninstallation prompts to remove Babylon Search (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed as per the provided script, and the main goal of removing Babylon Search from the browser has been achieved. No further actions are required unless additional issues arise.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Final Validation of Removal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that Babylon Search has been successfully removed from the browser. This will be achieved by checking the browser’s search engine settings and extensions to ensure no traces of Babylon Search remain.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the browser’s settings menu and navigate to the search engine settings (e.g., in Chrome: Settings > Search Engine; in Firefox: Options > Search). Verify that Babylon Search is no longer listed as the default search engine. Next, check the extensions or add-ons menu (e.g., in Chrome: More Tools > Extensions; in Firefox: Add-ons and Themes) to ensure no Babylon Search extensions remain. Perform a test search to confirm that Babylon Search does not appear. If any traces are found, revisit the uninstallation instructions or manually remove the remaining components.  

[/IMP]

### Step 10: Recall Information for Final Confirmation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the successful removal of Babylon Search by recalling the steps taken and their outcomes, ensuring all script steps were followed correctly.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 3: Launched the browser and navigated to the Babylon Search homepage.  
- Step 4: Validated that the correct homepage was loaded.  
- Step 5: Located and clicked the "Uninstall" link on the homepage.  
- Step 6: Verified that the uninstallation page or prompt was accessed.  
- Step 7: Followed the uninstallation prompts, which included changing search engine settings and removing extensions.  
- Step 9: Validated the removal by checking browser settings and performing a test search.  
All steps align with the provided script: launching the browser and opening the Babylon Search homepage, clicking the "Uninstall" link, and following the prompts. The constraint of removing Babylon Search via the browser was adhered to, and no issues were noted in the process.  

[/REVIEW]
