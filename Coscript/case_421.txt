**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the spring-form pan  
**How to Achieve**: Grease and line a 20 cm (7.9 in) round spring-form pan to ensure the cheesecake can be easily removed after setting.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Grease the inside of a 20 cm (7.9 in) round spring-form pan with butter or non-stick spray. Line the base with parchment paper, ensuring it fits snugly. Secure the pan’s sides to hold the paper in place. This prepares the pan for the Oreo crust and cheesecake assembly.  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the spring-form pan  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the pan is properly greased and lined to prevent sticking and ensure easy removal of the cheesecake.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the spring-form pan to confirm the interior is evenly greased and the parchment paper is securely placed on the base without wrinkles. Test the pan’s latch to ensure it closes tightly, preventing leaks during assembly.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Create the Oreo cookie crust  
**How to Achieve**: Melt butter, process Oreo cookies and shortbread biscuits with the melted butter in a food processor, and press the mixture into the base of the prepared pan to form the crust.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Melt 100g of butter in a microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop. In a food processor, combine 200g of Oreo cookies (with filling) and 100g of shortbread biscuits, processing until finely crumbed. Add the melted butter and process until combined. Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the base of the prepared spring-form pan to form a smooth crust.  

[/IMP]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Chill the crust  
**How to Achieve**: Place the pan with the Oreo crust into the refrigerator to set, preferably covered to avoid contamination.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cover the spring-form pan with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent odors from affecting the crust. Place the pan in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the Oreo crust to firm up.  

[/IMP]

**Step 7: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the cheesecake filling preparation, focusing on the ingredients and steps involving cream cheese, sugar, and Toblerone.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the cheesecake filling with cream cheese, sugar, and Toblerone  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From the script: Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer (Step 6). Melt Toblerone using a double boiler or microwave (Step 7).  
- Relevant details: These steps involve combining cream cheese and sugar to form a smooth base and melting Toblerone to incorporate its flavor into the filling, critical for the cheesecake’s texture and taste.

**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the cheesecake filling with cream cheese, sugar, and Toblerone  
**How to Achieve**: Beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth, then incorporate melted Toblerone into the mixture.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat 500g of softened cream cheese and 100g of caster sugar until smooth and creamy. Melt 200g of milk Toblerone in a microwave (in 30-second intervals, stirring between) or using a double boiler until fully melted. Gradually fold the melted Toblerone into the cream cheese mixture, mixing until fully combined.

**How to Achieve**: Whip the cream to soft peaks to incorporate air, ensuring a light and creamy cheesecake filling.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a separate bowl, whip 300ml of heavy cream using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese and Toblerone mixture to create a light, airy filling.
