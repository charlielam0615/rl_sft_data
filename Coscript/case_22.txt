**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to back up and transfer OpenOffice or LibreOffice settings by saving them to an external device, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, based on the action’s category.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of backing up and transferring OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.  
- Subgoal 1: Locate the settings folder in the user’s system.  
- Subgoal 2: Back up the settings folder to an external device.  
- Subgoal 3: Install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system.  
- Subgoal 4: Transfer the backed-up settings to the new system.  
- Subgoal 5: Verify the settings are applied correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the previous planning step.  
- **Goal**: Back up and transfer OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings to an external device.  
  - Subgoal 1: Locate the settings folder in the user’s system.  
  - Subgoal 2: Back up the settings folder to an external device.  
  - Subgoal 3: Install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system.  
  - Subgoal 4: Transfer the backed-up settings to the new system.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the settings are applied correctly.  
**Current Goal**: Locate the settings folder in the user’s system.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate the settings folder in the user’s system. This will be achieved by navigating to the directory C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3, where the “user” folder containing settings is stored.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Navigate to the directory C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3 using File Explorer on Windows. Replace <your_username> with the actual username and <OpenOffice/LibreOffice> with the specific software name (e.g., LibreOffice). Locate the “user” folder, which contains settings, autocorrection rules, templates, and extensions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the correct “user” folder has been located. This will be achieved by checking the folder path and confirming it contains configuration files like registrymodifications.xcu.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open the “user” folder located at C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3. Verify the presence of key configuration files, such as registrymodifications.xcu, to confirm it is the correct folder containing OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to back up the settings folder to an external device. This will be achieved by copying the “user” folder to a connected external storage device, such as a USB drive.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Connect an external storage device (e.g., USB drive) to the computer. In File Explorer, right-click the “user” folder at C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3, select “Copy,” navigate to the external device, and select “Paste” to back up the folder.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress:  
- **Goal**: Back up and transfer OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings to an external device.  
  - Subgoal 1: Locate the settings folder in the user’s system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Back up the settings folder to an external device (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system.  
  - Subgoal 4: Transfer the backed-up settings to the new system.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the settings are applied correctly.  
**Current Goal**: Install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system. This will be achieved by downloading and installing the software from the official website.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
On the target system, visit the official OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org) or LibreOffice (www.libreoffice.org) website. Download the latest version of the software compatible with the system. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to transfer the backed-up settings to the new system. This will be achieved by copying the “user” folder from the external device to the appropriate directory on the target system.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Connect the external device to the target system. Navigate to C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3 on the target system using File Explorer. Delete or rename the existing “user” folder, then copy the backed-up “user” folder from the external device to this directory.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the settings are applied correctly. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the settings transfer process to ensure all necessary actions were completed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- Located the “user” folder at C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\<OpenOffice/LibreOffice>\3 (Step 3).  
- Validated the folder contains configuration files like registrymodifications.xcu (Step 4).  
- Backed up the “user” folder to an external device (Step 5).  
- Installed OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system (Step 7).  
- Transferred the “user” folder to the target system’s corresponding directory (Step 8).  
This confirms all steps leading to the settings transfer have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the settings are applied correctly on the target system. This will be achieved by opening OpenOffice/LibreOffice and checking that settings, templates, and extensions are intact.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open OpenOffice or LibreOffice on the target system. Check that user-specific settings (e.g., autocorrection rules, templates, or extensions) are present and functional. For example, open a document to confirm autocorrection works or verify that custom templates are available.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Final update to the goal-management system:  
- **Goal**: Back up and transfer OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings to an external device.  
  - Subgoal 1: Locate the settings folder in the user’s system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Back up the settings folder to an external device (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Install OpenOffice/LibreOffice on the target system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Transfer the backed-up settings to the new system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the settings are applied correctly (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The process of backing up and transferring OpenOffice/LibreOffice settings is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The plan has been fully executed, covering all steps in the provided script while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set and format requirements. Each step used a single action from the Planning, Implementation, or Review categories, with appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks.
