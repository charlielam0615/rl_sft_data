### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of making napkin rings with hot glue into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:
- Subgoal 1: Acquire plain napkin rings as the base material.
- Subgoal 2: Obtain hot glue and a glue gun for decoration.
- Subgoal 3: Select decorative materials for the napkin rings.
- Subgoal 4: Attach decorations to the napkin rings using hot glue.
- Subgoal 5: Allow the glue to set to ensure the decorations are secure.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Acquire plain napkin rings as the base material.
- **How to Achieve**: Purchase or gather plain napkin rings from a craft store, online retailer, or existing household items.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of acquiring plain napkin rings, check local craft stores like Michaels or Joann for affordable plain wooden, metal, or plastic napkin rings. Alternatively, search online on platforms like Amazon or Etsy for bulk options. If available, repurpose old napkin rings from home to save costs. Ensure the napkin rings are sturdy and suitable for decoration with hot glue.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Obtain hot glue and a glue gun for decoration.
- **How to Achieve**: Purchase a hot glue gun and glue sticks from a craft store or online, ensuring they are compatible and safe for use.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Visit a craft store like Hobby Lobby or order a hot glue gun and glue sticks from Amazon. Choose a glue gun with a low-temperature setting for safety and standard glue sticks suitable for bonding decorations to napkin rings. Verify that the glue gun is in working condition and has enough glue sticks for the project.

### Step 4: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Make napkin rings with hot glue.
  - Subgoal 1: Acquire plain napkin rings as the base material (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Obtain hot glue and a glue gun for decoration (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select decorative materials for the napkin rings (Pending).
  - Subgoal 4: Attach decorations to the napkin rings using hot glue (Pending).
  - Subgoal 5: Allow the glue to set to ensure the decorations are secure (Pending).

**Current Goal**: Select decorative materials for the napkin rings.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Select decorative materials for the napkin rings.
- **How to Achieve**: Choose aesthetically pleasing and glue-compatible decorations such as beads, ribbons, or fabric that suit the desired design theme.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Decide on a design theme (e.g., rustic, elegant, or seasonal). Select decorations like small beads, ribbon strips, faux flowers, or fabric scraps from a craft store or household supplies. Ensure materials are lightweight and have surfaces that hot glue can adhere to, such as wood, fabric, or plastic. Gather enough decorations for all napkin rings, considering color coordination and quantity.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the selected decorations are suitable for attachment with hot glue.
- **How to Achieve**: Test the compatibility of decorations with hot glue and verify they enhance the napkin rings’ appearance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test a small amount of hot glue on a sample decoration to confirm it adheres well without melting or damaging the material. Check that the decorations complement the napkin rings’ size and style, ensuring they are not too heavy or bulky. Adjust selections if any materials fail the test or do not align with the design vision.
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Attach decorations to the napkin rings using hot glue.
- **How to Achieve**: Use the hot glue gun to securely attach decorations to the napkin rings, following the chosen design.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Heat the glue gun to the appropriate temperature. Apply small amounts of hot glue to the napkin ring surface, then carefully press the decorations into place, holding them briefly to ensure a strong bond. Work in a well-ventilated area and arrange decorations evenly for a balanced look. Complete all napkin rings, ensuring consistency in the design.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Allow the glue to set to ensure the decorations are secure.
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to the hot glue setting process and ensuring decoration stability.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
From previous steps, hot glue was selected as the adhesive for attaching decorations (Step 3). The glue gun should be used at a low-temperature setting for safety (Step 3), and decorations were tested for compatibility (Step 6). To ensure stability, the glue must fully set after application, which typically requires a short drying period to secure the bond between decorations and napkin rings.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Allow the glue to set to ensure the decorations are secure.
- **How to Achieve**: Let the napkin rings sit undisturbed for sufficient time to allow the hot glue to fully harden.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place the decorated napkin rings on a flat, stable surface in a cool, dry area. Allow them to sit undisturbed for at least 10-15 minutes, or as recommended by the glue stick packaging, to ensure the hot glue fully sets. Check that decorations are firmly attached by gently testing one ring before use.
[/IMP]
