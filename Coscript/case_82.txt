### Step 3: Prepare the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to prepare the hide for tanning. This involves cleaning and fleshing the hide to remove hair, fat, and membranes, ensuring it is ready for the tanning solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the hide:  
- Scrape off hair, fat, and membranes using a fleshing knife or similar tool.  
- Rinse the hide thoroughly with water to remove debris.  
- Soak the hide in a salt solution (1:10 salt-to-water ratio) for 24 hours to preserve it and remove moisture.  
- Rinse again to remove excess salt before tanning.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate Preparation Step
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to validate that the hide is properly prepared for tanning. This involves checking that the hide is clean, free of hair, fat, and membranes, and properly preserved.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the hide to ensure:  
- No hair, fat, or membranes remain on the surface.  
- The hide feels clean and slightly pliable after rinsing.  
- No strong odors or visible debris are present.  
If any issues are found, repeat scraping or rinsing as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Soak the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to soak the hide in the tanning solution. This involves submerging the hide in a prepared tanning solution to chemically treat and preserve it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To soak the hide:  
- Prepare a tanning solution (e.g., a commercial tannin-based solution or a natural solution like bark tea).  
- Submerge the hide completely in the solution in a non-reactive container (e.g., plastic or wooden barrel).  
- Stir occasionally and ensure the hide remains submerged for 2–7 days, depending on the solution’s instructions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Progress of Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Tan a hide by soaking it in a tanning solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the hide for tanning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the hide in the tanning solution (In Progress).  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove the hide from the solution.  
  - Subgoal 4: Wash the hide to remove excess solution.  
  - Subgoal 5: Dry the hide to set the tanning.  
  - Subgoal 6: Oil the hide to soften it.  
  - Subgoal 7: Stretch the hide to ensure flexibility and shape.  
**Current Goal**: Soak the hide in the tanning solution.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Adjust Soaking Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Adjust the soaking subgoal to include monitoring the tanning process to ensure proper absorption of the solution. Add a checkpoint to test the hide’s tanning progress (e.g., cut a small piece to check if the solution has penetrated fully).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8: Remove the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to remove the hide from the tanning solution. This involves carefully taking the hide out and checking its condition to ensure it has tanned properly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To remove the hide:  
- Lift the hide from the tanning solution using gloves to avoid skin contact with chemicals.  
- Allow excess solution to drip off into the container.  
- Cut a small section of the hide to check if the tanning solution has penetrated fully (the cut should show consistent color and texture throughout).  
- If tanning is incomplete, return the hide to the solution for additional time.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Information for Washing
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to wash the hide. Retrieve information related to washing the hide to remove excess tanning solution, focusing on methods used after soaking.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Previous information related to washing:  
- From Step 3 (Prepare the Hide): The hide was rinsed with water to remove debris and salt after soaking in a salt solution.  
- Implication: Washing after tanning likely involves similar rinsing to remove excess tanning solution, ensuring the hide is clean before drying.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Wash the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to wash the hide to remove excess tanning solution. This involves rinsing the hide thoroughly to ensure no residual chemicals remain.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To wash the hide:  
- Rinse the hide under running water or soak it in clean water, changing the water multiple times until it runs clear.  
- Gently agitate the hide to remove residual tanning solution.  
- Check that the hide feels clean and free of slippery residue.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Dry the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to dry the hide to set the tanning. This involves air-drying the hide in a controlled environment to prevent cracking or stiffness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To dry the hide:  
- Hang the hide in a shaded, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources.  
- Ensure the hide is spread out evenly to avoid wrinkles.  
- Allow it to dry slowly over 1–3 days, checking periodically to ensure it remains pliable and does not harden excessively.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Oil the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to oil the hide to soften it. This involves applying a suitable oil to restore flexibility and prevent brittleness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To oil the hide:  
- Apply a tanning oil (e.g., neatsfoot oil or a commercial leather conditioner) evenly across the hide’s surface.  
- Work the oil into the hide using a soft cloth or hands, ensuring thorough coverage.  
- Allow the oil to absorb for 12–24 hours, adding more if the hide appears dry.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Stretch the Hide
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to stretch the hide to ensure flexibility and shape. This involves physically working the hide to make it soft and pliable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To stretch the hide:  
- Pull and stretch the hide gently by hand or over a smooth, rounded surface (e.g., a wooden frame or stake).  
- Work the hide in all directions to break down stiff fibers, continuing until it feels soft and flexible.  
- Check for uniform texture and elasticity across the hide.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Track Final Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Tan a hide by soaking it in a tanning solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the hide for tanning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Soak the hide in the tanning solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove the hide from the solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Wash the hide to remove excess solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Dry the hide to set the tanning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Oil the hide to soften it (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 7: Stretch the hide to ensure flexibility and shape (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; the hide is tanned and ready for use.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 15: Validate Final Outcome
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to validate the final outcome of the tanning process. This involves checking that the hide is properly tanned, soft, flexible, and free of defects.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the hide to ensure:  
- The hide is soft, flexible, and evenly tanned with no hard or brittle areas.  
- The surface is smooth and free of cracks or discoloration.  
- The hide has a consistent texture and no residual odors from the tanning solution.  
If defects are found, consider backtracking to re-oil or re-stretch the hide.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16: Backtrack if Necessary
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
If the validation step reveals issues (e.g., stiffness or uneven tanning), return to the oiling or stretching steps to correct them. Since the validation step confirmed the hide is properly tanned, no backtracking is needed at this time.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Final Outcome**: The hide has been successfully tanned by soaking it in a tanning solution, following the provided script. All subgoals have been completed, and the final validation confirms the hide is soft, flexible, and ready for use in hobbies and crafts.
