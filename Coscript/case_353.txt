### Step 2: Organize and Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, integrating information from the recent planning step, and stating the current goal:  
- **Main Goal**: Write the date in French on a worksheet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and follow the worksheet's instructions for writing the date.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the correct format and vocabulary for writing the date in French.  
  - Subgoal 3: Write the date in French on the worksheet.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the accuracy of the written date.  
**Current Goal**: Understand and follow the worksheet's instructions for writing the date.

- **How to Achieve**: Review the worksheet to identify any specific instructions regarding format, placement, or style for writing the date, and prepare to apply them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume the worksheet specifies writing the date in French at the top of the page in the format "day of the week, day number, month, year" (e.g., "lundi 26 mai 2025"). Read and interpret these instructions to ensure the date is written as required.

The standard French date format is: [day of the week], [day number] [month] [year]. For example, for May 26, 2025, which is a Monday, the date is written as "lundi 26 mai 2025." Key vocabulary:  
- Days: lundi (Monday), mardi (Tuesday), etc.  
- Months: janvier, février, mars, avril, mai, juin, juillet, août, septembre, octobre, novembre, décembre.
