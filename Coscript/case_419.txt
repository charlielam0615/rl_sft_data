### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the previous planning step, and state the current goal.  

- **Main Goal**: Make vanilla ice cream without an ice cream maker using egg yolks.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Prepare the custard base.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Thicken the custard base.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Chill the custard base.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Incorporate whipped cream.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Freeze the mixture.  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare the custard base (Subgoal 1).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the custard base. This will be achieved by completing the following recipe steps: separate 5–8 egg yolks, whisk them with salt and sugar, heat 1 cup (240 mL) of evaporated milk to a simmer, add vanilla, and slowly whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Separate 5–8 egg yolks**: Crack eggs carefully, separating yolks from whites, and place 5–8 yolks in a bowl.  
- **Whisk with salt and sugar**: Add a pinch of salt and approximately ¾ cup (150 g) of sugar to the yolks. Whisk until smooth and pale.  
- **Heat evaporated milk**: In a saucepan, heat 1 cup (240 mL) of evaporated milk over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer.  
- **Add vanilla**: Stir in 1–2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the simmering milk.  
- **Combine mixtures**: Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously to temper the eggs and prevent curdling.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the custard base preparation is valid. This involves checking that the egg yolks are properly separated, the yolk mixture is smooth, the milk is heated correctly, and the tempering process is successful.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Verify that 5–8 egg yolks are separated without traces of whites.  
- Confirm the yolk, salt, and sugar mixture is smooth and pale, indicating proper emulsification.  
- Check that the evaporated milk reached a simmer (small bubbles forming) without boiling over.  
- Ensure the vanilla is evenly mixed into the milk.  
- Confirm the milk was added slowly to the egg mixture while whisking, resulting in a smooth, lump-free custard base.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to thicken the custard base. This will be achieved by heating the combined egg and milk mixture until it thickens to a custard-like consistency.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Pour the combined egg and milk mixture back into the saucepan.  
- Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (approximately 170–175°F or 77–79°C).  
- Avoid boiling to prevent curdling.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the custard base has thickened correctly. This involves checking the consistency and temperature of the mixture.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Check that the custard coats the back of a spoon and holds a line when a finger is drawn through it.  
- Verify the temperature is around 170–175°F (77–79°C) using a thermometer, if available.  
- Ensure no curdling has occurred (no lumps or grainy texture).
