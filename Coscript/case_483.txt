### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select and prepare short ribs.  
**How to Achieve:** Choose high-quality short ribs, cut them into individual pieces, rinse to remove bone fragments, and trim excess fat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select fresh, well-marbled short ribs from a butcher or grocery store. Cut the ribs into individual portions, ensuring each piece is manageable for cooking. Rinse the ribs under cold water to remove any bone fragments or debris. Trim excess fat to ensure a balanced flavor and texture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select and prepare short ribs.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that the short ribs are properly selected, cut, rinsed, and trimmed to meet quality standards for Galbi preparation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the short ribs to ensure they are fresh and well-marbled, with no off-odors. Confirm that the ribs are cut into uniform individual pieces suitable for marinating and cooking. Check that all bone fragments are removed after rinsing and that excess fat has been trimmed without removing the marbling essential for flavor.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Create and apply the marinade.  
**How to Achieve:** Combine ingredients for a traditional Galbi marinade and apply it to the prepared short ribs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Prepare a marinade by combining soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, onion, pear (grated for tenderness), sesame seeds, and black pepper in a bowl. Mix thoroughly until the sugar dissolves. Place the prepared short ribs in a large bowl or resealable bag, pour the marinade over the ribs, and ensure all pieces are evenly coated.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Create and apply the marinade.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that the marinade is properly mixed and evenly applied to the short ribs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check that the marinade has a balanced consistency, with no undissolved sugar or uneven ingredient distribution. Verify that all short ribs are fully coated with the marinade by inspecting each piece. Ensure the ribs are placed in a suitable container (bowl or bag) for marinating.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make Galbi in a traditional clay pot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select and prepare short ribs (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create and apply the marinade (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Marinate the short ribs for at least 6 hours.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cook the short ribs in an oven-safe dish at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
  - Subgoal 5: Serve the cooked Galbi in a traditional clay pot.  
**Current Goal:** Marinate the short ribs for at least 6 hours.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Marinate the short ribs for at least 6 hours.  
**How to Achieve:** Place the marinated short ribs in a refrigerator for at least 6 hours to allow flavors to penetrate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Cover the bowl of marinated short ribs or seal the resealable bag, and place it in the refrigerator. Set a timer for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight, to ensure the ribs absorb the marinade flavors fully. Occasionally turn the ribs or bag to ensure even marination.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make Galbi in a traditional clay pot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select and prepare short ribs (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create and apply the marinade (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Marinate the short ribs for at least 6 hours (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Cook the short ribs in an oven-safe dish at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
  - Subgoal 5: Serve the cooked Galbi in a traditional clay pot.  
**Current Goal:** Cook the short ribs in an oven-safe dish at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The constraint requires using a traditional clay pot, but the script specifies cooking in an oven-safe dish. Adjust Subgoal 4 to incorporate the traditional clay pot for cooking, ensuring compatibility with oven use, and update Subgoal 5 to reflect serving directly from the clay pot.  
**Updated Subgoals:**  
- Subgoal 4: Cook the short ribs in a traditional clay pot at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
- Subgoal 5: Serve the cooked Galbi directly from the traditional clay pot.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 12: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Core Content:** Information related to cooking Galbi in a traditional clay pot.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The constraint emphasizes using a traditional clay pot. Previous steps indicate the short ribs are marinated and ready for cooking. A traditional clay pot (e.g., Korean ttukbaegi) can be used in an oven if it is oven-safe, but care must be taken to avoid thermal shock. The cooking temperature (375°F) and time (30–45 minutes) from the script remain applicable.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Cook the short ribs in a traditional clay pot at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
**How to Achieve:** Preheat the oven, place the marinated short ribs in an oven-safe traditional clay pot, and bake as specified.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Ensure the traditional clay pot is oven-safe to prevent cracking. Place the marinated short ribs in the clay pot, arranging them evenly. Cover the pot with a lid or foil to retain moisture. Bake in the oven for 30–45 minutes, checking for doneness (ribs should be tender and caramelized).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Cook the short ribs in a traditional clay pot at 375°F for 30–45 minutes.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that the oven is at the correct temperature, the clay pot is suitable, and the ribs are cooked properly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm the oven is preheated to 375°F using an oven thermometer. Verify the clay pot is oven-safe and free of cracks. After baking, check that the short ribs are tender, with a caramelized exterior and an internal temperature of at least 145°F (for safety, though tenderness is the priority for Galbi).  
[/IMP]
