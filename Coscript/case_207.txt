### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for managing an iTunes playlist by rating songs, following the provided script and constraints. The script includes four steps: (1) Rate songs in iTunes, (2) Create a playlist, (3) Sort the playlist by rating, and (4) Delete songs from the playlist. The solution must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To manage an iTunes playlist by rating songs, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Assign ratings to songs in the iTunes library.  
2. Create a new playlist in iTunes.  
3. Sort the playlist based on song ratings.  
4. Remove songs from the playlist as needed.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the planning process.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Assign ratings to songs in the iTunes library.  
- **How to Achieve:** Open iTunes, navigate to the music library, select songs, and assign ratings (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) based on user preference or criteria.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In iTunes, go to the "Music" section and select "Songs" view. For each song, right-click and choose "Song Info," then assign a rating from 1 to 5 stars in the "Details" tab. Alternatively, use the "Rating" column in the song list to set ratings directly. Repeat for all songs intended for the playlist.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure ratings are correctly assigned to songs.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the iTunes library to confirm that songs have the intended ratings and that the ratings are visible in the song list.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In iTunes, switch to the "Songs" view and enable the "Rating" column (View > View Options > Rating). Scroll through the library to verify that each song has a rating (e.g., 1–5 stars) as assigned. If any song lacks a rating or has an incorrect rating, update it by right-clicking and adjusting in "Song Info."
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create a new playlist in iTunes.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use iTunes’ playlist creation feature to create a new playlist and add songs based on their ratings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In iTunes, go to File > New > Playlist, and name it (e.g., "High-Rated Songs"). To add songs, create a Smart Playlist (File > New > Smart Playlist), set the rule to “Rating is greater than X stars” (e.g., 3 stars), and enable “Live updating” to automatically include songs meeting the criteria. Click "OK" to generate the playlist.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Manage an iTunes playlist by rating songs.  
  - Subgoal 1: Assign ratings to songs in iTunes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a new playlist in iTunes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sort the playlist based on song ratings (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Delete songs from the playlist as needed (Pending).  
**Current Goal:** Sort the playlist based on song ratings.  
The first two subgoals have been addressed by rating songs and creating a playlist. The focus now shifts to sorting the playlist by rating to ensure high-rated songs are prioritized.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Sort the playlist based on song ratings.  
- **How to Achieve:** Access the playlist in iTunes and apply a sort function to order songs by their star ratings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In iTunes, open the created playlist (e.g., “High-Rated Songs”). Click View > View Options, ensure the “Rating” column is enabled, then click the “Rating” column header to sort songs in descending order (highest-rated first). Alternatively, if using a Smart Playlist, the songs are already filtered by rating, but manual sorting can refine the order further.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm the playlist is sorted correctly by rating.  
- **How to Achieve:** Visually inspect the playlist to ensure songs are ordered from highest to lowest rating.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the playlist view, verify that songs are arranged in descending order of rating (e.g., 5-star songs at the top, followed by 4-star, etc.). If the order is incorrect, re-click the “Rating” column header to toggle the sort direction. Check a few songs to confirm their ratings match the displayed order.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Delete songs from the playlist as needed.  
- **How to Achieve:** Review the playlist and remove songs that no longer fit the user’s criteria or preferences.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the playlist, select any song that should be removed (e.g., songs with lower ratings or irrelevant genres). Right-click and choose “Remove from Playlist” (ensuring not to select “Delete from Library” unless intended). Repeat for all songs to be removed, refining the playlist to meet preferences.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Retrieve information related to the process of managing the iTunes playlist, focusing on the steps taken to rate, create, sort, and refine the playlist.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:**  
- **Rating Songs:** Songs were rated in iTunes using the “Song Info” option or the “Rating” column, assigning 1–5 stars (Step 2).  
- **Creating Playlist:** A Smart Playlist was created with a rule to include songs above a certain rating, ensuring dynamic updates (Step 4).  
- **Sorting Playlist:** The playlist was sorted by rating in descending order using the “Rating” column header (Step 6).  
- **Deleting Songs:** Songs were removed from the playlist by right-clicking and selecting “Remove from Playlist” (Step 8).  
This information confirms that all subgoals from the script have been addressed, completing the task of managing the iTunes playlist by rating songs.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Manage an iTunes playlist by rating songs.  
  - Subgoal 1: Assign ratings to songs in iTunes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a new playlist in iTunes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sort the playlist based on song ratings (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Delete songs from the playlist as needed (Completed).  
**Current Goal:** None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals from the script have been successfully completed, resulting in a managed iTunes playlist sorted by ratings with unwanted songs removed.
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to manage an iTunes playlist by rating songs has been completed through a series of meta-cognitive actions, following the provided script and constraints. All subgoals—rating songs, creating a playlist, sorting by rating, and deleting songs—have been addressed, as confirmed by the final goal-tracking step.
