### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To effectively cut good layered bangs at home, break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to achieve well-cut, layered bangs while adhering to the constraint of performing the task at home. Subgoals include:  
1. Gather necessary tools and resources for cutting bangs.  
2. Identify or recruit a skilled person (friend or family member) to assist.  
3. Learn the technique for cutting layered bangs.  
4. Execute the cutting process safely and accurately.  
5. Verify the outcome and make adjustments if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather necessary tools and resources for cutting bangs. This will be achieved by identifying and collecting essential items such as sharp hair-cutting scissors, a comb, hair clips, a mirror, and a spray bottle for water, all available at home.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To gather the necessary tools:  
- Locate a pair of sharp, professional hair-cutting scissors (or ensure regular scissors are clean and sharp).  
- Find a fine-tooth comb for sectioning hair.  
- Collect hair clips or ties to hold hair in place.  
- Ensure a well-lit mirror is available for visibility.  
- Prepare a spray bottle with water to dampen hair for easier cutting.  
Check household items or a home beauty kit to confirm availability. If any item is missing, consider improvising (e.g., using a clean, sharp pair of regular scissors if hair-cutting scissors are unavailable).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cut good layered bangs at home.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools and resources (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify or recruit a skilled person to assist.  
  - Subgoal 3: Learn the technique for cutting layered bangs.  
  - Subgoal 4: Execute the cutting process safely and accurately.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the outcome and make adjustments if needed.  
**Current Goal**: Identify or recruit a skilled person to assist.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the forward subgoaling from Step 1, with the first subgoal completed in Step 2. The focus now shifts to finding a friend or family member with hair-cutting experience to ensure the task is performed effectively at home.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify or recruit a skilled person to assist with cutting bangs. This will be achieved by contacting a friend or family member who has experience cutting hair and is available to help at home.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Contact friends or family members via phone, text, or in-person conversation to inquire if anyone has experience cutting hair, particularly bangs. Explain the need for assistance in cutting layered bangs at home. If someone is available, confirm their willingness to help and schedule a time. If no one has experience, consider proceeding with self-cutting after researching techniques, but prioritize finding assistance to align with the provided script.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to learn the technique for cutting layered bangs. Retrieve information related to the process of cutting layered bangs, focusing on techniques suitable for home use with assistance.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information for learning the technique:  
- From the script (provided): Steps include finding a skilled person to help, following their instructions, and cutting bangs to the desired length and style.  
- Implied from Step 2: Tools like sharp scissors, a comb, clips, a mirror, and a spray bottle are prepared, which will support the cutting process.  
- General knowledge: Layered bangs require sectioning hair, cutting at an angle for layering, and ensuring evenness by working with small sections of damp hair.  
This information suggests that the technique involves following the assistant’s guidance, using prepared tools, and cutting small sections at a time to achieve a layered effect.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to learn the technique for cutting layered bangs. This will be achieved by studying a reliable method (e.g., online tutorials or assistant’s guidance) and practicing the steps under supervision of the recruited person.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With the help of the recruited friend or family member:  
- Watch a brief, reputable online tutorial on cutting layered bangs (e.g., YouTube or beauty blogs) to understand sectioning, angling, and cutting techniques.  
- Discuss the desired bang style (length, layering intensity) with the assistant.  
- Practice the technique on a small, non-visible section of hair (if possible) or follow the assistant’s instructions to section hair, dampen it with the spray bottle, and prepare for cutting.  
Ensure the assistant supervises to avoid mistakes and confirm the technique aligns with achieving layered bangs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to execute the cutting process safely and accurately. This will be achieved by following the assistant’s instructions, using the gathered tools, and cutting the bangs to the desired layered style.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Under the assistant’s guidance:  
- Section the bangs using the comb and clips, isolating the hair to be cut.  
- Dampen the hair lightly with the spray bottle for better control.  
- Cut small sections at a time, holding scissors at a slight angle to create layering, as advised by the assistant or tutorial.  
- Check progress in the mirror frequently to ensure evenness and desired length.  
- Follow the assistant’s feedback to adjust cuts, ensuring the bangs are layered and styled as intended.  
Work slowly to avoid over-cutting, and keep the workspace well-lit for accuracy.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the outcome of the bang-cutting process. This will be achieved by checking the bangs for evenness, length, and layering, and making minor adjustments if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Examine the bangs in the mirror, ensuring they are even, layered as desired, and match the intended style.  
- Ask the assistant for feedback on the appearance and any areas needing improvement.  
- If minor adjustments are needed (e.g., uneven sections or excess length), carefully trim small amounts using the same angled cutting technique.  
- Style the bangs (e.g., blow-dry or comb into place) to confirm the final look is satisfactory.  
If significant issues are found, consider consulting the assistant for further guidance or researching additional tips online.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cut good layered bangs at home (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools and resources (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify or recruit a skilled person to assist (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Learn the technique for cutting layered bangs (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Execute the cutting process safely and accurately (completed).

**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The goal hierarchy confirms that all subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal of cutting good layered bangs at home has been achieved. The process involved gathering tools, recruiting assistance, learning and executing the technique, and validating the outcome, all within the constraint of performing the task at home.  
[/REVIEW]

**Conclusion**: The plan to cut good layered bangs at home has been completed through a structured sequence of meta-cognitive actions. All subgoals were addressed, and the final outcome was validated, ensuring the task was performed effectively with the assistance of a skilled friend or family member, as per the provided script and constraint.
