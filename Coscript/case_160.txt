### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for grooming an Affenpinscher using a pin brush, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint of using a pin brush. The plan must be developed step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) as outlined, with each step selecting one action from the set and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks based on the action's category.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To groom an Affenpinscher with a pin brush, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Prepare tools and start grooming at the head.  
2. Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush.  
3. Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body.  
4. Complete grooming by brushing the tail.  
These subgoals align with the script and ensure the constraint of using a pin brush is met.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context and focus on the current subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Groom an Affenpinscher with a pin brush.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare tools and start grooming at the head. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush.  
  - Subgoal 3: Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body.  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete grooming by brushing the tail.  
**Current Goal:** Prepare tools and start grooming at the head.  
This provides a clear structure for proceeding with the first grooming step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare tools and start grooming at the head. This involves gathering a soft pin brush for the head and ensuring the Affenpinscher is calm and positioned for grooming.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather a soft pin brush suitable for the Affenpinscher’s head. Ensure the dog is calm, possibly by offering a treat or speaking soothingly. Position the dog on a stable surface and begin brushing gently at the head, focusing on the fur around the ears and face.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the head grooming was performed correctly using a soft pin brush and that the Affenpinscher remains comfortable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the head fur is smooth and free of tangles after brushing. Confirm the soft pin brush was used and that the dog shows no signs of distress. If tangles remain, gently brush again. If the dog is uncomfortable, pause and soothe before continuing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and shift focus to the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Groom an Affenpinscher with a pin brush.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare tools and start grooming at the head. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body.  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete grooming by brushing the tail.  
**Current Goal:** Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush.  
This reflects progress and sets the context for the next grooming step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush. This involves using the appropriate brush for each area while keeping the dog comfortable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use the soft pin brush to gently groom the Affenpinscher’s face, avoiding the eyes and mouth. Switch to a stiffer pin brush for the body, brushing from the neck down to the hindquarters. Ensure steady, gentle strokes to detangle fur without causing discomfort.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the face and body were groomed correctly using the appropriate pin brushes and that the fur is smooth and the dog remains calm.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the face and body to ensure the fur is detangled and smooth. Confirm the soft pin brush was used for the face and the stiffer pin brush for the body. Check the dog for signs of stress or discomfort, addressing any issues by pausing or adjusting technique if needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and focus on the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Groom an Affenpinscher with a pin brush.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare tools and start grooming at the head. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete grooming by brushing the tail.  
**Current Goal:** Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body.  
This updates the progress and prepares for the next step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to brush in the direction of hair growth across the body, using the stiffer pin brush to ensure a smooth coat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the stiffer pin brush, brush the Affenpinscher’s body in the direction of hair growth, starting from the neck and moving toward the hindquarters. Ensure even strokes to align the fur and remove any remaining tangles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the body was brushed in the direction of hair growth using the stiffer pin brush and that the coat is smooth and well-groomed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the body to confirm the fur is aligned in the direction of growth and free of tangles. Verify the stiffer pin brush was used and the dog remains comfortable. Re-brush any uneven areas if necessary.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and focus on the final subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Groom an Affenpinscher with a pin brush.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare tools and start grooming at the head. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Groom the face with a soft pin brush and the body with a stiffer pin brush. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Brush in the direction of hair growth across the body. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete grooming by brushing the tail. (Current)  
**Current Goal:** Complete grooming by brushing the tail.  
This sets the focus for the final grooming step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to complete grooming by brushing the tail, using the stiffer pin brush to ensure the tail fur is smooth.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use the stiffer pin brush to gently brush the Affenpinscher’s tail, following the direction of hair growth. Work carefully to detangle and smooth the fur, ensuring the tail is well-groomed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the tail was brushed correctly using the stiffer pin brush and that the entire grooming process is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the tail to ensure the fur is smooth, detangled, and aligned with the direction of growth. Confirm the stiffer pin brush was used. Review the entire dog to ensure all areas (head, face, body, tail) are well-groomed and the dog is comfortable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals are completed.
