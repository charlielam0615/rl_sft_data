**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to get an Amaryllis to rebloom in the spring, following the provided script of steps (watering, fertilizing, repotting) and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with the specified format and constraints.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of getting an Amaryllis to rebloom in the spring into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script lists three steps: watering, fertilizing, and repotting. These will form the subgoals to ensure the Amaryllis reblooms in the spring.  
- Subgoal 1: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health.  
- Subgoal 2: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming.  
- Subgoal 3: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get Amaryllis to rebloom in the spring.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming.  
  - Subgoal 3: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health (Subgoal 1).  
The goal hierarchy is based on the forward subgoaling from Step 1, organizing the steps from the script into a structured plan. The focus is now on the first subgoal to guide the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health.  
- **How to Achieve**: Provide consistent moisture to the Amaryllis bulb without overwatering, following guidelines for frequency and amount suitable for the spring season.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve proper watering:  
- Water the Amaryllis when the top inch of soil feels dry, typically every 7–10 days in spring, depending on indoor conditions.  
- Use room-temperature water and ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging, which can rot the bulb.  
- Aim for moist but not soggy soil, providing about 1 cup of water per watering for a standard 6-inch pot.  
This approach supports bulb health, encouraging energy storage for reblooming.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the watering method applied is effective by assessing soil moisture and plant health.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the watering process:  
- Check soil moisture 2–3 days after watering using a finger test; the top inch should be slightly moist but not wet.  
- Observe the Amaryllis for signs of healthy leaves (firm, green) and no yellowing or wilting, indicating proper hydration.  
- Confirm the pot’s drainage is functioning, with no standing water in the saucer.  
The plant shows healthy leaves and no signs of rot, confirming the watering method is effective.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get Amaryllis to rebloom in the spring.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming.  
  - Subgoal 3: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
**Current Goal**: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming (Subgoal 2).  
Subgoal 1 is marked complete based on successful watering and validation. The focus shifts to Subgoal 2 for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use a balanced fertilizer to provide nutrients that promote leaf growth and energy storage for spring blooming.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve proper fertilization:  
- Use a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) diluted to half strength.  
- Apply every 2 weeks during the spring growing season, starting when new growth appears.  
- Pour the fertilizer solution evenly over the soil, avoiding the bulb’s neck to prevent rot.  
This provides essential nutrients to support foliage and future flower development.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that fertilization is effective by monitoring plant growth and checking for nutrient deficiency signs.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate fertilization:  
- Observe the Amaryllis for new leaf growth and vibrant green color within 2–3 weeks of fertilizing.  
- Check for no signs of nutrient deficiency, such as yellowing leaves or stunted growth.  
- Ensure no fertilizer burn (brown leaf tips) by confirming proper dilution.  
The plant shows new leaf growth and healthy color, indicating effective fertilization.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get Amaryllis to rebloom in the spring.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure proper watering to maintain bulb health (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply appropriate fertilization to support growth and blooming (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
**Current Goal**: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development (Subgoal 3).  
Subgoal 2 is complete based on successful fertilization and validation. The focus now shifts to Subgoal 3, the final step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
- **How to Achieve**: Repot the Amaryllis in fresh, well-draining soil in a slightly larger pot to support bulb and root growth for spring blooming.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve repotting:  
- Choose a pot 1–2 inches wider than the bulb, with drainage holes.  
- Use a well-draining potting mix (e.g., equal parts peat, perlite, and compost).  
- Gently remove the Amaryllis, trim any dead roots, and place the bulb in the new pot with one-third of it above soil level.  
- Water lightly after repotting to settle the soil.  
This provides a fresh environment for root growth, supporting reblooming.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Repot the Amaryllis to provide fresh soil and space for root development.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm the repotting was successful by checking bulb stability and initial plant response.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate repotting:  
- Ensure the bulb is stable in the new pot and positioned correctly (one-third above soil).  
- Check that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged 2–3 days after repotting.  
- Monitor for new growth or maintained leaf health over the next 1–2 weeks.  
The bulb is stable, and the plant shows no signs of stress, confirming successful repotting.
