### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to avoid products with "fragrance" on the label, as these may contain hidden phthalates. This will be achieved by checking ingredient labels on personal care products before purchase and selecting those without "fragrance" listed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, examine the ingredient labels of personal care products such as shampoos, body washes, and perfumes. Avoid any product that lists "fragrance" or "parfum" on the label, as these terms often indicate the presence of phthalates. Instead, select products explicitly labeled as "fragrance-free" or those with fully disclosed natural scent ingredients (e.g., essential oils). If shopping online, review ingredient lists on product websites or contact manufacturers for clarification.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the path of avoiding products with "fragrance" is valid. This will be achieved by verifying that selected fragrance-free products are free of phthalates and meet personal care needs.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the ingredient lists of selected fragrance-free products to confirm they do not contain phthalates (e.g., diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate). Cross-reference with reputable sources like the Environmental Working Group’s (EWG) Skin Deep database to verify product safety. Ensure the products meet functional needs (e.g., suitable for skin type or hair care). If uncertainties arise, consult product reviews or contact manufacturers to confirm phthalate-free status.
