### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for sleeping on a chair to improve posture, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Ensure proper spinal alignment by sitting up straight.  
2. Support the lower back with a pillow to maintain the natural curve of the spine.  
3. Provide neck support with a rolled-up towel or small pillow to prevent strain.  
4. Evaluate and implement leg elevation to reduce lower body tension and enhance circulation.  
These subgoals align with the constraint of improving posture and will guide the implementation steps.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sit up straight in the chair to ensure proper spinal alignment.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a sturdy chair with a straight back, sit with hips against the back of the chair, and align the spine by keeping shoulders back and head level.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve proper spinal alignment, choose a chair with a firm, upright backrest. Sit fully back in the chair, ensuring hips are pressed against the backrest. Keep shoulders relaxed but pulled back slightly, and position the head directly above the spine, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. This posture promotes the natural curvature of the spine, reducing strain during sleep.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate that sitting up straight in the chair promotes proper spinal alignment.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the body’s alignment against posture guidelines and ensure comfort and stability for sleeping.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the spine is aligned by ensuring the lower back maintains its natural inward curve, the shoulders are not hunched, and the head is not tilted forward or backward. Confirm that the chair provides adequate support and that the position feels stable and comfortable for extended periods, suitable for sleeping without causing discomfort.

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Place a pillow behind the lower back to support the spine’s natural curve.  
**How to Achieve**: Position a small, firm pillow or cushion at the lower back to fill the gap between the chair and the lumbar spine.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select a small, firm pillow or cushion. Place it in the lower back area, just above the hips, to support the natural inward curve of the lumbar spine. Adjust the pillow to ensure it feels comfortable and maintains alignment without pushing the body forward. This support helps prevent slouching and reduces lower back strain during sleep.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate that the pillow placement supports the lower back effectively.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the pillow maintains the lumbar curve, ensures comfort, and does not disrupt the upright posture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the pillow fills the gap between the lower back and the chair, maintaining the spine’s natural curve. Ensure the pillow is secure and does not shift, and verify that the posture remains upright without discomfort. The lower back should feel supported, with no strain or pressure points.

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Consider elevating the legs to reduce tension and improve circulation.  
**How to Achieve**: Assess the feasibility of leg elevation using a stool or ottoman, and implement if it supports posture and comfort.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate whether elevating the legs is feasible based on the chair’s setup and available space. If possible, place a sturdy stool or ottoman in front of the chair to raise the legs to a level where the knees are slightly bent, promoting circulation and reducing lower body tension. Ensure this position does not disrupt the spinal alignment achieved in previous steps. If elevation is not practical, maintain the legs in a relaxed position on the floor.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate that leg elevation (or lack thereof) supports posture and comfort.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that leg elevation maintains overall body alignment and enhances comfort without strain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If legs are elevated, confirm that the stool or ottoman keeps the knees slightly bent and supports circulation without causing discomfort. Ensure the spine remains aligned and the posture is not compromised. If legs are not elevated, verify that they rest comfortably on the floor without tension, maintaining the overall posture setup.
