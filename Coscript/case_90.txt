### Problem Restatement
The task is to simulate a "Read a Balance Sheet in an Accounting Class" planning case by creating a plan to understand and analyze a balance sheet, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The process must select one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, using the specified [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks. The constraint is that this task occurs in an accounting class, and the script provides nine ordered steps to guide the process. The goal is to complete the plan by addressing all steps in the script.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reading a balance sheet in an accounting class into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Understand the balance sheet as a key financial statement.  
2. Recognize that it lists assets and liabilities.  
3. Note that it reflects a specific date.  
4. Ensure it balances (assets = liabilities + equity).  
5. Understand the order of assets by liquidity.  
6. Understand the order of liabilities by maturity.  
7. Identify red flags.  
8. Research unfamiliar items.  
9. Ask questions in class.  
These subgoals will guide subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the subgoals from Step 1:  
- **Main Goal**: Read and understand a balance sheet in an accounting class.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Understand the balance sheet as a key financial statement.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Recognize that it lists assets and liabilities.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Note that it reflects a specific date.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Ensure it balances (assets = liabilities + equity).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Understand the order of assets by liquidity.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Understand the order of liabilities by maturity.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Identify red flags.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Research unfamiliar items.  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Ask questions in class.  
**Current Goal**: Understand the balance sheet as a key financial statement (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Understand the balance sheet as a key financial statement.  
- **How to Achieve**: Research the role of the balance sheet among financial statements, focusing on its purpose and how it differs from the income statement and cash flow statement, using class materials or reliable accounting resources.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The balance sheet is one of three essential financial statements, alongside the income statement and cash flow statement. It provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time, detailing its assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity. Unlike the income statement, which shows performance over a period, or the cash flow statement, which tracks cash movements, the balance sheet focuses on what the company owns and owes. This understanding is foundational for analyzing financial health in an accounting class.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Recognize that the balance sheet lists assets and liabilities.  
- **How to Achieve**: Review the structure of a balance sheet, identifying the main categories (assets and liabilities) and their components, using a sample balance sheet from class or a textbook.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
A balance sheet is divided into two main sections: assets and liabilities. Assets include items like cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and property, representing what the company owns. Liabilities include obligations like accounts payable, loans, and accrued expenses, representing what the company owes. In an accounting class, recognizing these components helps in understanding the company’s financial structure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Note that the balance sheet reflects a specific date.  
- **How to Achieve**: Examine a balance sheet to identify the date it represents and understand why this temporal aspect matters, using class discussions or textbook explanations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The balance sheet is prepared as of a specific date, such as December 31, 2024, reflecting the company’s financial position at that moment. This differs from other statements that cover a period. In an accounting class, noting the date is crucial for understanding the context of the financial data and comparing it across different points in time.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the balance sheet balances (assets = liabilities + equity).  
- **How to Achieve**: Study the accounting equation and verify it using a sample balance sheet, ensuring the total assets equal the sum of liabilities and shareholder equity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The balance sheet must balance, adhering to the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity. For example, if a company has $100,000 in assets, it must have $100,000 in liabilities and equity combined (e.g., $60,000 liabilities + $40,000 equity). In class, verifying this balance ensures the statement is accurate and helps understand financial equilibrium.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Understand the order of assets by liquidity.  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze a balance sheet to observe how assets are listed, learning the concept of liquidity and why assets are ordered from most to least liquid, using class resources.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assets on a balance sheet are listed in order of liquidity, meaning how quickly they can be converted to cash. Current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) are listed first, followed by long-term assets (e.g., property, equipment). In an accounting class, understanding this order helps assess a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Understand the order of liabilities by maturity.  
- **How to Achieve**: Review a balance sheet to see how liabilities are organized, learning the concept of maturity and why liabilities are ordered by due date, using textbook examples.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Liabilities are listed in order of maturity, with current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, short-term loans due within a year) appearing before long-term liabilities (e.g., bonds payable, long-term loans). In an accounting class, this organization helps evaluate a company’s debt repayment timeline and financial obligations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify red flags on the balance sheet.  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze a sample balance sheet to spot potential issues, such as high debt levels or low cash reserves, using guidelines from class or accounting texts.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Red flags on a balance sheet include excessive debt compared to equity, low cash or liquid assets, or significant declines in asset values. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio might indicate financial risk. In an accounting class, identifying these issues helps assess the company’s financial health and stability.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Research unfamiliar items on the balance sheet.  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify any unclear terms or items on a balance sheet and research their meanings using class resources, textbooks, or reliable online sources.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If a balance sheet includes unfamiliar items, such as “deferred tax liabilities” or “intangible assets,” research their definitions. For instance, deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary differences in tax and accounting rules, while intangible assets include patents or goodwill. In an accounting class, clarifying these terms ensures a comprehensive understanding of the balance sheet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ask questions in class about the balance sheet.  
- **How to Achieve**: Prepare specific questions about unclear aspects of the balance sheet and ask them during class discussions to deepen understanding.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Prepare questions like “What does a high debt-to-equity ratio indicate?” or “How do we interpret negative retained earnings?” and ask them in class. Engaging with the instructor or peers clarifies complex concepts and reinforces learning about balance sheets in an accounting class setting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
