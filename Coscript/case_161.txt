### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure hair is clean and dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the hair is recently washed and fully dry, using a towel or hairdryer if needed, to prepare it for styling.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if the hair has been washed recently (e.g., within the last day). If not, wash it with shampoo and conditioner suitable for short hair. Pat the hair dry with a towel, then use a hairdryer on a low heat setting to ensure it is completely dry, as wet hair can hinder styling and brushing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure hair is clean and dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the hair to confirm it is clean (no oil or residue) and dry (no dampness).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Run fingers through the hair to check for any oily patches or residue, indicating cleanliness. Touch the hair to ensure it feels dry throughout, with no damp spots. If dampness is detected, use a hairdryer to finish drying. Confirm the hair is ready for the next step (detangling).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Detangle hair using a comb.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a wide-tooth comb to gently remove knots and tangles from the hair, starting from the ends and working up to the roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take a wide-tooth comb and start at the ends of the hair, gently working through any knots. Move upward in small sections, combing smoothly to avoid pulling or breaking the hair. Continue until all tangles are removed, ensuring the hair is smooth and ready for brushing.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take a boar bristle brush and start brushing from the scalp downward, following the natural direction of hair growth. Use smooth, even strokes to distribute natural scalp oils along the hair shafts, enhancing shine. Brush all sections of the hair evenly for a polished look.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Style hair in a school-appropriate manner.  
**How to Achieve**: Choose a simple, neat style (e.g., side part or slicked-back look) and use fingers or a comb to shape the hair accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a school-appropriate look, create a neat side part. Use a comb to part the hair on one side, then smooth it into place with fingers or the comb. If desired, apply a small amount of lightweight styling gel to hold the shape and maintain a tidy appearance suitable for school.  
[/IMP]

**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Core Content**: Information related to styling short hair for school and the use of hairspray.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- The script specifies styling hair as desired in a school-appropriate manner (Step 4 of the script). A side part was chosen as a simple, neat style (Step 8).  
- The final step involves applying hairspray to set the style (Step 5 of the script), ensuring the hair remains in place throughout the school day.  
- No prior issues were noted with styling or hairspray use in previous steps.

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply hairspray to set the style.  
**How to Achieve**: Lightly spray a school-appropriate amount of hairspray over the styled hair to hold it in place without making it stiff.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Hold a can of lightweight hairspray about 10-12 inches from the head. Lightly mist the hair in short bursts, focusing on the styled areas (e.g., the side part). Avoid over-spraying to keep the hair natural and flexible. Check that the style is secure and ready for the school day.
