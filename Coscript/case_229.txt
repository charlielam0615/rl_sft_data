### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan to find a forgotten WiFi password stored on a router. The constraint is that the solution must involve actions performed on the router itself. The provided script outlines four steps: (1) Look for a label on the router, (2) Check the router's web interface, (3) Try the default username and password for the router, and (4) Contact the ISP or router manufacturer for help. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) as specified, with each step adhering to the required format and selecting one action from the meta-cognitive action list.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals to Find the WiFi Password
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the forgotten WiFi password into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script and constraint.  

Subgoals:  
1. Check the router for a physical label containing the WiFi password.  
2. Access the router’s web interface to retrieve the WiFi password.  
3. Attempt to log in to the router’s web interface using default credentials if user-specific credentials are unavailable.  
4. Seek external assistance from the ISP or router manufacturer if the above steps fail.

### Step 2: Organize and Track the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step, highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the forgotten WiFi password on the router.  
  - Subgoal 1: Check the router for a physical label containing the WiFi password.  
  - Subgoal 2: Access the router’s web interface to retrieve the WiFi password.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to log in to the router’s web interface using default credentials.  
  - Subgoal 4: Seek external assistance from the ISP or router manufacturer.  

**Current Goal:** Check the router for a physical label containing the WiFi password.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Check the Router for a Physical Label
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Check the router for a physical label containing the WiFi password.  
- **How to Achieve:** Physically inspect the router to locate a sticker or label that typically includes the default WiFi network name (SSID) and password.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the router and examine its exterior (top, bottom, sides, or back) for a printed label or sticker. This label often includes the WiFi network name (SSID) and the default password (sometimes labeled as “WiFi Key” or “Password”). Write down the password if found. If no label is present or the password is not listed, proceed to the next subgoal.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate the Label Check
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate whether the WiFi password was found on the router’s label.  
- **How to Achieve:** Confirm if a label was found and if it contains the correct WiFi password by testing it on a device.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If a password was found on the router’s label, attempt to connect a device (e.g., a phone or laptop) to the WiFi network using the password. If the connection is successful, the password is correct, and the goal is achieved. If no label was found, the password is not listed, or the password does not work, proceed to the next subgoal (accessing the router’s web interface).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Plan Access to the Router’s Web Interface
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the next subgoal of accessing the router’s web interface by breaking it into actionable steps.  

Substeps for accessing the router’s web interface:  
1. Connect a device to the router (via WiFi or Ethernet).  
2. Identify the router’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).  
3. Access the router’s login page through a web browser.  
4. Log in to the web interface to locate the WiFi password.  

[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Connect to the Router
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Connect a device to the router to access its web interface.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a computer or device to connect to the router via an Ethernet cable or the existing WiFi network.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Connect a computer to the router using an Ethernet cable for a stable connection. Alternatively, if the WiFi password is not required for this step (e.g., using a device already connected), connect to the WiFi network. Ensure the device is on the same network as the router to access its web interface.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Identify the Router’s IP Address
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the router’s IP address to access its web interface.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the router’s label for the IP address or use a command-line tool to find the default gateway.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the router’s label for an IP address (commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1). If not listed, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) on the connected device and type `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig`/`netstat -nr` (Mac/Linux) to find the “Default Gateway” address, which is typically the router’s IP address. Note this address.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Access and Log In to the Router’s Web Interface
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Access the router’s web interface and locate the WiFi password.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a web browser to navigate to the router’s IP address, log in, and find the WiFi settings.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address (e.g., http://192.168.0.1) in the address bar. When prompted, enter the router’s username and password (try user-specific credentials if known). Navigate to the “Wireless” or “WiFi Settings” section to find the WiFi password. If the password is found, write it down and test it. If login fails, proceed to the next subgoal (trying default credentials).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Try Default Username and Password
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Log in to the router’s web interface using default credentials.  
- **How to Achieve:** Find the default username and password for the router model and use them to access the web interface.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the router’s label for default login credentials (e.g., username: “admin,” password: “admin” or “password”). Alternatively, search online for the default credentials for your router’s make and model (e.g., “Linksys EA7500 default password”). Attempt to log in to the router’s web interface using these credentials. If successful, navigate to the “Wireless” or “WiFi Settings” section to retrieve the WiFi password. If the default credentials fail, proceed to the next subgoal.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Recall Previous Attempts
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Review previous attempts to find the WiFi password to inform the next steps.  
- **Core Content:** Summarize the outcomes of checking the router label, accessing the web interface, and trying default credentials.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- **Checking the Router Label:** Inspected the router for a label; either no label was found, or the password was incorrect/not listed.  
- **Accessing the Web Interface:** Attempted to connect to the router’s IP address but could not log in due to unknown or incorrect credentials.  
- **Trying Default Credentials:** Used default username and password for the router model, but login failed, or the password was not found in the web interface.  
**Current Goal:** Seek external assistance from the ISP or router manufacturer, as previous attempts were unsuccessful.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Contact ISP or Router Manufacturer
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Contact the ISP or router manufacturer to retrieve the WiFi password.  
- **How to Achieve:** Gather router details and contact the ISP or manufacturer for assistance.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the router’s model number and serial number (usually on the router’s label). Contact the ISP’s customer support (via phone or website) or the router manufacturer’s support line (check their website, e.g., Linksys, Netgear). Provide the router details and explain that you need the WiFi password. Follow their instructions, which may involve resetting the router or retrieving the password from their records. Test any provided password to confirm it works.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Final Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate whether the WiFi password was successfully retrieved.  
- **How to Achieve:** Test the obtained password on a device to confirm it connects to the WiFi network.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use the password obtained from the label, web interface, or ISP/manufacturer to connect a device to the WiFi network. If the connection is successful, the goal of finding the WiFi password is achieved. If the password does not work, consider resetting the router to factory settings (noting that this may erase custom settings) and repeating the process from Step 3.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Review Goal Completion
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the forgotten WiFi password on the router (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Check the router for a physical label containing the WiFi password (Attempted; success or failure).  
  - Subgoal 2: Access the router’s web interface to retrieve the WiFi password (Attempted; success or failure).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to log in to the router’s web interface using default credentials (Attempted; success or failure).  
  - Subgoal 4: Seek external assistance from the ISP or router manufacturer (Attempted; success or failure).  

**Current Status:** The WiFi password was retrieved through one of the subgoals (label, web interface, default credentials, or external assistance) and validated by connecting a device to the network. The main goal is complete.  

[/REVIEW]
