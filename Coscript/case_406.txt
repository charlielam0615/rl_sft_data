**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for dyeing silhouettes onto Easter eggs using a pen, following the provided script and constraint. Create a plan by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the defined set (Planning, Implementation, Review), adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate. The script provided includes 12 steps: (1) Prepare the eggs, (2) Cut out a silhouette shape from black paper, (3) Tape the black paper silhouette onto the egg, (4) Use a white pen to trace around the silhouette, (5) Prepare the dye bath, (6) Strain the dye bath, then let it cool, (7) Add vinegar to the dye bath, (8) Dye the eggs, (9) Take the eggs out and unwrap them, (10) Pat the eggs dry with a towel, (11) Remove the black paper silhouette, (12) Finished. The constraint is that a pen must be used, and the task falls under the category of Holidays and Traditions.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for dyeing silhouettes onto Easter eggs, break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to complete the Easter egg dyeing process with silhouettes using a pen. Subgoals include preparing materials, creating and applying silhouettes, dyeing the eggs, and finalizing the process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dye silhouettes onto Easter eggs using a pen.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials (eggs, black paper, pen, dye, vinegar, etc.).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create and apply silhouette shapes to eggs.  
  - Subgoal 3: Dye the eggs with silhouettes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize by removing silhouettes and drying eggs.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare materials (corresponds to script step 1: Prepare the eggs).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the eggs. This involves boiling and cooling the eggs to ensure they are ready for decorating.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Boil the eggs until hard-boiled (about 10-12 minutes), then place them in cold water to cool. Ensure they are dry and at room temperature before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut out a silhouette shape from black paper. Use scissors to carefully cut a desired shape (e.g., bunny, flower) from black paper for use as a stencil.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a simple design (e.g., bunny or egg shape), draw it on black paper, and cut it out precisely with scissors to create a clean silhouette stencil.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to tape the black paper silhouette onto the egg. Secure the silhouette to the egg using small pieces of tape to hold it firmly in place.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carefully place the black paper silhouette on the egg’s surface and use small pieces of transparent tape to secure it, ensuring it doesn’t shift during the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use a white pen to trace around the silhouette. Trace the outline of the silhouette on the egg with a white pen to mark the design.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using a white pen (e.g., a white gel pen or paint pen suitable for eggs), carefully trace around the edges of the black paper silhouette to create a clear outline on the egg’s surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the silhouette application and pen tracing. Ensure the silhouette is securely taped and the pen outline is clear and accurate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the egg to confirm the silhouette is firmly attached and the white pen outline is visible and precise. If the outline is uneven or the silhouette is loose, re-tape or re-trace as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the dye bath. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the materials needed for dyeing to ensure all components are ready.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
From previous steps, the eggs are prepared (boiled and cooled), and silhouettes are applied with a white pen outline. The dye bath preparation requires dye materials (e.g., food coloring or egg dye), water, and containers, which should be gathered now for the dyeing process (script step 5).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the dye bath. Mix dye with water in a container suitable for submerging eggs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In a container, mix food coloring or egg dye with warm water according to package instructions (e.g., 1 cup water with a few drops of food coloring or dye tablet). Stir until fully dissolved.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to strain the dye bath and let it cool. Remove any undissolved particles and cool the dye to a safe temperature.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Strain the dye bath through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any debris. Allow the dye to cool to room temperature to prevent cracking the eggs during dyeing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add vinegar to the dye bath. Add a small amount of vinegar to enhance dye absorption.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add 1-2 tablespoons of white vinegar to the cooled dye bath and stir gently to mix. This helps the dye adhere better to the eggshell.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dye the eggs. Submerge the eggs with silhouettes in the dye bath to apply color.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Gently place the eggs with attached silhouettes into the dye bath, ensuring they are fully submerged. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes, depending on desired color intensity.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take the eggs out and unwrap them. Remove the eggs from the dye and begin removing the tape and silhouette.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carefully remove the eggs from the dye bath using a spoon, place them on a drying rack, and gently peel off the tape and black paper silhouette to reveal the design.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pat the eggs dry with a towel. Dry the eggs to remove excess dye and prepare for final steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Gently pat the eggs with a clean, soft towel to remove excess dye and moisture, taking care not to smudge the silhouette design.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the black paper silhouette fully. Ensure all paper and tape are removed to complete the design.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check each egg and remove any remaining pieces of black paper or tape, ensuring the silhouette outline created by the white pen and dye is clean and intact.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dye silhouettes onto Easter eggs using a pen.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials (completed: eggs boiled, materials gathered).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create and apply silhouette shapes to eggs (completed: silhouettes cut, taped, and traced).  
  - Subgoal 3: Dye the eggs with silhouettes (completed: dye bath prepared, eggs dyed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize by removing silhouettes and drying eggs (completed: eggs dried, silhouettes removed).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the process (script step 12: Finished).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the process. Ensure the eggs are complete and ready for display.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the eggs to confirm the silhouette designs are clear and vibrant. Arrange them for display or storage, completing the Easter egg dyeing process.  
[/IMP]
