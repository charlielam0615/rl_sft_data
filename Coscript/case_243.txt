### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for bypassing a firewall or internet filter using a proxy server. The process must adhere to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the given script: (1) Find a proxy server, (2) Enter the URL of the website to access, (3) Enter the proxy server's address, (4) Select the port number, (5) Enter a username and password (if required), (6) Click Connect, and (7) Browse unrestricted. The constraint is that the solution must involve the use of a proxy server, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and ensuring all steps in the script are addressed to complete the plan.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of bypassing a firewall or internet filter using a proxy into forward-looking intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to access a restricted website by routing traffic through a proxy server. Subgoals include:  
1. Identify and select a reliable proxy server.  
2. Configure the proxy settings correctly.  
3. Establish a connection through the proxy.  
4. Access the restricted website successfully.  
These subgoals align with the provided script and will guide the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals identified in Step 1.  
- **Main Goal**: Bypass a firewall or internet filter using a proxy server.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify and select a reliable proxy server.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Configure the proxy settings correctly.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Establish a connection through the proxy.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Access the restricted website successfully.  
**Current Goal**: Identify and select a reliable proxy server (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy provides context for the next steps, ensuring focus on finding a proxy server first.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify and select a reliable proxy server.  
**How to Achieve**: Research available proxy servers online, evaluate their reliability based on user reviews and security features, and select one that supports the desired protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, search for proxy servers using a search engine or proxy listing websites (e.g., HideMyAss, ProxyNova). Look for servers with high uptime, good speed, and encryption support. For example, a reputable proxy service like NordVPN or a free proxy list from a trusted source can be considered. Select a proxy server that matches the protocol needed for the restricted website (e.g., HTTPS for secure browsing). Note the server’s address and port number for later steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the selected proxy server is suitable for bypassing the firewall.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify the proxy server’s functionality by checking its availability, protocol compatibility, and whether it can bypass the specific firewall or filter in use.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the selected proxy server by attempting a connection to a non-restricted website using a proxy tool or browser settings. Confirm that the server is operational and supports the required protocol (e.g., HTTPS). If the firewall blocks specific proxy servers, cross-check the selected server against known blocked lists or test it with a small, non-sensitive request to ensure it can bypass the filter. If the server fails, return to Step 3 to select a different proxy.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on progress, refine the subgoals to ensure clarity for the configuration phase. The original subgoals are sufficient, but Subgoal 2 (Configure proxy settings) can be broken down further for precision:  
- Subgoal 2.1: Input the website URL.  
- Subgoal 2.2: Enter the proxy server’s address and port.  
- Subgoal 2.3: Provide authentication details if required.  
Updated subgoals:  
1. Identify and select a reliable proxy server (completed).  
2. Configure the proxy settings correctly.  
   - 2.1: Input the website URL.  
   - 2.2: Enter the proxy server’s address and port.  
   - 2.3: Provide authentication details if required.  
3. Establish a connection through the proxy.  
4. Access the restricted website successfully.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoals:  
- **Main Goal**: Bypass a firewall or internet filter using a proxy server.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify and select a reliable proxy server (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Configure the proxy settings correctly.  
    - **Subgoal 2.1**: Input the website URL.  
    - **Subgoal 2.2**: Enter the proxy server’s address and port.  
    - **Subgoal 2.3**: Provide authentication details if required.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Establish a connection through the proxy.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Access the restricted website successfully.  
**Current Goal**: Input the website URL (Subgoal 2.1).  
This ensures focus on the next configuration step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Input the website URL.  
**How to Achieve**: Access the proxy service’s interface (e.g., a web-based proxy or browser settings) and enter the URL of the restricted website to initiate the connection process.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open the proxy service’s interface, which could be a web-based proxy (e.g., Kproxy) or the proxy settings in a browser (e.g., Firefox’s network settings). In the provided URL field, enter the address of the restricted website (e.g., https://example.com). Ensure the URL is correct and includes the appropriate protocol (http:// or https://). Submit the URL to proceed to the next configuration step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Enter the proxy server’s address and port.  
**How to Achieve**: Input the proxy server’s address and port number (obtained in Step 3) into the proxy service or browser settings to route traffic through the proxy.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the proxy service’s interface or browser settings, locate the fields for the proxy server address and port. Enter the address (e.g., 192.168.1.1 or proxy.example.com) and the port number (e.g., 8080 or 443) noted earlier. Ensure accuracy to avoid connection errors. If using a browser, this is typically under network settings (e.g., Chrome’s advanced settings or Firefox’s manual proxy configuration). Save or apply the settings to proceed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Provide authentication details if required.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the proxy server requires a username and password, and input these credentials if necessary to authenticate the connection.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the proxy service’s documentation or interface for authentication requirements. If required, enter the username and password provided by the proxy service (e.g., during registration or subscription). If no authentication is needed (common for free proxies), skip this step. For browser-based proxies, credentials may be entered in a pop-up prompt. Ensure credentials are correct to avoid access denial.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Establish a connection through the proxy.  
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Review previous steps related to proxy server selection and configuration to ensure all necessary details are in place before attempting the connection.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Summarize information related to establishing the connection:  
- **Step 3**: Selected a reliable proxy server with a noted address and port.  
- **Step 4**: Validated the proxy server’s functionality.  
- **Step 7**: Entered the restricted website’s URL.  
- **Step 8**: Input the proxy server’s address and port.  
- **Step 9**: Provided authentication details (if required).  
These steps confirm that the proxy server is selected, validated, and configured with the correct URL, address, port, and credentials (if needed). This information ensures readiness to establish the connection.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Establish a connection through the proxy.  
**How to Achieve**: Initiate the connection by clicking the “Connect” button or equivalent in the proxy interface or applying settings in the browser.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the proxy service’s interface, locate and click the “Connect” button (or equivalent, e.g., “Start Browsing”). If configuring via browser settings, apply the proxy settings and attempt to load a webpage. Monitor for connection errors. If the connection fails, verify the address, port, and credentials, and retry. A successful connection routes traffic through the proxy server.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the proxy connection allows access to the restricted website.  
**How to Achieve**: Test access to the restricted website and verify that the firewall or filter is bypassed successfully.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Attempt to load the restricted website entered in Step 7. Check if the website loads without errors or restrictions. If the firewall or filter blocks the site, revisit Steps 3 or 8 to select a different proxy or correct configuration errors. A successful load indicates the proxy is bypassing the firewall effectively.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Browse the restricted website unrestricted.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the established proxy connection to navigate the restricted website freely.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With the proxy connection active, browse the restricted website as needed. Navigate through pages, access content, and perform desired actions (e.g., streaming, downloading). Ensure the proxy remains active during the session to maintain unrestricted access. If disruptions occur, recheck the connection (Step 11) or validate the proxy (Step 12).  
[/IMP]
