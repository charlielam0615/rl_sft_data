### Step 1: Check your iPhone's model number
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of choosing a mobile phone battery into intermediate subgoals. The first subgoal is to identify the iPhone model number to ensure compatibility with the battery.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Find your iPhone's serial number
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Define the next subgoal as finding the iPhone's serial number to verify the device’s specifications and ensure the battery matches the specific model.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3: Open a search engine of your choosing
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access a search engine to research battery options for the iPhone model identified. This will be achieved by opening a web browser and navigating to a search engine like Google or Bing.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Open a web browser on a computer or mobile device and go to a search engine such as Google (www.google.com) or Bing (www.bing.com). Ensure an active internet connection is available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Type your search criteria into your search engine
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to input search criteria to find compatible iPhone batteries. This will be achieved by entering a query like "[iPhone model] battery replacement" into the search engine, using the model number and serial number information gathered earlier.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In the search engine’s search bar, type a query such as "[iPhone model] battery replacement" (e.g., "iPhone 12 battery replacement"). Press Enter to retrieve results.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Review your search results
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the search results to identify reliable sources for purchasing an iPhone battery. This will be achieved by checking the credibility of websites, ensuring they offer batteries compatible with the specific iPhone model.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Examine the search results. Prioritize reputable sources like Apple’s official website, authorized resellers, or well-known electronics retailers (e.g., Best Buy, Amazon). Verify that the battery matches the iPhone model number and check customer reviews for reliability. Avoid unverified or suspicious websites.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Purchase directly from the manufacturer
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to purchase a compatible iPhone battery directly from the manufacturer (Apple). This will be achieved by navigating to Apple’s official website, selecting the appropriate battery, and completing the purchase process.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Go to Apple’s official website (www.apple.com). Navigate to the support or accessories section, locate the battery replacement option for the specific iPhone model, and follow the prompts to purchase the battery. Ensure the serial number and model number are confirmed during the process. Complete the transaction using a secure payment method.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Keep a record of your purchase
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to ensure all steps have been completed and maintain a record of the purchase for future reference.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Choose a mobile phone battery for an iPhone  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify iPhone model number (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find iPhone serial number (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Access a search engine (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Search for compatible batteries (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate search results (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 6: Purchase battery from manufacturer (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 7: Keep a record of the purchase (Current)  

**Current Goal**: Keep a record of the purchase.  
Save the purchase confirmation email, receipt, or order number from Apple’s website. Store this information in a secure location, such as a dedicated folder in your email or a physical file, for warranty or return purposes.  
[/REVIEW]
