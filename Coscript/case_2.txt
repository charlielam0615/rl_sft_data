**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make a sundae with fruit, following the provided script and constraint that the sundae must include fruit. The plan will be developed using the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of making a sundae with fruit into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:
1. Select suitable fruits for the sundae.
2. Prepare the fruits by washing and cutting them.
3. Assemble the sundae by combining fruits, ice cream, and chocolate sauce.
4. Serve and enjoy the sundae.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Make a sundae with fruit
  - Subgoal 1: Select suitable fruits for the sundae
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the fruits by washing and cutting them
  - Subgoal 3: Assemble the sundae by combining fruits, ice cream, and chocolate sauce
  - Subgoal 4: Serve and enjoy the sundae
**Current Goal**: Select suitable fruits for the sundae
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select suitable fruits for the sundae. This will be achieved by choosing a variety of fresh, flavorful fruits that complement the ice cream, such as strawberries, bananas, and blueberries.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Choose strawberries, bananas, and blueberries for their vibrant flavors and textures, which pair well with ice cream. Ensure the fruits are fresh and ripe for the best taste.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of preparing the fruits by washing and cutting them, focusing on prior steps or constraints relevant to fruit preparation.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The script specifies washing the chosen fruits (Step 2) and cutting them into bite-sized pieces (Step 3). The constraint emphasizes including fruit, so preparation must ensure fruits are clean and appropriately sized for the sundae.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the fruits by washing and cutting them. This will be achieved by washing the selected strawberries, bananas, and blueberries under cold water and cutting them into bite-sized pieces.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Wash the strawberries, bananas, and blueberries under cold running water to remove any dirt or residues. Peel the bananas, hull the strawberries, and cut all fruits into bite-sized pieces using a clean knife and cutting board.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the fruit preparation is valid. This will be achieved by checking that the fruits are clean, properly cut, and ready for assembly.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Inspect the washed and cut fruits to ensure they are free of dirt, peels, or hulls and are uniformly cut into bite-sized pieces suitable for the sundae. Confirm that the strawberries, bananas, and blueberries look fresh and are ready to be added to the bowl.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Based on progress, refine the remaining subgoals to focus on assembly and serving:
1. Assemble the sundae by placing cut fruits in a bowl, adding ice cream, and drizzling chocolate sauce.
2. Serve and enjoy the sundae.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Make a sundae with fruit
  - Subgoal 1: Assemble the sundae by placing cut fruits in a bowl, adding ice cream, and drizzling chocolate sauce
  - Subgoal 2: Serve and enjoy the sundae
**Current Goal**: Assemble the sundae by placing cut fruits in a bowl, adding ice cream, and drizzling chocolate sauce
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assemble the sundae. This will be achieved by placing the prepared fruits in a bowl, adding a scoop of ice cream, and topping with chocolate sauce, as per the script.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Place the cut strawberries, bananas, and blueberries into a serving bowl. Add a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the fruits. Drizzle chocolate sauce over the ice cream and fruits to complete the sundae assembly.
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the sundae is correctly assembled. This will be achieved by checking that the bowl contains the prepared fruits, a scoop of ice cream, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Confirm that the bowl contains an even distribution of strawberries, bananas, and blueberries, topped with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Ensure the presentation is appealing and all components are included as per the script.
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve and enjoy the sundae. This will be achieved by presenting the sundae with a spoon and consuming it.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Serve the sundae with a spoon and enjoy the combination of fresh fruits, creamy ice cream, and rich chocolate sauce.
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Make a sundae with fruit (Completed)
  - Subgoal 1: Select suitable fruits for the sundae (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the fruits by washing and cutting them (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Assemble the sundae by placing cut fruits in a bowl, adding ice cream, and drizzling chocolate sauce (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Serve and enjoy the sundae (Completed)
**Current Goal**: None (All goals completed)
[/REVIEW]

**Conclusion**: The plan to make a sundae with fruit has been completed, following the provided script and constraint. All subgoals were addressed through a combination of planning, implementation, and review actions, resulting in a successfully prepared and enjoyed sundae.
