### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan to simulate tagging people in Twitter photos who have previously liked your photos, adhering to the constraint that only those who have liked your photos before can be tagged. The provided script outlines the steps: log in to Twitter, visit the profile page and photos tab, select a photo, view its likes, search for accounts to tag, and tweet the photo. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify accounts that have liked the selected photo. Retrieve information about how to access the list of accounts that liked the photo.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The script indicates that after selecting a photo, the next step is to “click on the likes tab beneath the photo.” This suggests that Twitter provides a feature to view the list of accounts that have liked a specific photo, accessible via a likes tab or similar interface.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify accounts that have liked the selected photo. This will be achieved by accessing the likes tab for the selected photo and reviewing the list of accounts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With the selected photo open, locate and click the “Likes” tab or icon beneath the photo to display the list of accounts that have liked it. Review the list to identify potential accounts to tag.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the list of accounts that liked the photo is accessible and relevant. This will be achieved by confirming that the likes tab displays a list of accounts and that these accounts meet the constraint of having liked the photo before.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the “Likes” tab shows a list of account names or usernames. Confirm that the listed accounts are those who have previously liked the photo, aligning with the constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the list of accounts that liked the photo, select one or more accounts to tag. Use Twitter’s tagging feature (e.g., clicking a “Tag People” option or typing usernames in the tweet composition box) to add the selected accounts as tags to the photo.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
If the tagging feature requires composing a tweet before tagging, adjust the subgoals to reflect this.  
- Adjusted Subgoal 5: Compose a tweet with the selected photo and tag eligible accounts in the tweet.  
- Subgoal 6 (unchanged): Post the tweet with the tagged photo.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 13
