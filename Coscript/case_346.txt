### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan to obtain a wholesaler license in the United States, adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The plan must follow the given script: (1) Begin at the SBA website, (2) Investigate your state's licensing requirements, (3) Complete the application materials. All steps must be executed within the constraint of operating in the United States, and the response must use the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To initiate the process of obtaining a wholesaler license, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Visit the SBA website to gather initial information.  
2. Research state-specific licensing requirements.  
3. Prepare and submit the application materials.  
These subgoals align with the script and provide a clear path forward.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to visit the SBA website to gather initial information on obtaining a wholesaler license. This will be achieved by navigating to the Small Business Administration (SBA) website and identifying resources or guides related to wholesaler licensing in the United States.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Navigate to the SBA website (www.sba.gov). Search for resources under sections like "Start a Business" or "Licenses and Permits." The SBA provides general guidance on federal and state licensing requirements for businesses, including wholesalers. Note any federal requirements (e.g., EIN registration) and links to state-specific resources for further investigation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Obtain a wholesaler license in the United States.  
  - Subgoal 1: Visit the SBA website to gather initial information (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Research state-specific licensing requirements (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare and submit application materials (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Research state-specific licensing requirements.  
The first subgoal has been addressed by visiting the SBA website. The focus now shifts to the next subgoal, ensuring alignment with the script.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to investigate state-specific licensing requirements for a wholesaler license. This will be achieved by identifying the relevant state agency (e.g., Department of Revenue or Secretary of State) and reviewing their requirements, such as forms, fees, and eligibility criteria.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select the state in which the wholesaler license is needed (e.g., California, Texas, or New York). Visit the state’s official website, typically the Secretary of State or Department of Revenue portal, to locate the business licensing section. Review requirements for a wholesaler license, which may include a registered business entity, tax ID, application forms, and fees. Note any specific conditions, such as minimum inventory or sales volume thresholds, and download necessary forms.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the information gathered on state-specific licensing requirements. This will be achieved by cross-checking the collected requirements against official state resources and ensuring all necessary forms and fees are identified.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Revisit the state’s licensing website to confirm the accuracy of the gathered information. Ensure all required documents (e.g., business registration, tax ID, proof of compliance with state regulations) are listed. Verify fee amounts and payment methods. If discrepancies are found, consult additional resources like the SBA or state business helplines to clarify requirements.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Obtain a wholesaler license in the United States.  
  - Subgoal 1: Visit the SBA website to gather initial information (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Research state-specific licensing requirements (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare and submit application materials (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Prepare and submit application materials.  
The first two subgoals have been completed, with initial information gathered from the SBA and state-specific requirements identified and validated. The next step is to focus on completing the application process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the application materials for the wholesaler license. This will be achieved by filling out the required forms, gathering supporting documents, paying any fees, and submitting the application to the appropriate state agency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Complete the application forms downloaded from the state’s licensing portal, ensuring all fields are accurately filled. Gather supporting documents, such as a federal EIN, business registration certificate, and any required financial statements. Pay the licensing fee as specified (e.g., via online portal, check, or money order). Submit the application package to the state agency through the designated method (e.g., online submission, mail, or in-person). Retain copies of all documents and confirmation of submission.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the submitted application for the wholesaler license. This will be achieved by confirming receipt of the application with the state agency and ensuring no additional documents or actions are required.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check for confirmation of application receipt from the state agency (e.g., email, online portal status update). If no confirmation is received within the expected timeframe, contact the agency to verify submission. Review any feedback or requests for additional information and address them promptly. Ensure compliance with any follow-up requirements, such as inspections or interviews, if applicable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Obtain a wholesaler license in the United States.  
  - Subgoal 1: Visit the SBA website to gather initial information (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Research state-specific licensing requirements (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare and submit application materials (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed: initial information was gathered from the SBA, state-specific requirements were researched and validated, and the application materials were completed and submitted. The process to obtain the wholesaler license is complete, pending approval from the state agency.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Note
The plan to obtain a wholesaler license in the United States has been completed by following the provided script and meta-cognitive action set. Each step utilized a single action from the Planning, Implementation, or Review categories, adhering to the specified format and constraints. If further action is needed (e.g., responding to state agency feedback), additional steps can be planned accordingly.
