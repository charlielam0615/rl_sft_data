### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making peanut butter toast for breakfast, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The script includes four steps: 1) Wake up, 2) Place the bread slices into the toaster, 3) Spread peanut butter on each slice of toast, and 4) Eat. The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified guidelines. The constraint is that this task is for breakfast, and the category is Food and Entertaining.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To create a plan for making peanut butter toast for breakfast, I will break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to prepare and eat peanut butter toast. The subgoals are:  
1. Wake up to start the breakfast preparation.  
2. Toast bread slices using a toaster.  
3. Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices.  
4. Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
The goal hierarchy is as follows:  
- **Main Goal**: Prepare and eat peanut butter toast for breakfast.  
  - Subgoal 1: Wake up to start the breakfast preparation.  
  - Subgoal 2: Toast bread slices using a toaster.  
  - Subgoal 3: Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices.  
  - Subgoal 4: Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
**Current Goal**: Wake up to start the breakfast preparation.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation action.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wake up to start the breakfast preparation. This will be achieved by ensuring the individual is awake and ready to proceed with the task, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of waking up, the individual should rise from bed, which may involve turning off an alarm or following their morning routine. This step is straightforward as it assumes the person is in a state to begin breakfast preparation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the individual has successfully woken up to start breakfast preparation. This will be achieved by verifying that the person is out of bed and alert enough to proceed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the wake-up step, check if the individual is out of bed and mentally prepared to start the task. If they are still in bed or not alert, they may need to set an alarm or take a moment to become fully awake. Assuming the individual is now awake, the step is valid, and we can proceed to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
The goal hierarchy remains:  
- **Main Goal**: Prepare and eat peanut butter toast for breakfast.  
  - Subgoal 1: Wake up to start the breakfast preparation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Toast bread slices using a toaster.  
  - Subgoal 3: Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices.  
  - Subgoal 4: Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
**Current Goal**: Toast bread slices using a toaster.  
The first subgoal has been completed and validated, so the focus shifts to the next subgoal of toasting the bread.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to toast bread slices using a toaster. This will be achieved by selecting bread, placing it in the toaster, and operating the toaster to produce toasted slices.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select two slices of bread (or the desired number) from a loaf, ensuring they are fresh and suitable for toasting. Place the slices into the toaster slots, adjust the toasting setting to the preferred level (e.g., medium for a golden-brown toast), and press the lever to start toasting. Wait until the toaster pops up, indicating the bread is toasted.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the bread slices have been successfully toasted. This will be achieved by checking the toast for the desired color and texture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the toasted bread slices to ensure they are evenly toasted to the desired level (e.g., golden-brown and crispy). If the toast is underdone or burnt, adjust the toaster settings and repeat the toasting process with new slices if necessary. Assuming the toast meets the desired quality, this step is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Prepare and eat peanut butter toast for breakfast.  
  - Subgoal 1: Wake up to start the breakfast preparation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Toast bread slices using a toaster (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices.  
  - Subgoal 4: Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
**Current Goal**: Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices.  
The toasting step has been completed and validated, so the next subgoal is to spread peanut butter.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to spread peanut butter on the toasted slices. This will be achieved by obtaining peanut butter and a utensil, then evenly spreading the peanut butter on the toast.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Retrieve a jar of peanut butter and a butter knife or spatula from the kitchen. Open the jar, scoop an appropriate amount of peanut butter, and spread it evenly across the surface of each toasted slice. Ensure the layer is smooth and covers the toast to the desired thickness.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that peanut butter has been spread evenly on the toasted slices. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the toast to ensure coverage and consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the toast to verify that peanut butter is spread evenly across each slice without gaps or overly thick areas. If the spread is uneven, use the knife to adjust the peanut butter. If the peanut butter is not spreadable (e.g., too cold), let it sit at room temperature briefly and try again. Assuming the peanut butter is evenly applied, this step is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Prepare and eat peanut butter toast for breakfast.  
  - Subgoal 1: Wake up to start the breakfast preparation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Toast bread slices using a toaster (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Spread peanut butter on the toasted slices (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
**Current Goal**: Eat the prepared peanut butter toast.  
The peanut butter spreading step has been completed and validated, so the final subgoal is to eat the toast.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to eat the prepared peanut butter toast. This will be achieved by consuming the toast as part of the breakfast meal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the peanut butter toast on a plate or hold it in hand. Take bites of the toast, chewing and swallowing carefully to enjoy the meal. This step completes the breakfast preparation and consumption process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the peanut butter toast has been eaten. This will be achieved by verifying that the toast has been fully consumed or that the individual is satisfied with the meal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if the peanut butter toast has been eaten or if the individual feels satisfied with the breakfast. If any toast remains uneaten and the individual is full, the step is still valid as the breakfast goal has been met. Assuming the toast is consumed or the meal is complete, this step is valid.  
[/IMP]
