**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create a wing template by drawing and cutting a wing shape from cardboard.  
**How to Achieve**: Draw a butterfly wing shape on a piece of cardboard using a pencil, ensuring the shape is symmetrical and appropriately sized for the butterfly. Cut out the shape carefully with scissors to create a reusable template.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following the script steps 1 and 2:  
1. Take a piece of cardboard and a pencil. Sketch a butterfly wing shape, ensuring it has a curved, symmetrical design suitable for a butterfly.  
2. Use scissors to carefully cut along the drawn outline, creating a precise cardboard wing template for tracing onto tissue paper.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the wing template is correctly created.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the cardboard wing template is symmetrical, appropriately sized, and cleanly cut for use as a tracing template.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the cardboard wing template. Verify that the shape is symmetrical by folding it in half to check if both sides align. Ensure the size is suitable for the butterfly (e.g., 3-5 inches in length). Confirm the edges are smooth and precise for accurate tracing onto tissue paper. If any issues are found, redraw or recut the template as needed.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Use the template to cut two tissue paper wings.  
**How to Achieve**: Trace the cardboard wing template onto a sheet of tissue paper twice and cut out the shapes to create two wings.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following script step 3:  
1. Place the cardboard wing template on a sheet of tissue paper and trace its outline with a pencil. Repeat to create two wing outlines.  
2. Carefully cut out both wing shapes from the tissue paper using scissors, ensuring clean edges to maintain the wing design.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and focus on the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make tissue paper butterflies with wings.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a wing template by drawing and cutting a wing shape from cardboard (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the template to cut two tissue paper wings (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Assemble the wings by stacking and clipping them with a clothespin.  
  - Subgoal 4: Create and attach the antenna using a pipe cleaner.  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the clothespin body.  
  - Subgoal 6: Securely attach the wings to the body to complete the butterfly.  
**Current Goal**: Assemble the wings by stacking and clipping them with a clothespin.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Assemble the wings by stacking and clipping them with a clothespin.  
**How to Achieve**: Stack the two tissue paper wings evenly and clip a clothespin at their center to form the butterfly’s body.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following script steps 4 and 5:  
1. Stack the two tissue paper wings directly on top of each other, aligning their edges carefully.  
2. Pinch the center of the stacked wings and secure them with a clothespin, positioning the clip to act as the butterfly’s body while holding the wings in place.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Create and attach the antenna using a pipe cleaner.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information about the materials and steps involved in creating and attaching the antenna, focusing on the use of a pipe cleaner and its integration with the clothespin.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies steps 6 and 7: (6) Make the antenna out of a pipe cleaner, and (7) Clip the antenna into the clothespin. Relevant materials include a pipe cleaner for the antenna and the existing clothespin used as the butterfly’s body. The process involves shaping the pipe cleaner into an antenna form and securing it within the clothespin to complete the butterfly’s head structure.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create and attach the antenna using a pipe cleaner.  
**How to Achieve**: Shape a pipe cleaner into two antenna forms and clip it into the clothespin to secure it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following script steps 6 and 7:  
1. Take a pipe cleaner and cut it to an appropriate length (e.g., 4-6 inches). Fold it in half and twist the ends to form two antenna shapes with curled or straight tips.  
2. Insert the folded center of the pipe cleaner into the top of the clothespin, clipping it securely to form the butterfly’s antennae.  
[/IMP]

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Decorate the clothespin body.  
**How to Achieve**: Use craft materials like paint, markers, or stickers to decorate the clothespin, enhancing its appearance as the butterfly’s body.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following script step 8:  
1. Gather decorative materials such as acrylic paint, markers, or stickers.  
2. Paint or draw designs on the clothespin to resemble a butterfly’s body, or apply stickers for added detail, ensuring the decorations are dry and secure before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

**Step 11**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the butterfly’s components are correctly assembled before final attachment.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the wings, clothespin, and antennae are properly aligned, secure, and aesthetically pleasing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the butterfly:  
1. Confirm the tissue paper wings are evenly stacked, securely clipped by the clothespin, and undamaged.  
2. Verify the antennae are firmly attached and symmetrically positioned.  
3. Ensure the clothespin decorations are dry and visually appealing. Adjust or redo any components if misaligned or insecure.  
[/IMP]

**Step 12**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attach the wings to the body to complete the butterfly.  
**How to Achieve**: Ensure the tissue paper wings are permanently secured to the clothespin body, finalizing the butterfly structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following script step 9:  
1. If the wings are not already permanently attached, apply a small amount of glue (e.g., craft glue or hot glue) between the tissue paper wings and the clothespin to secure them firmly.  
2. Hold the wings in place until the glue dries, ensuring they are evenly positioned and spread to resemble a butterfly’s natural wingspan.
