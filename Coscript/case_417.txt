### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of interacting with children by playing games into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
- Select an age-appropriate game for the children.  
- Understand and adhere to the game’s rules during play.  
- Demonstrate good sportsmanship throughout the game.  
- Promote healthy competition among the children.  
- Monitor the duration of play to avoid excessive time.  
- Ensure all children are engaged and enjoying the activity.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select an age-appropriate game for the children. This will be achieved by considering the age group of the children, their interests, and the suitability of the game for a group setting.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To select an age-appropriate game, first determine the age range of the children (e.g., 4-6 years old). For young children, a simple game like "Duck, Duck, Goose" is ideal because it encourages physical activity, requires minimal setup, and is easy to understand. Confirm with any supervising adults if the game suits the group’s needs and ensure the play area is safe and spacious enough.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Interact with children by playing games.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an age-appropriate game (completed: chose "Duck, Duck, Goose").  
  - Subgoal 2: Understand and adhere to the game’s rules during play (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate good sportsmanship throughout the game (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Promote healthy competition among the children (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Monitor the duration of play to avoid excessive time (pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Ensure all children are engaged and enjoying the activity (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Understand and adhere to the game’s rules during play.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand and adhere to the rules of "Duck, Duck, Goose" during play. This will be achieved by learning the rules, explaining them clearly to the children, and ensuring they are followed during the game.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The rules of "Duck, Duck, Goose" involve children sitting in a circle, with one child walking around tapping others, saying "Duck" until they choose someone by saying "Goose." The chosen child chases the tapper around the circle to tag them before they sit in the vacant spot. Explain these rules to the children using simple language and demonstrate a practice round. During play, gently remind children to follow the rules, such as sitting properly or running safely, to maintain order and safety.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the rules of "Duck, Duck, Goose" are being followed correctly. This will be achieved by observing the game and ensuring all participants understand and adhere to the rules.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe the children during the first few rounds of "Duck, Duck, Goose." Check if the tapper is using the correct words ("Duck" and "Goose"), if the chased child runs in the right direction, and if all children remain seated in the circle when not chosen. If any confusion arises (e.g., children running incorrectly or not sitting), pause the game briefly to clarify the rules and ensure everyone understands. Confirm that the game is proceeding smoothly and safely.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Interact with children by playing games.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an age-appropriate game (completed: chose "Duck, Duck, Goose").  
  - Subgoal 2: Understand and adhere to the game’s rules during play (completed: rules explained and followed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Demonstrate good sportsmanship throughout the game (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Promote healthy competition among the children (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Monitor the duration of play to avoid excessive time (pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Ensure all children are engaged and enjoying the activity (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate good sportsmanship throughout the game.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to demonstrate good sportsmanship throughout the game. This will be achieved by modeling positive behavior, such as cheering for all participants and handling wins or losses gracefully.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
During "Duck, Duck, Goose," model good sportsmanship by encouraging all children, saying things like, “Great running!” or “Nice try!” regardless of who wins the chase. If a child is upset about being tagged or not chosen, acknowledge their feelings and encourage them to keep playing. Avoid overly competitive behavior and praise children for being kind to each other, such as waiting patiently or helping a friend understand the rules.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to promote healthy competition among the children. This will be achieved by fostering a supportive environment where children are motivated to participate without feeling pressured to win.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Encourage healthy competition by emphasizing effort over winning. For example, say, “Everyone’s doing such a great job running and having fun!” during "Duck, Duck, Goose." Ensure every child gets a turn to be the tapper, balancing participation. If any child dominates or feels left out, gently guide the group to include everyone, such as suggesting, “Let’s make sure everyone gets a chance to be Goose!” Reward positive interactions, like cheering for friends, with verbal praise to reinforce cooperative play.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor the duration of play to avoid excessive time. Retrieve information from previous steps related to maintaining engagement and ensuring the game remains enjoyable without overextending.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps emphasized selecting a simple, engaging game ("Duck, Duck, Goose") and ensuring all children are involved through clear rules and inclusive participation. Step 2 noted the game’s simplicity keeps children engaged, and Step 8 highlighted balancing turns to maintain enjoyment. This suggests the game should be kept short to sustain interest and prevent fatigue, especially for young children.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor the duration of play to avoid excessive time. This will be achieved by setting a reasonable time limit for "Duck, Duck, Goose" and observing the children for signs of fatigue or waning interest.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set a time limit of about 15-20 minutes for "Duck, Duck, Goose," as young children may lose focus or tire after this period. Watch for signs of boredom or restlessness, such as children disengaging or becoming overly silly. If interest wanes, suggest wrapping up the game after the current round and transitioning to a brief closing activity, like a group high-five, to end on a positive note. If the children are still highly engaged, extend slightly but stop before fatigue sets in.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all children are engaged and enjoying the activity. This will be achieved by observing the children’s participation and emotions during "Duck, Duck, Goose" and making adjustments to maintain fun.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
While the game is ongoing, watch for signs of engagement, such as laughter, active participation, or excitement. If any child seems left out or uninterested, engage them directly by asking, “Want to be the next Goose?” or inviting them to help call out “Duck” or “Goose.” If the group’s energy dips, introduce a small variation, like adding a silly sound when saying “Goose,” to rekindle excitement. After the game, ask the children what they enjoyed to confirm everyone had fun.  
[/IMP]
