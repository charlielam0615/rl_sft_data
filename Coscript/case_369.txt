1. Ensure the computer is powered and connected properly.  
2. Verify peripheral devices (monitor, keyboard) are connected.  
3. Attempt to restart the computer by pressing the power button.  
4. Confirm the computer boots successfully.  
5. Ensure the computer is connected to the internet.  
6. Verify the software (Windows) is up to date.  
7. Verify the BIOS is up to date.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Fix a PC that won't boot by restarting the computer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the computer is powered and connected properly (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify peripheral devices (monitor, keyboard) are connected.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to restart the computer by pressing the power button.  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the computer boots successfully.  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the computer is connected to the internet.  
  - Subgoal 6: Verify the software (Windows) is up to date.  
  - Subgoal 7: Verify the BIOS is up to date.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the computer is powered and connected properly.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the computer is powered and connected properly. This will be achieved by checking if the computer is plugged into a power source.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the power cable to confirm it is securely plugged into both the computer and a working power outlet. If the cable is loose or unplugged, reconnect it firmly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate that the computer is receiving power by checking for indicators such as LED lights or fan activity after ensuring the power connection.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Observe the computer for signs of power, such as illuminated LEDs, fan noise, or other indicators. If no signs of power are present, try a different power outlet or cable to rule out faulty hardware.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
If the computer is powered but still not booting, adjust the subgoals to focus on verifying peripheral devices before attempting a restart. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Verify peripheral devices (monitor, keyboard) are connected (next focus).  
2. Attempt to restart the computer by pressing the power button.  
3. Confirm the computer boots successfully.  
4. Ensure the computer is connected to the internet.  
5. Verify the software (Windows) is up to date.  
6. Verify the BIOS is up to date.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify peripheral devices (monitor, keyboard) are connected. This will be achieved by checking the monitor and keyboard connections.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Check that the monitor is plugged into a power source and connected to the computer via the appropriate cable (e.g., HDMI, DisplayPort). Ensure the monitor is turned on.  
2. Confirm the keyboard is securely connected to a USB port or other relevant input.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate that the monitor and keyboard are functioning by checking for display output and keyboard responsiveness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Turn on the monitor and check for a display signal (e.g., BIOS screen or error message).  
2. Press keys on the keyboard (e.g., Caps Lock) to check for responsiveness, such as indicator lights. If no output or responsiveness is observed, try different cables or ports.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attempt to restart the computer by pressing the power button to initiate a boot sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Locate the power button on the computer and press it. If the computer is already powered on, press and hold the power button for 5-10 seconds to shut it down, then press it again to restart.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate that the computer boots successfully by observing the boot sequence and checking for a login screen or desktop.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wait for the computer to complete the boot process. Look for the BIOS/UEFI screen, followed by the Windows loading screen, and finally the login or desktop screen. If the computer fails to boot, note any error messages or behaviors (e.g., beeping sounds).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the computer boots successfully. Retrieve past information related to potential reasons for boot failure if the computer does not boot.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 3 and 4 confirmed the computer is powered and connected properly (power cable and outlet checked).  
- Step 6 and 7 verified that peripherals (monitor, keyboard) are connected and functional.  
- Step 8 attempted a restart by pressing the power button.  
If the computer still does not boot, potential issues could include hardware failures (e.g., RAM, motherboard), corrupted BIOS, or software issues preventing the boot process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
If the computer does not boot, backtrack to recheck power and peripheral connections to rule out oversight before proceeding to software or BIOS checks.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the computer is connected to the internet to support subsequent software updates. This will be achieved by checking network connections.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Check if the Ethernet cable is securely connected or if Wi-Fi is enabled and connected to a network.  
2. Verify internet connectivity by observing network indicators in the operating system (if accessible) or testing with another device on the same network.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the computer is running the latest version of Windows to rule out software-related boot issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. If the computer boots to the desktop, navigate to Settings > System > Windows Update and check for updates.  
2. Install any available updates and restart the computer if prompted.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the computer is running the latest version of its BIOS to address potential firmware-related boot issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Restart the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup by pressing the appropriate key (e.g., Del, F2) during boot.  
2. Note the current BIOS version and check the manufacturer’s website for the latest version.  
3. If an update is available, download and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to update the BIOS.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion of all subgoals.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Fix a PC that won't boot by restarting the computer (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the computer is powered and connected properly (completed in Steps 3, 4).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify peripheral devices (monitor, keyboard) are connected (completed in Steps 6, 7).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to restart the computer by pressing the power button (completed in Step 8).  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the computer boots successfully (completed in Step 9).  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the computer is connected to the internet (completed in Step 12).  
  - Subgoal 6: Verify the software (Windows) is up to date (completed in Step 13).  
  - Subgoal 7: Verify the BIOS is up to date (completed in Step 14).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; the PC should now boot successfully after restarting and verifying all components.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The plan to fix the PC that won't boot by restarting the computer has been completed by systematically addressing power, peripherals, restart attempts, and software/firmware updates, following the meta-cognitive action framework. If the PC still does not boot, further diagnostics (e.g., hardware testing) may be required, but these are outside the provided script.
