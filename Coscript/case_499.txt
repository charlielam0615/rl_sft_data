**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to delete a drive partition on a Mac using Disk Utility, adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) and the specified format. The task must use Disk Utility, and the steps are: 1. Launch Disk Utility, 2. Select the drive, 3. Click the Erase tab, 4. Click the Erase button, 5. Select the partition to delete, 6. Click the Delete button, 7. Click Done.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Open Disk Utility to access the partition management interface.  
- **How to Achieve**: Launch Disk Utility by locating it in the Applications folder or using Spotlight Search.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To open Disk Utility:  
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.  
2. Navigate to the "Applications" folder, then the "Utilities" folder, and double-click "Disk Utility."  
Alternatively, press Command + Space, type "Disk Utility," and press Enter to launch it via Spotlight Search.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure Disk Utility is successfully launched.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the Disk Utility application is open and displaying the drive management interface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the Disk Utility window is open on the screen. Confirm that the sidebar on the left displays available drives and volumes. If Disk Utility is not open or shows an error, relaunch it or troubleshoot by checking system permissions or restarting the Mac.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify and select the target drive containing the partition.  
- **How to Achieve**: In Disk Utility, locate the drive in the sidebar and select it to proceed with partition management.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Disk Utility sidebar, locate the drive that contains the partition you want to delete. Click on the drive name (not the partition) to highlight it. Ensure the drive is the correct one by checking its name and capacity to avoid selecting the wrong device.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals to account for potential complexities in the erase process, such as ensuring the correct partition is targeted and understanding the erase functionality. Updated subgoals:  
1. Open Disk Utility to access the partition management interface (completed).  
2. Identify and select the target drive containing the partition (completed).  
3. Access the partition management interface to modify or delete partitions.  
4. Select and delete the specific partition.  
5. Confirm the deletion to finalize the process.  
[/PLANNING]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Delete a drive partition on a Mac using Disk Utility.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open Disk Utility to access the partition management interface (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and select the target drive containing the partition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the partition management interface to modify or delete partitions.  
  - Subgoal 4: Select and delete the specific partition.  
  - Subgoal 5: Confirm the deletion to finalize the process.  
**Current Goal**: Access the partition management interface to modify or delete partitions.

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Access the partition management interface to modify or delete partitions.  
- **How to Achieve**: In Disk Utility, click the "Partition" tab (not the Erase tab, as the provided script may be inaccurate for deleting a partition) to manage partitions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With the target drive selected in Disk Utility, click the "Partition" tab at the top of the window. This displays the partition layout of the drive, allowing you to view and manage existing partitions. Ensure the correct drive is selected before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the partition management interface is accessible and displays the correct drive’s partitions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm that the Partition tab shows the drive’s partition layout and that the correct drive is selected.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the Partition tab is active and displays a graphical or list view of the drive’s partitions. Verify that the selected drive matches the one intended for partition deletion by cross-referencing its name and size. If the Partition tab is not available (e.g., for certain drive formats), consider reformatting the drive or selecting a different drive.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Select and delete the specific partition.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the Partition tab, select the partition to delete and remove it using the provided controls.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Partition tab, click on the partition you want to delete in the partition layout diagram or list. Click the "–" (minus) button below the partition layout to remove the selected partition. A warning may appear indicating that this action will erase data on the partition; confirm that you have backed up any important data before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the deletion to finalize the process.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to finalizing partition deletion in Disk Utility, including confirmation steps and potential warnings.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps indicate that after selecting and removing a partition in the Partition tab, Disk Utility may prompt a warning about data loss. The provided script references clicking a "Delete" button and then "Done." Relevant information: In Disk Utility, after clicking the "–" button to delete a partition, you must click "Apply" to confirm changes to the partition table, followed by "Done" to complete the process.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the deletion to finalize the process.  
- **How to Achieve**: Apply the partition changes and confirm completion in Disk Utility.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After removing the partition, click the "Apply" button in the Partition tab to commit the changes. A confirmation dialog may appear; click "Partition" to proceed. Once the operation is complete, click "Done" to exit the Partition tab. Verify that the partition no longer appears in the drive’s layout.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the partition has been successfully deleted.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the drive’s partition layout in Disk Utility to ensure the target partition is gone.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In Disk Utility, reselect the drive and check the Partition tab or sidebar to confirm that the deleted partition no longer appears. Verify that the remaining partitions or free space reflect the expected changes. If the partition still appears, repeat the deletion process or check for errors (e.g., locked drives or insufficient permissions).  
[/IMP]
