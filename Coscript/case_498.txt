**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to clean a purse using vinegar, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must use the provided script steps: (1) Mix one part vinegar with one part water, (2) Rub the solution on the purse with a cloth, (3) Let it sit for a few minutes, (4) Wipe it down with a clean, damp cloth. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and responses will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To clean a purse using vinegar, break down the task into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution.  
2. Apply the solution to the purse surface.  
3. Allow the solution to work on the purse.  
4. Remove the solution and clean the purse.  
These subgoals align with the script steps and provide a structured approach to achieve the final goal of a clean purse.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean a purse using vinegar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the solution to the purse surface.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the solution to work on the purse.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the solution and clean the purse.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous step, providing context for the next actions.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Mix one part vinegar with one part water in a container to create a cleaning solution, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the cleaning solution, take a container and combine equal parts of vinegar and water (e.g., 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup water). Stir gently to ensure the solution is well-mixed. This aligns with the script’s first step: “Mix one part vinegar with one part water.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the solution is correctly mixed by checking the proportions and consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the solution contains equal parts vinegar and water (e.g., 1:1 ratio). Confirm the mixture is uniform with no separation. The solution should appear clear and slightly acidic in smell, indicating it is ready for use in cleaning the purse.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the solution to the purse surface.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use a cloth to rub the vinegar-water solution onto the purse, as per the script’s second step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Dip a clean, soft cloth into the vinegar-water solution, ensuring it is damp but not soaking wet. Gently rub the cloth over the purse’s surface, focusing on stained or dirty areas, as specified in the script: “Rub the solution on the purse with a cloth.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the solution to the purse surface.  
- **How to Achieve**: Ensure the solution is applied evenly across the purse and that the cloth used is appropriate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the solution has been applied evenly across the purse’s surface, with no areas overly saturated or missed. Confirm the cloth is clean and soft to avoid scratching the purse material. The purse should appear uniformly damp with the solution.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Allow the solution to work on the purse.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let the purse sit for a few minutes after applying the solution, as per the script’s third step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the purse aside for 3–5 minutes to allow the vinegar-water solution to break down dirt and stains, as specified in the script: “Let it sit for a few minutes.” Ensure the purse is in a well-ventilated area to avoid prolonged exposure to moisture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of removing the solution and cleaning the purse, focusing on the script’s final step and previous actions.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Remove the solution and clean the purse (Subgoal 4).  
**Relevant Information**:  
- The script’s final step is “Wipe it down with a clean, damp cloth.”  
- Previous steps confirmed the solution was prepared (Step 3), applied (Step 5), and allowed to sit (Step 7).  
- Validation steps (Steps 4 and 6) ensured the solution was correctly mixed and applied, indicating the purse is ready for the final cleaning step.  
This information provides context for wiping down the purse to complete the cleaning process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Remove the solution and clean the purse.  
- **How to Achieve**: Wipe the purse with a clean, damp cloth to remove the vinegar solution, as per the script’s fourth step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take a clean cloth, dampen it with water, and wipe down the entire surface of the purse to remove the vinegar-water solution and any loosened dirt. Ensure the cloth is only slightly damp to avoid over-wetting the purse, as specified in the script: “Wipe it down with a clean, damp cloth.”  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean a purse using vinegar (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a vinegar-water cleaning solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the solution to the purse surface (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the solution to work on the purse (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the solution and clean the purse (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been achieved, and the main goal of cleaning the purse using vinegar is complete. The purse should now be clean and free of the vinegar solution.  
[/REVIEW]
