### Step 4: Recall Recipe Requirements
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the recipe requirements and the script to ensure alignment with the current goal of preheating the oven.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies: "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)." The selected recipe requires an oven and a roasting pan, with no conflicting temperature instructions. The ingredients and tools gathered in the previous step (quails, olive oil, seasonings, roasting pan, etc.) are relevant for the preparation and cooking steps that follow preheating.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Preheat the Oven
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) as specified in the script. This will be achieved by setting the oven to the correct temperature and allowing it to reach the desired heat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Turn on the oven and set the temperature to 350°F (180°C). Allow it to preheat for approximately 10-15 minutes, checking the oven’s indicator to confirm it has reached the correct temperature.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validate Oven Preheating
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the oven has preheated to 350°F (180°C). This will be achieved by checking the oven’s temperature indicator or using an oven thermometer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the oven’s temperature by checking the built-in temperature indicator or placing an oven thermometer inside to confirm it reads 350°F (180°C). If not at the correct temperature, adjust the oven settings and wait additional time as needed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Prepare the Quail
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the quail according to the recipe instructions. This will be achieved by seasoning the quail and placing it in the roasting pan as specified.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Pat the quails dry with paper towels. In a bowl, mix 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tbsp chopped rosemary, and the juice of 1 lemon. Rub this mixture evenly over the quails, inside and out. Place the quails breast-side up in the roasting pan.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Cooking Time Information
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the cooking time for the quail, as the script notes that "cooking time depends on the recipe being used."  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script indicates that cooking time depends on the recipe. For the selected roasted quail recipe, typical cooking time at 350°F (180°C) is approximately 25-30 minutes for quails, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). The script’s instruction to "follow the recipe instructions" supports adhering to this time frame.  
[/REVIEW]
