### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for conditioning dirty hair using a mixture of beer and chamomile tea, adhering to the provided script and the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The script includes four steps: (1) Prepare a mixture of chamomile tea and beer, (2) Pour the mixture over dirty hair, (3) Leave the mixture in hair for a few minutes, and (4) Rinse hair with cool water. The constraint is that the hair is dirty, and the task falls under the category of Personal Care and Style. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of conditioning dirty hair with beer and chamomile into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Create a chamomile tea and beer mixture.  
2. Apply the mixture to dirty hair.  
3. Allow the mixture to sit in the hair for a few minutes.  
4. Rinse the hair with cool water to complete the conditioning process.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals. Based on the recent [PLANNING] block, the goals are:  
- Main Goal: Condition dirty hair using beer and chamomile.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a chamomile tea and beer mixture.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the mixture to dirty hair.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the mixture to sit in the hair for a few minutes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the hair with cool water.  
**Current Goal**: Create a chamomile tea and beer mixture (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy provides context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a chamomile tea and beer mixture.  
- **How to Achieve**: Brew chamomile tea, let it cool, and mix it with beer in a suitable container.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of creating the mixture:  
1. Boil water and steep chamomile tea (using a tea bag or loose chamomile flowers) for 5-10 minutes.  
2. Allow the tea to cool to room temperature to avoid damaging hair.  
3. In a bowl or jug, combine equal parts of cooled chamomile tea and beer (e.g., 1 cup tea and 1 cup beer).  
4. Stir gently to ensure the mixture is well-blended.  
The mixture is now ready for application.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the chamomile tea and beer mixture is properly prepared.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the mixture for correct consistency, temperature, and proportions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the mixture:  
- Confirm the mixture is at room temperature to ensure it’s safe for hair application.  
- Verify the consistency is liquid and well-mixed, with no separation or sediment.  
- Ensure the proportions are roughly equal (e.g., 1:1 ratio of tea to beer) for balanced conditioning effects.  
The mixture meets the requirements and is ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the mixture to dirty hair.  
- **How to Achieve**: Pour the chamomile tea and beer mixture evenly over the hair, ensuring full coverage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To apply the mixture:  
1. Position yourself over a sink or in a shower to manage drips.  
2. Slowly pour the chamomile tea and beer mixture over your dirty hair, starting from the roots and working to the ends.  
3. Massage the mixture gently into the scalp and hair to ensure even distribution.  
The mixture has been applied to the dirty hair.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Allow the mixture to sit in the hair for a few minutes.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let the mixture remain in the hair for 5-10 minutes to allow conditioning effects.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve this goal:  
1. Leave the chamomile tea and beer mixture in the hair for 5-10 minutes.  
2. Optionally, cover the hair with a shower cap to prevent dripping and enhance absorption.  
3. Use a timer to ensure the mixture sits for the appropriate duration.  
The mixture has conditioned the hair during this time.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve past information related to the current goal of rinsing the hair, focusing on the script’s instruction to use cool water.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The current goal is to rinse the hair with cool water (Subgoal 4). Relevant information from the script and previous steps:  
- The script specifies rinsing with cool water to complete the conditioning process (Step 4 of the script).  
- The hair is currently treated with the chamomile tea and beer mixture, which has been applied and left for 5-10 minutes.  
- Cool water is emphasized to seal the hair cuticles and maintain the conditioning effects.  
This information confirms the rinsing process should use cool water to finalize the treatment.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Rinse the hair with cool water.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use cool water to thoroughly rinse the mixture from the hair, ensuring no residue remains.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To rinse the hair:  
1. Use a shower or faucet to run cool water (not cold or warm) through the hair.  
2. Rinse thoroughly, starting from the scalp and moving to the ends, to remove all traces of the chamomile tea and beer mixture.  
3. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear, indicating no residue remains.  
The hair is now clean and conditioned.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update and review the goal hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Condition dirty hair using beer and chamomile (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a chamomile tea and beer mixture (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the mixture to dirty hair (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the mixture to sit in the hair for a few minutes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the hair with cool water (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
The conditioning process is fully executed, and no further steps are required.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to condition dirty hair with beer and chamomile has been completed by following the meta-cognitive action set framework. All four steps from the script were executed, with subgoals planned, implemented, and reviewed systematically. The hair is now conditioned, addressing the constraint of dirty hair in the Personal Care and Style category.
