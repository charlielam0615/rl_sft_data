### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for using a hot glue gun to make a phone stand, following the provided script and adhering to the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M) framework. The script includes five steps: obtaining a hot glue gun and glue stick, heating the glue gun, applying glue to the phone's back, pressing the phone onto a surface, and holding it until the glue hardens. The constraint is to use a hot glue gun, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The plan must be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating a phone stand using a hot glue gun into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Acquire necessary materials (hot glue gun and glue stick).  
2. Prepare the hot glue gun for use.  
3. Apply glue to the phone.  
4. Attach the phone to a surface.  
5. Ensure the glue sets properly to form a stable stand.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to acquire necessary materials (hot glue gun and glue stick). This will be achieved by gathering the required items from a workspace or purchasing them if not available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Locate a hot glue gun and a compatible glue stick in the workspace. If unavailable, purchase them from a hardware or craft store. Ensure the glue stick is suitable for the glue gun model.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the acquired materials are suitable. This will be achieved by checking that the hot glue gun is functional and the glue stick is compatible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the hot glue gun for any damage and confirm it powers on. Verify that the glue stick fits the gun’s barrel and is designed for hot glue applications.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Create a phone stand using a hot glue gun.  
  - Subgoal 1: Acquire necessary materials (hot glue gun and glue stick) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the hot glue gun for use – Not started.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply glue to the phone – Not started.  
  - Subgoal 4: Attach the phone to a surface – Not started.  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the glue sets properly – Not started.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the hot glue gun for use.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to prepare the hot glue gun for use. This will be achieved by plugging in the glue gun and allowing it to heat up.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Plug the hot glue gun into a power outlet. Wait approximately 5-10 minutes for it to reach the appropriate temperature, as indicated by the glue becoming molten when the trigger is pressed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Revise the subgoals to account for safety and stability considerations:  
1. Acquire necessary materials (hot glue gun and glue stick) – Completed.  
2. Prepare the hot glue gun for use, ensuring safe handling – In progress.  
3. Select a stable surface and apply glue to the phone carefully to avoid burns.  
4. Attach the phone to the surface at an angle suitable for a stand.  
5. Ensure the glue sets properly while maintaining the phone’s position.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to select a stable surface and apply glue to the phone carefully. This will be achieved by choosing a flat, sturdy surface and applying a small amount of hot glue to the phone’s back.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a flat, heat-resistant surface (e.g., a piece of wood or plastic) for the phone stand base. Once the glue gun is heated, apply a small, even layer of hot glue to the back of the phone, avoiding sensitive areas like buttons or ports.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the glue application is correct. This will be achieved by checking that the glue is applied evenly and in the correct position on the phone.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the glue on the phone’s back to ensure it forms a thin, even layer and is positioned to allow stable attachment to the surface. If uneven or excessive, remove excess glue carefully before it hardens.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to attach the phone to the surface. Retrieve information related to the surface selection and glue application to ensure proper execution.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 6: A stable, heat-resistant surface (e.g., wood or plastic) was selected for the stand.  
- From Step 7: A small, even layer of hot glue was applied to the phone’s back, avoiding sensitive areas.  
This information ensures the surface is suitable and the glue is correctly positioned for attachment.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to attach the phone to the surface. This will be achieved by pressing the phone onto the selected surface at an angle suitable for a stand.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Carefully press the glued back of the phone onto the selected surface at a 45-degree angle to create a functional stand. Ensure firm contact between the phone and the surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the glue sets properly. This will be achieved by holding the phone in place until the glue cools and hardens.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the phone firmly in place on the surface for 1-2 minutes until the glue cools and hardens, ensuring the phone remains stable and at the desired angle.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to confirm the phone stand is stable. This will be achieved by testing the stand’s stability and ensuring the phone is securely attached.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gently release the phone and test the stand by placing it on a flat surface. Check if the phone remains upright and stable. If it wobbles or detaches, reapply glue and repeat the attachment process.  
[/IMP]
