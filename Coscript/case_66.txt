**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for making campfire starters using matches, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The process involves creating campfire starters by lining a cardboard box with aluminum foil, filling it with sawdust or similar materials, placing cotton balls on top, lighting them with matches, and storing the extinguished cotton balls for later use as campfire starters. The solution must follow the structured format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as applicable, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step until the plan is complete.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Making Campfire Starters

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making campfire starters with matches into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare the container by setting up a cardboard box with aluminum foil and filling it with sawdust, shavings, or fine sand.  
- Subgoal 2: Ensure the container is stored safely in a cool, dry place until ready for use.  
- Subgoal 3: Set up the campfire starter by placing a cotton ball on the sawdust and lighting it with a match.  
- Subgoal 4: Safely extinguish the cotton ball in the sawdust and store the extinguished cotton balls in a resealable bag.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Review Goal Hierarchy

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals and highlighting the current one.  
- **Goal**: Make campfire starters with matches.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the container (cardboard box with aluminum foil and sawdust).  
  - Subgoal 2: Store the container safely.  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and light the campfire starter.  
  - Subgoal 4: Extinguish and store the cotton balls.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the container (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Prepare the Container

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the container for making campfire starters. This involves getting a cardboard box, lining it with aluminum foil, and filling it with sawdust, shavings, or fine sand, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Obtain a sturdy cardboard box suitable for containing sawdust and heat.  
- Line the bottom of the box with aluminum foil to create a heat-resistant surface.  
- Fill the box with sawdust, wood shavings, or fine sand to serve as the base material for the campfire starters.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate Container Preparation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the container is correctly prepared. This involves checking that the cardboard box is lined with aluminum foil and filled with appropriate material (sawdust, shavings, or fine sand).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Inspect the cardboard box to ensure the aluminum foil is securely and evenly lined across the bottom without gaps.  
- Verify that the box is filled with a sufficient amount of sawdust, shavings, or fine sand to cover the foil and provide a stable base for the cotton balls.  
- Confirm that the materials used are dry and suitable for the task.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Store the Container Safely

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to store the prepared container safely. This involves placing the box in a cool, dry place to ensure the materials remain stable until ready for use.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Identify a cool, dry location, such as a garage or storage closet, away from heat sources or moisture.  
- Place the prepared cardboard box in this location to keep the sawdust or other materials dry and ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Review Progress and Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy:  
- **Goal**: Make campfire starters with matches.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the container (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Store the container safely (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and light the campfire starter.  
  - Subgoal 4: Extinguish and store the cotton balls.  
**Current Goal**: Set up and light the campfire starter (Subgoal 3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Set Up and Light the Campfire Starter

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and light the campfire starter. This involves taking the box outside, placing a cotton ball on the sawdust, and carefully lighting it with a match.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Take the prepared cardboard box outside to a safe, open area away from flammable materials.  
- Place a cotton ball on top of the sawdust in the box.  
- Carefully light a match and use it to ignite the cotton ball, ensuring safe handling to avoid burns or unintended fires.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validate the Lighting Process

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the cotton ball is properly lit and burns as intended. This involves checking that the cotton ball ignites and burns briefly without causing issues in the box.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Observe the cotton ball to ensure it catches fire and burns steadily when lit with the match.  
- Confirm that the flame does not spread uncontrollably to the sawdust or the box.  
- Ensure the burning process is safe and contained within the foil-lined box.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Extinguish and Store Cotton Balls

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extinguish the burning cotton ball in the sawdust and store the extinguished cotton balls. This involves holding the burning cotton ball in the sawdust until it goes out and then storing it in a resealable bag.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Hold the burning cotton ball in the sawdust using tongs or a safe tool until the flame extinguishes completely.  
- Allow the cotton ball to cool briefly to ensure it is fully extinguished.  
- Place the extinguished cotton ball in a resealable bag for storage, ensuring the bag is sealed to keep the starters dry and ready for future use.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Final Goal Review

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Review the final goal hierarchy:  
- **Goal**: Make campfire starters with matches.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the container (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Store the container safely (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and light the campfire starter (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Extinguish and store the cotton balls (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The process of making campfire starters with matches is now complete, with all subgoals successfully achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Summary
The plan for making campfire starters with matches has been completed through a series of meta-cognitive actions, including forward subgoaling, tracking goals, reaching goals, and validation. Each step adhered to the provided script and constraints, ensuring a safe and effective process for creating campfire starters.
