**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for driving to the store, following the provided script of steps ('1. Start the car.', '2. Put on your seatbelt.', '3. Drive to the store.', '4. Park the car.', '5. Turn off the car.') while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. Each step must select one action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and the response must use the specified [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the action's category. The plan must be completed systematically, ensuring all steps in the script are addressed.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To drive to the store, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Start the car.  
2. Put on the seatbelt.  
3. Drive to the store.  
4. Park the car.  
5. Turn off the car.  
These subgoals form a sequential plan to achieve the main goal of driving to the store.

**Step 2: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Drive to the store  
  - Subgoal 1: Start the car  
  - Subgoal 2: Put on the seatbelt  
  - Subgoal 3: Drive to the store  
  - Subgoal 4: Park the car  
  - Subgoal 5: Turn off the car  
**Current Goal**: Start the car  
The goal hierarchy is updated based on the forward subgoaling from Step 1. The current focus is on the first subgoal: starting the car.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Start the car  
**How to Achieve**: Insert the key into the ignition or press the start button (for keyless ignition) to start the car's engine.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To start the car, ensure the vehicle is in park, insert the key into the ignition (or press the start button if equipped with keyless ignition), and turn the key or press the button to activate the engine. Verify that the engine is running by checking the dashboard indicators.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the car has started  
**How to Achieve**: Check the dashboard for engine indicators and listen for the engine running to validate the car is operational.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the car has started by observing the dashboard lights (e.g., engine or battery indicators) and listening for the sound of the engine. If the engine does not start, check the battery or key position and retry. The car is now running, confirming the first subgoal is complete.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 3: Drive to the store  
  - Subgoal 4: Park the car  
  - Subgoal 5: Turn off the car  
**Current Goal**: Put on the seatbelt  
The first subgoal (start the car) is complete, as validated in Step 4. The current focus shifts to the next subgoal: putting on the seatbelt.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Put on the seatbelt  
**How to Achieve**: Pull the seatbelt across the body and click it into the buckle to secure it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pull the seatbelt from its holder over the shoulder and across the chest, then insert the buckle into the latch until it clicks. Ensure the seatbelt is not twisted and lies flat for proper safety.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the seatbelt is properly secured  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the seatbelt is latched and fits snugly without twists.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the seatbelt is securely fastened by ensuring the buckle is clicked into place and the belt is snug across the chest and lap. Tug lightly to confirm it is locked. If not secure, unbuckle and re-fasten. The seatbelt is now properly secured, completing the second subgoal.
