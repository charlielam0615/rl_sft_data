**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for splitting hardwood firewood using an ax, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task must adhere to the constraint of using an ax and follow the script: (1) Place the log on the chopping block, (2) Examine the wood, (3) Aim, (4) Bring the ax up and down, (5) Finish the job. Each step will involve selecting one meta-cognitive action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To effectively split hardwood firewood with an ax, break down the provided script into actionable subgoals that align with the steps: (1) Place the log, (2) Examine the wood, (3) Aim, (4) Swing the ax, (5) Complete the task. Each subgoal will correspond to a script step, ensuring the task is manageable and sequential. The subgoals are:  
- Subgoal 1: Position the log securely on the chopping block.  
- Subgoal 2: Inspect the log for knots or cracks to determine the best splitting point.  
- Subgoal 3: Align the ax for an accurate strike.  
- Subgoal 4: Execute a controlled ax swing to split the log.  
- Subgoal 5: Ensure the log is fully split or repeat as needed to complete the task.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the log securely on the chopping block (Subgoal 1). This will be achieved by selecting a stable, flat chopping block and placing the log upright to ensure it remains steady during the swing.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select a sturdy chopping block on level ground to prevent wobbling. Choose a hardwood log and place it upright in the center of the block, ensuring it balances without support. Adjust the log if it leans or rocks to confirm stability before proceeding.  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the log is securely positioned on the chopping block (Subgoal 1). This will be achieved by checking the log’s stability and the chopping block’s suitability to ensure safe and effective splitting.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the log to confirm it stands upright without wobbling. Push gently against the log to test its balance. Verify that the chopping block is flat, stable, and free of debris that could interfere with the log’s placement. If the log or block is unstable, reposition the log or select a new block.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Split hardwood firewood with an ax.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the log securely on the chopping block (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Inspect the log for knots or cracks to determine the best splitting point (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Align the ax for an accurate strike (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Execute a controlled ax swing to split the log (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the log is fully split or repeat as needed to complete the task (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Inspect the log for knots or cracks to determine the best splitting point.  

[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to inspect the log for knots or cracks to determine the best splitting point (Subgoal 2). This will be achieved by visually examining the log’s surface and grain to identify weak points for splitting.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the log’s surface for visible knots, cracks, or irregularities. Look for natural splits or weaker grain patterns that indicate where the wood is likely to split cleanly. Rotate the log if needed to find the optimal side for striking. Mark the chosen splitting point mentally or with a small chalk mark for clarity.  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the chosen splitting point on the log is optimal (Subgoal 2). This will be achieved by confirming that the selected point avoids knots and aligns with the wood’s grain for easier splitting.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Reassess the marked splitting point to ensure it avoids knots or dense areas that could resist the ax. Check that the point aligns with the wood’s grain by observing the direction of fibers. If the point seems suboptimal (e.g., too close to a knot), select a new point and re-evaluate. Confirm the log remains stable on the block during this process.  

[/IMP]

**Step 7: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to align the ax for an accurate strike (Subgoal 3). This will be achieved by positioning the body and ax to target the chosen splitting point precisely.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, facing the log. Hold the ax with both hands, dominant hand near the ax head and non-dominant hand at the handle’s end. Position the ax above the marked splitting point, aligning the blade with the log’s grain. Practice a slow, controlled motion to ensure the swing will hit the target accurately.  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to execute a controlled ax swing to split the log (Subgoal 4). This will be achieved by swinging the ax with proper force and technique to drive it through the marked splitting point.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Raise the ax overhead, keeping elbows slightly bent and eyes on the target point. Slide the dominant hand down to meet the non-dominant hand at the handle’s end as you swing downward. Strike the log firmly at the marked point, driving the ax blade through the wood. Follow through with the swing to maximize force. If the log doesn’t split, pry the ax free and prepare for another swing.  

[/IMP]

**Step 9: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the log is fully split or repeat as needed (Subgoal 5). Retrieve information from previous steps related to splitting technique and log inspection to inform the completion process.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 5: The log was inspected for knots and cracks, and a splitting point was chosen based on weak grain patterns (Subgoal 2).  
- Step 6: The splitting point was validated to avoid knots and align with the grain for easier splitting (Subgoal 2).  
- Step 7: The ax was aligned accurately with the chosen splitting point (Subgoal 3).  
- Step 8: A controlled ax swing was executed, targeting the splitting point with proper technique (Subgoal 4).  
This information indicates the log was prepared and struck correctly. If the log is not fully split, reapply the same inspection and swinging technique, adjusting the strike point if necessary.  

[/REVIEW]

**Step 10: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the log is fully split or repeat as needed to complete the task (Subgoal 5). This will be achieved by checking the log’s condition and repeating swings or moving to the next log.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the log to determine if it has split completely. If split, remove the pieces from the chopping block and place a new log to continue. If not fully split, reposition the log to target remaining connected sections, re-aim, and swing the ax again using the technique from Step 8. Repeat until the log is fully split. Once complete, clear the block and prepare for the next log or conclude the task if all logs are split.
