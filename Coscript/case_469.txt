This information will serve as the foundation for crafting clear, targeted questions.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Define necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the goal of clarifying questions to ensure they are specific and relevant.  
1. **Identify Key Areas**: Determine critical topics (curriculum, admissions, culture) based on research.  
2. **Draft Questions**: Formulate specific questions for each area that align with personal goals and school priorities.  
3. **Refine Questions**: Ensure questions are concise, professional, and likely to elicit useful responses.  
[/PLANNING]
