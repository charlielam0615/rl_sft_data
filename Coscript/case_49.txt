### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block, and stating the current goal.  

- **Main Goal**: Scale objects in AutoCAD using reference objects.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Open the AutoCAD drawing to prepare for scaling.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Select the objects to be scaled.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Initiate the scale command.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Specify the base point for scaling.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Define the reference length using two points on the object.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Specify a reference point in the drawing.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Set the new length for scaling.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Complete the scaling operation.  

**Current Goal**: Open the AutoCAD drawing to prepare for scaling.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the AutoCAD drawing to prepare for scaling. This will be achieved by launching AutoCAD and accessing the relevant drawing file.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Launch the AutoCAD application on the computer. Navigate to the "File" menu, select "Open," and choose the drawing file that contains the objects to be scaled. Ensure the drawing is fully loaded and visible in the AutoCAD workspace.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the correct AutoCAD drawing is open and ready for scaling. This will be achieved by checking the drawing’s contents and ensuring it is the intended file.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the AutoCAD workspace to confirm that the opened drawing contains the objects intended for scaling. Verify the file name in the title bar or properties to ensure it matches the expected drawing. Check that the drawing is not locked or read-only to allow modifications.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain the goal-management system by listing all goals and highlighting the current goal.  

- **Main Goal**: Scale objects in AutoCAD using reference objects.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Open the AutoCAD drawing to prepare for scaling (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Select the objects to be scaled.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Initiate the scale command.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Specify the base point for scaling.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Define the reference length using two points on the object.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Specify a reference point in the drawing.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Set the new length for scaling.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Complete the scaling operation.  

**Current Goal**: Select the objects to be scaled.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the objects to be scaled. This will be achieved by using AutoCAD’s selection tools to highlight the desired objects in the drawing.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the AutoCAD workspace, use the mouse to click and drag a selection window around the objects to be scaled, or individually click each object while holding the Shift key to add multiple objects to the selection. Ensure all intended objects are highlighted before proceeding.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to initiate the scale command. This will be achieved by entering the “scale” command in AutoCAD’s command line.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Type “sc” or “scale” into the AutoCAD command line and press Enter. Confirm that the command is active by checking for the “Specify base point or [Displacement]” prompt in the command line.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to specify the base point for scaling. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the selection of objects and the initiation of the scale command to ensure proper context for selecting the base point.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to specify the base point for scaling. From previous steps:  
- The correct AutoCAD drawing has been opened and verified (Step 3, Step 4).  
- The objects to be scaled have been selected (Step 6).  
- The scale command has been initiated, and the “Specify base point or [Displacement]” prompt is active (Step 7).  
This confirms that the selected objects are ready for scaling, and the next step involves choosing a base point on one of these objects to define the scaling origin.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to specify the base point for scaling. This will be achieved by clicking a point on one of the selected objects to serve as the scaling origin.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Click a precise point on one of the selected objects in the AutoCAD drawing to set the base point for scaling. This point should be a logical anchor, such as a corner or intersection, to ensure accurate scaling. Confirm that AutoCAD registers the base point and prompts for the next step.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the reference length using two points on the object. This will be achieved by selecting two points on the object to establish the reference length for scaling.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After the “Specify second point or [Copy] [Reference]” prompt appears, click the “Reference” option in the command line. Then, click two points on the selected object to define the reference length (e.g., the distance between two endpoints of a line). Ensure the points are accurately selected to represent the current length.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to specify a reference point in the drawing. This will be achieved by selecting a point in the drawing that corresponds to the desired scaling reference.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
When the “Specify reference point” prompt appears, click a point in the AutoCAD drawing that serves as the reference point for scaling (e.g., a known point on another object or a fixed location in the drawing). Ensure the point is chosen carefully to align with the scaling requirements.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set the new length for scaling. This will be achieved by entering the desired length in the command line to complete the scaling operation.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
When the “Specify new length or [Select objects]” prompt appears, type the desired new length for the reference distance in the command line and press Enter. Verify that the selected objects scale proportionally based on the new length provided.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the objects have been scaled correctly using the reference objects. This will be achieved by checking the dimensions of the scaled objects against the expected outcome.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use AutoCAD’s measurement tools (e.g., “Distance” command) to measure the scaled objects and confirm that the new dimensions match the intended scaling factor based on the reference length and new length provided. Visually inspect the objects to ensure they are proportionally scaled and aligned with the reference point.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain the goal-management system by listing all goals and highlighting the current goal.  

- **Main Goal**: Scale objects in AutoCAD using reference objects.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Open the AutoCAD drawing to prepare for scaling (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Select the objects to be scaled (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Initiate the scale command (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Specify the base point for scaling (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Define the reference length using two points on the object (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Specify a reference point in the drawing (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Set the new length for scaling (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Complete the scaling operation (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: The scaling operation is complete, and all subgoals have been achieved.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Since all subgoals have been completed and validated, evaluate whether any additional steps are needed to finalize the plan or address potential oversights in the scaling process.  

No additional subgoals are required, as the scaling operation has been successfully completed using reference objects, and the results have been validated. The plan is complete.  

[/PLANNING]
