### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to develop confidence in approaching bass clef notation. Validate the understanding of the bass clef staff and ledger lines by checking comprehension through a simple exercise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate understanding:  
- Draw or visualize a bass clef staff and place the note F on the fourth line.  
- Identify one ledger line note below the staff (e.g., low C, two ledger lines below).  
- Confirm accuracy by referencing a bass clef note chart or diagram. If errors occur, revisit the study of the bass clef structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the subgoals to ensure steady progress, considering the validation results. If confidence in ledger lines is weak, add a subgoal to reinforce ledger line practice before moving to identifying the note C.  
- Updated Subgoal 1: Develop confidence in approaching bass clef notation, including handling ledger lines (in progress).  
- New Subgoal 2: Practice identifying ledger line notes in isolation to build familiarity.  
- Subgoal 3: Identify the note C on the bass clef staff (shifted).  
- Subgoal 4: Memorize the order of notes in the bass clef (shifted).  
- Subgoal 5: Practice reading notes directly from the bass clef staff (shifted).  
- Subgoal 6: Gain proficiency in reading ledger lines in the bass clef (shifted).  
- Subgoal 7: Apply skills by playing simple bass clef melodies (shifted).  
[/PLANNING]

---

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To practice identifying ledger line notes:  
- Use a blank bass clef staff and write notes one and two ledger lines below the staff (e.g., D and C).  
- Practice naming these notes without a reference, then check against a note chart.  
- Repeat with notes above the staff (e.g., A, one ledger line above).  
- Complete 5–10 exercises to build familiarity and confidence.  
[/IMP]
