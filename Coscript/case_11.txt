### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for removing beer stains from fabric at home, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint that all actions must be performed at home. The solution will use the meta-cognitive action set (M) divided into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories, selecting one action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The script provided includes six steps: making a cleaning mixture, applying it to the stain, rubbing it in, rinsing, repeating as needed, and washing the item normally.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To effectively remove beer stains from fabric at home, I will break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare a cleaning mixture.  
2. Apply the mixture to the stained area.  
3. Work the mixture into the stain.  
4. Rinse the treated area.  
5. Assess and repeat the treatment if necessary.  
6. Wash the fabric item as usual.  
These subgoals align with the script and ensure a structured approach to achieving the final goal of a stain-free fabric.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Remove beer stains from fabric at home.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a cleaning mixture.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the mixture to the stained area.  
  - Subgoal 3: Work the mixture into the stain.  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the treated area.  
  - Subgoal 5: Assess and repeat the treatment if necessary.  
  - Subgoal 6: Wash the fabric item as usual.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare a cleaning mixture (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare a cleaning mixture.  
**How to Achieve**: Mix one part dishwashing liquid with one part lukewarm water in a container, following the script’s first step, ensuring the mixture is ready for application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To prepare the cleaning mixture, take a small bowl or container available at home. Measure equal parts of dishwashing liquid (e.g., a common brand like Dawn) and lukewarm water (e.g., one tablespoon of each). Combine them in the container and stir gently to create a uniform solution. This mixture will be used to treat the beer stain.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the cleaning mixture is correctly prepared.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the mixture consists of equal parts dishwashing liquid and lukewarm water, checking for proper consistency and readiness for application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the prepared mixture to confirm it has a soapy, slightly viscous consistency, indicating a proper blend of dishwashing liquid and lukewarm water. Ensure the water is lukewarm (not hot or cold) by feeling it with your hand. If the mixture appears too watery or overly concentrated, adjust by adding more dishwashing liquid or water to achieve a balanced solution.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the mixture to the stained area.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a clean cloth or sponge to apply the prepared mixture directly onto the beer stain on the fabric, as per the script’s second step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Dip a clean cloth or sponge into the prepared mixture, ensuring it is saturated but not dripping. Gently dab or spread the mixture onto the beer-stained area of the fabric, covering the entire stain evenly. Avoid excessive soaking to prevent spreading the stain or damaging the fabric.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Work the mixture into the stain.  
**How to Achieve**: Rub the applied mixture into the beer stain using a cloth, sponge, or fingers, as outlined in the script’s third step, to help break down the stain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the same cloth or sponge, or clean fingers, gently rub the mixture into the stained area in a circular motion. Apply light pressure to work the solution into the fabric fibers, focusing on the stain without spreading it to unaffected areas. Continue for about 30 seconds to ensure the mixture penetrates the stain.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the treated area.  
**How to Achieve**: Rinse the stained area with lukewarm water, as per the script’s fourth step, to remove the cleaning mixture and loosened stain particles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Hold the treated area of the fabric under a stream of lukewarm water or use a clean, damp cloth to blot and rinse the area thoroughly. Ensure all soap residue and loosened stain particles are washed away. Check that the water remains lukewarm to avoid setting the stain or damaging the fabric.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of assessing whether the stain is removed, focusing on the process of applying, rubbing, and rinsing the mixture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Assess and repeat the treatment if necessary (Subgoal 5).  
**Recalled Information**: Previous steps involved preparing a mixture of equal parts dishwashing liquid and lukewarm water (Step 3), applying it to the stain (Step 5), rubbing it into the fabric (Step 6), and rinsing with lukewarm water (Step 7). The script indicates that steps 2 through 4 (apply, rub, rinse) should be repeated until the stain is gone. This suggests inspecting the fabric after rinsing to determine if the stain persists, which will guide the next action.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Assess whether the beer stain is removed from the fabric.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the rinsed area visually and tactilely to determine if the stain is gone, as implied by the script’s fifth step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the fabric under good lighting to check for any remaining traces of the beer stain. Run your fingers over the area to feel for any residue or discoloration. If the stain is no longer visible and the fabric feels clean, the stain is considered removed. If any stain remains, the process of applying, rubbing, and rinsing must be repeated.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Based on the validation, if the stain persists, adjust the plan to repeat subgoals 2 through 4 (apply the mixture, rub it in, rinse the area). If the stain is gone, proceed to the final subgoal of washing the item. For this step, assume the stain persists slightly to demonstrate the repetition process, requiring one more cycle before moving to washing. The adjusted subgoals are:  
1. Reapply the mixture to the stained area.  
2. Rub the mixture into the stain again.  
3. Rinse the area with lukewarm water.  
4. Reassess the stain.  
5. Wash the fabric item as usual (if the stain is gone).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Reapply the mixture to the stained area.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the existing mixture to reapply it to the remaining beer stain, following the adjusted subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the same cloth or sponge, dip it into the prepared dishwashing liquid and lukewarm water mixture. Dab or spread the mixture onto the remaining beer stain, ensuring full coverage of the affected area, as done previously.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rub the mixture into the stain again.  
**How to Achieve**: Rub the reapplied mixture into the stain to further break it down, as per the adjusted subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gently rub the mixture into the stain using circular motions with the cloth, sponge, or fingers for about 30 seconds. Focus on the remaining stained area to ensure the solution penetrates the fabric fibers effectively.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the area with lukewarm water.  
**How to Achieve**: Rinse the treated area again with lukewarm water to remove the mixture and any remaining stain particles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rinse the fabric under lukewarm water or use a clean, damp cloth to blot the area thoroughly, removing all soap and loosened stain residue. Ensure the water is lukewarm to maintain consistency with previous steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Reassess whether the beer stain is fully removed.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the fabric to confirm the stain is gone, determining whether to proceed to washing or repeat the treatment again.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the fabric under good lighting and feel the area for any remaining stain or residue. For this simulation, assume the stain is now fully removed, as the repeated treatment was effective. The fabric appears clean and ready for the final washing step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Remove beer stains from fabric at home.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a cleaning mixture (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the mixture to the stained area (Completed, repeated).  
  - Subgoal 3: Work the mixture into the stain (Completed, repeated).  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the treated area (Completed, repeated).  
  - Subgoal 5: Assess and repeat the treatment if necessary (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Wash the fabric item as usual (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Wash the fabric item as usual (Subgoal 6).  
This updated hierarchy reflects the completion of the stain removal process and the final pending subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Wash the fabric item as usual.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow the fabric’s care instructions to wash the item normally, as per the script’s sixth step, using a washing machine or hand-washing at home.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the fabric’s care label for washing instructions. If machine-washable, place the item in a washing machine with regular detergent and wash on the appropriate cycle (e.g., normal or delicate) using lukewarm water. If hand-washing is required, fill a basin with lukewarm water and detergent, agitate the fabric gently, then rinse thoroughly. Dry the item according to its care instructions (e.g., air dry or tumble dry). This completes the stain removal process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the fabric is clean and undamaged after washing.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the washed fabric to ensure the beer stain is gone and the fabric is intact, verifying the success of the entire process.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After washing and drying, examine the fabric under good lighting to confirm the beer stain is completely removed. Check for any damage, such as color fading or fabric wear, caused by the cleaning process. If the fabric is clean and undamaged, the goal of removing the beer stain at home is achieved. For this simulation, assume the fabric is clean and in good condition, indicating success.  
[/IMP]
