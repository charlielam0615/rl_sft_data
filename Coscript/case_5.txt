### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for drying lavender in the microwave, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint that the drying must be done in the microwave. The plan will be developed step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action from the set and presenting content in the appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified requirements.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of drying lavender in the microwave into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare the lavender for drying by placing it on a plate.  
- Subgoal 2: Position the plate with lavender in the microwave.  
- Subgoal 3: Dry the lavender using the microwave on high for 30 seconds.  
- Subgoal 4: Remove the plate and allow the lavender to cool to complete the drying process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous planning step, highlighting the current goal.
