### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Determine the amount of soap base needed for an 8-pound mold.  
**How to Achieve:** Calculate the soap base required by considering the mold’s capacity (8 pounds or 3.6 kilograms) and accounting for any additives (calamine lotion, essential oils), which may slightly reduce the soap base proportion. Use standard soap-making guidelines to ensure the mold is filled appropriately.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To calculate the soap base needed for an 8-pound mold, note that the mold’s capacity is 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) of final soap mixture. In soap making, the soap base typically constitutes 85–90% of the total weight, with additives like calamine lotion and essential oils making up the remainder. Assuming calamine lotion and essential oils account for approximately 10–15% of the mixture (a standard estimate for such recipes), the soap base required is:  
- Lower estimate: 85% of 8 pounds = 0.85 × 8 = 6.8 pounds (3.08 kilograms).  
- Upper estimate: 90% of 8 pounds = 0.90 × 8 = 7.2 pounds (3.27 kilograms).  
To ensure sufficient mixture and account for potential loss during melting or pouring, use 7.2 pounds (3.27 kilograms) of soap base. This aligns with standard soap-making practices for an 8-pound mold.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the calculated amount of soap base (7.2 pounds) is appropriate for the 8-pound mold.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify the calculation by cross-checking with soap-making standards and ensuring the amount accounts for additives and mold capacity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The calculated 7.2 pounds (3.27 kilograms) of soap base is validated by comparing it to soap-making guidelines, which suggest the soap base should be 85–90% of the mold’s capacity to accommodate additives like calamine lotion and essential oils. For an 8-pound mold, 7.2 pounds falls within this range (90% of 8 pounds). Additionally, the slight excess accounts for potential loss during melting or pouring, ensuring the mold is filled adequately. This confirms the calculation is appropriate for producing calamine soap.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Melt the soap base safely.  
**How to Achieve:** Use a double-boiler or microwave to melt 7.2 pounds of soap base, following safe heating practices to avoid scorching or overheating, which could affect the soap’s quality for eczema relief.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To melt 7.2 pounds of soap base, use a double-boiler for even heating, as it prevents scorching, which is critical for maintaining the soap’s skin-soothing properties. Cut the soap base into small chunks for faster, uniform melting. Place the chunks in the top of a double-boiler over simmering water, stirring occasionally until fully melted (temperature around 120–140°F or 49–60°C). Alternatively, if using a microwave, place chunks in a microwave-safe container, heat in 30-second bursts, stirring between intervals to ensure even melting. Monitor closely to avoid overheating, which could degrade the soap base. Once melted, the soap base is ready for adding calamine lotion.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Incorporate calamine lotion into the melted soap.  
**How to Achieve:** Stir in an appropriate amount of calamine lotion to the melted soap base, ensuring even distribution without compromising the soap’s consistency, as calamine is key for eczema relief.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For an 8-pound soap batch, add approximately 0.8–1.2 pounds (10–15% of the total weight) of calamine lotion to the melted 7.2 pounds of soap base, as calamine is the active ingredient for eczema relief. Remove the melted soap base from heat to cool slightly (to about 110–120°F or 43–49°C) to prevent degrading the calamine lotion’s properties. Slowly stir in the calamine lotion using a spatula or whisk, ensuring it is fully incorporated without clumps. Mix gently to avoid introducing air bubbles, which could affect the soap’s texture. The mixture should appear uniform and slightly pink due to the calamine.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Add essential oils to the mixture.  
**How to Achieve:** Select and add essential oils suitable for eczema-prone skin, mixing them into the soap base and calamine mixture to enhance therapeutic properties and fragrance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose essential oils like lavender or chamomile, which are soothing for eczema-prone skin, avoiding irritants like citrus or peppermint. For an 8-pound batch, add 1–2 ounces (30–60 ml) of essential oils (approximately 0.5–1% of the total weight) to balance fragrance and skin safety. With the soap mixture at 110–120°F (43–49°C), slowly stir in the essential oils using a spatula, ensuring even distribution. Mix thoroughly for 1–2 minutes to incorporate the oils without causing the mixture to cool too much, maintaining a pourable consistency.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Pour the mixture into an 8-pound soap-making mold.  
**How to Achieve:** Carefully pour the soap mixture into the mold to ensure it fills evenly without air pockets, preparing it for setting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Ensure the 8-pound (3.6-kilogram) soap-making mold is clean, dry, and placed on a flat surface. With the soap mixture still at a pourable temperature (around 100–110°F or 38–43°C), pour it slowly and steadily into the mold to avoid splashing or trapping air bubbles. Use a spatula to guide the mixture and scrape out any remaining soap from the mixing container. Gently tap the mold on the surface to release any air pockets and ensure the mixture settles evenly. The mold should be filled to the top for a full batch.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Allow the soap to set for 24 hours with proper covering.  
**How to Achieve:** Cover the filled mold with plastic wrap and blankets to insulate it, allowing the soap to undergo saponification and set properly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After pouring, cover the mold with plastic wrap to prevent dust or debris from settling on the soap surface. Wrap the mold in blankets or towels to insulate it, maintaining warmth to support the saponification process, which is critical for the soap’s texture and eczema-soothing properties. Place the mold in a stable, undisturbed location at room temperature (around 70–80°F or 21–27°C). Allow it to set for 24 hours to ensure the soap hardens properly before de-molding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal:** De-mold, cut, and cure the soap.  
**Core Content for Retrieval:** Review previous steps to ensure all preparatory actions (melting, mixing, pouring, setting) were completed correctly to support successful de-molding and curing.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information Related to Current Goal:**  
- Step 3 & 4: Calculated and validated 7.2 pounds of soap base for an 8-pound mold, ensuring sufficient volume.  
- Step 5: Melted the soap base safely using a double-boiler or microwave, achieving a uniform liquid state.  
- Step 6: Added 0.8–1.2 pounds of calamine lotion, ensuring even distribution for eczema relief.  
- Step 7: Incorporated 1–2 ounces of eczema-safe essential oils (e.g., lavender), mixed thoroughly.  
- Step 8: Poured the mixture into the 8-pound mold, ensuring no air pockets.  
- Step 9: Covered the mold with plastic wrap and blankets, set for 24 hours to allow saponification.  
These steps confirm the soap mixture was prepared and molded correctly, setting the stage for de-molding, cutting, and curing.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** De-mold, cut, and cure the soap.  
**How to Achieve:** Remove the soap from the mold, cut it into bars, and cure it for several weeks to ensure it is fully hardened and safe for eczema-prone skin.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After 24 hours, uncover the mold and gently remove the soap block by pressing or tapping it out, ensuring not to damage the soap. If the soap resists, chill the mold briefly (10–15 minutes in a refrigerator) to ease release. Using a sharp knife or soap cutter, cut the soap block into bars of desired size (e.g., 4–5 ounces each, yielding about 25–30 bars from an 8-pound batch). Place the bars on a drying rack in a well-ventilated, dry area (60–70% humidity, 65–75°F or 18–24°C) for curing. Cure the soap for 4–6 weeks, turning the bars weekly to ensure even drying. This process reduces moisture, making the soap milder and longer-lasting for eczema relief.
