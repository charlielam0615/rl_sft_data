**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Prepare high-protein snacks with cottage cheese.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare ingredients by cutting vegetables.  
  - Subgoal 2: Process cottage cheese in a food processor.  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine vegetables with cottage cheese and blend to desired consistency.  
  - Subgoal 4: Serve the mixture as a snack, either alone or with crackers.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare ingredients by cutting vegetables (Subgoal 1).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare ingredients by cutting vegetables. This will be achieved by selecting suitable vegetables, washing them, and chopping them into small pieces for blending.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select vegetables such as cucumbers, bell peppers, or carrots for their crunch and compatibility with cottage cheese. Wash the vegetables thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt. Using a sharp knife, chop them into small, uniform pieces (about 1/2-inch cubes) to ensure they blend well in the food processor.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the vegetables are properly prepared. This will be achieved by checking that the vegetables are clean, evenly chopped, and suitable for blending.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the chopped vegetables to confirm they are clean and free of any residual dirt. Verify that the pieces are uniformly small (around 1/2-inch) to ensure smooth blending in the next step. If any pieces are too large, re-chop them to match the desired size. Confirm that the selected vegetables (e.g., cucumbers, bell peppers, or carrots) are fresh and appropriate for the snack.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Prepare high-protein snacks with cottage cheese.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare ingredients by cutting vegetables (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Process cottage cheese in a food processor.  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine vegetables with cottage cheese and blend to desired consistency.  
  - Subgoal 4: Serve the mixture as a snack, either alone or with crackers.  
**Current Goal**: Process cottage cheese in a food processor (Subgoal 2).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to process cottage cheese in a food processor. This will be achieved by adding the cottage cheese to a food processor and blending it until smooth.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Measure out an appropriate amount of cottage cheese (e.g., 1–2 cups, depending on desired batch size) and place it into the food processor. Blend on medium speed for 30–60 seconds until the cottage cheese reaches a smooth, creamy consistency. Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl if needed to ensure even blending.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cottage cheese is properly processed. This will be achieved by checking that the cottage cheese is smooth and free of lumps.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the cottage cheese in the food processor to confirm it has a smooth, creamy texture with no large curds or lumps. If lumps remain, blend for an additional 15–30 seconds and recheck. Ensure the consistency is suitable for combining with vegetables in the next step.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine vegetables with cottage cheese and blend to desired consistency. This will be achieved by adding the chopped vegetables to the processed cottage cheese in the food processor and pulsing until the mixture is well-combined.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the chopped vegetables (prepared in Step 3) to the food processor containing the smooth cottage cheese. Pulse the mixture in short bursts (3–5 seconds each) until the vegetables are evenly incorporated, and the mixture reaches the desired consistency (e.g., slightly chunky or fully smooth, based on preference). Scrape down the sides as needed to ensure even mixing. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired (e.g., add a pinch of salt or herbs).

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the vegetable and cottage cheese mixture is properly blended. This will be achieved by checking the consistency and flavor of the mixture.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Examine the mixture to confirm it has reached the desired consistency (e.g., smooth or slightly chunky, as preferred). Ensure the vegetables are evenly distributed throughout the cottage cheese. Taste the mixture to verify flavor balance; if needed, add seasonings like black pepper, garlic powder, or fresh herbs, and pulse briefly to incorporate.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Transfer the vegetable and cottage cheese mixture to a serving bowl or individual containers for easy snacking. If desired, serve with whole-grain crackers, pita chips, or vegetable sticks for dipping. Alternatively, enjoy the mixture on its own as a high-protein snack. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days.
