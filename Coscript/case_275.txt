**Problem Restatement**: Create a plan to simulate the process of diffusing essential oils using a diffuser, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must use the diffuser as a constraint and follow the script: (1) Place diffuser in desired location, (2) Fill diffuser with water and essential oils, (3) Turn diffuser on, (4) Enjoy your diffused essential oils. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and responses will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of diffusing essential oils into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Position the diffuser correctly.  
- Subgoal 2: Prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils.  
- Subgoal 3: Activate the diffuser.  
- Subgoal 4: Experience the benefits of the diffused oils.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated by forward subgoaling and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Diffuse essential oils using a diffuser.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the diffuser correctly (Current).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils.  
  - Subgoal 3: Activate the diffuser.  
  - Subgoal 4: Experience the benefits of the diffused oils.  
**Current Goal**: Position the diffuser correctly.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the diffuser correctly. This will be achieved by selecting a stable, safe location for the diffuser, ensuring it is near a power source and in a well-ventilated area suitable for oil diffusion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a flat, stable surface in a room with good air circulation, such as a living room table or bedroom nightstand. Ensure the diffuser is placed away from edges to prevent tipping and near an electrical outlet for easy access to power. Verify that the location allows the mist to disperse effectively without obstruction.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the diffuser correctly. Validate that the chosen location meets the requirements for stability, proximity to a power source, and effective mist dispersion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the diffuser is on a flat, stable surface and not at risk of falling. Confirm that it is within reach of a power outlet and that the surrounding area is free of obstructions that could block the mist. Ensure the location is safe from water-sensitive items, as the diffuser will release moisture. If any issues are found, reposition the diffuser to meet these criteria.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Diffuse essential oils using a diffuser.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the diffuser correctly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Activate the diffuser.  
  - Subgoal 4: Experience the benefits of the diffused oils.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils. This will be achieved by filling the diffuser’s reservoir with the appropriate amount of water and adding a few drops of essential oils as per the diffuser’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the diffuser’s reservoir. Fill it with clean, room-temperature water up to the fill line indicated in the diffuser’s manual (typically 100-200 ml, depending on the model). Add 3-5 drops of essential oils (e.g., lavender or eucalyptus) to the water, ensuring not to exceed the recommended amount to avoid overpowering the scent or damaging the diffuser. Close the reservoir securely.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils. Validate that the reservoir is filled correctly with the appropriate amount of water and oils, and that it is properly sealed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the water level is at the fill line and not overfilled, as excess water can cause malfunction. Verify that the correct number of essential oil drops (3-5) has been added to avoid overwhelming the room or clogging the diffuser. Ensure the reservoir is securely closed to prevent leaks. If any issues are detected, adjust the water level or oil quantity and reseal the reservoir.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Diffuse essential oils using a diffuser.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the diffuser correctly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the diffuser with water and essential oils (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Activate the diffuser (Current).  
  - Subgoal 4: Experience the benefits of the diffused oils.  
**Current Goal**: Activate the diffuser.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to activate the diffuser. This will be achieved by connecting the diffuser to a power source and pressing the power button to start the diffusion process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Plug the diffuser’s power cord into a nearby electrical outlet. Press the power button or switch on the diffuser to start it. If the diffuser has settings (e.g., mist intensity or timer), select the desired options as per the manual (e.g., continuous mist or 1-hour timer). Ensure the diffuser begins releasing mist, indicating it is operational.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to activate the diffuser. Validate that the diffuser is powered on, functioning correctly, and releasing mist as expected.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the diffuser is plugged in and the power light is on. Check that mist is being released from the diffuser and that the scent of the essential oils is detectable in the room. If the diffuser is not working, verify the power connection, ensure the reservoir is not empty, and check for any error indicators in the manual. Make necessary adjustments to ensure proper operation.  
[/IMP]
