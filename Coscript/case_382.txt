### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Gather necessary financial paperwork to calculate income and debt.  
- **How to Achieve**: Collect documents such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, and records of monthly debt payments (e.g., credit card bills, student loans, mortgage payments) to ensure accurate data for DTI calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, compile the following documents:  
- **Income Documentation**: Recent pay stubs (last 2–3 months), tax returns (last 2 years), and any additional income sources (e.g., freelance work, rental income).  
- **Debt Documentation**: Statements for all debts, including mortgage, auto loans, student loans, credit card balances, and other recurring payments.  
- **Verification**: Ensure all documents are up-to-date and accurate to avoid errors in the DTI calculation.  
This step ensures all necessary data is available for calculating the DTI ratio in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the subgoals to ensure they are precise and account for potential gaps. Adjust Subgoal 2 to clarify its role in the process.  

**Adjusted Subgoals**:  
1. Gather necessary financial paperwork to calculate income and debt (unchanged).  
2. **Determine affordable loan payment based on income and expenses** (adjusted from "Assess affordability" to be more specific to loan qualification).  
3. Calculate the DTI ratio using collected financial data (unchanged).  
4. Identify the maximum DTI ratio allowed by bank regulations (unchanged).  
5. Compare the calculated DTI ratio with bank regulations to determine loan qualification (unchanged).  
6. Explore interest rates to ensure optimal loan terms (if qualified) (unchanged).  

This adjustment makes Subgoal 2 more actionable by focusing on calculating an affordable loan payment, which supports the overall goal of loan qualification.

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action**: Track Goals  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoals and highlight the current goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Determine if you qualify for a loan under bank regulations by calculating the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Gather necessary financial paperwork to calculate income and debt (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine affordable loan payment based on income and expenses.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the DTI ratio using collected financial data.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Identify the maximum DTI ratio allowed by bank regulations.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Compare the calculated DTI ratio with bank regulations to determine loan qualification.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Explore interest rates to ensure optimal loan terms (if qualified).  

**Current Goal**: Determine affordable loan payment based on income and expenses (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine affordable loan payment based on income and expenses.  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze income and expenses from collected paperwork to estimate a monthly loan payment that fits within financial constraints, considering existing debt obligations and living expenses.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the gathered financial documents:  
- **Calculate Total Monthly Income**: Sum all income sources (e.g., salary, freelance income) from pay stubs and tax returns. For example, assume a monthly income of $5,000.  
- **Calculate Total Monthly Expenses**: Include living expenses (e.g., rent, utilities, groceries) and existing debt payments (e.g., $1,000 for mortgage, $300 for car loan, $200 for credit cards), totaling $2,500.  
- **Determine Disposable Income**: Subtract expenses from income ($5,000 - $2,500 = $2,500).  
- **Estimate Affordable Loan Payment**: Allocate a portion of disposable income (e.g., 20–30%) for a potential loan payment, ensuring it aligns with bank expectations. For example, 25% of $2,500 = $625/month as an affordable loan payment.  
This step establishes a realistic loan payment amount to guide the DTI calculation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the DTI ratio using collected financial data.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the formula DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments / Total Monthly Income) × 100, applying data from previous steps to compute the ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the financial data:  
- **Total Monthly Debt Payments**: From Step 3, assume debts are $1,000 (mortgage) + $300 (car loan) + $200 (credit cards) = $1,500.  
- **Total Monthly Income**: From Step 6, assume $5,000.  
- **DTI Calculation**: DTI = ($1,500 / $5,000) × 100 = 30%.  
The calculated DTI ratio is 30%, which will be compared to bank regulations in the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information about bank regulations for the maximum DTI ratio to determine loan qualification, focusing on typical standards for loan approval.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action**: Recall Info  
Summarize information related to the current goal of identifying the maximum DTI ratio allowed by bank regulations.  

- From general knowledge, most banks require a DTI ratio of 43% or lower for conventional loans, though some may allow up to 50% for specific loan types (e.g., FHA loans).  
- No specific bank regulations were provided in the script, so the standard threshold of 43% is assumed as a common benchmark for loan qualification.  

This information will guide the comparison in the next step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compare the calculated DTI ratio with bank regulations to determine loan qualification.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compare the DTI ratio (30%) from Step 7 with the standard bank regulation threshold (43%) from Step 8 to determine if the individual qualifies for a loan.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Calculated DTI**: 30% (from Step 7).  
- **Bank Regulation Threshold**: 43% (from Step 8).  
- **Comparison**: Since 30% is below 43%, the individual qualifies for a loan under typical bank regulations.  
This step confirms loan eligibility based on the DTI ratio.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the DTI calculation and loan qualification conclusion.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recheck the input data (income and debt) and calculations to ensure accuracy, and confirm the bank regulation threshold aligns with standard practices.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Recheck Data**: Verify income ($5,000) and debt payments ($1,500) from Steps 3 and 6. Recalculate DTI: ($1,500 / $5,000) × 100 = 30%.  
- **Confirm Threshold**: The 43% DTI threshold is consistent with standard bank regulations for conventional loans.  
- **Validation Result**: The DTI calculation is accurate, and the conclusion that the individual qualifies for a loan (30% < 43%) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Explore interest rates to ensure optimal loan terms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Research current market interest rates for loans and compare offers from multiple lenders to identify the best terms, considering the confirmed loan qualification.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Research Interest Rates**: Based on general knowledge, current mortgage rates (as of May 2025) typically range from 6% to 7% for 30-year fixed loans, depending on credit score and market conditions.  
- **Action**: Contact multiple lenders (e.g., banks, credit unions) to obtain quotes, focusing on rates for individuals with a DTI of 30% and a strong credit profile.  
- **Outcome**: Select the lender offering the lowest rate (e.g., 6.2%) that aligns with the affordable loan payment ($625/month from Step 6) to finalize the loan application.  
This step completes the planning case by ensuring the best loan terms are secured.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
