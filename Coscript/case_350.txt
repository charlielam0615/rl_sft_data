The script specifies disabling the following Bluetooth features for the selected device:  
- Media audio  
- Phone Calls  
- Contact sharing  
- Internet connection sharing  
- Notification access  
- Tasker  
This information, from step 5 of the script, serves as a pointer to the features that must be toggled off in the next implementation step.
