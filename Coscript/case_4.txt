### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To achieve the goal of swimming underwater without goggles and feeling comfortable, break down the task into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Acclimate to water rushing over the face to build comfort.  
2. Experiment with breathing techniques to maintain ease underwater.  
3. Test different strokes and speeds to find comfortable movements.  
4. Monitor comfort levels and exit the pool if discomfort arises.  

These subgoals align with the script and prioritize the constraint of feeling comfortable.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus and provide context for future steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal**: Swim underwater without goggles and feel comfortable.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Experiment with breathing techniques.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Test different strokes and speeds.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Monitor comfort and exit if uncomfortable.  

**Current Goal**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face (Subgoal 1).  
This provides a clear structure for the planning process, ensuring alignment with the script and the comfort constraint.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face.  
**How to Achieve**: Practice submerging the face in shallow water to get accustomed to the sensation of water flow, focusing on staying relaxed to ensure comfort.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Begin in a shallow pool where you can stand comfortably. Slowly lower your face into the water for a few seconds at a time, keeping your eyes closed to avoid irritation. Focus on breathing calmly through your nose or mouth before submerging. Repeat this 5-10 times, gradually increasing the duration of submersion as you feel more at ease with the water rushing over your face. Take breaks if any discomfort arises to maintain the comfort constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face.  
**How to Achieve**: Assess whether the practice of submerging the face has increased comfort with water flow, ensuring the approach aligns with the goal of feeling comfortable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Evaluate your comfort level after several submersion attempts. Check if you can submerge your face for 5-10 seconds without feeling anxious or irritated. If discomfort persists (e.g., stinging eyes or panic), reduce submersion time or take longer breaks. If you feel relaxed and accustomed to the sensation, the path is valid, and you can proceed to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the validation, refine the subgoals to ensure progress. If acclimation to water is achieved, proceed to the next subgoal. If not, adjust the approach to enhance comfort.  
Assume partial success: comfort is improving but not fully achieved. Adjust Subgoal 1 to include additional relaxation techniques.  
- **Adjusted Subgoal 1**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face using relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing before submersion).  
- Subgoals 2-4 remain unchanged.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face using relaxation techniques.  
**How to Achieve**: Incorporate deep breathing exercises before submerging to enhance relaxation and comfort during face submersion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Stand in shallow water. Practice deep breathing for 30 seconds (inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds) to relax your body. Then, gently submerge your face for 5-10 seconds, keeping your eyes closed. Focus on maintaining a calm state. Repeat 8-10 times, increasing submersion time slightly if comfortable. Pause and reassess if you feel any discomfort, ensuring the comfort constraint is met.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Update and review the goal hierarchy to reflect the adjusted subgoal and ensure focus on the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal**: Swim underwater without goggles and feel comfortable.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face using relaxation techniques (current, adjusted).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Experiment with breathing techniques.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Test different strokes and speeds.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Monitor comfort and exit if uncomfortable.  

**Current Goal**: Experiment with breathing techniques (Subgoal 2).  
The adjusted Subgoal 1 reflects the incorporation of relaxation techniques, and the focus now shifts to Subgoal 2 as acclimation is assumed complete.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Experiment with breathing techniques.  
**How to Achieve**: Practice controlled exhalation underwater to maintain comfort and avoid water inhalation, aligning with the script’s second step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In shallow water, submerge your face and practice exhaling slowly through your nose or mouth, creating a steady stream of bubbles. Start with 5-second exhalations, ensuring you remain relaxed. Try different exhalation speeds (slow vs. slightly faster) to find what feels most comfortable. Complete 5-8 repetitions, stopping if you feel any discomfort to adhere to the constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Experiment with breathing techniques.  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information from previous steps related to maintaining comfort during underwater activities to support effective breathing experimentation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 3 and 6 ([IMP] blocks): Practicing submersion with deep breathing and relaxation techniques helped build comfort with water on the face. Keeping eyes closed and taking breaks prevented discomfort.  
- From Step 4 ([IMP] block): Validation involved checking for anxiety or irritation during submersion, emphasizing short durations and breaks to maintain comfort.  

This information suggests that breathing techniques should incorporate relaxation (e.g., deep breathing before submerging) and short practice durations to ensure comfort while experimenting.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Test different strokes and speeds.  
**How to Achieve**: Swim short distances underwater using various strokes and speeds to identify the most comfortable combination, per the script’s third step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a pool, submerge and swim 5-10 meters underwater using a basic breaststroke, keeping movements slow and controlled. Then, try a gentle freestyle stroke at a similar distance. Maintain steady exhalation (from Step 8) and keep eyes closed to avoid irritation. Compare comfort levels between strokes and speeds, pausing after each attempt to assess. Stop if discomfort arises, per the script’s fourth step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Test different strokes and speeds.  
**How to Achieve**: Evaluate which stroke and speed combination feels most comfortable and allows sustained underwater swimming without goggles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After trying breaststroke and freestyle, assess comfort based on ease of movement, breathing control, and lack of eye irritation or anxiety. If breaststroke at a slow speed feels more comfortable, prioritize it for further practice. If discomfort is noted (e.g., difficulty exhaling or water entering the nose), reduce distance or revert to practicing exhalation (Subgoal 2). Confirm the approach aligns with feeling comfortable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Update the goal hierarchy to confirm progress and focus on the final subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- **Main Goal**: Swim underwater without goggles and feel comfortable.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Acclimate to water rushing over the face using relaxation techniques (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Experiment with breathing techniques (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Test different strokes and speeds (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Monitor comfort and exit if uncomfortable (current).  

**Current Goal**: Monitor comfort and exit if uncomfortable (Subgoal 4).  
All prior subgoals are completed, and the focus is now on ensuring ongoing comfort during underwater swimming.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Monitor comfort and exit if uncomfortable.  
**How to Achieve**: Continuously assess comfort during underwater swimming and exit the pool if discomfort is detected, as per the script’s fourth step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
While swimming underwater using the preferred stroke and speed (e.g., slow breaststroke from Step 10), monitor for signs of discomfort such as eye irritation, difficulty breathing, or anxiety. Swim for 10-15 seconds at a time, resurfacing to evaluate comfort. If discomfort occurs, exit the pool immediately to rest and reassess. Repeat short swims, ensuring comfort is maintained throughout.  
[/IMP]
