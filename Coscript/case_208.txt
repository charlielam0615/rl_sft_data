### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the scratch by scoring the wood surface.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a sharp knife to carefully score the wood around the scratch, creating a clean boundary to facilitate further repair steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select a sharp, precision knife suitable for woodworking. Hold the knife at a slight angle and gently score the wood surface around the scratch, making shallow cuts to outline the damaged area. Ensure the cuts are controlled to avoid deepening the scratch or damaging surrounding wood. This prepares the area for creating a trough in the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the scoring of the wood surface is valid and effective.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the scored area to confirm it is clean, precise, and suitable for the next step of creating a trough.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the scored area around the scratch. Verify that the cuts are shallow, even, and form a clear boundary around the scratch without additional damage to the wood. If the scoring is uneven or insufficient, re-score lightly with the knife to achieve a clean outline. The area should be ready for prying up wood fibers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Create a trough by prying up wood fibers.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the knife to gently lift and pry up wood fibers within the scored area to form a trough for the epoxy filler.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the same sharp knife, carefully insert the blade tip into the scored area and lift small sections of wood fibers. Work slowly to create a shallow trough along the scratch, ensuring the trough is deep enough to hold epoxy but does not weaken the surrounding wood structure. Remove any loose debris from the trough.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare epoxy filler.  
**How to Achieve**: Mix the epoxy according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure it is ready for application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Obtain a two-part epoxy suitable for wood repair. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, typically mixing equal parts of resin and hardener in a small container. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is uniform, ensuring no streaks remain. Prepare only the amount needed to fill the scratch to avoid waste.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply epoxy to the scratch.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour the mixed epoxy into the prepared trough in the scratch to fill the damaged area.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using a small tool like a toothpick or the edge of the knife, carefully pour or scoop the mixed epoxy into the trough created in the scratch. Ensure the epoxy fills the entire trough, slightly overfilling to account for settling. Avoid air bubbles by applying the epoxy slowly and steadily.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to the current goal of leveling the epoxy and subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to level the epoxy (Subgoal 5). Previous relevant information includes:  
- Step 5 created a trough for the epoxy (Subgoal 2).  
- Step 7 prepared the epoxy (Subgoal 3).  
- Step 8 applied the epoxy to the trough (Subgoal 4).  
The script specifies using the knife to level the epoxy, followed by curing, sanding, and finishing. The knife used for scoring and prying (Steps 3 and 5) should be suitable for leveling. Ensure the epoxy is still workable (not cured) before leveling.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Level the epoxy.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the knife to smooth and level the epoxy flush with the surrounding wood surface.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Before the epoxy begins to cure, use the flat edge of the knife to gently scrape and smooth the epoxy surface. Remove excess epoxy to make it level with the surrounding wood. Work carefully to avoid gouging the epoxy or scratching the wood. Clean the knife immediately after to prevent epoxy buildup.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Cure the epoxy.  
**How to Achieve**: Allow the epoxy to cure for the time specified by the manufacturer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the wood in a stable, dust-free environment. Follow the epoxy manufacturer’s instructions for curing time, typically 24–48 hours, depending on the product. Avoid touching or disturbing the epoxy during this period to ensure a strong bond.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the remaining subgoals to ensure they are clear and achievable. The remaining subgoals (7: Sand the epoxy flush, 8: Finish with staining and sealing) are straightforward but can be refined for clarity:  
- Subgoal 7: Sand the cured epoxy until it is flush with the surrounding wood surface.  
- Subgoal 8: Apply stain to match the wood’s color and seal the repair for protection.  
These adjusted descriptions ensure precision in the final steps.  
[/PLANNING]
