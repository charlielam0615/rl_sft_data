### Problem Restatement
The task is to simulate a "Remember to Do" planning case, creating a plan to ensure a task is remembered and completed, following the provided script: ['1. Make a list.', '2. Put it in a visible place.', '3. Write it down.', '4. Set a reminder.', '5. Do it.'] The plan must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the specified format, with each step selecting one action from the meta-cognitive action list. The constraint is to focus on actions that ensure the task is remembered and completed, categorized under Education and Communications.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of remembering and completing a task into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Create a task list to organize the task.  
2. Place the list in a visible location to ensure awareness.  
3. Write down the task details to clarify the action.  
4. Set a reminder to prompt action at the right time.  
5. Execute the task as planned.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to create a task list to organize the task. This will be achieved by writing a clear and concise list of tasks to be remembered.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal, I will create a task list that includes the specific task to be remembered. For example, if the task is "Submit a report," the list will clearly state: "1. Submit report by due date." The list will be written on a notepad or a digital app like a to-do list manager to ensure clarity and accessibility.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remember and complete a task.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a task list to organize the task (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Place the list in a visible location (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Write down the task details (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Set a reminder (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Execute the task (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Place the list in a visible location to ensure awareness.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to place the task list in a visible location to ensure awareness. This will be achieved by selecting a prominent physical or digital location where the list can be frequently seen.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The task list will be placed in a highly visible location. For a physical list, this could be on a bulletin board, refrigerator door, or desk. For a digital list, it could be set as a pinned note on a phone’s home screen or a desktop widget. For example, if using a notepad, I will pin the list to a corkboard in my workspace. If digital, I will pin the task in a to-do app like Todoist to appear on my phone’s main screen.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve past information related to the current goal of writing down the task details to ensure clarity and specificity.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Current Goal**: Write down the task details.  
**Recalled Information**: The task list was created in Step 2 (e.g., "Submit report by due date") and placed in a visible location in Step 4 (e.g., pinned to a corkboard or a phone’s home screen). The task details should include specifics like the task’s due date, priority, and any relevant notes to ensure it is actionable and clear.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to write down the task details to clarify the action. This will be achieved by adding specific details to the task list, such as deadlines and requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the example task "Submit report by due date," I will write down detailed information: "Submit quarterly report to supervisor by email by 5 PM, May 30, 2025. Include sales data and analysis." This will be added to the existing task list, either by updating the notepad or editing the digital to-do list entry to include these specifics.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remember and complete a task.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a task list to organize the task (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Place the list in a visible location (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Write down the task details (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Set a reminder (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Execute the task (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Set a reminder to prompt action at the right time.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to set a reminder to prompt action at the right time. This will be achieved by scheduling a notification or alarm for the task’s due date.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the task "Submit quarterly report by 5 PM, May 30, 2025," I will set a reminder using a digital tool like a calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar) or a to-do app with notification features. The reminder will be set for May 30, 2025, at 3 PM to allow time to prepare and submit the report. Additionally, a secondary reminder may be set for May 29, 2025, to ensure preparation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the current path to ensure all steps are correctly set up for task completion. This will be achieved by checking the task list, its visibility, details, and reminder settings.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the plan:  
1. Confirm the task list exists and includes "Submit quarterly report to supervisor by email by 5 PM, May 30, 2025. Include sales data and analysis."  
2. Verify the list is in a visible location (e.g., pinned on corkboard or phone home screen).  
3. Check that the task details are clear and specific.  
4. Ensure the reminder is set for May 30, 2025, at 3 PM, with an optional secondary reminder on May 29, 2025.  
All steps are confirmed to be correctly implemented, ensuring the task is well-prepared for completion.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to execute the task as planned. This will be achieved by following the task details and submitting the report by the due date.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
On or before May 30, 2025, at 5 PM, I will compile the quarterly report, including sales data and analysis, and submit it via email to the supervisor as specified in the task details. The reminder set for 3 PM will prompt me to finalize and send the report.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remember and complete a task.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a task list to organize the task (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Place the list in a visible location (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Write down the task details (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Set a reminder (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Execute the task (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The plan to remember and complete the task has been fully executed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The "Remember to Do" plan has been successfully created and completed by following the provided script and meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals—creating a task list, placing it in a visible location, writing down details, setting a reminder, and executing the task—have been achieved, ensuring the task (e.g., submitting a quarterly report) is remembered and completed by May 30, 2025.
