### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for taking a video off YouTube by asking the user who uploaded it to delete it. The process must adhere to the provided script and the constraint of asking the user directly. The solution will use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a plan, ensuring each step selects one action from the meta-cognitive action list and follows the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of taking a video off YouTube by asking the user into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Access the YouTube video in a web browser.  
- Subgoal 2: Locate and select the specific video to be deleted.  
- Subgoal 3: Access the sharing options for the video.  
- Subgoal 4: Copy the video link.  
- Subgoal 5: Create a message with the video link and a request to delete it.  
- Subgoal 6: Send the message to the user who uploaded the video.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step to provide context for future actions, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Take a video off YouTube by asking the user.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the YouTube video in a web browser.  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate and select the specific video to be deleted.  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the sharing options for the video.  
  - Subgoal 4: Copy the video link.  
  - Subgoal 5: Create a message with the video link and a request to delete it.  
  - Subgoal 6: Send the message to the user who uploaded the video.  

**Current Goal:** Access the YouTube video in a web browser.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Access the YouTube video in a web browser.  
- **How to Achieve:** Open a web browser and navigate to https://www.youtube.com to begin the process of locating the video.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and enter "https://www.youtube.com" in the address bar. Press Enter to load the YouTube homepage.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the YouTube homepage is accessed correctly.  
- **How to Achieve:** Verify that the browser has loaded the YouTube website by checking for the YouTube logo and search bar.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the browser displays the YouTube homepage, identifiable by the YouTube logo in the top-left corner and the search bar at the top of the page. If the page fails to load, check the internet connection or re-enter the URL.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Locate and select the specific video to be deleted.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the YouTube search bar or navigate through the user’s channel to find and click on the target video.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
On the YouTube homepage, use the search bar to enter keywords related to the video’s title or description, or navigate to the uploader’s channel via the sidebar or subscriptions. Click on the video thumbnail to open it.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Access the sharing options for the video.  
- **How to Achieve:** Locate and click the “Share” button below the video player, which may involve interacting with the “Add to” button as a precursor in some interfaces.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Below the video player, locate the “Add to” button (typically represented by a plus icon or similar). Click it to reveal additional options, then find and click the “Share” button to access sharing options.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm that the sharing options are accessible.  
- **How to Achieve:** Verify that clicking the “Share” button opens a menu with options like “Copy link.”  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that a share menu appears with options such as “Copy link,” “Share via email,” or social media icons. If the menu does not appear, ensure the correct button was clicked or refresh the page and try again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Copy the video link.  
- **How to Achieve:** Click the “Copy link” option in the share menu to copy the video’s URL to the clipboard.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the share menu, click the “Copy link” button. Confirm the link is copied by pasting it into a text editor or checking for a “Link copied” notification.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create a message with the video link and a request to delete it.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information about the video link and the need to request deletion from the user.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- The video link has been copied to the clipboard (from Step 8).  
- The constraint specifies that the video must be taken down by asking the user directly (from problem statement).  
- The script indicates the message should include the text “Please delete this video” (from script step 7).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create a message with the video link and a request to delete it.  
- **How to Achieve:** Open a messaging platform or post interface, paste the copied video link, and type the request “Please delete this video.”  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open a messaging platform (e.g., email, YouTube’s messaging feature, or a social media platform where the user can be contacted). Paste the video link from the clipboard into the message body. Type “Please delete this video” in the message.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Send the message to the user who uploaded the video.  
- **How to Achieve:** Identify the user’s contact information or messaging channel and send the prepared message.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Identify the uploader’s contact information, such as their YouTube channel’s messaging feature or a linked social media account. Click the “Send” or “Post” button to deliver the message containing the video link and the deletion request.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been addressed and highlight the completion of the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Take a video off YouTube by asking the user.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the YouTube video in a web browser (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate and select the specific video to be deleted (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the sharing options for the video (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Copy the video link (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Create a message with the video link and a request to delete it (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Send the message to the user who uploaded the video (Completed).  

**Current Goal:** None (all subgoals completed).  
The main goal of taking the video off YouTube by asking the user has been addressed by completing all subgoals in the script.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to take a video off YouTube by asking the user has been fully executed by following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed through a combination of planning, implementation, and review actions, ensuring a structured and validated approach.
