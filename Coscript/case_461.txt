**Current Goal**: Understand the nature of a 180-degree rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand the nature of a 180-degree rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).  
**How to Achieve**: Research and explain whether a 180-degree rotation is equivalent in both directions, using geometric principles to clarify the effect on a shape.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
A 180-degree rotation of a shape around a point (typically the origin) results in the same position whether performed clockwise or counterclockwise. This is because rotating a point (x, y) by 180 degrees in either direction around the origin maps it to (-x, -y). For example, a point at (1, 1) rotates to (-1, -1) regardless of direction, as the angle of 180 degrees is symmetric. Thus, for a 180-degree rotation, the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise is unnecessary, as the outcome is identical.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the understanding of a 180-degree rotation.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the conclusion about clockwise and counterclockwise rotations being equivalent for 180 degrees is correct by referencing geometric principles or testing with a sample point.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, consider a point (2, 3) rotated 180 degrees around the origin. The formula for a 180-degree rotation is (x, y) → (-x, -y). Applying this: (2, 3) → (-2, -3). Testing both directions: a 180-degree clockwise rotation and a 180-degree counterclockwise rotation both yield (-2, -3), confirming that the direction does not affect the result for a 180-degree rotation. This aligns with geometric principles, as a 180-degree rotation is a half-turn, symmetric about the origin.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For demonstration, assume the shape is a triangle with vertices at A(1, 1), B(3, 1), and C(2, 3). These coordinates represent the original positions of the triangle’s vertices in the 2D Cartesian plane, suitable for applying a 180-degree rotation.

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Establish the mathematical formula for a 180-degree rotation.  
**How to Achieve**: Derive or state the formula for rotating a point 180 degrees around the origin using geometric transformation principles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The formula for rotating a point (x, y) by 180 degrees around the origin is (x, y) → (-x, -y). This can be derived from the rotation matrix for an angle θ:  
\[ R = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{bmatrix} \]  
For θ = 180°, cos(180°) = -1 and sin(180°) = 0, so the matrix becomes:  
\[ R = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \]  
Applying this to a point (x, y):  
\[ \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -x \\ -y \end{bmatrix} \]  
Thus, the formula is (x, y) → (-x, -y).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the 180-degree rotation formula.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the formula with a sample point and verify the result aligns with expected geometric behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the point (2, 3) from earlier, apply the formula (x, y) → (-x, -y):  
(2, 3) → (-2, -3).  
To verify, consider the geometric effect: a 180-degree rotation moves a point to the opposite quadrant, symmetric about the origin. The point (2, 3) in the first quadrant should move to the third quadrant, which (-2, -3) does. This confirms the formula’s correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the formula to transform the coordinates.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula (x, y) → (-x, -y) to compute the new coordinates of the triangle’s vertices A(1, 1), B(3, 1), and C(2, 3).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply the 180-degree rotation formula (x, y) → (-x, -y) to each vertex:  
- Vertex A(1, 1): (1, 1) → (-1, -1)  
- Vertex B(3, 1): (3, 1) → (-3, -1)  
- Vertex C(2, 3): (2, 3) → (-2, -3)  
The transformed coordinates are A’(-1, -1), B’(-3, -1), and C’(-2, -3).  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the transformed coordinates.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the transformed coordinates maintain the shape’s structure (e.g., distances between points) and reflect a 180-degree rotation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, calculate the distance between points A and B, and A’ and B’, to ensure the shape’s structure is preserved.  
- Original distance AB:  
  \[ \sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (1-1)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]  
- Transformed distance A’B’:  
  \[ \sqrt{((-3)-(-1))^2 + ((-1)-(-1))^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2} = 2 \]  
The distances match, indicating the shape’s structure is preserved. Geometrically, the points A’(-1, -1), B’(-3, -1), and C’(-2, -3) are in the third quadrant, opposite the original first-quadrant positions, consistent with a 180-degree rotation.

### Step 14: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use the transformed coordinates to form the rotated shape.  
**How to Achieve**: Connect the transformed vertices A’(-1, -1), B’(-3, -1), and C’(-2, -3) to describe the rotated triangle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The rotated triangle is formed by connecting the points A’(-1, -1), B’(-3, -1), and C’(-2, -3) in the same order as the original triangle (A to B to C to A). This creates a triangle in the third quadrant, with edges:  
- A’ to B’: Horizontal edge from (-1, -1) to (-3, -1).  
- B’ to C’: Edge from (-3, -1) to (-2, -3).  
- C’ to A’: Edge from (-2, -3) to (-1, -1).  
The rotated shape is a triangle congruent to the original, oriented 180 degrees from its initial position.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the formation of the rotated shape.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the rotated triangle maintains the same geometric properties (e.g., angles, side lengths) as the original and is correctly positioned after a 180-degree rotation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate all side lengths of the original and rotated triangles:  
- Original triangle:  
  - AB = 2 (calculated earlier).  
  - BC: \[ \sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (1-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]  
  - CA: \[ \sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (3-1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]  
- Rotated triangle:  
  - A’B’ = 2 (calculated earlier).  
  - B’C’: \[ \sqrt{((-2)-(-3))^2 + ((-3)-(-1))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]  
  - C’A’: \[ \sqrt{((-1)-(-2))^2 + ((-1)-(-3))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]  
All side lengths match, confirming the rotated triangle is congruent to the original. The vertices’ positions in the third quadrant align with a 180-degree rotation from the first quadrant, validating the shape’s formation.
