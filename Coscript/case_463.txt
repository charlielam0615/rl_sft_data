**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for cleaning microscope lenses using lens paper, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format. The task involves following the script: (1) Place a piece of lens paper over the lens, (2) Apply gentle pressure to the lens paper and move it in a circular motion, (3) Remove the lens paper and inspect the lens for any remaining debris, (4) Repeat steps 1-3 until the lens is clean, with the constraint of using lens paper.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of cleaning microscope lenses into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Position lens paper correctly on the lens.  
- Subgoal 2: Clean the lens by applying gentle pressure and circular motion.  
- Subgoal 3: Inspect the lens for cleanliness.  
- Subgoal 4: Repeat the process if the lens is not clean.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals and highlight the current one.  
- **Goal Hierarchy**:  
  - Main Goal: Clean microscope lenses using lens paper.  
    - Subgoal 1: Position lens paper correctly on the lens.  
    - Subgoal 2: Clean the lens by applying gentle pressure and circular motion.  
    - Subgoal 3: Inspect the lens for cleanliness.  
    - Subgoal 4: Repeat the process if the lens is not clean.  
- **Current Goal**: Position lens paper correctly on the lens (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position lens paper correctly on the lens. This will be achieved by carefully placing a piece of lens paper over the microscope lens to ensure full coverage without damaging the lens.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Execute the first step of the script: Place a piece of lens paper over the lens. Ensure the paper is clean and free of contaminants, and position it to cover the entire lens surface gently.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the lens paper is correctly positioned on the lens. This will be achieved by checking that the paper fully covers the lens surface without wrinkles or misalignment.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the lens paper placement to confirm it covers the entire lens evenly. If the paper is misaligned or wrinkled, adjust or replace it to ensure proper coverage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clean the lens by applying gentle pressure and circular motion. This will be achieved by pressing lightly on the lens paper and moving it in a circular pattern to remove dust and smudges.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Execute the second step of the script: Apply gentle pressure to the lens paper and move it in a circular motion. Use minimal force to avoid scratching the lens, ensuring the motion is smooth and consistent.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the circular motion cleaning was effective. This will be achieved by checking if the lens paper has picked up debris and if the lens surface appears cleaner.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the lens paper for visible dust or smudges it has collected. Observe the lens surface to ensure no obvious debris remains after the circular motion cleaning.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to inspect the lens for cleanliness. This will be achieved by removing the lens paper and visually checking the lens for any remaining debris under appropriate lighting.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Execute the third step of the script: Remove the lens paper and inspect the lens for any remaining debris. Use a light source to illuminate the lens and check for smudges, dust, or streaks.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress and highlight the current goal.  
- **Goal Hierarchy**:  
  - Main Goal: Clean microscope lenses using lens paper.  
    - Subgoal 1: Position lens paper correctly on the lens (Completed).  
    - Subgoal 2: Clean the lens by applying gentle pressure and circular motion (Completed).  
    - Subgoal 3: Inspect the lens for cleanliness (In Progress).  
    - Subgoal 4: Repeat the process if the lens is not clean.  
- **Current Goal**: Inspect the lens for cleanliness (Subgoal 3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Evaluate the inspection results to determine if the lens is clean. If debris remains, adjust the plan to repeat subgoals 1–3. If clean, mark the task as complete.  
- Adjusted Plan:  
  - If lens is not clean: Repeat Subgoals 1–3.  
  - If lens is clean: Conclude the cleaning process.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm whether the lens is clean or requires further cleaning. This will be achieved by assessing the lens inspection results to decide if repeating the process is necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Based on the inspection, determine if the lens is free of debris, smudges, or streaks. If clean, no further action is needed. If debris remains, prepare to repeat the cleaning steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decide whether to repeat the cleaning process. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the cleaning and inspection process to inform the decision.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Summarize relevant information:  
- Step 3: Lens paper was placed over the lens to cover it fully.  
- Step 5: Gentle pressure and circular motion were applied to clean the lens.  
- Step 7: Lens was inspected for debris after removing the lens paper.  
- Step 9: Plan adjusted to repeat steps 1–3 if the lens is not clean.  
This information indicates the process to follow if the lens is not clean: repeat placing the paper, cleaning, and inspecting.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat the cleaning process if the lens is not clean. This will be achieved by restarting the cycle of placing lens paper, cleaning, and inspecting until the lens is clean.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Execute the fourth step of the script: Repeat steps 1–3 (place lens paper, apply gentle pressure in circular motion, remove paper and inspect) until the lens is clean. Perform each step carefully, checking after each cycle if the lens is free of debris.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the current state.

    - Subgoal 1: Position lens paper correctly on the lens (Completed, may repeat).  
    - Subgoal 2: Clean the lens by applying gentle pressure and circular motion (Completed, may repeat).  
    - Subgoal 3: Inspect the lens for cleanliness (Completed, may repeat).  
    - Subgoal 4: Repeat the process if the lens is not clean (In Progress).  
- **Current Goal**: Repeat the process until the lens is clean (Subgoal 4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the lens is clean after repeating the process. This will be achieved by performing a final inspection to ensure no debris remains.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After completing the repeated cleaning cycles, remove the lens paper and inspect the lens under proper lighting. Confirm the lens is free of smudges, dust, or streaks. If clean, the process is complete; otherwise, repeat the cycle again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]
