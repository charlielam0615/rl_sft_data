### Step 7: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of adding functional elements (door and windows), focusing on previous steps that define the structure’s dimensions and stability.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Current Goal**: Add a door and two windows (script step 4).
**Relevant Information**:
- The cardboard is 5x10 feet, folded into a 5x5-foot structure (Steps 3 and 5).
- The fold was reinforced with duct tape for stability (Step 6).
- The structure must maintain the 5x10-foot overall dimensions when unfolded, with the folded 5x5-foot piece forming the building’s base and walls.
This information ensures that cuts for the door and windows are made on the correct panels and do not compromise the structure.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: 
- **Current Goal**: Cut out a door and two windows.
- **How to Achieve**: Use a utility knife to cut precise openings on the folded cardboard structure, ensuring they are appropriately sized for a Littlest Pet Shop building.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
On one of the 5x5-foot panels (acting as a wall), mark a rectangular door (e.g., 2 feet high by 1 foot wide) near the bottom center. On the same or adjacent panels, mark two windows (e.g., 1 foot by 1 foot each) at a height suitable for the Littlest Pet Shop aesthetic. Use a utility knife to carefully cut along the marked lines, ensuring clean edges. Keep the door attached on one side to act as a hinge, if desired.
[/IMP]
