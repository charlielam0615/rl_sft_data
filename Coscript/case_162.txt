### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for applying a "Smokey Eyes like Jack Sparrow" makeup look, specifically tailored for individuals with hooded eyes. The plan must follow the provided script of steps and adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories. The constraint is that the makeup application must be suitable for hooded eyes, which typically have a fold of skin that covers part of the eyelid, requiring specific techniques to enhance visibility and achieve the desired dramatic, smokey effect inspired by Jack Sparrow's iconic look.

I will proceed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and ensuring the plan aligns with the provided script and the constraint for hooded eyes.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating a "Smokey Eyes like Jack Sparrow" look for hooded eyes into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Apply primer to prepare the eyelid.  
2. Apply dark eyeshadow to the crease to create depth.  
3. Apply lighter eyeshadow to the lid for contrast.  
4. Highlight the brow bone to lift the eye area.  
5. Create a winged eyeliner look to elongate the eyes.  
6. Apply mascara to enhance the lashes.  
Each subgoal will be addressed in sequence, tailored for hooded eyes to ensure the smokey effect is visible and dramatic.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the Forward Subgoaling step, and highlight the current goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Create a Smokey Eyes like Jack Sparrow look for hooded eyes  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply primer to prepare the eyelid  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply dark eyeshadow to the crease to create depth  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply lighter eyeshadow to the lid for contrast  
  - Subgoal 4: Highlight the brow bone to lift the eye area  
  - Subgoal 5: Create a winged eyeliner look to elongate the eyes  
  - Subgoal 6: Apply mascara to enhance the lashes  

**Current Goal:** Apply primer to prepare the eyelid.  
This step ensures the eyelid is prepped for long-lasting makeup, critical for hooded eyes to prevent creasing.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply primer to prepare the eyelid.  
- **How to Achieve:** Select a suitable eye primer and apply it evenly across the eyelid up to the brow bone, focusing on the hooded area to create a smooth base that enhances makeup longevity and prevents creasing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For hooded eyes, choose a long-wear, oil-free primer to prevent makeup from settling into the crease. Using a clean fingertip or a small brush, apply a thin layer of primer across the entire eyelid, extending slightly above the crease to account for the hooded fold. Blend gently to ensure even coverage. This step sets the foundation for the smokey eye look, ensuring the dramatic colors inspired by Jack Sparrow adhere well and remain vibrant.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the primer application is suitable for hooded eyes and aligns with the smokey eye goal.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check that the primer is evenly applied, non-sticky, and covers the hooded area without creasing, ensuring it supports the subsequent dark eyeshadow application.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the eyelid to confirm the primer is smoothly applied with no patches or excess product. For hooded eyes, ensure the primer extends slightly above the visible lid to cover the folded skin. Test by lightly touching the lid; it should feel tacky but not wet. If creasing is observed or the primer feels uneven, reapply a thin layer and blend thoroughly. This ensures the base is ready for the dark eyeshadow to create the dramatic, Jack Sparrow-inspired smokey effect.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply dark eyeshadow to the crease to create depth.  
- **How to Achieve:** Select a dark eyeshadow (e.g., charcoal or black for Jack Sparrow’s smokey look) and apply it to the crease area, blending upward and outward to enhance depth for hooded eyes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose a matte dark eyeshadow, such as charcoal or black, to mimic Jack Sparrow’s intense, smudged look. Using a tapered crease brush, apply the eyeshadow to the crease, starting at the outer corner and blending upward above the natural crease line to ensure visibility on hooded eyes. Use windshield-wiper motions to diffuse the color, creating a smoky gradient. Extend slightly toward the outer lid for drama, keeping the inner lid clear for the next step. This technique adds depth while accommodating the hooded eye shape.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply dark eyeshadow to the crease to create depth.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to the application of dark eyeshadow for hooded eyes and its role in achieving the Jack Sparrow smokey eye look.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Reviewing previous content, the dark eyeshadow application (Step 5) involves using a matte charcoal or black shade applied with a tapered brush to the crease, blended upward to ensure visibility on hooded eyes. This aligns with the script’s second step and the constraint for hooded eyes, emphasizing depth and drama for the Jack Sparrow look. The primer application (Step 3) supports this by providing a smooth base, preventing creasing in the hooded area. The goal is to create a smoky, intense effect, consistent with Jack Sparrow’s aesthetic.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply lighter eyeshadow to the lid for contrast.  
- **How to Achieve:** Select a lighter, shimmery eyeshadow (e.g., taupe or silver) and apply it to the visible lid area to create contrast with the dark crease, enhancing the smokey effect for hooded eyes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose a shimmery taupe or silver eyeshadow to add a subtle glow, reflecting Jack Sparrow’s weathered yet striking look. Using a flat shader brush, apply the lighter eyeshadow to the visible lid area below the crease, focusing on the center to create a focal point. For hooded eyes, keep the application below the crease line to avoid covering the dark eyeshadow. Blend lightly at the edges where the light and dark shades meet to maintain the smokey gradient. This contrast enhances the eye’s appearance despite the hooded fold.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the remaining subgoals to ensure they align with the Jack Sparrow smokey eye look for hooded eyes. The original subgoals (highlight brow bone, create winged eyeliner, apply mascara) remain relevant but need slight adjustments to emphasize techniques suitable for hooded eyes:  
- Highlight brow bone: Use a matte highlighter to lift the eye area, avoiding shimmer that might emphasize the hood.  
- Create winged eyeliner: Adjust the wing angle to elongate the eye, accounting for the hooded fold.  
- Apply mascara: Focus on volumizing mascara to open up the eyes.  
These adjusted subgoals ensure the dramatic, smudged aesthetic of Jack Sparrow while addressing the hooded eye constraint.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Highlight the brow bone to lift the eye area.  
- **How to Achieve:** Apply a matte highlighter shade to the brow bone to create a lifting effect, tailored for hooded eyes to enhance visibility of the smokey look.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select a matte highlighter in a soft ivory or beige shade to avoid drawing attention to the hooded fold. Using a small, fluffy brush, apply the highlighter directly under the eyebrow, focusing on the arch and extending slightly outward. Blend gently to create a subtle lift that complements the dark smokey eye. For hooded eyes, avoid shimmery highlighters, as they can accentuate the fold. This step enhances the eye’s openness, aligning with Jack Sparrow’s bold yet balanced look.
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create a winged eyeliner look to elongate the eyes.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a waterproof black eyeliner to draw a winged line, angling it upward to counteract the hooded eye’s downward appearance, achieving Jack Sparrow’s dramatic eye effect.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose a waterproof black gel or liquid eyeliner for precision and longevity. Start at the inner corner of the upper lash line, drawing a thin line that thickens slightly toward the outer corner. For hooded eyes, create a wing by extending the line upward and outward at a 45-degree angle from the outer corner, checking that the wing is visible when the eyes are open. Slightly smudge the line with a small brush to mimic Jack Sparrow’s rugged, smokey aesthetic. This elongates the eye, enhancing the dramatic effect.
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply mascara to enhance the lashes.  
- **How to Achieve:** Apply a volumizing mascara to the upper and lower lashes to open up the eyes, completing the Jack Sparrow smokey eye look for hooded eyes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select a volumizing, black mascara to maximize lash fullness. Apply two coats to the upper lashes, wiggling the wand at the root and pulling upward to lift and separate, countering the hooded eye’s tendency to appear closed. Apply a light coat to the lower lashes for balance, avoiding clumping to maintain the smudged, lived-in look of Jack Sparrow. For hooded eyes, curl the lashes first to enhance openness. This final step completes the dramatic, smokey eye effect.
[/IMP]
