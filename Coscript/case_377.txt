### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making a no-sew tutu using ribbon, following a provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and the response will use the required format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, ensuring all content aligns with the specified action category. The constraint is that the tutu must incorporate ribbon, and the provided script outlines the steps to achieve this.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making a no-sew tutu with ribbon into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon).  
2. Set up the ribbon base for the tutu.  
3. Attach tulle strips to the ribbon.  
4. Finalize the tutu by trimming and tying it.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system:  
- Main Goal: Make a no-sew tutu with ribbon.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the ribbon base for the tutu.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach tulle strips to the ribbon.  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize the tutu by trimming and tying it.  
**Current Goal**: Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon).  
**How to Achieve**: Cut tulle to twice the desired length and cut a ribbon strip long enough to fit around the waist with extra for tying a bow.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow the script steps:  
- Start with a spool of tulle and cut it into strips, each twice the desired tutu length (e.g., for a 15-inch tutu, cut 30-inch strips).  
- Cut a ribbon strip long enough to go around the waist and allow extra length to tie a bow (e.g., waist size plus 48 inches for bow tails).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure materials are prepared correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that tulle strips are cut to the correct length and the ribbon is long enough to fit around the waist with extra for tying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Verify tulle strips are twice the desired tutu length (e.g., 30 inches for a 15-inch tutu).  
- Confirm the ribbon length accommodates the waist measurement plus at least 48 inches for tying a bow.  
- Ensure enough tulle strips are cut to cover the ribbon between knots (to be set in the next step).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine subgoals to account for the next steps in the script:  
1. Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon) – Completed.  
2. Set up the ribbon base by knotting and placing it on a cylinder.  
3. Attach tulle strips to the ribbon by folding and looping.  
4. Finalize the tutu by trimming and tying.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Updated goal-management system:  
- Main Goal: Make a no-sew tutu with ribbon.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather and prepare materials (tulle and ribbon) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the ribbon base by knotting and placing it on a cylinder.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach tulle strips to the ribbon by folding and looping.  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize the tutu by trimming and tying.  
**Current Goal**: Set up the ribbon base by knotting and placing it on a cylinder.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up the ribbon base.  
**How to Achieve**: Make knots in the ribbon to mark the tutu’s width and place it around a cylinder base for stability while attaching tulle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Make a knot in the ribbon 24 inches from each end to define the tutu’s width.  
- Place the ribbon around a cylindrical object (e.g., a cardboard tube or chair back) to hold it steady for the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Core Content**: Information related to setting up the ribbon base and preparing for tulle attachment.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 3: Tulle strips were cut to twice the desired length, ready for folding and attachment.  
- From Step 4: Ribbon length was validated to ensure it fits the waist with extra for tying.  
- From Step 7: Ribbon has knots 24 inches from each end and is placed on a cylinder base, setting the stage for attaching tulle strips.  
**Current Goal**: Set up the ribbon base by knotting and placing it on a cylinder (achieved, ready to proceed to tulle attachment).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attach tulle strips to the ribbon.  
**How to Achieve**: Fold tulle strips in half, slip them behind the ribbon, and pull the ends through the loop to secure them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Take a tulle strip and fold it in half to form a loop at one end.  
- Slip the folded end behind the ribbon between the knots.  
- Pull the long ends of the tulle through the loop and tighten to secure.  
- Repeat, adding tulle strips side by side until the ribbon is covered between the knots.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure tulle strips are correctly attached.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that tulle strips are securely looped, evenly spaced, and cover the ribbon fully between the knots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Inspect each tulle strip to confirm it is folded, looped, and tightened properly around the ribbon.  
- Ensure strips are placed close together for a full, even appearance.  
- Verify the tulle covers the entire section between the two knots on the ribbon.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Backward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Work backward from the final goal (a completed no-sew tutu):  
- To wear the tutu, it must be trimmed to the desired length and tied around the waist.  
- To trim and tie, the tulle must be fully attached to the ribbon.  
- To attach tulle, the ribbon base must be set up with knots and a cylinder.  
- To set up the ribbon, materials (tulle and ribbon) must be prepared.  
This confirms the subgoals align with the script and prior steps.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the tutu by trimming and tying.  
**How to Achieve**: Remove the tutu from the cylinder, trim tulle to the desired length, and tie the ribbon around the waist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Remove the tutu from the cylinder base.  
- Trim the tulle strips to the desired length for an even appearance.  
- Wrap the ribbon around the waist and tie the ends into a bow to secure the tutu.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the tutu is complete and wearable.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the tulle is evenly trimmed, the ribbon ties securely, and the tutu fits comfortably.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Confirm all tulle strips are trimmed to the same length for a polished look.  
- Test the ribbon by tying it around the waist to ensure a secure and comfortable fit.  
- Inspect the tutu for any loose tulle strips or uneven sections and adjust as needed.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The plan for making a no-sew tutu with ribbon has been completed using the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed, validated, and tracked, resulting in a finished tutu that meets the constraint of incorporating ribbon, as outlined in the provided script.
