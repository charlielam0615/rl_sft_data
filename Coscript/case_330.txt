### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for harvesting corn to make tortillas, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The script outlines 11 steps: planting corn 60-80 days before harvest, waiting for tassels to turn brown, checking kernel color, peeling back husks to inspect kernels, harvesting corn, removing husks and silk, washing kernels, grinding into masa harina, mixing with water to form dough, rolling into flat discs, and cooking tortillas on a griddle. The constraint is that the corn must be suitable for making tortillas. The solution will use the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a complete plan, selecting one action per step and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of harvesting corn for tortillas into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to produce tortillas from harvested corn. Subgoals include:  
1. Plant corn at the right time.  
2. Monitor corn growth until tassels brown.  
3. Verify kernel readiness (color and fullness).  
4. Harvest corn properly.  
5. Process corn into masa harina.  
6. Prepare and cook tortilla dough.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and will guide subsequent actions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system based on the recent forward subgoaling. The hierarchy of goals is:  
- **Main Goal**: Harvest corn and produce tortillas.  
  - Subgoal 1: Plant corn at the right time.  
  - Subgoal 2: Monitor corn growth until tassels brown.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify kernel readiness (color and fullness).  
  - Subgoal 4: Harvest corn properly.  
  - Subgoal 5: Process corn into masa harina.  
  - Subgoal 6: Prepare and cook tortilla dough.  
**Current Goal**: Plant corn at the right time.  
This structure reflects the subgoals from the forward subgoaling action and provides context for future implementation.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to plant corn at the right time. This involves selecting a suitable planting time, 60-80 days before the planned harvest, to ensure the corn is ready for tortilla production.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of planting corn at the right time, determine the harvest date (e.g., early August for summer tortillas). Count backward 60-80 days to plant between mid-May and early June. Select a sunny location with well-drained soil, plant corn seeds 1-2 inches deep, spaced 8-12 inches apart in rows, and ensure proper irrigation. This aligns with the script’s first step: “Plant corn 60-80 days before you plan to harvest it.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the corn planting process is valid. This involves checking if the planting conditions and timing align with the requirements for successful corn growth for tortillas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the planting was done 60-80 days before the planned harvest (mid-May to early June for an August harvest). Confirm the soil is well-drained, seeds were planted at the correct depth (1-2 inches) and spacing (8-12 inches), and irrigation is adequate. If any conditions are not met (e.g., poor soil drainage), adjust by improving soil or replanting. This ensures the first step supports the goal of harvesting corn for tortillas.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to account for potential issues identified during validation. The original subgoals remain largely intact, but add a contingency for replanting if validation fails (e.g., poor germination). Updated subgoals:  
1. Plant corn at the right time (with contingency for replanting if needed).  
2. Monitor corn growth until tassels brown.  
3. Verify kernel readiness (color and fullness).  
4. Harvest corn properly.  
5. Process corn into masa harina.  
6. Prepare and cook tortilla dough.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor corn growth until tassels brown. Retrieve past information related to corn growth monitoring to support this step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to monitor corn growth until tassels brown. Relevant past information includes:  
- From Step 3 (Reach Goal): Corn was planted 60-80 days before the planned harvest, targeting mid-May to early June for an August harvest.  
- From Step 4 (Validation): Planting conditions (soil, depth, spacing, irrigation) were verified to support healthy growth.  
This information indicates the corn should be monitored over the 60-80 day period, checking for tassel browning as a sign of maturity, aligning with the script’s second step: “Wait until the corn tassels turn brown.”  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor corn growth until tassels brown. This involves observing the corn plants over 60-80 days to identify when tassels turn brown, indicating maturity for harvest.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Regularly inspect the corn plants starting around 50 days after planting (early to mid-July for a mid-May planting). Look for tassels (the male flowers at the top of the stalk) turning from green to brown, which typically occurs 60-80 days after planting. Ensure plants receive adequate water and nutrients during this period to support healthy development. This aligns with the script’s second step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify kernel readiness by checking for white or yellow color and fullness. This involves inspecting the corn kernels to ensure they are suitable for tortilla production.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Once tassels are brown (around 60-80 days), check kernel color by gently peeling back a small portion of the husk on a few cobs. Look for kernels that are white or yellow, depending on the corn variety, as these are suitable for masa harina. Peel back the husk further (per the script’s fourth step) to confirm kernels are plump and full, indicating readiness for harvest. This satisfies the script’s third and fourth steps: “Check the corn kernels for a white or yellow color” and “Peel back the husk to see if the kernels are full.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to harvest corn properly. This involves pulling the corn from the stalk to collect cobs ready for tortilla processing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Harvest the corn by firmly grasping each cob and pulling downward to detach it from the stalk, as per the script’s fifth step: “Harvest the corn by pulling it from the stalk.” Do this once kernel color and fullness are confirmed (from Step 8). Collect cobs in a basket to avoid damage and proceed to processing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system based on progress:  
- **Main Goal**: Harvest corn and produce tortillas.  
  - Subgoal 1: Plant corn at the right time (with contingency for replanting if needed) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Monitor corn growth until tassels brown – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify kernel readiness (color and fullness) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Harvest corn properly – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 5: Process corn into masa harina.  
  - Subgoal 6: Prepare and cook tortilla dough.  
**Current Goal**: Process corn into masa harina.  
This reflects the completion of planting, monitoring, verification, and harvesting, with focus now on processing.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to process corn into masa harina. This involves removing husks and silk, washing kernels, and grinding them into flour suitable for tortillas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Remove husks and silk from the harvested cobs (script step 6: “Remove the corn husks and silk”). Wash the kernels thoroughly to remove any debris (script step 7: “Wash the corn kernels”). Grind the kernels using a grain mill or food processor until a fine masa harina flour is produced (script step 8: “Grind the corn kernels into masa harina”). Ensure the flour is fine and consistent for tortilla dough.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare and cook tortilla dough. This involves mixing masa harina with water, forming flat discs, and cooking them on a griddle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Mix the masa harina with water in a bowl, kneading until a smooth dough forms (script step 9: “Mix the masa harina with water to make a dough”). Roll the dough into small balls and flatten into thin, round discs using a tortilla press or rolling pin (script step 10: “Roll the dough into flat discs”). Cook each disc on a preheated griddle for about 1-2 minutes per side until lightly browned (script step 11: “Cook the tortillas on a griddle”). Stack cooked tortillas in a cloth to keep warm.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the tortillas are properly prepared and suitable for use. This involves checking the texture, taste, and cooking quality of the tortillas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the cooked tortillas for a soft, pliable texture and a slightly toasted appearance. Taste a sample to confirm the flavor is consistent with corn tortillas (not too dry or doughy). Verify that the dough was mixed and rolled correctly (from Step 12) and that the griddle was at the right temperature. If tortillas are too tough or undercooked, adjust by adding more water to the dough or increasing cooking time. This ensures the final product meets the constraint of being suitable for tortillas.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Final goal-management system update:  
- **Main Goal**: Harvest corn and produce tortillas – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 1: Plant corn at the right time (with contingency for replanting if needed) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Monitor corn growth until tassels brown – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify kernel readiness (color and fullness) – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Harvest corn properly – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 5: Process corn into masa harina – Completed.  
  - Subgoal 6: Prepare and cook tortilla dough – Completed.  
**Current Goal**: None (all goals completed).  
The plan has been fully executed, with tortillas successfully produced from harvested corn.  
[/REVIEW]
