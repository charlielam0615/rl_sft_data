**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan for using TeamViewer on a smartphone to enable remote control by a partner. The process involves following a given script of steps while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework, which includes Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The constraint is that the task must be performed on a smartphone, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The provided script is:

1. Open TeamViewer on your smartphone.
2. Enter your partner's ID.
3. Tap Connect to Partner.
4. Tap Allow when prompted.
5. Your partner will now be able to remotely control your smartphone.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and ensuring all steps in the script are completed.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for the Task

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for using TeamViewer on a smartphone, I will break down the provided script into intermediate subgoals that align with each step. The subgoals are:  
1. Launch the TeamViewer application on the smartphone.  
2. Input the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app.  
3. Initiate a connection to the partner.  
4. Grant permission for remote control when prompted.  
5. Enable the partner to remotely control the smartphone.  
These subgoals will guide the subsequent steps to achieve the final goal of enabling remote control via TeamViewer.

### Step 2: Organize and Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Enable a partner to remotely control the smartphone using TeamViewer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Launch the TeamViewer application on the smartphone.  
  - Subgoal 2: Input the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app.  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate a connection to the partner.  
  - Subgoal 4: Grant permission for remote control when prompted.  
  - Subgoal 5: Enable the partner to remotely control the smartphone.  
**Current Goal**: Launch the TeamViewer application on the smartphone.  
This hierarchy integrates the subgoals defined in the previous planning step, providing context for the implementation steps to follow.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Launch the TeamViewer Application

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Launch the TeamViewer application on the smartphone.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate the TeamViewer app on the smartphone’s home screen or app drawer and tap to open it.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To launch the TeamViewer application, find the app icon on the smartphone’s home screen or in the app drawer. Tap the icon to open the TeamViewer app. Ensure the smartphone is powered on and unlocked to access the app.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validate the Launch of the TeamViewer App

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the TeamViewer app has been successfully launched.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the TeamViewer app interface is visible on the smartphone screen.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the TeamViewer app has opened by checking if the app’s main interface, which typically includes fields for entering a partner’s ID or other connection options, is displayed on the smartphone screen. If the app does not open, ensure it is installed and try launching it again.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Input the Partner’s ID

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Input the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate the field for entering the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app and type the provided ID.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the TeamViewer app, find the text field labeled for the partner’s ID (often marked as “Partner ID” or similar). Tap the field to bring up the keyboard, then carefully enter the partner’s ID as provided. Double-check the ID for accuracy before proceeding.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Recall Information About Partner’s ID

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the partner’s ID to ensure it is correctly understood and entered.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Input the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app.  
**Recalled Information**: The partner’s ID is a unique numeric code provided by the person who will remotely control the smartphone. This ID must be entered exactly as provided in the TeamViewer app’s designated field, as specified in the previous implementation step. No additional details about the ID’s format were provided in the script, so it should be assumed to be a standard numeric TeamViewer ID.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Initiate Connection to Partner

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Initiate a connection to the partner.  
- **How to Achieve**: Tap the “Connect to Partner” button in the TeamViewer app after entering the partner’s ID.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After entering the partner’s ID, locate the “Connect to Partner” button (or similar, such as “Connect”) in the TeamViewer app interface. Tap this button to initiate the connection to the partner’s device. Ensure the smartphone has an active internet connection to proceed.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8: Grant Permission for Remote Control

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Grant permission for remote control when prompted.  
- **How to Achieve**: Tap the “Allow” button when the TeamViewer app prompts for permission to enable remote control.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
When the TeamViewer app displays a prompt requesting permission for the partner to control the smartphone (e.g., a pop-up asking to allow remote access), tap the “Allow” button. This may involve granting specific permissions, such as screen sharing or accessibility, depending on the smartphone’s operating system.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validate Remote Control Setup

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the partner can remotely control the smartphone.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the partner can interact with the smartphone screen, such as moving the cursor or performing actions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the partner can remotely control the smartphone by observing if they can interact with the screen (e.g., moving a cursor, opening apps, or performing other actions). If the partner reports issues or no control is observed, ensure all permissions were granted correctly and the connection is stable.  

[/IMP]

### Step 10: Review Goal Completion

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Enable a partner to remotely control the smartphone using TeamViewer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Launch the TeamViewer application on the smartphone. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Input the partner’s ID in the TeamViewer app. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Initiate a connection to the partner. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Grant permission for remote control when prompted. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Enable the partner to remotely control the smartphone. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal of enabling remote control via TeamViewer on the smartphone has been achieved, assuming no issues were reported during validation.  

[/REVIEW]

### Final Notes
The plan for using TeamViewer on a smartphone has been completed by following the provided script and applying the meta-cognitive action set. Each step was addressed with a combination of planning, implementation, and review actions to ensure clarity and progress. If any issues arise (e.g., app not installed, incorrect ID, or connection failure), additional planning or backtracking may be needed, but the current plan assumes successful execution of all steps.
