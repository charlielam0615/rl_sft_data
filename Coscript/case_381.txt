### Problem Statement
The task is to create yeast for baking by adjusting water temperature, following a provided script of steps while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The process involves finding a warm spot, preparing warm water (110°F–115°F), mixing yeast and sugar, letting the mixture proof until frothy, troubleshooting if it fails, and using the activated yeast in a recipe. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step, categorized as Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating yeast for baking into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Identify a suitable warm location in the kitchen for proofing.  
2. Prepare water at the correct temperature (110°F–115°F).  
3. Mix yeast and sugar with the warm water.  
4. Allow the mixture to proof for 5–10 minutes until frothy.  
5. Verify the yeast’s activation (frothiness) and troubleshoot if necessary.  
6. Use the activated yeast in the baking recipe.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify a suitable warm location in the kitchen for proofing the yeast. This will be achieved by selecting a spot near a heat source, such as a stove or oven, that maintains a warm, stable environment conducive to yeast activation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Find a warm spot in the kitchen, such as near the stove or oven, where the temperature is consistently warm but not hot. Ensure the area is free from drafts to maintain a stable environment for proofing the yeast.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare water at the correct temperature (110°F–115°F). This will be achieved by heating water and using a cooking thermometer to verify the temperature is within the specified range.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Fill a bowl or cup with water and heat it gently until it reaches a temperature between 110°F and 115°F. Use a cooking thermometer to check the temperature, ensuring it is neither too hot (which could kill the yeast) nor too cold (which could slow activation).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix yeast and sugar with the warm water. This will be achieved by adding the ingredients to the water and stirring gently to combine.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Add the specified amount of yeast and a pinch of sugar to the warm water in the bowl or cup. Stir gently to ensure the yeast and sugar are fully dissolved and evenly distributed in the water.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to allow the yeast mixture to proof until frothy. This will be achieved by letting the mixture sit undisturbed in the warm spot for 5–10 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the bowl or cup with the yeast mixture in the identified warm spot. Let it sit undisturbed for 5–10 minutes, observing for a frothy, bubbly texture that indicates the yeast is active.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if the yeast mixture is frothy, indicating successful activation. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the mixture for frothiness and deciding whether to proceed or troubleshoot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the yeast mixture after 5–10 minutes. If it is frothy and bubbly, the yeast is active and ready for use. If it is not frothy, the yeast may be dead or the water temperature may have been incorrect. In this case, discard the mixture and start over with new yeast, ensuring the water is between 110°F and 115°F.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Create yeast for baking by adjusting water temperature.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify a suitable warm location in the kitchen (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare water at 110°F–115°F (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Mix yeast and sugar with warm water (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Allow the mixture to proof for 5–10 minutes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the yeast’s activation and troubleshoot if necessary (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Use the activated yeast in the baking recipe (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Use the activated yeast in the baking recipe.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the activated yeast in the baking recipe. This will be achieved by incorporating the frothy yeast mixture into the recipe as directed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Once the yeast mixture is frothy, add it to the other ingredients in your baking recipe as specified. Follow the recipe instructions to proceed with mixing, kneading, or other steps required for your baked goods.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of creating yeast for baking, focusing on the critical role of water temperature (110°F–115°F) and the verification of yeast activation. Retrieve information related to these aspects from previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- Water temperature is critical and must be maintained between 110°F and 115°F to ensure yeast activation without killing it (Step 3).  
- The yeast mixture should become frothy after 5–10 minutes of proofing in a warm spot, indicating successful activation (Step 5).  
- If the mixture does not become frothy, the yeast may be dead or the water temperature incorrect, requiring a restart with new yeast (Step 6).  
These points highlight the importance of precise temperature control and verification of frothiness to confirm yeast activity before use in baking.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that all steps for creating yeast have been correctly executed. This will be achieved by reviewing the process to ensure the yeast is active and ready for baking.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that all steps were followed: a warm spot was identified, water was heated to 110°F–115°F, yeast and sugar were mixed, the mixture proofed for 5–10 minutes, and frothiness was confirmed. If any step was missed or incorrect, repeat the process from the relevant step. If all steps are confirmed, the yeast is ready for successful use in baking.  
[/IMP]

### Completion
All subgoals from the forward subgoaling in Step 1 have been addressed, and the yeast is successfully prepared for baking. The process adhered to the constraint of adjusting water temperature and followed the provided script, using one meta-cognitive action per step in the required format.
