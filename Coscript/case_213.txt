### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan for fostering "Love with Friends" under the constraint that the activities and actions involve friends. The provided script outlines seven steps to achieve this: (1) Find friends who love you for who you are, (2) Do things together that make you both happy, (3) Make time for your friends, (4) Be there for your friends, (5) Listen to your friends, (6) Accept that you may not always agree, and (7) Cherish your friendship. This task falls under the Health category, focusing on emotional and social well-being. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of fostering "Love with Friends" into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals will align with the seven steps provided:  
1. Identify and connect with friends who accept you authentically.  
2. Engage in shared activities that bring mutual joy.  
3. Schedule regular time for friends.  
4. Provide support during friends' challenges.  
5. Practice active listening in conversations.  
6. Embrace disagreements with understanding.  
7. Actively appreciate and maintain the friendship.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Identify and connect with friends who accept you authentically." This can be achieved by reflecting on existing relationships to identify friends who value you for who you are and initiating contact to strengthen those bonds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve this goal, start by listing current friends and evaluating which relationships feel genuine and supportive. Consider qualities like mutual respect, trust, and acceptance. Reach out to one or two friends via a message or call to catch up or plan a meetup, expressing appreciation for their support. For example, send a text like, "Hey, I really value our friendship and how you always accept me for me. Want to grab coffee soon?" This initiates a connection rooted in authenticity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Foster "Love with Friends"  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and connect with friends who accept you authentically (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Engage in shared activities that bring mutual joy (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Schedule regular time for friends.  
  - Subgoal 4: Provide support during friends' challenges.  
  - Subgoal 5: Practice active listening in conversations.  
  - Subgoal 6: Embrace disagreements with understanding.  
  - Subgoal 7: Actively appreciate and maintain the friendship.  
**Current Goal**: Engage in shared activities that bring mutual joy.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Engage in shared activities that bring mutual joy." This can be achieved by discussing with friends to identify activities you both enjoy and planning to do them together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Contact a friend identified in Step 2 and suggest activities you both enjoy, such as watching a favorite movie, going for a hike, or cooking together. For example, say, "Remember how much fun we had hiking last time? Want to plan a hike this weekend?" Schedule a specific time and place for the activity to ensure it happens. After the activity, reflect on how it strengthened your bond.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the path of engaging in shared activities. This can be achieved by assessing whether the activities planned and executed with friends are fostering mutual joy and strengthening the friendship.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate the recent shared activity by asking yourself: Did both you and your friend enjoy the activity? Did it deepen your connection? If the activity was successful (e.g., both enjoyed the hike and felt closer), continue planning similar activities. If not, consider discussing with your friend to find alternative activities that better align with mutual interests. For example, if the hike felt rushed, suggest a more relaxed activity like a board game night.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the validation, adjust the subgoals to refine the approach. If the shared activities are working, maintain them but add variety. If not, modify the approach to better align with mutual joy. For instance, incorporate new activities or adjust the frequency to ensure sustainability.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Schedule regular time for friends." This can be achieved by creating a recurring plan to spend time with friends, ensuring consistency in the friendship.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Propose a regular meetup schedule with your friend(s), such as a weekly coffee date or a monthly game night. Use a shared calendar or app to track these plans. For example, say, "How about we meet every other Sunday for brunch? I’ll set a reminder!" Confirm the schedule with your friend and stick to it, adjusting only if necessary to accommodate both parties.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Provide support during friends' challenges." Retrieve past information related to supporting friends to inform this step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**: From Step 2, you identified friends who accept you authentically, indicating a foundation of trust. From Step 4, shared activities strengthened your bond, suggesting open communication channels. This trust and communication are key to offering support. For example, being available to listen or help during tough times builds on these established connections.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Provide support during friends' challenges." This can be achieved by checking in with friends and offering help or emotional support when they face difficulties.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Reach out to a friend to check in on their well-being, e.g., "Hey, how have you been? Anything going on you’d like to talk about?" If they share a challenge, offer specific support, such as helping with a task, listening attentively, or suggesting resources. For instance, if a friend is stressed about work, offer to meet up and talk it through or suggest a fun distraction like watching a comedy together.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Practice active listening in conversations." This can be achieved by focusing fully on what friends say during interactions, showing empathy, and responding thoughtfully.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
During your next conversation with a friend, practice active listening by maintaining eye contact, avoiding interruptions, and summarizing their points to show understanding, e.g., "It sounds like you’re really excited about your new project!" Ask open-ended questions like, “How do you feel about that?” to deepen the conversation. Reflect afterward on how this improved the interaction.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to "Embrace disagreements with understanding." This can be achieved by approaching conflicts with patience and seeking to understand your friend’s perspective.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If a disagreement arises, stay calm and listen to your friend’s viewpoint without judgment. For example, if you disagree about plans, say, “I see why you’d prefer that; can you tell me more?” Work toward a compromise, like alternating activity choices. After resolving the disagreement, reflect on how it affected your friendship and discuss with your friend to ensure mutual respect remains intact.  
[/IMP]
