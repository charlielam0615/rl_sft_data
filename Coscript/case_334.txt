**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Add and subtract integers without a calculator.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the concept of integer addition and subtraction.  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize that addition and subtraction are inverse operations.  
  - Subgoal 3: Select two integers for the operation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Perform the addition or subtraction of the chosen integers.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the result by reversing the operation.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the concept of integer addition and subtraction. This will be achieved by explaining the rules for adding and subtracting integers, including handling positive and negative numbers.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Integers are whole numbers, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Addition involves combining two integers to find their sum, while subtraction finds the difference. Key rules:  
- Adding two positive integers: Add as usual (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7).  
- Adding two negative integers: Add the absolute values and keep the negative sign (e.g., -3 + -4 = -7).  
- Adding a positive and a negative integer: Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger, and use the sign of the larger number (e.g., -3 + 5 = 2).  
- Subtracting integers: Rewrite subtraction as addition by adding the opposite (e.g., 5 - 3 = 5 + (-3)). Then apply addition rules.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Add and subtract integers without a calculator.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the concept of integer addition and subtraction (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize that addition and subtraction are inverse operations.  
  - Subgoal 3: Select two integers for the operation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Perform the addition or subtraction of the chosen integers.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the result by reversing the operation.  
**Current Goal**: Recognize that addition and subtraction are inverse operations.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to recognize that addition and subtraction are inverse operations. This will be achieved by explaining how addition and subtraction undo each other.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Addition and subtraction are inverse operations, meaning one operation can undo the other. For example, if you add 5 to 3 (3 + 5 = 8), you can undo it by subtracting 5 (8 - 5 = 3). Similarly, if you subtract 4 from 7 (7 - 4 = 3), you can undo it by adding 4 (3 + 4 = 7). This relationship holds for all integers, including negative numbers.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select two integers for the operation. This will be achieved by choosing two integers, one positive and one negative, to demonstrate both addition and subtraction.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose the integers 6 and -4 for the operation. These will be used to demonstrate both addition (6 + (-4)) and subtraction (6 - (-4)).

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the results of the operations (6 + (-4) = 2 and 6 - (-4) = 10) by reversing the operations. This will be achieved by applying the inverse operation to confirm the original numbers are obtained.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For addition (6 + (-4) = 2): Reverse by subtracting -4 from 2: 2 - (-4) = 2 + 4 = 6, which matches the original number.  
- For subtraction (6 - (-4) = 10): Reverse by adding -4 to 10: 10 + (-4) = 10 - 4 = 6, which matches the original number.  
Both results are verified as correct.
