**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Scan a QR code with a tablet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Camera app on the tablet.  
  - Subgoal 2: Point the tablet's camera at the QR code.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wait for the QR code to be scanned and process the result.  
**Current Goal**: Open the Camera app on the tablet.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Open the Camera app on the tablet.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate and tap the Camera app icon on the tablet’s home screen or app drawer to launch the application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the first subgoal, ensure the tablet is powered on and unlocked. Navigate to the home screen or app drawer, find the Camera app icon (typically a camera symbol), and tap it to open the app. If the app is not found, check if it’s pre-installed or requires downloading from the tablet’s app store.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the Camera app is open and functional.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the Camera app interface is displayed and the camera is active, ready to scan.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the tablet screen to ensure the Camera app is open, displaying a live camera feed. Test the camera by pointing it at an object to confirm it’s functioning. If the app fails to open or the camera doesn’t work, restart the app or troubleshoot the camera settings.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Scan a QR code with a tablet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Camera app on the tablet (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Point the tablet's camera at the QR code.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wait for the QR code to be scanned and process the result.  
**Current Goal**: Point the tablet's camera at the QR code.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Point the tablet's camera at the QR code.  
- **How to Achieve**: Hold the tablet steadily, aligning the camera lens with the QR code so it’s fully visible in the camera’s viewfinder.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With the Camera app open, position the tablet so the QR code appears clearly within the camera’s frame. Ensure proper lighting and avoid reflections or obstructions. Hold the tablet steady to allow the camera to focus on the QR code.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the QR code is properly aligned and detected by the camera.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the Camera app recognizes the QR code, typically indicated by a highlighted frame or notification.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe the Camera app interface for a visual cue (e.g., a box around the QR code or a pop-up notification) indicating that the QR code is detected. If no detection occurs, adjust the tablet’s position, distance, or lighting to improve visibility.

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Wait for the QR code to be scanned and process the result.  
- **How to Achieve**: Allow the Camera app time to process the QR code and follow any prompts to access the linked content.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Keep the tablet steady while the Camera app processes the QR code. Once scanned, the app typically displays a link or notification. Tap the prompt to access the content (e.g., a website or payment details, relevant to the Finance and Business category). If no prompt appears, ensure the QR code is valid or try restarting the scan.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the QR code has been successfully scanned and the content is accessible.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the tablet displays the QR code’s linked content or performs the intended action.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if the tablet opens the linked content, such as a webpage or payment confirmation. If the content doesn’t load or the action fails, re-scan the QR code or verify the QR code’s validity. If successful, the task is complete.  
[/IMP]
