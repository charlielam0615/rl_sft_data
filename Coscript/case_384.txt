### Step 1: Define Subgoals for Making the Fairy Tiara

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making a fairy tiara into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare materials by cutting pipe cleaners.  
2. Shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops.  
3. Form the tiara structure by twisting pipe cleaners together.  
4. Adjust the tiara size to fit the head.  
5. Decorate the tiara with jewels or embellishments using glue.  
6. Allow the tiara to dry before use.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Organize and Track the Hierarchy of Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a fairy tiara with glue.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials by cutting pipe cleaners.  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops.  
  - Subgoal 3: Form the tiara structure by twisting pipe cleaners together.  
  - Subgoal 4: Adjust the tiara size to fit the head.  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the tiara with jewels or embellishments using glue.  
  - Subgoal 6: Allow the tiara to dry before use.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare materials by cutting pipe cleaners.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Execute the First Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to prepare materials by cutting two lengths of pipe cleaners. This will be achieved by selecting appropriately sized pipe cleaners and cutting them to a suitable length for the tiara base.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather pipe cleaners and scissors. Cut two lengths of pipe cleaner, each approximately 12–18 inches long, to serve as the base for the fairy tiara. Ensure the cuts are clean and even.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate the Material Preparation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to verify that the pipe cleaners are cut correctly. This will be achieved by checking the length and quality of the cut pipe cleaners to ensure they are suitable for the tiara.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the two cut pipe cleaners to confirm they are approximately 12–18 inches long and have clean, even ends. Inspect for any fraying or damage that could affect the tiara’s structure. If any issues are found, re-cut the pipe cleaners as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Recall Information for Next Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops. Retrieve information from the script related to shaping the pipe cleaners.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies: “Curl the ends of the pipe cleaners around your fingers to create loops.” This indicates that the next step involves shaping the cut pipe cleaners by curling their ends to form decorative loops, which will contribute to the tiara’s fairy-like aesthetic.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Execute the Shaping Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops. This will be achieved by curling the ends of each pipe cleaner around a finger or a cylindrical object to form loops.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take each pipe cleaner and gently curl both ends around a finger or a small cylindrical object (e.g., a pencil) to create loops. Ensure the loops are symmetrical and securely formed without kinking the pipe cleaner.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Form the Tiara Structure

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to form the tiara structure by twisting the pipe cleaners together. This will be achieved by crossing the two pipe cleaners at their centers and twisting them to create a secure base.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cross the two pipe cleaners at their midpoints to form an “X” shape. Twist them together at the intersection to secure the structure, ensuring the loops at the ends remain intact and evenly spaced.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Progress and Update Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a fairy tiara with glue.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials by cutting pipe cleaners (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Form the tiara structure by twisting pipe cleaners together (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Adjust the tiara size to fit the head.  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the tiara with jewels or embellishments using glue.  
  - Subgoal 6: Allow the tiara to dry before use.  
**Current Goal**: Adjust the tiara size to fit the head.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Adjust the Tiara Size

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to adjust the tiara size to fit the head. This will be achieved by measuring the tiara around the head and trimming any excess pipe cleaner.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the twisted pipe cleaner structure around the head to measure its fit. Mark any excess length, then carefully cut off the extra pipe cleaner using scissors, ensuring the tiara remains comfortable and secure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Decorate the Tiara

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to decorate the tiara with jewels or embellishments using glue. This will be achieved by selecting decorative items and attaching them to the tiara with glue.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select jewels, beads, or other embellishments suitable for the fairy tiara. Apply a small amount of craft glue (e.g., hot glue or fabric glue) to the back of each embellishment and press them onto the pipe cleaner structure, focusing on the loops and twisted center for aesthetic appeal. Arrange the decorations evenly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validate the Decoration

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to verify that the decorations are securely attached. This will be achieved by checking that the glued embellishments are firmly in place and visually balanced.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the tiara to ensure all jewels and embellishments are securely glued and not loose. Check the overall appearance to confirm the decorations are evenly distributed and enhance the fairy-like aesthetic. Reapply glue to any loose items as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Allow the Tiara to Dry

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to allow the tiara to dry completely. This will be achieved by setting the tiara aside in a safe place to let the glue set fully.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the tiara on a flat, stable surface in a well-ventilated area, away from disturbances. Let it dry for the recommended time based on the glue’s instructions (typically 1–24 hours, depending on the glue type). Avoid handling the tiara during this period.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Final Review of Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a fairy tiara with glue.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials by cutting pipe cleaners (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the pipe cleaners by creating loops (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Form the tiara structure by twisting pipe cleaners together (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Adjust the tiara size to fit the head (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the tiara with jewels or embellishments using glue (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Allow the tiara to dry before use (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed).  
The plan to make a fairy tiara with glue is complete, with all subgoals successfully achieved.
