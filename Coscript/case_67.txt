### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the hair by washing and brushing it to ensure it is clean and tangle-free. This will be achieved by washing the hair with shampoo and conditioner, drying it, and brushing it to remove tangles, as outlined in step 1 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wash the hair thoroughly with shampoo and conditioner to ensure it is clean. Towel-dry or blow-dry the hair until it is damp or fully dry, depending on preference. Use a wide-tooth comb or brush to gently detangle the hair, starting from the ends and working up to the roots to avoid breakage. Ensure the hair is smooth and free of knots.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the hair is properly prepared (clean and tangle-free). This will be achieved by checking that the hair is clean, dry, and smooth with no tangles, as per step 1 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the hair to confirm it is clean, free of residue, and smooth. Run a brush through the hair to verify there are no tangles or knots. If any tangles remain, gently brush them out. Ensure the hair is dry enough to proceed with styling.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create a smooth, neat ponytail by brushing hair back and securing it, as outlined in steps 2 and 3 of the script. This will be achieved by brushing the hair back evenly and securing it with a hair tie.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Brush the hair back from the forehead and sides toward the desired ponytail position (typically high on the crown for a ballerina bun). Gather all the hair smoothly and secure it tightly with a strong hair tie to form a ponytail. Ensure no loose strands are left out.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to smooth the ponytail, as per step 4 of the script. This will be achieved by brushing the ponytail to eliminate bumps and applying a smoothing product if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Brush the ponytail gently to ensure it is smooth and free of bumps. If necessary, apply a small amount of gel or smoothing serum to control flyaways and enhance sleekness. Check that the ponytail is tight and even.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to form a tight bun by twisting the ponytail and shaping it, as per steps 5 and 6 of the script. This will be achieved by twisting the ponytail into a rope and coiling it into a bun shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the ponytail and twist it tightly into a rope-like strand. Coil the twisted hair around the base of the ponytail in a circular motion to form a bun. Ensure the bun is tight and neat, with the ends tucked under.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the bun with bobby pins and apply hairspray, as per steps 7 and 8 of the script. This will be achieved by pinning the bun in place and spraying it to maintain its shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Insert bobby pins around the bun, sliding them through the coiled hair and into the base to secure it firmly. Use enough pins to ensure the bun is stable. Lightly spray the bun with hairspray to hold the shape and control flyaways.
