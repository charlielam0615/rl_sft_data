**Problem Statement**: The goal is to create a plan to make a Comcast wireless internet connection faster by restarting the wireless router, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework (Planning, Implementation, Review). The process is constrained to restarting the router, and the script includes two steps: restarting the wireless router and checking the router’s documentation for additional tips. The plan will be developed systematically, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making the Comcast wireless internet connection faster into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script suggests two steps: restarting the router and checking its documentation. Subgoals are:  
1. Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection.  
2. Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make the Comcast wireless internet connection faster by restarting the router.  
  - Subgoal 1: Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection.  
  - Subgoal 2: Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips.  
**Current Goal**: Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the subgoals identified in the previous planning step, with the current focus on restarting the router as the first actionable step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate the router’s power source, power it off, wait briefly, and power it back on to reset the connection, following standard router restart procedures.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To restart the wireless router:  
1. Locate the router’s power cord or power button.  
2. Unplug the router from the power source or press the power button to turn it off.  
3. Wait for 30 seconds to ensure a full reset.  
4. Plug the router back in or press the power button to turn it on.  
5. Wait for the router to fully reboot, which may take 1–2 minutes, and confirm the internet connection is active.  
This process refreshes the router’s connection to Comcast’s network, potentially resolving speed issues.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the router restart improved the internet connection speed.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test the internet speed using a reliable tool and compare it to previous performance to confirm the restart’s effectiveness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the router restart:  
1. Connect a device to the wireless network.  
2. Use a speed test tool (e.g., speedtest.net) to measure the current download and upload speeds.  
3. Compare the results to typical or previously recorded speeds for the Comcast connection.  
4. If the speed has improved, the restart was successful; if not, further steps may be needed.  
This ensures the restart addressed the connection issue as intended.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The validation step indicates that if the speed does not improve, further steps are needed. Adjust the subgoals to prioritize reviewing the router’s documentation (the second script step) to identify additional optimization tips. The updated subgoals are:  
1. (Completed) Restart the wireless router.  
2. Review the router’s documentation for tips to further optimize the connection speed.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make the Comcast wireless internet connection faster by restarting the router.  
  - Subgoal 1: Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips.  
**Current Goal**: Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips.  
The hierarchy reflects the completion of the router restart and shifts focus to the documentation review as the next step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate the router’s manual (physical or online) and identify recommendations for improving wireless performance, such as channel adjustments or firmware updates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To review the router’s documentation:  
1. Identify the router’s model number (usually on the device or box).  
2. Access the documentation, either from a physical manual or the manufacturer’s website (e.g., search for “Comcast router [model number] manual”).  
3. Look for sections on optimizing wireless performance, such as:  
   - Changing the Wi-Fi channel to avoid interference.  
   - Updating the router’s firmware.  
   - Adjusting bandwidth settings (e.g., prioritizing 5GHz over 2.4GHz).  
4. Implement one or two key recommendations (e.g., change the Wi-Fi channel or update firmware).  
This step leverages the manufacturer’s guidance to further enhance the connection speed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the optimization tips from the documentation improved the internet connection speed.  
- **How to Achieve**: Re-test the internet speed after applying documentation recommendations and compare with previous results.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the documentation-based optimizations:  
1. Ensure the recommended changes (e.g., Wi-Fi channel or firmware update) are applied.  
2. Reconnect a device to the wireless network.  
3. Run another speed test using a tool like speedtest.net.  
4. Compare the new results to the post-restart speed test and typical Comcast speeds.  
5. If the speed meets expectations, the plan is complete; otherwise, consider additional troubleshooting (e.g., contacting Comcast support).  
This confirms whether the documentation tips effectively improved the connection.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of optimizing the Comcast wireless connection, focusing on the effectiveness of the restart and documentation-based adjustments.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- **Router Restart (Step 3)**: The router was restarted by powering it off for 30 seconds and back on, refreshing the connection.  
- **Initial Validation (Step 4)**: A speed test was conducted to check if the restart improved performance, with results compared to typical Comcast speeds.  
- **Documentation Review (Step 7)**: The router’s documentation was consulted for optimization tips, such as changing the Wi-Fi channel or updating firmware.  
- **Second Validation (Step 8)**: A follow-up speed test verified the effectiveness of the documentation-based changes.  
This summary confirms that both script steps (restart and documentation review) were addressed, with validation at each stage to assess speed improvements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make the Comcast wireless internet connection faster by restarting the router.  
  - Subgoal 1: Restart the wireless router to refresh the connection (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Review the router’s documentation for additional optimization tips (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
Both subgoals from the script have been addressed, with validation confirming their impact. The plan to improve the Comcast wireless connection speed is complete unless further issues are identified.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Note**: The plan has been fully executed, covering both steps in the provided script (restarting the router and checking documentation) while adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. All subgoals are completed, and the process included planning, implementation, and review to ensure a faster Comcast wireless connection. If further optimization is needed, additional troubleshooting (e.g., contacting Comcast) could be considered, but this was not part of the provided script.
