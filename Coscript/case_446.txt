### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making orange marmalade without sugar, following the provided script while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The marmalade must be prepared without using sugar, and the process should follow the given steps: choosing oranges, cutting peels, juicing oranges, boiling peels with water, simmering until soft, adding juice to thicken, cooling, and storing. Each step will use one meta-cognitive action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of making sugar-free orange marmalade into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:
1. Select suitable oranges for marmalade.
2. Prepare orange peels by cutting them into thin strips.
3. Extract and measure 3 cups of orange juice.
4. Cook peels with water until soft.
5. Combine juice with peels and cook to thicken.
6. Cool the marmalade.
7. Store the marmalade in jars.

These subgoals align with the script and ensure a sugar-free process.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Select suitable oranges for marmalade.
**How to Achieve**: Choose navel, Valencia, or blood oranges, as they are ideal for marmalade due to their flavor and juiciness, ensuring no sugar is needed to enhance taste.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select navel, Valencia, or blood oranges from a grocery store or market. Inspect for freshness, ensuring they are firm and heavy for their size, which indicates juiciness. Avoid oranges with blemishes or soft spots. Approximately 6–8 medium oranges should suffice for 3 cups of juice.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Make sugar-free orange marmalade.
  - Subgoal 1: Select suitable oranges for marmalade (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare orange peels by cutting them into thin strips.
  - Subgoal 3: Extract and measure 3 cups of orange juice.
  - Subgoal 4: Cook peels with water until soft.
  - Subgoal 5: Combine juice with peels and cook to thicken.
  - Subgoal 6: Cool the marmalade.
  - Subgoal 7: Store the marmalade in jars.

**Current Goal**: Prepare orange peels by cutting them into thin strips.
The first subgoal has been addressed by selecting suitable oranges. The hierarchy is updated to reflect this progress, and the focus is now on preparing the peels.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Prepare orange peels by cutting them into thin strips.
**How to Achieve**: Peel the selected oranges and cut the peels into thin, uniform strips, minimizing the pith to avoid bitterness in the sugar-free marmalade.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using a sharp knife or peeler, carefully remove the orange peel, avoiding excessive white pith. Slice the peel into thin strips (about 1/8 inch wide). Collect the strips in a bowl, ensuring consistency for even cooking. Discard any pith-heavy pieces to maintain a pleasant flavor.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Ensure the peels are properly prepared for cooking.
**How to Achieve**: Check that the peel strips are thin, uniform, and mostly pith-free to prevent bitterness in the marmalade.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the prepared peel strips to confirm they are approximately 1/8 inch wide and have minimal pith. If any strips are too thick or pith-heavy, trim or discard them. Verify that enough peel has been collected to match the volume of 6–8 oranges, sufficient for the recipe.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Backward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)

Work backward from the goal of having soft peels ready for juicing. To achieve soft peels, they must be boiled and simmered in water. This requires:
1. Placing peels in a pot with enough water to cover them.
2. Bringing the mixture to a boil, then simmering for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
These steps ensure the peels are ready for the next stage of combining with juice.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Cook peels with water until soft.
**How to Achieve**: Add the prepared peel strips to a pot with enough water to cover them, boil, and then simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour until the peels are soft.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place the peel strips in a large pot and add water until they are just covered. Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until the peels are tender when pierced with a fork. Check water levels periodically to ensure peels remain submerged, adding more water if needed.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Current Goal**: Extract and measure 3 cups of orange juice.
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to juicing oranges and measuring the required amount for sugar-free marmalade.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
From the script, step 3 states: "Juice the oranges (straining out any seeds or pulp) and measure the juice -- you'll need 3 cups." This indicates that the oranges selected in Step 2 (navel, Valencia, or blood oranges) should be juiced, with seeds and pulp removed, to obtain exactly 3 cups of juice. No prior steps mention adding sugar, aligning with the sugar-free constraint.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Extract and measure 3 cups of orange juice.
**How to Achieve**: Juice the oranges, strain out seeds and pulp, and measure to ensure 3 cups of juice for the marmalade.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Cut the peeled oranges in half and use a juicer or hand-squeeze to extract the juice. Strain the juice through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds and pulp. Measure the juice using a liquid measuring cup, ensuring exactly 3 cups. If short, juice additional oranges as needed.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

Review the remaining subgoals to ensure alignment with the sugar-free constraint and process efficiency. The next subgoal is to combine juice with peels and cook to thicken. Adjust this subgoal to emphasize monitoring thickness without sugar, as the lack of sugar may affect cooking time and consistency. Revised subgoal: Combine juice with peels and cook, monitoring closely to achieve a thick, spreadable consistency (potentially longer than 20 minutes due to no sugar).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Combine juice with peels and cook to achieve a thick consistency.
**How to Achieve**: Add the 3 cups of orange juice to the pot with softened peels and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens to a spreadable consistency, adjusting time as needed since no sugar is used.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pour the 3 cups of strained orange juice into the pot with the softened peels. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer. Stir frequently and cook for about 20–30 minutes, checking for a thick, spreadable consistency. Since no sugar is used, the thickening process may take longer; continue cooking until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that the marmalade has reached the desired thickness.
**How to Achieve**: Test the marmalade’s consistency to ensure it is thick and spreadable, suitable for a sugar-free product.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Spoon a small amount of the marmalade onto a chilled plate and let it sit for 1–2 minutes. Run a finger through it; if it holds its shape and doesn’t run, it’s thick enough. If too thin, continue simmering and retest every 5 minutes. Ensure no sugar has been added, maintaining the sugar-free requirement.
[/IMP]
