[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Watch the selected video tutorial to understand the steps.  
- **How to Achieve:** Play the selected video tutorial, take notes on key steps, and ensure comprehension of the process for creating a timeline in Excel.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Access the selected video tutorial on the chosen platform (e.g., YouTube). Watch the video attentively, pausing as needed to take notes on critical steps, such as selecting data, choosing chart types (e.g., Gantt chart or SmartArt), and formatting the timeline. Ensure a stable internet connection and a quiet environment for focus.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Prepare the necessary tools (Excel software, computer, etc.).  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to the steps and requirements for creating a timeline in Excel as outlined in the video tutorial.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
From the previous implementation step (Step 5), the video tutorial likely outlined steps such as selecting a dataset, using Excel’s chart tools (e.g., Gantt chart or SmartArt), and formatting the timeline. Key requirements include having Microsoft Excel installed and a dataset ready for the timeline. This information indicates that the necessary tools include a computer with Microsoft Excel and a prepared dataset.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Prepare the necessary tools (Excel software, computer, etc.).  
- **How to Achieve:** Ensure Microsoft Excel is installed on a computer, verify the software version supports timeline features, and prepare a sample dataset for the timeline.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that a computer with Microsoft Excel (preferably a recent version, e.g., Microsoft 365 or Excel 2019) is available and functional. If not installed, download and install Excel via Microsoft’s official website or a licensed source. Create a sample dataset in Excel with columns for events, start dates, and durations (e.g., in a table format). Save the file in an accessible location.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open Microsoft Excel and load the prepared dataset. Replay the video tutorial, pausing at each step to replicate actions in Excel. For example, if the video uses SmartArt, navigate to Insert > SmartArt > Process, select a timeline layout, and input the dataset. If using a Gantt chart, select the dataset, go to Insert > Chart > Bar, and format it to represent the timeline. Adjust formatting (e.g., colors, labels) as shown in the video to complete the timeline.

- **Current Goal:** Verify the created timeline meets the desired outcome.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the timeline against the video tutorial’s example and ensure it accurately represents the dataset with clear, readable formatting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the created timeline in Excel with the example shown in the video tutorial. Ensure all events, dates, and durations from the dataset are accurately represented. Verify that the timeline is visually clear, with readable labels, appropriate colors, and correct chronological order. Make adjustments (e.g., font size, alignment) if needed to match the desired outcome.
