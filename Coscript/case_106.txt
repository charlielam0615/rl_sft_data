### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a safe environment for practicing cartwheels. This will be achieved by placing a yoga or exercise mat in an open space to provide a soft, non-slip surface suitable for a 4-year-old.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place a yoga mat or exercise mat in a clear, open space free of obstacles. Ensure the area is spacious enough for a 4-year-old to move safely, and check that the mat is flat and secure to prevent slipping.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the safe environment is properly set up. This will be achieved by checking the mat’s placement and the surrounding area for safety, ensuring it’s suitable for a 4-year-old to practice cartwheels.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the yoga mat to confirm it is flat, non-slip, and securely placed. Verify that the surrounding area is free of sharp objects, furniture, or other hazards that could harm a 4-year-old during practice.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Teach 4-year-old daughter to perform a cartwheel.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up a safe environment for practicing cartwheels (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the child correctly to begin the cartwheel.  
  - Subgoal 3: Guide the child to place her hands correctly on the mat.  
  - Subgoal 4: Assist the child in performing the cartwheel motion.  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the child lands safely on both feet.  
**Current Goal**: Position the child correctly to begin the cartwheel.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the 4-year-old correctly to begin the cartwheel. This will be achieved by helping her stand on one end of the mat, ensuring she is balanced and ready to start.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gently guide the 4-year-old to stand on one end of the yoga mat. Ensure she is facing the direction of the cartwheel, with her feet together and body relaxed. Provide verbal encouragement to help her feel confident.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to guide the child to place her hands correctly on the mat. Retrieve information related to ensuring proper hand placement for a 4-year-old learning a cartwheel.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies instructing the child to place her hands on the mat (Step 3 of the provided script). This involves ensuring the 4-year-old places her hands shoulder-width apart on the mat to provide a stable base for the cartwheel. Previous steps confirm the mat is safe and the child is positioned correctly, which supports proper hand placement.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to guide the 4-year-old to place her hands correctly on the mat. This will be achieved by instructing her to place her hands shoulder-width apart on the mat and demonstrating the position if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Instruct the 4-year-old to bend forward and place both hands on the mat, shoulder-width apart. Demonstrate the hand placement yourself if she is unsure, and gently guide her hands to the correct position. Ensure she feels secure and balanced.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the 4-year-old’s hand placement is correct. This will be achieved by checking that her hands are shoulder-width apart and firmly on the mat, suitable for initiating a cartwheel.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the 4-year-old’s hands are placed shoulder-width apart on the mat and that her fingers are spread for stability. Ensure her body is aligned properly for the cartwheel and that she is not leaning too far forward or backward.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assist the 4-year-old in performing the cartwheel motion. This will be achieved by physically supporting her as she rotates over her hands, ensuring a safe and controlled motion.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stand beside the 4-year-old and support her by holding her waist or legs as she begins the cartwheel. Guide her body through the rotation, ensuring her legs go over her head in a smooth arc. Use verbal cues like “kick up” to encourage her and keep the motion controlled.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cartwheel motion is performed correctly. This will be achieved by checking that the 4-year-old’s body moves in a smooth arc and that she maintains balance during the rotation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe the 4-year-old’s cartwheel motion to ensure her legs follow a smooth arc over her head and that she maintains a straight body line. Provide gentle corrections if her form is off, and ensure she is not at risk of falling.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Support the 4-year-old’s waist or legs as she completes the cartwheel, guiding her to land gently on both feet on the mat. Ensure she lands with knees slightly bent to absorb the impact and maintain balance. Praise her effort to build confidence.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the 4-year-old lands safely on both feet. This will be achieved by checking that both feet land on the mat simultaneously and that she maintains balance after landing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that both of the 4-year-old’s feet land on the mat at the same time. Check that she is balanced and not wobbling after landing. If needed, provide feedback to help her adjust her landing technique for stability.  
[/IMP]
