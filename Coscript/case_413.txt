**Problem Restatement**: Create a plan to observe Autism Acceptance in April to support a friend with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), following the provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The plan must respect the constraint of supporting the friend directly and be completed by systematically applying one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of observing Autism Acceptance in April to support a friend into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  

The main goal is to support a friend with ASD during Autism Acceptance Month. To achieve this, I will create a structured plan by dividing the script into actionable subgoals:  
1. Understand the friend’s needs through conversation.  
2. Respect their diagnosis and coping mechanisms.  
3. Educate myself about autism and its specific impact on my friend.  
4. Provide direct support to the friend.  
5. Maintain an open-minded attitude without assumptions.  
6. Regularly check in with the friend.  
7. Advocate for the friend when needed.  
8. Exercise patience and avoid pressuring the friend to change.  
9. Celebrate successes and support during setbacks.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the friend’s needs through conversation (subgoal 1). This will be achieved by initiating a private, open-ended discussion with the friend to learn about their preferences and needs for support during April.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Schedule a comfortable, private setting to talk with my friend, such as over coffee or a video call, depending on their preference. Ask open-ended questions like, “What kind of support would mean the most to you this April?” or “Are there specific things you’d like me to know or do?” Listen actively without interrupting, and take notes if appropriate to remember key points. Ensure the conversation feels safe and non-judgmental, respecting their communication style.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the conversation (subgoal 1) was effective and respectful. This will be achieved by confirming with the friend that they felt heard and that the discussed needs are accurate.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
After the conversation, follow up with a message like, “I really appreciated our talk. Did I understand correctly that [summarize key points, e.g., you prefer low-key support or specific accommodations]?” Adjust my understanding based on their feedback. Ensure the friend feels their input was valued and clarify any misunderstandings.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Observe Autism Acceptance in April to support a friend.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the friend’s needs through conversation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Respect their ASD diagnosis and coping mechanisms (current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Educate myself about autism and its specific impact.  
  - Subgoal 4: Provide direct support to the friend.  
  - Subgoal 5: Maintain an open-minded attitude without assumptions.  
  - Subgoal 6: Regularly check in with the friend.  
  - Subgoal 7: Advocate for the friend when needed.  
  - Subgoal 8: Exercise patience and avoid pressuring change.  
  - Subgoal 9: Celebrate successes and support during setbacks.  

**Current Goal**: Respect the friend’s ASD diagnosis and coping mechanisms. This follows the successful completion of understanding their needs through conversation, which provides context for how to approach this respect.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to respect the friend’s ASD diagnosis and coping mechanisms (subgoal 2). This will be achieved by acknowledging their diagnosis in a supportive way and honoring their preferred coping strategies as shared in the conversation.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reflect on the friend’s shared needs (e.g., preferring quiet environments or specific routines). Avoid suggesting changes to their coping mechanisms unless they ask. For example, if they mention needing time alone to decompress, ensure I don’t pressure them to socialize. Express support by saying things like, “I’m here for you in whatever way works best for you.” Incorporate their preferences into plans for April, such as choosing sensory-friendly activities.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to educate myself about autism and its specific impact on my friend (subgoal 3). Retrieve past information from the conversation (subgoal 1) to guide this learning process.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
From the conversation in Step 2, my friend shared specific needs, such as [hypothetical example: preferring text communication over calls or needing predictable schedules]. They also mentioned challenges like sensory overload in crowded places. This information is relevant to learning about autism, particularly how it manifests for them. I will use these insights to focus my research on relevant aspects of ASD, such as sensory sensitivities or communication preferences.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to educate myself about autism and its specific impact on my friend (subgoal 3). This will be achieved by researching reputable sources on autism and tailoring my learning to the friend’s specific needs identified in the conversation.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Read materials from organizations like the Autism Society or Autistic Self Advocacy Network, focusing on topics like sensory processing or social communication relevant to my friend’s needs. Watch videos or read personal accounts from autistic individuals to understand their perspective. Take notes on how autism affects my friend specifically (e.g., sensory sensitivities) and how I can support them (e.g., suggesting calm environments). If needed, ask my friend for recommended resources to ensure accuracy.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the remaining subgoals to ensure they align with the friend’s specific needs and my recent learning about autism.  

The original subgoals 4–9 are still relevant but can be tailored based on insights from the conversation and research. Adjusted subgoals:  
- Subgoal 4: Offer direct support tailored to the friend’s preferences (e.g., text check-ins if they prefer).  
- Subgoal 5: Maintain an open mind, avoiding assumptions about their abilities or needs.  
- Subgoal 6: Check in regularly using their preferred communication method.  
- Subgoal 7: Advocate for the friend in situations they identify as challenging (e.g., sensory-overload settings).  
- Subgoal 8: Be patient, respecting their pace and boundaries.  
- Subgoal 9: Celebrate successes and support setbacks in ways they find meaningful (e.g., low-key acknowledgment).  
These adjustments ensure the plan remains personalized and effective.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to offer direct support to the friend (subgoal 4). This will be achieved by providing practical help based on their expressed needs and my autism research.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Based on the friend’s preferences (e.g., text communication, avoiding crowded places), offer specific support like helping plan a sensory-friendly outing in April or sending encouraging messages. For example, suggest a quiet park visit for Autism Acceptance Month or assist with a task they find overwhelming. Ensure all support is directed to them, not caregivers, and confirm it aligns with their needs by asking, “Would this be helpful for you?”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maintain an open mind and avoid assumptions (subgoal 5). This will be achieved by consciously reflecting on my interactions and ensuring I don’t impose expectations on my friend’s behavior or abilities.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Before and during interactions, remind myself that autism affects everyone differently, and my friend’s needs may vary day-to-day. Avoid assuming they want to socialize or handle situations like others. If unsure, ask clarifying questions like, “Is this a good time to talk?” or “Would you prefer a different approach?” Use insights from my research to recognize diverse autistic experiences and stay flexible in my support.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check in regularly with the friend, especially during difficult times (subgoal 6). This will be achieved by scheduling consistent, low-pressure check-ins using their preferred communication method.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set a calendar reminder to check in weekly during April via text (or their preferred method). Send brief, supportive messages like, “Hey, just checking in—how’s your week going?” Be attentive to signs of difficult times (e.g., if they mention stress) and offer extra support, such as listening or suggesting a calming activity they enjoy. Respect their response time and avoid pushing for immediate replies.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to advocate for the friend when needed (subgoal 7). This will be achieved by stepping in to support them in situations they find challenging, as identified in our conversation.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
If my friend faces a challenging situation (e.g., a sensory-overloading event or misunderstanding with others), offer to advocate by explaining their needs to others (with their permission). For example, if we’re at an Autism Acceptance event and they’re overwhelmed, I could discreetly ask organizers for a quieter space. Always check with them first, saying, “Would you like me to help explain this to anyone?” to ensure they’re comfortable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to be patient and avoid pressuring the friend to change (subgoal 8). This will be achieved by respecting their pace and boundaries in all interactions.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In all interactions, allow my friend to set the pace, whether in conversations, activities, or responses. If they decline an invitation or need time alone, respond positively, like, “No worries, I’m here whenever you’re ready.” Avoid suggesting they “try harder” to adapt to neurotypical norms. Reflect on my research to reinforce that their behaviors are valid responses to their experiences.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to celebrate the friend’s successes and support them during setbacks (subgoal 9). This will be achieved by acknowledging their achievements in a way they find meaningful and offering support during challenges.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
When my friend shares a success (e.g., completing a project), celebrate in a low-key, personalized way, like sending a congratulatory text or small gesture they appreciate. During setbacks (e.g., a tough day), offer support like, “I’m here if you want to talk or need a break together.” Tailor my response to their preferences, avoiding over-the-top reactions that might overwhelm them.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Review the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been addressed and the main goal is complete.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Observe Autism Acceptance in April to support a friend (complete).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the friend’s needs through conversation (complete).
