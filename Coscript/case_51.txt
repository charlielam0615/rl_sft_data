- Subgoal 1: Set up a fun video chat background.  
- Subgoal 2: Wear a silly costume or prop.  
- Subgoal 3: Perform a funny dance or song.  
- Subgoal 4: Share a funny meme or joke.  
- Subgoal 5: Use facial expressions to elicit laughter.

**Track Goals**  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Make someone smile through a video chat.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up a fun video chat background.  
  - Subgoal 2: Wear a silly costume or prop.  
  - Subgoal 3: Perform a funny dance or song.  
  - Subgoal 4: Share a funny meme or joke.  
  - Subgoal 5: Use facial expressions to elicit laughter.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a fun video chat background. This will be achieved by selecting a virtual background that is colorful, humorous, or engaging, compatible with the video chat platform (e.g., Zoom, Teams).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, select a virtual background for the video chat. Check the platform’s background options or upload a custom image, such as a cartoonish scene, a funny meme background, or a playful setting like a beach with animated elements. Test the background to ensure it displays correctly and is not distracting. For example, a background with dancing cats or a quirky animated scene can set a lighthearted tone.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a fun video chat background. Validate that the chosen background is functional, visible, and appropriate for eliciting a smile.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the selected background during a mock video call to confirm it appears clearly without technical issues (e.g., green screen artifacts). Ensure the background aligns with the goal of being fun and engaging, such as a vibrant cartoon or humorous theme, and does not obscure the user’s face or appear unprofessional. Adjust settings if needed to optimize visibility.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wear a silly costume or prop. This will be achieved by selecting an item that is humorous and visually striking, such as a funny hat, oversized glasses, or a costume piece, to wear during the video chat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a silly prop or costume, such as a clown wig, a pirate hat, or novelty glasses with a fake nose. Ensure the item is comfortable and visible on camera. Test the prop in front of the camera to confirm it enhances the humorous effect without obstructing the view or distracting from the interaction. For example, a bright, oversized bow tie could spark laughter.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform a funny dance or sing a silly song. This will be achieved by preparing a short, humorous performance, such as a simple dance move or a lighthearted song, to entertain during the video chat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a short, silly performance, such as a 10-second exaggerated dance (e.g., the floss or a goofy chicken dance) or a humorous song (e.g., singing “Happy Birthday” in a cartoonish voice). Practice the performance to ensure it’s smooth and funny. Test it on camera to confirm it’s visible and engaging, keeping the tone playful to elicit a smile.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to share a funny meme or joke. Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure the meme or joke aligns with the humorous tone established by the background, costume, and performance.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**  
Previous steps established a playful tone with a fun background (e.g., dancing cats), a silly prop (e.g., clown wig), and a humorous performance (e.g., goofy dance). The meme or joke should be lighthearted and universally funny, avoiding offensive content, to maintain the positive, smile-inducing atmosphere.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to share a funny meme or joke. This will be achieved by selecting a clean, humorous meme or joke and sharing it via screen share or verbally during the video chat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a simple, funny meme (e.g., a dog with a goofy caption like “When you realize it’s Friday!”) or a short joke (e.g., “Why did the scarecrow become a motivational speaker? Because he was outstanding in his field!”). Prepare to share the meme via screen share or tell the joke clearly on the call. Test the delivery to ensure clarity and timing for maximum humor.

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use facial expressions to elicit laughter. This will be achieved by practicing exaggerated, humorous facial expressions to perform during the video chat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Practice a series of funny facial expressions, such as winking dramatically, puffing out cheeks, or raising one eyebrow comically. Test these expressions on camera to ensure they are visible and amusing. Perform them during the video chat, spacing them out to maintain engagement, and combine with playful banter to enhance the effect.

  - Subgoal 1: Set up a fun video chat background (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Wear a silly costume or prop (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Perform a funny dance or song (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Share a funny meme or joke (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Use facial expressions to elicit laughter (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The main goal of making someone smile through a video chat has been addressed by completing all planned subgoals.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The final goal is to make someone smile through a video chat. Validate that all subgoals were executed effectively and contributed to the main goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the execution of all subgoals: a fun background was set, a silly prop was worn, a humorous performance was delivered, a funny meme or joke was shared, and expressive facial gestures were used. Confirm that these actions were performed during the video chat and assess their likely impact on making the person smile, based on the playful and engaging tone maintained throughout. If feedback is available (e.g., the person laughed), note it as validation. If not, assume the combination of humorous elements likely achieved the goal.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
All subgoals from the provided script have been completed, and the main goal of making someone smile through a video chat has been addressed through a structured plan using meta-cognitive actions. The process involved planning subgoals, implementing each step, reviewing progress, and validating outcomes, ensuring a cohesive and humorous video chat experience.
