**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of finding the third angle of a triangle given two angles (30° and 60°), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the key property of triangles relevant to angle calculation.  
2. Apply this property to calculate the third angle.  
3. Verify the result aligns with the properties of a triangle.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the key property of triangles relevant to angle calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Recall the geometric rule that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180°. This property allows us to calculate the third angle by subtracting the known angles from 180°.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The key property is that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°. This rule applies to all triangles and will be used to find the third angle.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the third angle using the sum of angles property.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the given angles (30° and 60°) from 180° to find the third angle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the property that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°:  
Third angle = 180° - 30° - 60° = 90°.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the calculated third angle (90°) is valid for the triangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the sum of all angles (30°, 60°, 90°) equals 180° and ensure all angles are positive, as required for a valid triangle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum of angles: 30° + 60° + 90° = 180°.  
All angles (30°, 60°, 90°) are positive, and their sum equals 180°, confirming the result is valid for a triangle.
