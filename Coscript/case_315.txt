### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan to turn off the "Show Previews" feature for Messages on an iPhone by following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set framework. The script includes four steps: opening the iPhone's Settings, tapping Notifications, scrolling to and tapping Messages, and toggling off the Show Previews option. Each step must be addressed using one meta-cognitive action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of turning off "Show Previews" into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Open the iPhone's Settings app.  
- Subgoal 2: Navigate to the Notifications section.  
- Subgoal 3: Access the Messages settings.  
- Subgoal 4: Disable the Show Previews feature by toggling it off.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the iPhone's Settings app. This will be achieved by locating and tapping the Settings app icon on the iPhone's home screen.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the first subgoal, locate the Settings app on the iPhone's home screen, which is typically represented by a gear icon, and tap it to open the app. This provides access to the iPhone's configuration options.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Turn off "Show Previews" for Messages.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the iPhone's Settings app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the Notifications section (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the Messages settings.  
  - Subgoal 4: Disable the Show Previews feature.  
**Current Goal**: Navigate to the Notifications section.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the Notifications section. This will be achieved by locating and tapping the "Notifications" option within the Settings app.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Settings app, scroll through the list of options to find "Notifications" and tap it to access the Notifications settings menu.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the Messages settings. This will be achieved by scrolling through the Notifications menu to find and tap the "Messages" option.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Notifications menu, scroll down to locate the "Messages" option, which corresponds to the Messages app, and tap it to enter the Messages-specific notification settings.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to disable the Show Previews feature. This will be achieved by locating the "Show Previews" toggle in the Messages settings and tapping it to turn it off.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Messages notification settings, find the "Show Previews" option, which has a toggle next to it. Tap the toggle to switch it to the "Off" position, ensuring that message previews are no longer displayed on the lock screen or in notifications.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the Show Previews feature is turned off. This will be achieved by checking the toggle state and testing the behavior of Messages notifications.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the "Show Previews" toggle in the Messages settings is in the "Off" position (greyed out). To further validate, send a test message to the iPhone and check the lock screen or notification banner to ensure that the message content is not displayed, only the sender's name or a generic notification.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Turn off "Show Previews" for Messages (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the iPhone's Settings app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the Notifications section (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the Messages settings (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Disable the Show Previews feature (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, and the main goal is achieved).  
The plan has been fully executed, and the Show Previews feature is confirmed to be turned off.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Summary
The plan to turn off the "Show Previews" feature for Messages on an iPhone has been completed using the meta-cognitive action set. The process involved breaking down the task into subgoals, implementing each step as per the script, validating the outcome, and tracking progress to ensure all goals were met. The final validation confirms that the feature is disabled, completing the task.
