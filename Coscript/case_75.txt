### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of cleaning a heavily dirty glass windshield into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals:  
1. Remove loose dirt by pre-rinsing the windshield.  
2. Apply a series of specialized glass cleaners (vinegar, ammonia, alcohol, soap, detergent) to tackle persistent dirt.  
3. Rinse off all cleaning agents.  
4. Dry the windshield to prevent streaks.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus.  
- **Main Goal**: Clean a heavily dirty glass windshield.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Remove loose dirt by pre-rinsing the windshield.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Apply specialized glass cleaners (vinegar, ammonia, alcohol, soap, detergent).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Rinse off all cleaning agents.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Dry the windshield to prevent streaks.  
**Current Goal**: Remove loose dirt by pre-rinsing the windshield.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is established based on the forward subgoaling in Step 1. The current focus is on pre-rinsing to remove loose dirt, which aligns with the first step of the provided script. No prior implementation steps have occurred, so no additional review is needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove loose dirt by pre-rinsing the windshield. This will be achieved by using water to loosen and wash away surface dirt and debris, preparing the windshield for deeper cleaning.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Spray or pour water over the entire windshield using a hose or bucket, ensuring all areas with visible dirt are thoroughly wetted. Use a soft sponge or cloth to gently scrub areas with heavy dirt to dislodge loose particles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the pre-rinse effectively removed loose dirt. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the windshield for remaining loose debris and ensuring the surface is ready for the application of glass cleaners.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the windshield under good lighting to check for loose dirt or debris. If significant loose dirt remains, repeat the pre-rinse process. Confirm that the surface feels relatively smooth and free of gritty particles before proceeding to apply glass cleaners.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the validation, refine the subgoals for applying specialized cleaners to address the heavy dirt constraint. Adjusted subgoals for Subgoal 2:  
- Apply vinegar-based cleaner to break down organic dirt.  
- Apply ammonia-based cleaner to tackle greasy residues.  
- Apply alcohol-based cleaner for stubborn stains.  
- Apply soap-based cleaner for general grime.  
- Apply detergent-based cleaner for remaining tough dirt.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

  - **Subgoal 1**: Remove loose dirt by pre-rinsing the windshield (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Apply specialized glass cleaners.  
    - Apply vinegar-based cleaner to break down organic dirt.  
    - Apply ammonia-based cleaner to tackle greasy residues.  
    - Apply alcohol-based cleaner for stubborn stains.  
    - Apply soap-based cleaner for general grime.  
    - Apply detergent-based cleaner for remaining tough dirt.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Rinse off all cleaning agents.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Dry the windshield to prevent streaks.  
**Current Goal**: Apply vinegar-based cleaner to break down organic dirt.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals from Step 5. Subgoal 1 (pre-rinse) is complete based on the validation in Step 4. The current focus is on the first cleaner (vinegar-based) to address organic dirt, as per the script’s second step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply a vinegar-based glass cleaner to break down organic dirt. This will be achieved by spraying the cleaner and wiping the windshield to remove organic residues like bug splatter or tree sap.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Spray a vinegar-based glass cleaner evenly across the windshield. Let it sit for 1–2 minutes to loosen organic dirt. Use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe the surface in circular motions, focusing on areas with visible organic residues.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the vinegar-based cleaner effectively removed organic dirt. This will be achieved by inspecting the windshield for remaining organic residues and ensuring the surface is ready for the next cleaner.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the windshield for remaining bug splatter, tree sap, or other organic dirt. If residues persist, reapply the vinegar-based cleaner and wipe again. Confirm the surface is free of organic dirt before moving to the ammonia-based cleaner.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Spray an ammonia-based glass cleaner across the windshield. Allow it to sit for 1 minute to break down greasy residues. Wipe the surface with a clean microfiber cloth in straight lines to avoid streaking, focusing on areas with oily buildup.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the ammonia-based cleaner effectively removed greasy residues. This will be achieved by checking the windshield for remaining greasy spots and ensuring readiness for the next cleaner.
