### Step 3: Implement Organized Planner System
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Maintain an organized planner to manage time and tasks effectively.  
- **How to Achieve:** Select a planner tool (digital or physical), input all academic deadlines, class schedules, and study sessions, and review/update it daily to stay on track.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose a digital planner app like Google Calendar or a physical planner notebook. Input all course schedules, assignment due dates, and exam dates from syllabi. Allocate specific times for studying, extracurricular activities, and rest. Set a daily 10-minute review to update the planner and ensure no tasks are missed. Commit to checking the planner every morning to prioritize tasks.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate Planner System Effectiveness
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the planner system is effective in managing time and tasks.  
- **How to Achieve:** Assess whether the planner is helping meet deadlines and maintain a balanced schedule by reviewing task completion and stress levels after one month.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After one month of using the planner, evaluate its effectiveness. Check if all assignments were submitted on time and if study sessions were adequately planned. Reflect on whether the schedule feels manageable or overwhelming. If issues arise, identify specific problems (e.g., forgetting to check the planner) and plan adjustments, such as setting reminders or simplifying the layout.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Planner System if Needed
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the validation, adjust the planner system if it’s not fully effective. For example, switch to a different app, simplify the schedule, or add reminders to ensure consistent use.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Track Updated Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**  
Update the goal hierarchy to reflect any adjustments made to the planner system and shift focus to the next subgoal.  

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Get Good Grades in College  
  - Subgoal 1: Maintain an organized planner to manage time and tasks effectively (adjusted if needed, e.g., added reminders or switched tools).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and adopt an effective study method tailored to personal learning style. (*Current Focus*)  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure sufficient sleep to support cognitive performance.  
  - Subgoal 4: Utilize office hours to clarify doubts and understand professors’ expectations.  
  - Subgoal 5: Begin exam preparation early, starting from syllabus release.  
  - Subgoal 6: Build a supportive network of academically focused friends.  
  - Subgoal 7: Prioritize mental and emotional well-being to sustain academic performance.  

**Current Goal:** Identify and adopt an effective study method tailored to personal learning style.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Implement Study Method Exploration
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify and adopt an effective study method tailored to personal learning style.  
- **How to Achieve:** Experiment with different study techniques (e.g., flashcards, mind maps, active recall) over a few weeks, assess which method improves retention and understanding, and adopt the most effective one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test three study methods over three weeks: Week 1, use flashcards for key concepts; Week 2, create mind maps to connect ideas; Week 3, practice active recall by self-quizzing. Track performance by noting comprehension and quiz results after each method. Choose the method that yields the best retention and understanding, and integrate it into regular study sessions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Information on Study Methods
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify and adopt an effective study method.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information on the effectiveness of study methods tested in Step 7 to inform adoption.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recall Info**  
From Step 7, three study methods were tested: flashcards, mind maps, and active recall. Flashcards helped with memorization but were time-intensive. Mind maps improved conceptual understanding but were less effective for details. Active recall led to the highest retention and quiz performance. This suggests active recall is likely the most effective method for this goal.  
[/REVIEW]
