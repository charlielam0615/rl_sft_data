  - Subgoal 4: Maintain patience and persistence (Not started: Step 7).  
**Current Goal**: Subgoal 2 (Use the spray bottle during biting incidents).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use the spray bottle during biting incidents.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow Step 4 of the script by yelping when the puppy bites and immediately spraying its face with the prepared solution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
When the puppy bites:  
1. Emit a sharp, high-pitched yelp to mimic a pain response, signaling to the puppy that biting is undesirable.  
2. Immediately use the prepared spray bottle to gently squirt a small amount of the lemon water or vinegar solution toward the puppy’s face, avoiding the eyes.  
This action associates biting with an unpleasant but safe consequence.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the spray bottle technique is applied correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the yelp and spray are timed correctly and that the spray is gentle and safe, targeting the puppy’s face without causing harm.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the technique:  
1. Confirm the yelp is loud and immediate upon biting to effectively communicate discomfort.  
2. Verify the spray bottle is set to a gentle mist, not a strong stream, and the solution is directed at the puppy’s face (avoiding eyes) to ensure safety.  
3. Observe the puppy’s reaction: it should show mild discomfort (e.g., pausing or backing away) without signs of distress or fear.  
If the puppy does not respond or reacts excessively, adjust the amount of lemon juice/vinegar or consult a professional trainer.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure consistent application of the spray bottle technique.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow Steps 5-6 of the script by repeating the yelp-and-spray process every time the puppy bites and maintaining consistency in its use.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To ensure consistency:  
1. Every time the puppy bites, respond with a yelp followed by a gentle spray, as practiced in Subgoal 2, without exception.  
2. Keep the spray bottle accessible during interactions with the puppy to ensure immediate response to biting.  
3. Apply the technique consistently across all household members or caregivers to reinforce the same message to the puppy.  
Consistency strengthens the puppy’s association between biting and the unpleasant spray.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure consistent application (Subgoal 3).  
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to the importance of consistency in puppy training and the use of the spray bottle.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 7 [IMP]: Consistency requires applying the yelp-and-spray technique every time the puppy bites and ensuring all caregivers use the same approach.  
- From Step 4 [IMP]: The yelp-and-spray action associates biting with an unpleasant consequence, which relies on repeated application to be effective.  
- From Step 5 [IMP]: Validation confirmed the technique must be gentle and correctly timed to avoid distress, supporting the need for consistent, careful application.  
Summary: Consistency in using the spray bottle (yelp and spray every time the puppy bites, by all caregivers) is critical to reinforce the association between biting and the unpleasant consequence, ensuring effective training.  
[/REVIEW]
