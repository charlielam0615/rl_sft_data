### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for transporting breast milk for moms who are pumping, adhering to the provided script and constraints. The script outlines nine specific steps to ensure the breast milk is transported safely and effectively. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action from the set and following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of transporting breast milk into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to safely transport breast milk, and the subgoals align with the script steps:  
1. Ensure the milk is fresh.  
2. Prepare appropriate containers.  
3. Use a functional ice cooler.  
4. Place ice at the bottom of the cooler.  
5. Pack the breast milk securely.  
6. Add more ice to the cooler.  
7. Securely close the cooler.  
8. Pack the cooler in a cardboard box.  
9. Seal the box for transport.  
These subgoals will guide the subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Safely transport breast milk for moms who are pumping.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Ensure the milk is fresh.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Prepare appropriate containers.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Use a functional ice cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Place ice at the bottom of the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Pack the breast milk securely.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Add more ice to the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Securely close the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Pack the cooler in a cardboard box.  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Seal the box for transport.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the milk is fresh (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the milk is fresh.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the breast milk is recently pumped and stored properly to maintain freshness before packing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of ensuring the milk is fresh, confirm that the breast milk was pumped within the last 24 hours and has been stored at a temperature below 4°C (39°F) in a refrigerator or freezer. Check the pumping date and time labels on the milk containers. If the milk has been stored longer than recommended guidelines (e.g., 4 days in the refrigerator or 6 months in the freezer), discard it and use only freshly pumped milk for transport.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the milk is fresh.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the validity of the milk’s freshness by reviewing storage conditions and guidelines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify that the breast milk meets freshness standards by cross-checking the storage duration against guidelines: up to 4 days in a refrigerator (4°C or lower) or 6 months in a standard freezer (-18°C or lower). Inspect the milk for any signs of spoilage, such as an unusual odor or discoloration. Confirm that storage containers are clean and properly sealed to prevent contamination.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare appropriate containers.  
- **How to Achieve**: Select and prepare containers suitable for storing and transporting breast milk.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose BPA-free, sterile breast milk storage bags or bottles designed for breast milk. Ensure containers are clean, dry, and sealed tightly to prevent leaks. Label each container with the date and time of pumping to track freshness during transport.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Safely transport breast milk for moms who are pumping.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Ensure the milk is fresh (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Prepare appropriate containers (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Use a functional ice cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Place ice at the bottom of the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Pack the breast milk securely.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Add more ice to the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Securely close the cooler.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Pack the cooler in a cardboard box.  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Seal the box for transport.  
**Current Goal**: Use a functional ice cooler (Subgoal 3).  
The completed subgoals (1 and 2) confirm that the milk is fresh and stored in appropriate containers.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Use a functional ice cooler.  
- **How to Achieve**: Select and inspect an ice cooler to ensure it is in good condition for transport.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select a high-quality ice cooler with good insulation to maintain a cold temperature. Inspect the cooler for any cracks, broken seals, or damage that could compromise its ability to keep the milk cold. Ensure the cooler is clean and odor-free before use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Place ice at the bottom of the cooler.  
- **How to Achieve**: Add a layer of ice to the bottom of the cooler to create a cold base for the breast milk.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place a layer of ice packs or crushed ice at the bottom of the cooler, ensuring even coverage. Use enough ice to maintain a temperature below 4°C throughout the transport duration. Avoid loose ice if it risks leaking and contaminating the milk containers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Pack the breast milk securely.  
- **How to Achieve**: Arrange the breast milk containers in the cooler to ensure they are secure and protected.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Carefully place the labeled breast milk containers upright in the cooler on top of the ice layer. Ensure containers are tightly packed to prevent movement during transport. Use padding, such as bubble wrap or cloth, to fill any gaps and protect the containers from shifting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of packing the breast milk securely, focusing on ensuring the milk remains safe and uncontaminated.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 3 and 4 confirmed the milk is fresh and stored below 4°C, with containers labeled for tracking.  
- Step 5 ensured the use of sterile, BPA-free containers to prevent contamination.  
- Step 7 verified the cooler is functional and clean.  
- Step 8 established a cold base with ice packs or crushed ice.  
This information confirms that the milk is fresh, stored in appropriate containers, and placed in a clean, insulated cooler with a cold base, ensuring secure packing conditions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Fill the cooler with more ice.  
- **How to Achieve**: Add additional ice to the cooler to maintain a consistently cold environment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Add more ice packs or crushed ice around and on top of the breast milk containers, ensuring all gaps are filled to maintain a temperature below 4°C. If using loose ice, place it in sealed bags to prevent leaks. Ensure the ice does not crush or damage the containers.  
[/IMP]
