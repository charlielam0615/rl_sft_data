**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for making handprint butterflies with parents, following a provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The constraint is that the activity must involve parents. The script includes seven steps: cutting out handprints, gluing handprints at the palms, gluing wings together, cutting an oval for the body, making antennae with a pipe cleaner, decorating the wings, and letting the butterfly dry. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, with content organized in [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as per the provided guidelines.

  - Subgoal 1: Cut out two handprints from construction paper with parental assistance.  
  - Subgoal 2: Glue the handprints together at the palms.  
  - Subgoal 3: Glue the wings together to form the butterfly shape.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut a skinny oval for the butterfly’s body.  
  - Subgoal 5: Create antennae using a pipe cleaner.  
  - Subgoal 6: Decorate the butterfly wings.  
  - Subgoal 7: Allow the butterfly to dry completely.  
**Current Goal**: Cut out two handprints from construction paper with parental assistance.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut out two handprints from construction paper with parental assistance. This will be achieved by gathering materials (construction paper, scissors, pencil) and having the parent assist the child in tracing and cutting the handprints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather construction paper, a pencil, and child-safe scissors. Have the child place their hand on the paper, and with the parent’s guidance, trace the hand twice to create two handprint shapes. The parent should assist or perform the cutting to ensure safety and accuracy, resulting in two handprint cutouts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the handprints are correctly cut out. Validate by checking that two handprints are cut from construction paper and are roughly symmetrical.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the two handprint cutouts to confirm they are properly shaped, with clear finger outlines and no significant tears. Verify that the parent was involved in the cutting process to meet the constraint. If the handprints are uneven or damaged, consider recutting with parental assistance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to glue the handprints together at the palms. This will be achieved by applying glue to the palm area of one handprint and pressing it against the other, with parental help to ensure proper alignment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Provide glue (e.g., a glue stick or liquid glue) and position the two handprints so the palms overlap slightly, resembling butterfly wings. The parent should guide the child in applying glue to one palm and pressing the handprints together firmly, ensuring they stick without excess glue spillage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure alignment with the script and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

- Main Goal: Make handprint butterflies with parents.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut out two handprints from construction paper with parental assistance (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Glue the handprints together at the palms (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Glue the wings together to form the butterfly shape.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut a skinny oval for the butterfly’s body.  
  - Subgoal 5: Create antennae using a pipe cleaner.  
  - Subgoal 6: Decorate the butterfly wings.  
  - Subgoal 7: Allow the butterfly to dry completely.  
**Current Goal**: Glue the wings together to form the butterfly shape.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to glue the wings together to form the butterfly shape. This will be achieved by applying glue to secure the handprints in a way that mimics butterfly wings, with parental assistance for precision.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With the handprints already glued at the palms, apply additional glue if needed to reinforce the connection or adjust the angle of the handprints to resemble spread butterfly wings. The parent should assist the child in aligning the wings symmetrically and pressing them together to ensure a stable structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut a skinny oval for the butterfly’s body. This will be achieved by selecting black or brown construction paper and having the parent assist the child in cutting a skinny oval shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select black or brown construction paper. Have the child draw a skinny oval (approximately 3-4 inches long) with a pencil, guided by the parent. The parent should assist or perform the cutting to create a smooth oval shape for the butterfly’s body.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create antennae using a pipe cleaner. Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure all necessary components (handprints, body) are ready before proceeding.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Create antennae using a pipe cleaner.  
**Relevant Information**:  
- Step 3 and 4 confirmed two handprints were cut from construction paper with parental assistance.  
- Step 5 and 7 confirmed the handprints were glued together to form the butterfly wings.  
- Step 8 confirmed a skinny oval was cut for the body.  
These components are ready, and the next step involves using a pipe cleaner to form antennae, with parental guidance to ensure safety and proper attachment.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create antennae using a pipe cleaner. This will be achieved by cutting and shaping a pipe cleaner into two antennae and attaching them to the butterfly’s body, with parental assistance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a pipe cleaner (preferably black or brown to match the body). The parent should help the child cut the pipe cleaner into two equal pieces (about 2-3 inches each) and bend each piece into a slight curve or spiral to resemble antennae. Attach the antennae to the top of the oval body using glue, with the parent ensuring secure attachment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decorate the butterfly wings. This will be achieved by using craft materials like markers, stickers, or glitter, with parental supervision to enhance creativity and safety.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather decorating materials such as markers, stickers, glitter, or paint. The child, with parental guidance, should decorate the handprint wings with colorful patterns or designs. The parent can suggest symmetrical patterns or assist with applying materials like glitter to ensure a neat appearance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the butterfly is properly assembled and decorated. Validate by checking that all components (wings, body, antennae, decorations) are securely attached and visually appealing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the butterfly to confirm the handprints are glued securely, the oval body is attached, the antennae are in place, and the decorations are complete. Ensure the parent was involved in each step per the constraint. If any part is loose or incomplete, have the parent assist the child in fixing it (e.g., re-gluing or adding more decorations).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to let the butterfly dry completely. This will be achieved by placing the butterfly in a safe, dry location and waiting for the glue and decorations to set, with parental oversight.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the completed butterfly on a flat, dry surface in a well-ventilated area. The parent should ensure the child does not disturb the butterfly while it dries (typically 1-2 hours for glue, longer for paint or glitter glue). Check periodically to confirm the butterfly is fully dry and stable.  
[/IMP]
