### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pump and store an extra bottle of breast milk before bed. This will be achieved by using a breast pump to express milk in the evening and storing it safely in the refrigerator.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, set up a breast pump in a comfortable, quiet space before bedtime (e.g., 8-9 PM). Pump for 15-20 minutes to express enough milk for one feeding (typically 3-5 ounces, depending on the baby’s age and needs). Transfer the milk to a clean, sterile bottle or breast milk storage bag, label it with the date and time, and place it in the refrigerator at 4°C or lower to ensure freshness for the night feed.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the extra bottle of breast milk is properly pumped and stored. This will be achieved by checking the quantity and storage conditions of the milk.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the pumped milk is sufficient (3-5 ounces, based on the baby’s typical feed). Check that the milk is stored in a sterile container, properly labeled, and placed in the refrigerator at the correct temperature (4°C or lower). Ensure the storage container is sealed to prevent contamination. If the quantity or storage conditions are inadequate, pump additional milk or adjust storage as needed.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Track Goals**: Review the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus.  

- **Goal**: Drop a night feed by pumping an extra bottle before bed.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Pump and store an extra bottle of breast milk before bed to prepare for the night feed (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Use the extra bottle to replace or reduce breastfeeding during the night feed.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Support the baby’s comfort during and after the night feed (burping, soothing).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Involve the partner to assist with comforting the baby at night.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Monitor progress and decide when to fully eliminate the night feed.  

**Current Goal**: Use the extra bottle to replace or reduce breastfeeding during the night feed.

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the extra bottle to replace or reduce breastfeeding during the night feed. This will be achieved by feeding the baby the stored milk during the night feeding session and reducing the duration of breastfeeding.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
When the baby wakes for the night feed (e.g., 1-2 AM), retrieve the stored bottle from the refrigerator. Warm the milk to body temperature (about 37°C) using a bottle warmer or warm water bath. Feed the baby the bottle, ensuring they consume the full amount or as much as they need. If the baby still requires breastfeeding after the bottle, reduce the breastfeeding time by 5-10 minutes compared to usual to begin weaning from the night feed.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to support the baby’s comfort during and after the night feed. This will be achieved by burping and soothing the baby to ensure they settle back to sleep.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After feeding the baby the bottle (and any reduced breastfeeding), hold the baby upright and gently pat their back for 5-10 minutes to burp them, preventing discomfort from gas. If the baby is fussy or has difficulty settling, soothe them using techniques such as rocking, swaddling, or offering a pacifier to help them return to sleep.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to involve the partner to assist with comforting the baby at night. Retrieve information related to partner involvement from previous steps and the provided script.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**: The script includes step 7: “Instruct your partner to comfort the baby at night.” From the goal hierarchy (Step 2 and Step 5), Subgoal 4 specifies involving the partner to assist with comforting the baby at night. No prior steps have detailed partner involvement, so this step focuses on initiating their role in the plan.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to involve the partner to assist with comforting the baby at night. This will be achieved by instructing the partner to take on soothing or feeding tasks during the night feed.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Discuss with the partner before bedtime to assign them the role of comforting the baby during the night feed. Instruct them to soothe the baby after the bottle feed (e.g., rocking, singing, or holding) or to handle the bottle feeding if they are comfortable. Ensure they know the soothing techniques (from Step 7) and the location of the stored milk. Provide clear guidance to maintain consistency in the baby’s routine.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the progress of dropping the night feed and adjust subgoals to focus on monitoring and deciding when to fully eliminate the night feed.  

- **Adjusted Subgoal 5**: Monitor the baby’s response to the reduced night feed over 3-5 nights and decide whether to fully eliminate breastfeeding at night based on their feeding patterns and sleep behavior.  
- **New Subgoal 6**: Gradually eliminate the night feed by further reducing breastfeeding time or transitioning fully to bottle feeding, if appropriate.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 11: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Track Goals**: Update and review the hierarchy of goals to reflect adjustments.  

- **Goal**: Drop a night feed by pumping an extra bottle before bed.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Pump and store an extra bottle of breast milk before bed to prepare for the night feed (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Use the extra bottle to replace or reduce breastfeeding during the night feed (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Support the baby’s comfort during and after the night feed (burping, soothing) (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Involve the partner to assist with comforting the baby at night (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Monitor the baby’s response to the reduced night feed over 3-5 nights and decide whether to fully eliminate breastfeeding at night.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Gradually eliminate the night feed by further reducing breastfeeding time or transitioning fully to bottle feeding, if appropriate.  

**Current Goal**: Monitor the baby’s response to the reduced night feed over 3-5 nights and decide whether to fully eliminate breastfeeding at night.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor the baby’s response to the reduced night feed over 3-5 nights and decide whether to fully eliminate breastfeeding at night. This will be achieved by observing the baby’s feeding and sleep patterns and assessing readiness to drop the feed.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Over the next 3-5 nights, track the baby’s behavior during the night feed, noting how much of the bottle they consume, how long they breastfeed (if at all), and how easily they settle back to sleep. Record any signs of hunger or distress. If the baby consistently consumes the bottle and settles well with minimal or no breastfeeding, consider fully eliminating the night breastfeeding session. If the baby shows signs of needing breastfeeding, continue reducing the breastfeeding time gradually (e.g., by 2-3 minutes per night).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the decision to fully eliminate the night feed is appropriate. This will be achieved by reviewing the baby’s response data and consulting guidelines for dropping night feeds.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the notes from the 3-5 nights of monitoring (from Step 12). Check if the baby is consistently satisfied with the bottle feed, sleeping well, and showing no signs of hunger or distress. Cross-reference with general guidelines: babies typically drop night feeds between 6-12 months if they are gaining weight appropriately and consuming enough during the day. If the baby is not ready (e.g., still hungry or unsettled), continue the reduced breastfeeding schedule. If ready, proceed to eliminate the night breastfeeding session entirely, using only the bottle if needed.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Backtrack (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
If the baby is not ready to fully drop the night feed, return to the earlier state of reducing breastfeeding time and involving the partner to maintain progress toward the goal.  

- **Revised Subgoal 2**: Continue using the extra bottle and further reduce breastfeeding time by 2-3 minutes per night.  
- **Revised Subgoal 4**: Reinforce partner involvement to ensure consistent soothing and feeding support.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 15: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Track Goals**: Update the goal hierarchy to reflect the backtracking and final steps.  

- **Goal**: Drop a night feed by pumping an extra bottle before bed.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Pump and store an extra bottle of breast milk before bed to prepare for the night feed (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Continue using the extra bottle and further reduce breastfeeding time by 2-3 minutes per night (revised).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Support the baby’s comfort during and after the night feed (burping, soothing) (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Reinforce partner involvement to ensure consistent soothing and feeding support (revised).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Monitor the baby’s response to the reduced night feed over 3-5 nights and decide whether to fully eliminate breastfeeding at night.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Gradually eliminate the night feed by further reducing breastfeeding time or transitioning fully to bottle feeding, if appropriate.  

**Current Goal**: Continue using the extra bottle and further reduce breastfeeding time by 2-3 minutes per night.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to continue using the extra bottle and further reduce breastfeeding time by 2-3 minutes per night. This will be achieved by consistently feeding the baby the bottle and shortening breastfeeding duration.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the next 3-5 nights, feed the baby the stored bottle during the night feed, ensuring they consume the full amount needed. If breastfeeding is still required, reduce the duration by an additional 2-3 minutes each night compared to the previous session. Monitor the baby’s response to ensure they remain satisfied and settle back to sleep. Coordinate with the partner to assist with feeding or soothing as needed to maintain consistency.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to know when to quit the night feed entirely. Retrieve information related to deciding when to eliminate the night feed from previous steps and the script.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**: The script includes step 8: “Know when to quit.” From Step 12 and Step 13, monitoring the baby’s response over 3-5 nights involves checking for satisfaction with the bottle, good sleep patterns, and no signs of hunger or distress. Step 13 references guidelines that babies may drop night feeds between 6-12 months if they are gaining weight and eating sufficiently during the day. This information will guide the decision to fully eliminate the night feed.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 18: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to know when to quit the night feed entirely and act on it. This will be achieved by evaluating the baby’s readiness based on monitoring data and fully transitioning to bottle feeding or eliminating the night feed if appropriate.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After 3-5 nights of further reducing breastfeeding (from Step 16), evaluate the baby’s feeding and sleep patterns. If the baby consistently consumes the bottle, shows no signs of hunger, and sleeps well without breastfeeding, eliminate the breastfeeding portion of the night feed entirely, using only the bottle if a feed is still needed. If the baby is sleeping through the night without waking for a feed, discontinue the night feed altogether. Consult with a pediatrician if unsure about the baby’s readiness to ensure nutritional needs are met.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 19: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the night feed has been successfully dropped or appropriately adjusted. This will be achieved by checking the baby’s overall health, weight gain, and sleep patterns after eliminating the night feed.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Monitor the baby for 3-5 days after fully transitioning to bottle feeding or eliminating the night feed. Ensure the baby is gaining weight appropriately, appears satisfied during the day, and maintains healthy sleep patterns. Check daytime feeding records to confirm sufficient milk intake (e.g., 24-32 ounces per day for a 6-12 month old). If any concerns arise (e.g., increased hunger or poor sleep), consult a pediatrician and consider reintroducing a reduced night feed temporarily. If all indicators are positive, the night feed has been successfully dropped.  

[/IMP]
