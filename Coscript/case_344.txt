### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Create a sentimental item (collage or video of memories).  
**How to Achieve**: Gather photos and videos from shared moments (e.g., trips, dates, milestones), and use free editing software to compile a video or a physical collage board, emphasizing key memories to evoke emotion.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Collect digital photos and videos from personal devices (phone, laptop) or shared cloud storage, focusing on significant moments like first dates, vacations, or holidays. Choose a medium: a video using free software like iMovie or DaVinci Resolve, or a physical collage using printed photos and a poster board. For a video, select 10–15 clips/photos, arrange chronologically, add a heartfelt voiceover, and include her favorite song as background music. For a collage, print 20–30 photos, arrange them artistically on a board, and add handwritten captions. Ensure the final product is polished and ready to present during the proposal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the sentimental item is complete and effective.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the collage or video to confirm it captures key memories, is emotionally impactful, and is free of errors.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Watch the video or inspect the collage to ensure all selected memories are included and clearly presented. Check for technical issues (e.g., video audio sync, photo clarity). Verify the item evokes the intended emotional response by imagining her perspective or testing it with a trusted friend (without revealing the proposal). Make minor edits if needed, such as adjusting transitions or adding a missing photo. Confirm the item is ready for the proposal setting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Revise the subgoals to streamline the proposal plan, combining related steps for efficiency while maintaining the DIY constraint. Adjusted subgoals:  
1. Create and present a sentimental item (collage or video).  
2. Design a scavenger hunt that incorporates a homemade card and leads to the proposal.  
3. Propose during a shared activity (e.g., hiking), incorporating a traditional kneeling moment and the ring hidden in her jewelry.  
4. Cook and serve a special dinner post-proposal to celebrate.  
This adjustment reduces redundancy and creates a cohesive sequence: scavenger hunt leads to the proposal during a shared activity, followed by a celebratory dinner.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Design a scavenger hunt incorporating a homemade card.  
**How to Achieve**: Create a scavenger hunt with 4–5 clues placed in meaningful locations, ending at the proposal site, with a homemade card as one clue or the final reveal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Plan a scavenger hunt with 5 clues leading to the proposal site (e.g., a park or beach). Select locations tied to your relationship, like where you first met or had a memorable date. Write clues as short, handwritten notes on decorative paper, each directing her to the next location. For the homemade card, use cardstock, markers, and personal touches (e.g., a pressed flower from a shared trip) to create a heartfelt message as the final clue, revealing your intent to propose. Test the route to ensure clues are clear and the timing (under 1 hour) keeps her engaged. Prepare to guide her subtly if needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the scavenger hunt and homemade card are feasible and effective.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the scavenger hunt route and review the card to confirm clarity, emotional impact, and alignment with the proposal plan.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Walk through the scavenger hunt route to verify all clue locations are accessible and safe. Read each clue to ensure it’s understandable and leads to the next spot without confusion. Review the homemade card for spelling, design, and emotional resonance, ensuring it clearly hints at the proposal. Adjust wording or placement if needed. Confirm the final location aligns with the next subgoal (proposal during a shared activity). Ensure all materials (clues, card) are ready for execution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the shared activity and ring incorporation for the proposal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Propose during a shared activity with kneeling and hidden ring.  
**Recalled Information**: From Step 5, the proposal will occur during a shared activity (e.g., hiking), incorporating a traditional kneeling moment and the ring hidden in her jewelry. The scavenger hunt (Step 7) ends at the proposal site, setting the stage for this subgoal. No prior details specify the activity or jewelry type, so further planning is needed to select a specific activity and method for hiding the ring.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Propose during a shared activity with kneeling and hidden ring.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a shared activity like hiking, hide the ring in a piece of her jewelry, and propose by kneeling at the scavenger hunt’s final location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose hiking as the shared activity, selecting a scenic trail you both enjoy (e.g., a local park with a lookout point). For the ring, discreetly borrow a necklace or bracelet she wears often, and attach the engagement ring securely (e.g., in a small pouch tied to the necklace). At the scavenger hunt’s final clue (the homemade card), guide her to the trail’s lookout point. Present the sentimental item (video or collage) on a portable device or as a physical display. Kneel, reveal the ring from her jewelry, and propose with a heartfelt speech. Ensure the moment is private and timed for sunset or a meaningful time.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the proposal setup (shared activity, ring, kneeling) is feasible and impactful.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the hiking plan, ring placement, and proposal logistics to confirm everything is executable and emotionally resonant.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Visit the hiking trail to confirm the lookout point is suitable (private, scenic, accessible). Test the ring’s hiding method to ensure it’s secure yet retrievable during the proposal. Rehearse the kneeling moment and speech to ensure confidence and clarity. Verify the sentimental item can be presented at the location (e.g., bring a charged device for the video). Check weather forecasts and have a backup indoor location (e.g., a cozy café) if needed. Confirm all elements align for a seamless, heartfelt proposal.
