### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making glazed carrots in the microwave into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Cook the carrots in the microwave.  
- Subgoal 2: Prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients.  
- Subgoal 3: Heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency.  
- Subgoal 4: Combine the glaze with the cooked carrots.  
- Subgoal 5: Serve the glazed carrots.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1. Highlight the current goal.  
- **Goal**: Make glazed carrots in the microwave  
  - Subgoal 1: Cook the carrots in the microwave (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients  
  - Subgoal 3: Heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency  
  - Subgoal 4: Combine the glaze with the cooked carrots  
  - Subgoal 5: Serve the glazed carrots  
The current goal is to cook the carrots in the microwave.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cook the carrots in the microwave. This will be achieved by following the package instructions for microwaving the carrots, ensuring they are tender and ready for glazing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cook the carrots in the microwave according to the package instructions. Typically, this involves placing the carrots in a microwave-safe dish, adding a small amount of water, covering the dish, and microwaving on high for 5-7 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through if needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the carrots are properly cooked. This will be achieved by checking the tenderness of the carrots to confirm they are ready for the glaze.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the carrots for tenderness by piercing them with a fork. They should be soft but not mushy. If not tender, microwave for an additional 1-2 minutes and recheck.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  
- **Goal**: Make glazed carrots in the microwave  
  - Subgoal 1: Cook the carrots in the microwave (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency  
  - Subgoal 4: Combine the glaze with the cooked carrots  
  - Subgoal 5: Serve the glazed carrots  
The current goal is to prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients. This will be achieved by combining orange juice, sugar, butter, and salt in a bowl as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together ¼ cup orange juice, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and a pinch of salt until well combined.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  
- **Goal**: Make glazed carrots in the microwave  
  - Subgoal 1: Cook the carrots in the microwave (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the glaze by mixing ingredients (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency (Current)  
  - Subgoal 4: Combine the glaze with the cooked carrots  
  - Subgoal 5: Serve the glazed carrots  
The current goal is to heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to heat the glaze in the microwave to achieve desired consistency. This will be achieved by microwaving the glaze for 1 minute, stirring, then microwaving for an additional 1-2 minutes until it thickens.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Microwave the glaze mixture for 1 minute on high, then stir. Microwave for an additional 1-2 minutes, checking periodically, until the glaze thickens to a syrupy consistency.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the glaze has the correct consistency. This will be achieved by checking the thickness of the glaze to confirm it is syrupy and suitable for coating the carrots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the glaze’s consistency by stirring it. It should be thickened and slightly syrupy, able to coat the carrots evenly. If too thin, microwave for an additional 30 seconds and recheck.  
[/IMP]
