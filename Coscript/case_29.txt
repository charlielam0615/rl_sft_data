### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the identified state agency contact information is correct and supports anonymous reporting.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the contact information and verify that the reporting method allows anonymity by reviewing official resources or testing the reporting process without submitting personal details.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the contact information and anonymity support:  
- Revisit the state agency’s website or the USDA SNAP fraud reporting page to confirm the accuracy of the contact details (e.g., phone number, website link, or email).  
- Check for explicit statements about anonymity, such as “anonymous tips accepted” on the website or hotline instructions.  
- If possible, test the online form or hotline process without submitting personal information to ensure no mandatory fields compromise anonymity.  
- Ensure the reporting channel is secure (e.g., HTTPS for online forms) to protect the submission.
