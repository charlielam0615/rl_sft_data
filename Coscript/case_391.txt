### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of treating shin splints by stretching in the morning into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Perform a morning massage of shins and calves to warm up muscles.  
2. Execute heel step-downs to strengthen lower leg muscles.  
3. Conduct the toe-up stretch to improve flexibility.  
4. Perform calf raises to build calf strength.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Perform a morning massage of shins and calves to warm up muscles.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the morning, upon waking, use hands to gently massage the shin and calf muscles for 5-10 minutes to increase blood flow and reduce tension.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Upon waking in the morning, sit on the edge of the bed or a chair. Use both hands to gently massage the shin muscles (along the front of the lower leg) and calf muscles (at the back of the lower leg). Apply light to moderate pressure, using circular motions and long strokes for 5-10 minutes. This warms up the muscles, increases circulation, and prepares the legs for further stretches.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Perform a morning massage of shins and calves to warm up muscles.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the massage was performed correctly in the morning and if the muscles feel warmed and less tense.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the massage was done in the morning for 5-10 minutes, covering both shins and calves with consistent pressure. Confirm that the muscles feel warmer, less tight, and more relaxed compared to before the massage. If discomfort persists or the massage was not done in the morning, repeat the step or adjust the technique (e.g., lighter pressure).

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Execute heel step-downs to strengthen lower leg muscles.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the morning, stand on a step, lower heels below the step level, and raise them back up to strengthen the lower leg muscles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the morning, find a step (e.g., a staircase or a sturdy platform). Stand with the balls of your feet on the edge of the step, heels hanging off. Slowly lower your heels below the step level, feeling a stretch in the calves, then raise your heels back to the starting position. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, ensuring controlled movements to strengthen the shin and calf muscles.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that heel step-downs were done in the morning, completing 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions with proper form (heels lowering below the step and raising back up). Ensure no pain was felt during the exercise, only a mild stretch or muscle engagement. If form was incorrect or the exercise was not done in the morning, repeat with adjustments (e.g., slower movements or fewer repetitions).
