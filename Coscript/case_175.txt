### Step 6: Execute the painting step

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add acrylic craft paint to create the marbling effect.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour 2 to 3 colors of acrylic craft paint into the cleaned glass bottle in small, controlled amounts to ensure even distribution in the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select 2 to 3 colors of non-toxic acrylic craft paint (e.g., red, blue, and white). Pour a small amount of each color (about 1-2 teaspoons per color) into the clean, dry glass bottle, ensuring the paint reaches the interior surfaces. Avoid overfilling to maintain control during the marbling process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Distribute the paint inside the bottle

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Distribute the paint inside the bottle to create the marbling effect.  
**How to Achieve**: Tilt and rotate the bottle to allow the paint to spread and mix, creating a marbled pattern on the interior surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the bottle and gently tilt and rotate it in different directions. Allow the paint to flow and coat the interior surfaces, creating a swirled, marbled pattern. Continue rotating for 1-2 minutes to ensure even distribution, as per the script’s guidance. Monitor the process to achieve the desired aesthetic effect.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Remove excess paint

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Remove excess paint to prevent waste and ensure a clean finish.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour any excess paint from the bottle into a jar for potential reuse, ensuring the bottle retains only a thin, even layer of paint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Carefully tilt the bottle over a clean jar and pour out any excess paint that has not adhered to the interior surfaces. Rotate the bottle as needed to collect the excess paint. Ensure the remaining paint forms a thin, even marbled layer inside the bottle, suitable for drying in the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Clean external spills

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Clean any spills on the outside of the bottle for a polished appearance.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a damp paper towel to wipe away any paint that spilled on the bottle’s exterior during the pouring or tilting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the bottle’s exterior for any paint spills or smudges. Use a damp paper towel to gently wipe the exterior, removing any paint residue. Dry the exterior with a clean cloth to ensure a clean, professional appearance, as specified in the script.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Allow the bottle to dry

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Allow the bottle to dry completely.  
**How to Achieve**: Set the bottle upright on a paper towel in a well-ventilated area and let it dry for approximately one week, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the marbled bottle upright on a clean paper towel in a well-ventilated, dust-free area. Ensure the bottle is stable and not exposed to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, which could affect drying. Allow it to dry for about one week to ensure the paint is fully set and suitable for perfume storage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validate the drying process

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the bottle is fully dry and ready for perfume storage.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the bottle after one week to confirm the paint is dry and adhered properly, with no tackiness or odor that could affect the perfume.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After one week, inspect the bottle’s interior to ensure the paint is fully dry and no longer tacky. Gently touch the interior (using a clean tool if necessary) to confirm the paint has set. Check for any paint odor; if present, allow additional drying time. Confirm the bottle is clean and ready for perfume storage.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Recall information about paint compatibility

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Core Content**: Information about the compatibility of acrylic craft paint with perfume storage to ensure the bottle is safe for use.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Reviewing previous steps, the paint used was specified as non-toxic acrylic craft paint (Step 6). Acrylic paint, once fully dried, forms a stable, inert layer that is generally safe for decorative purposes. However, to ensure compatibility with perfume (which may contain alcohol), the paint must be fully cured with no residual odor, as confirmed in the drying validation (Step 12). No prior steps indicated the use of a sealant, so the bottle’s interior should be clean and free of contaminants (Step 3) to avoid chemical interactions with the perfume. This supports proceeding to the final step of filling the bottle.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14: Fill the bottle with perfume

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Fill the bottle with perfume for storage.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour the chosen perfume into the marbled, fully dried bottle, ensuring it is suitable for long-term storage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a favorite perfume that is compatible with glass storage. Using a clean funnel or dropper, carefully pour the perfume into the marbled bottle, filling it to the desired level (e.g., leaving some headspace to prevent spillage). Secure the bottle with a stopper or cap to ensure airtight storage, completing the process as per the script.  
[/IMP]
