### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the processor meets 4K video playback requirements.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the processor specifications (e.g., model, clock speed, cores) against recommended requirements for 4K video playback (typically a modern multi-core processor like Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7, 3.0 GHz or higher).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Access the computer’s system information (e.g., on Windows, use "System Information" or "Task Manager"; on macOS, use "About This Mac"). Confirm the processor is at least a 6th-generation Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 with a clock speed of 3.0 GHz or higher, capable of handling 4K video decoding (e.g., supports HEVC/H.265 or VP9 codecs). If specifications are unclear, consult the manufacturer’s website or documentation for the processor model.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the processor’s capability for 4K video playback.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the processor’s specifications with 4K video playback requirements and ensure no other system bottlenecks (e.g., insufficient RAM or GPU limitations).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the processor supports hardware decoding for 4K codecs (e.g., HEVC/H.265 or VP9). Ensure the system has at least 8 GB of RAM and a compatible GPU (e.g., Intel UHD Graphics 630, NVIDIA GTX 1050, or better). If the processor does not meet these requirements, note that an upgrade is necessary.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
If the processor does not meet 4K requirements, prioritize upgrading the processor before proceeding. Update the subgoals to reflect this conditional step:  
1. Upgrade the processor if it does not meet 4K requirements (prioritized if necessary).  
2. Verify that the processor meets 4K video playback requirements (completed).  
3. Confirm the availability of a 4K-capable monitor.  
4. Establish a connection between the monitor and the computer.  
5. Locate a 4K video file or source.  
6. Play the 4K video using appropriate software.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Upgrade the processor if it does not meet 4K video playback requirements.  
**How to Achieve**: If the processor is insufficient, select a compatible processor (e.g., Intel i7-8700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X) and replace the existing processor, ensuring compatibility with the motherboard.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the motherboard’s socket type (e.g., LGA 1151, AM4) and chipset compatibility using the manufacturer’s CPU support list. Purchase a suitable processor, power down the computer, and replace the processor following standard hardware installation procedures (e.g., remove the old processor, apply thermal paste, install the new processor, and secure the cooler). Update the BIOS if required.  
[/IMP]
