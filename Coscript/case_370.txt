**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to format APA citations for a journal article, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with the specified format requirements. The script includes seven steps: (1) Find the author's name, (2) Look for the date of publication, (3) Look for the article title, (4) Find the name of the journal, (5) Write out the volume and issue number of the journal, (6) Locate the page range of the article, and (7) Add the DOI number if available. Each step must select one meta-cognitive action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and the response must use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To format an APA citation for a journal article, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify the author’s name.  
2. Determine the publication date.  
3. Identify the article title.  
4. Identify the journal name.  
5. Determine the volume and issue number.  
6. Identify the page range.  
7. Include the DOI if available.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the process of gathering and formatting the citation components.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals. The main goal is to format an APA citation for a journal article. The subgoals, as defined in the Forward Subgoaling step, are:

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the author’s name for the journal article. This will be achieved by examining the article’s title page, abstract, or metadata to locate the full names of all authors, following APA guidelines (e.g., last name, first initial).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assume the journal article is titled “Cognitive Effects of Sleep Deprivation” from a sample source. Checking the article’s title page, the authors listed are John A. Smith and Emily R. Jones. In APA format, this would be formatted as: Smith, J. A., & Jones, E. R. This completes the first component of the citation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the article title. This will be achieved by locating the title on the article’s title page or metadata, ensuring it is formatted in sentence case per APA style.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The article’s title, found on the title page, is “Cognitive Effects of Sleep Deprivation.” In APA format, this is written in sentence case: Cognitive effects of sleep deprivation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the journal name. This will be achieved by checking the journal’s title page, cover, or database entry, ensuring the full journal name is used in title case per APA style.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The journal for the article is “Journal of Behavioral Science.” In APA format, this is written as *Journal of Behavioral Science* (italicized).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the volume and issue number of the journal. This will be achieved by reviewing the article’s publication details, typically found on the journal’s cover or metadata, formatted as volume(issue) in APA style.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The article’s publication details indicate it appears in Volume 45, Issue 3. In APA format, this is written as *45*(3).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the page range of the article. This will be achieved by checking the article’s title page or PDF, noting the first and last pages, formatted as page range in APA style.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The article spans pages 123 to 135 in the journal. In APA format, this is written as 123-135.  
[/IMP]
