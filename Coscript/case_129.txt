[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of identifying a suitable VPN service:  
- Research reputable VPN providers such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Surfshark, focusing on features like strong encryption (e.g., AES-256), a large number of servers in multiple countries, and proven ability to bypass geo-restrictions or network blocks.  
- Verify that the VPN service supports Windows (or the user’s operating system) since Command Prompt is typically used on Windows.  
- Check user reviews or technical forums on platforms like X to confirm the VPN’s effectiveness in unblocking restricted applications.  
- Select a VPN service, such as NordVPN, known for its reliability in bypassing network restrictions.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate that the selected VPN service can unblock Command Prompt.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm that the chosen VPN service has the necessary features and user feedback indicating success in bypassing network restrictions for Command Prompt.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate the selected VPN service:  
- Review the selected VPN’s (e.g., NordVPN) documentation or website to ensure it supports bypassing network restrictions on Windows.  
- Search for user feedback on platforms like X or tech forums to confirm instances where the VPN successfully unblocked Command Prompt or similar applications in restricted environments (e.g., schools or workplaces).  
- Ensure the VPN offers a money-back guarantee or free trial to test its effectiveness without financial risk.  
- Conclusion: NordVPN is validated as a suitable choice based on its strong encryption, extensive server network, and positive user feedback for bypassing restrictions.

**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoals remain appropriate, but refine Subgoal 2 to specify the operating system for clarity.  
- Updated Subgoal 2: Download and install the VPN software on the user’s Windows computer (since Command Prompt is primarily a Windows feature).  
- Updated Goal Hierarchy:  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and select a suitable VPN service that can bypass restrictions to unblock Command Prompt (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Download and install the VPN software on the user’s Windows computer.  
  - Subgoal 3: Establish a connection to a VPN server.  
  - Subgoal 4: Open and use Command Prompt without restrictions.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Download and install the VPN software on the user’s Windows computer.  
- **How to Achieve**: Visit the official website of the selected VPN provider, download the Windows-compatible software, and follow the installation instructions.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Open and use Command Prompt without restrictions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Launch Command Prompt on the Windows computer while connected to the VPN and verify that it functions without network restrictions.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To open and use Command Prompt:  
- Ensure the VPN connection is active (e.g., NordVPN is connected to a server).  
- Open Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing “cmd,” and pressing Enter, or by searching for “Command Prompt” in the Start menu.  
- Test Command Prompt functionality by running basic commands (e.g., “ping google.com” or “ipconfig”) to confirm it is not blocked by network restrictions.  
- If restrictions persist, try connecting to a different VPN server or contact the VPN provider’s support for assistance.  
- Conclusion: Command Prompt should now be accessible and functional, as the VPN bypasses network restrictions.
