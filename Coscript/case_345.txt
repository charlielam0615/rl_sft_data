**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan to simulate transferring calls from a cell phone to another phone number, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The process must be broken down into steps, each using one meta-cognitive action, and formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The constraint is that the task must be performed from a cell phone, and the script provides a clear sequence of steps to achieve the goal of enabling call forwarding.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To achieve the goal of transferring calls from a cell phone, break down the process into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:
1. Access the phone's menu.
2. Navigate to the call settings.
3. Select the call forwarding option.
4. Enable call forwarding.
5. Enter the target phone number.
6. Save the settings to activate call forwarding.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the phone's menu. This will be achieved by tapping the "Menu" button on the cell phone, as specified in the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate the "Menu" button on the cell phone's home screen or interface and tap it to open the menu.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Transfer calls from the cell phone.
  - Subgoal 1: Access the phone's menu (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the call settings.
  - Subgoal 3: Select the call forwarding option.
  - Subgoal 4: Enable call forwarding.
  - Subgoal 5: Enter the target phone number.
  - Subgoal 6: Save the settings to activate call forwarding.
**Current Goal**: Navigate to the call settings.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the call settings. This will be achieved by scrolling to and selecting "Settings," then selecting "Calls" from the menu.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the menu, scroll to find the "Settings" option, tap it, then locate and select the "Calls" option to access call-related settings.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the call forwarding option. This will be achieved by finding and selecting "Call Forwarding" within the Calls settings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Calls settings, locate the "Call Forwarding" option and tap it to access the call forwarding configuration.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enable call forwarding. Retrieve information from the script relevant to enabling call forwarding to ensure the next steps are accurate.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The script indicates that to enable call forwarding, the next step is to toggle the "Call Forwarding" switch to "On." This action follows selecting the "Call Forwarding" option and prepares for entering the target phone number.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enable call forwarding. This will be achieved by toggling the "Call Forwarding" switch to "On."
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Call Forwarding settings, find the "Call Forwarding" switch and toggle it to the "On" position to activate the feature.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enter the target phone number. This will be achieved by inputting the phone number to which all incoming calls will be transferred.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Call Forwarding settings, locate the field for the phone number, enter the desired phone number to which calls will be transferred, and ensure it is correctly formatted (e.g., include area code if required).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the entered phone number and call forwarding settings. This will be achieved by checking that the phone number is correct and the call forwarding switch is enabled.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the entered phone number to ensure it is accurate and properly formatted. Confirm that the "Call Forwarding" switch is set to "On." If any errors are found, correct the phone number or toggle the switch as needed.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to save the call forwarding settings. This will be achieved by tapping the "Menu" button and selecting "Save" to activate call forwarding.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Tap the "Menu" button in the Call Forwarding settings, then select the "Save" option to confirm and activate the call forwarding settings. This ensures all incoming calls will now transfer to the specified phone number.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Transfer calls from the cell phone (Completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Access the phone's menu (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the call settings (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select the call forwarding option (Completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Enable call forwarding (Completed).
  - Subgoal 5: Enter the target phone number (Completed).
  - Subgoal 6: Save the settings to activate call forwarding (Completed).
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).
The plan to transfer calls from the cell phone has been fully executed as per the provided script.
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Note**: The plan to transfer calls from a cell phone has been completed by following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed systematically, and the process was validated to ensure successful call forwarding activation.
