**How to Achieve**: Verify that the app has loaded correctly and displays the Spotify interface.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check that the Spotify app has opened successfully by confirming the home screen or login prompt is visible. If the app fails to load, ensure the device has a stable internet connection or restart the app.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track and update the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the next goal.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Listen to music offline with Spotify Free.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Spotify app on the device (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sign into the Spotify account.

  - Subgoal 4: Access the playlist options to enable offline mode.  
  - Subgoal 5: Make the playlist available for offline listening.  
**Current Goal**: Sign into the Spotify account.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sign into the Spotify account.  
**How to Achieve**: Enter valid login credentials (username and password) for a Spotify Free account or select an existing logged-in account.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
On the Spotify app’s login screen, enter the username and password for a Spotify Free account. Alternatively, if already logged in, confirm the account is active. If login issues occur, use the “Forgot Password” option to reset credentials.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify successful login to the Spotify account.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the app displays the user’s account details or playlists after signing in.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Confirm that the Spotify app shows the user’s account name, playlists, or home screen after login. If login fails, double-check credentials or ensure the internet connection is active.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Select a playlist to listen to offline.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information about the constraints of the Spotify Free plan related to offline listening.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The Spotify Free plan has limitations for offline listening. Typically, offline mode is restricted to Spotify Premium users, but certain playlists (e.g., Daily Mix or specific curated playlists) may be made available offline temporarily under promotional offers or specific conditions. The constraint “Free” suggests we are working within these limitations, so the selected playlist must be eligible for offline access under the Free plan.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Given the constraint that offline listening is typically a Premium feature, adjust the subgoals to account for selecting a playlist eligible for offline access under the Spotify Free plan.  
- Subgoal 3 (Adjusted): Select a playlist eligible for offline listening under Spotify Free (e.g., a promotional or supported playlist).  
- Subgoal 4: Access the playlist options to check for offline availability.  
- Subgoal 5: Enable offline mode for the selected playlist if permitted.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select a playlist eligible for offline listening under Spotify Free.  
**How to Achieve**: Browse the Spotify app for playlists marked as available for offline listening under the Free plan, such as a Daily Mix or promotional playlist.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In the Spotify app, navigate to the “Your Library” or “Home” section. Look for playlists labeled as “Daily Mix,” “Discover Weekly,” or other curated playlists that may have offline access enabled for Free users under specific promotions. Select a playlist that indicates offline availability.  

[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the selected playlist is eligible for offline listening.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the playlist options for an offline toggle or indicator.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Open the selected playlist and look for an option like “Download” or “Make Available Offline.” If no such option exists, the playlist may not be eligible under the Free plan. In this case, try another playlist or confirm with Spotify’s help resources.  

[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track and update the goal hierarchy, reflecting the adjusted subgoals and current progress.

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Access the playlist options to check for offline availability.  
**How to Achieve**: Open the selected playlist and locate the options menu to find the offline toggle.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Within the selected playlist, tap the three-dot menu (or similar icon) to access playlist options. Look for a “Download” or “Make Available Offline” option. If the option is greyed out or unavailable, the playlist may not support offline listening on the Free plan.

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the playlist options include an offline toggle.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the “Download” or “Make Available Offline” option is selectable.

Enable airplane mode or disconnect the device from the internet. Open the Spotify app, navigate to the downloaded playlist, and attempt to play a track. If the track plays successfully, the playlist is available offline.  

[/IMP]

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the final goal hierarchy and confirm all subgoals are completed.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Listen to music offline with Spotify Free.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Spotify app on the device (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sign into the Spotify account (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select a playlist eligible for offline listening under Spotify Free (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Access the playlist options to check for offline availability (Completed).

**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed).  
The plan to listen to music offline with Spotify Free has been successfully completed, assuming a playlist eligible for offline access was found.  

[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The plan assumes that a playlist eligible for offline listening is available under the Spotify Free plan, which may depend on temporary promotions or specific conditions. If no such playlist is available, the user may need to consider upgrading to Spotify Premium for full offline functionality.
