### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Establish an internet connection to access the hack-checking website.
**How to Achieve**: Ensure the work computer is connected to a stable internet network, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and verify connectivity by accessing a known website.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Connect the work computer to the internet by checking the network settings. If using Wi-Fi, select the appropriate network and enter credentials if required. If using Ethernet, ensure the cable is securely connected. Test the connection by opening a browser and navigating to a reliable site like www.google.com to confirm internet access.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Confirm that the internet connection is stable and functional.
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the computer can consistently access websites and that the connection is secure for proceeding to the hack-checking website.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the network status in the computer’s settings to ensure it shows as connected. Attempt to load multiple websites (e.g., www.google.com, www.microsoft.com) to confirm consistent access. Ensure the connection is secure by verifying the network is trusted (e.g., a company network) and no VPN or proxy issues interfere.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Navigate to a reliable website that can check if the computer has been hacked.
**How to Achieve**: Use a web browser to access a trusted hack-checking service, such as Have I Been Pwned or a network security tool recommended by IT professionals.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and navigate to a trusted website like https://haveibeenpwned.com or a similar service that checks for compromised systems. If unsure about the website, consult the company’s IT department for a recommended tool or service to ensure reliability and security.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Determine if work computers have been hacked.
  - Subgoal 1: Establish an internet connection (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to a reliable hack-checking website (In Progress).
  - Subgoal 3: Input the work computer’s IP address.
  - Subgoal 4: Initiate the hack check by clicking "Check."
  - Subgoal 5: Analyze the results.
  - Subgoal 6: Respond if hacked.
  - Subgoal 7: Disconnect from the internet.

**Current Goal**: Navigate to a reliable website to check for hacks (Subgoal 2).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Input the work computer’s IP address into the website.
**How to Achieve**: Retrieve the computer’s IP address from network settings and enter it into the designated field on the hack-checking website.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Find the computer’s IP address by opening the command prompt (Windows: `ipconfig`, macOS/Linux: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`) and noting the IPv4 address. On the hack-checking website, locate the input field for the IP address, enter the retrieved IP, and verify it is correct before proceeding.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Initiate the hack check by clicking the "Check" button.
**How to Achieve**: Locate and click the "Check" or equivalent button on the website to start the scan for potential hacks.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
On the hack-checking website, find the "Check" button (or similar, e.g., "Scan," "Analyze") associated with the IP address input field. Click the button to initiate the scan and wait for the website to process the request.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Analyze the results provided by the website.
**How to Achieve**: Review the scan results displayed by the website to determine if the computer has been compromised, looking for indicators like unauthorized access or data breaches.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the results page on the website, which may indicate whether the IP address is associated with known breaches, malware, or suspicious activity. Note any specific warnings or details provided, such as timestamps or types of threats. If the results are unclear, refer to the website’s help section or consult the IT department for interpretation.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Current Goal**: Analyze the results to determine if the computer has been hacked.
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information from previous steps related to the hack-checking process, including the website used and the IP address entered, to contextualize the results.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- Step 4: Navigated to a trusted hack-checking website (e.g., https://haveibeenpwned.com or a similar service recommended by IT).
- Step 6: Entered the work computer’s IP address, retrieved from network settings (e.g., via `ipconfig` or equivalent).
- Step 7: Initiated the scan by clicking the "Check" button.
This information confirms the process followed to reach the results stage, ensuring the correct IP was checked on a reliable platform.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

Based on the results from the hack check, adjust the next subgoal. If the computer is hacked, prioritize immediate action (e.g., notifying IT, isolating the system). If not hacked, proceed to disconnect from the internet as a precaution.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Respond appropriately if the results indicate a hack.
**How to Achieve**: If the scan indicates a compromise, follow security protocols such as notifying the IT department, isolating the computer, and documenting findings. If no hack is detected, prepare to disconnect from the internet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If the results show a hack (e.g., unauthorized access, malware), immediately contact the IT department with details from the scan (e.g., type of breach, timestamps). Isolate the computer by disabling network connections (e.g., turn off Wi-Fi, unplug Ethernet). If no hack is detected, proceed to the next step without further action.
[/IMP]
