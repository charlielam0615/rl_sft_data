**Problem Statement**: Form an electric guitar rock band, adhering to the constraint that an electric guitar must be involved. The task involves following an ordered list of steps: 1) Get an electric guitar, 2) Find people to form a band, 3) Write songs, 4) Rehearse, and 5) Perform gigs. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), selecting one action per step, and structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Acquire an electric guitar.  
**How to Achieve**: Research and purchase a reliable electric guitar suitable for rock music, considering budget and quality, either from a local music store or online retailer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To acquire an electric guitar, I will research options online, focusing on models like the Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul, which are popular for rock music. I’ll check retailers like Guitar Center or Sweetwater for prices, aiming for a budget-friendly option around $300-$500. I’ll also read reviews to ensure quality and suitability for rock band performances. After selecting a model, I’ll purchase it online or visit a local store to test and buy.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Acquire an electric guitar.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the purchased electric guitar is functional and suitable for rock band use by testing its sound and playability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
After purchasing the guitar (e.g., a Fender Stratocaster), I’ll test it by plugging it into an amplifier to check sound quality, ensuring it produces the desired rock tone. I’ll play various chords and riffs to confirm playability and check for any defects. If issues are found, I’ll return or exchange the guitar within the store’s policy period.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Recruit band members with relevant musical skills.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify and connect with potential band members (e.g., drummer, bassist, vocalist) through local music communities, social media, or platforms like BandMix.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I’ll post a call for band members on platforms like BandMix and local music forums, specifying the need for a drummer, bassist, and vocalist with rock music experience. I’ll also reach out to friends or attend local open mic nights to network with musicians. After gathering interest, I’ll organize auditions to assess candidates’ skills and compatibility, aiming to form a cohesive group of 3-4 members.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Recall Info (Review)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of recruiting band members, focusing on the need for musicians with rock music skills and the methods to find them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Relevant information: The current goal is to recruit band members with rock music skills. Previous implementation (Step 5) outlined posting on platforms like BandMix, networking at open mic nights, and holding auditions to select a drummer, bassist, and vocalist. This aligns with forming a band capable of performing rock music with an electric guitar.

**Step 7: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the subgoals to ensure they align with progress. The original subgoals are sufficient, but I’ll refine Subgoal 2 to include a specific timeline for recruitment to maintain momentum:  
1. Acquire an electric guitar (completed).  
2. Recruit band members with relevant musical skills within 4 weeks.  
3. Create original rock songs.  
4. Organize rehearsals.  
5. Book and perform gigs.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Create original rock songs.  
**How to Achieve**: Collaborate with band members to write 3-5 original rock songs, focusing on lyrics, melodies, and arrangements suitable for electric guitar-driven music.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
With the band formed, we’ll schedule songwriting sessions over 2-3 weeks. I’ll bring electric guitar riffs, while others contribute ideas for drums, bass, and vocals. We’ll aim for 3-5 songs with catchy hooks and rock energy, drawing inspiration from bands like Nirvana or Foo Fighters. We’ll document lyrics and arrangements, refining them through group feedback.

**Current Goal**: Organize rehearsals.  
**How to Achieve**: Schedule regular rehearsals with band members to practice the 3-5 original songs, focusing on performance quality and band cohesion.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I’ll coordinate with the band to schedule weekly rehearsals (2-3 hours each) in a rented studio or a member’s garage. We’ll practice the 3-5 original songs, focusing on tightening transitions, improving timing, and enhancing stage presence. I’ll use the electric guitar to lead arrangements, ensuring all parts blend well. We’ll aim for 4-6 weeks of rehearsals to prepare for gigs.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
During the final rehearsal, we’ll record a practice session and review it to evaluate song execution, timing, and energy. I’ll check that the electric guitar parts are prominent and blend with other instruments. If issues arise (e.g., weak vocals or timing errors), we’ll schedule additional rehearsals to address them before booking gigs.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I’ll contact local venues like bars, clubs, or community events to book a 30-45 minute set, offering to play for free or low cost to build exposure. We’ll promote the gig via social media and flyers. On performance day, we’ll arrive early to set up equipment, soundcheck the electric guitar and other instruments, and deliver a high-energy rock performance of our 3-5 songs.
