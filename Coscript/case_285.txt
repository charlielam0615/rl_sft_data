### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate planning a pop punk song about personal life, adhering to the provided script and constraints. The song must focus on a personal life event, be written in first person present tense, use simple and direct language, include specific details, convey thoughts and emotions, address someone else, emphasize the main point in the chorus, and be fun. The planning process will follow the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories, using the specified [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of writing a pop punk song about personal life into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Select a specific personal life event to base the song on.  
2. Define the emotional tone and key feelings to convey.  
3. Structure the song with verses, chorus, and bridge, ensuring first person present tense.  
4. Draft lyrics with simple, direct language, addressing someone else.  
5. Refine the chorus to emphasize the main point or feeling.  
6. Add energetic, fun elements typical of pop punk.  
7. Review and finalize the plan to ensure all script steps are addressed.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select a specific personal life event to base the song on. This will be achieved by choosing a relatable, emotionally charged event from personal experience, such as a recent breakup, to align with pop punk’s themes of heartache and resilience.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To select a personal life event, I choose a recent breakup, as it’s a common yet deeply personal experience that resonates with pop punk’s emotional intensity. The event involves the moment I realized my relationship was over, sitting alone in my room, replaying our last conversation. This moment is vivid, specific, and rich with emotions like sadness, anger, and hope for moving forward, making it ideal for a pop punk song.  
[/IMP]

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the emotional tone and key feelings to convey in the song. This will be achieved by identifying emotions tied to the breakup event, such as heartache, frustration, and a sense of liberation, to capture the pop punk vibe.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The emotional tone of the song will be raw and angsty, reflecting the intense feelings of a breakup. Key emotions include:  
- **Heartache**: The pain of losing someone I cared about deeply.  
- **Frustration**: Anger at how things ended and unresolved issues.  
- **Liberation**: A growing sense of freedom and self-discovery after the breakup.  
These emotions align with pop punk’s blend of vulnerability and defiance, ensuring the song feels authentic and relatable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Write a pop punk song about personal life.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select a specific personal life event (Completed: Chosen a recent breakup).  
  - Subgoal 2: Define the emotional tone and key feelings to convey (Completed: Heartache, frustration, liberation).

**Current Goal**: Structure the song with verses, chorus, and bridge, ensuring first person present tense.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To structure the song with verses, chorus, and bridge in first person present tense, work backward from the final song structure:  
1. The song must have a complete structure: intro, verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus, outro.  
2. Each section must use first person present tense to maintain immediacy.  
3. The verses will detail the breakup event and emotions, the chorus will emphasize the main feeling (liberation), and the bridge will reflect a turning point or realization.  
4. Ensure the structure supports addressing someone else (e.g., the ex-partner) and includes pop punk energy.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to draft lyrics with simple, direct language, addressing someone else. This will be achieved by writing verses, chorus, and bridge based on the breakup event, using first person present tense, and speaking directly to the ex-partner.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verse 1**:  
I sit in my room, the silence screams your name,  
Your words still burn, they’re fueling all my pain.  
I see your face in every shadowed wall,  
I’m breaking down, but I won’t take the fall.  

**Chorus**:  
I’m letting go, you’re just a ghost I knew,  
I’m finding me, no longer tied to you.  
This heart’s still bruised, but I’m breaking through,  
I’m moving on, there’s nothing left to prove.  

**Verse 2**:  
Your promises, they crumble in my hands,  
I’m done with dreams built on your sinking sand.  
I scream your name, but it don’t feel the same,  
I’m taking back the fire you tried to tame.  

**Bridge**:  
I thought you were my world, my everything,  
But now I see the truth, I’m spreading wings.  
You held me down, but I’m rising now,  
I’m louder than the doubts you left somehow.  

The lyrics use simple, direct language, address the ex-partner, and convey heartache, frustration, and liberation in first person present tense, aligning with pop punk’s emotional style.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the drafted lyrics. This will be achieved by ensuring they meet the script’s requirements: first person present tense, simple language, specific details, emotions, addressing someone else, and a strong chorus.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Checking the lyrics:  
- **First person present tense**: All sections (verses, chorus, bridge) use “I” and present tense (e.g., “I sit,” “I’m letting go”).  
- **Simple, direct language**: Words like “burn,” “scream,” “crumble” are straightforward and vivid.  
- **Specific details**: References to sitting in a room, replaying conversations, and crumbling promises add specificity.  
- **Emotions**: Heartache (“Your words still burn”), frustration (“I’m done with dreams”), and liberation (“I’m moving on”) are clear.  
- **Addressing someone else**: Lyrics speak directly to the ex-partner (e.g., “you’re just a ghost I knew”).  
- **Strong chorus**: The chorus emphasizes liberation (“I’m moving on, there’s nothing left to prove”) and repeats for impact.  
The lyrics meet all requirements, but the fun, energetic pop punk vibe needs enhancement in the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the subgoal for adding energetic, fun elements to ensure the song captures pop punk’s high-energy vibe:  
1. Original subgoal: Add energetic, fun elements typical of pop punk.  
2. Adjusted subgoal: Incorporate pop punk stylistic elements, such as fast-paced imagery, rebellious tone, and catchy, anthemic phrases in the chorus and bridge to enhance energy and fun.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate pop punk stylistic elements to enhance energy and fun. This will be achieved by revising lyrics to include fast-paced imagery, a rebellious tone, and catchy, anthemic phrases, especially in the chorus and bridge.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Revised lyrics with pop punk energy:  

**Verse 1**:  
I’m pacing my room, your name’s a jagged scar,  
Your lies hit hard, they crash my beat-up car.  
I see your shadow in this neon glow,  
I’m kicking free, I’m ready to explode.  

**Chorus**:  
I’m breaking loose, you’re just a faded scream,  
I’m chasing fire, I’m living my own dream.  
This heart’s alive, it’s tearing through the seams,  
I’m moving on, I’m louder than your schemes.  

**Verse 2**:  
Your promises, they’re dust in this old town,  
I’m done with chains, I’m burning your lies down.  
I scream your name, it’s lost in my guitar,  
I’m taking back the life you pushed too far.  

**Bridge**:  
You thought I’d break, you thought I’d never sing,  
But now I’m free, I’m cutting every string.  
I’m cranking up, the world’s gonna hear me now,  
This is my fight, I’m screaming it out loud.  

Changes include fast-paced imagery (“pacing,” “crash my beat-up car,” “neon glow”), a rebellious tone (“kicking free,” “burning your lies down”), and catchy, anthemic phrases (“I’m louder than your schemes,” “screaming it out loud”) to amplify the pop punk vibe.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to refine the chorus to emphasize the main point or feeling. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the main feeling (liberation) and chorus development to ensure the chorus is impactful.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Selected a breakup as the personal event, focusing on emotions like heartache, frustration, and liberation.  
- Step 4: Defined liberation as the key feeling to emphasize, aligning with pop punk’s defiant tone.  
- Step 7: Initial chorus: “I’m letting go, you’re just a ghost I knew, I’m finding me, no longer tied to you...” emphasizes liberation but lacks high energy.  
- Step 10: Revised chorus: “I’m breaking loose, you’re just a faded scream, I’m chasing fire, I’m living my own dream...” adds catchy, anthemic phrases and a rebellious tone.  
The chorus already emphasizes liberation, but further refinement can make it more memorable and punchy for pop punk impact.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to refine the chorus to emphasize the main point or feeling (liberation). This will be achieved by making the chorus more concise, punchy, and memorable while retaining its anthemic quality and addressing the ex-partner.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Refined Chorus**:  
I’m breaking free, you’re just a fading scream,  
I’m chasing fire, I’m living my own dream.  
No chains on me, I’m tearing through the night,  
I’m moving on, I’m ready for the fight.  

The refined chorus is shorter, uses punchy phrases (“fading scream,” “tearing through the night”), and reinforces liberation with a defiant, anthemic tone, making it more memorable and aligned with pop punk energy.  
[/IMP]
