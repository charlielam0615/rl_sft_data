### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to avoid spicy foods to reduce irritation of the stomach lining. This will be achieved by identifying spicy foods commonly consumed and planning meals without them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To avoid spicy foods:  
- Identify common spicy foods (e.g., chili, hot peppers, spicy sauces, curries).  
- Check ingredient labels for spices like cayenne, paprika, or black pepper.  
- Plan meals using mild flavors, such as herbs (basil, parsley) or non-spicy seasonings.  
- Communicate dietary needs to restaurants or hosts when eating out.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the avoidance of spicy foods is effective. This will be achieved by checking if meal plans and eating habits align with the goal of reducing acid reflux.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate the avoidance of spicy foods:  
- Review recent meals to confirm no spicy ingredients were consumed.  
- Monitor acid reflux symptoms to assess if frequency or severity has decreased.  
- If symptoms persist, double-check for hidden spices in processed foods or restaurant meals.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Refine the next subgoal (identify and avoid other trigger foods) by breaking it into actionable steps.  
- Identify common non-spicy trigger foods for acid reflux (e.g., citrus, tomatoes, caffeine, fatty foods).  
- Create a list of safe foods to replace triggers.  
- Update meal plans to exclude trigger foods.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify and avoid other trigger foods for acid reflux. This will be achieved by researching trigger foods and adjusting meal plans accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To avoid other trigger foods:  
- Research shows common triggers include citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, caffeine, and high-fat foods.  
- Create a list of safe alternatives: lean proteins (chicken, fish), non-citrus fruits (bananas, apples), and whole grains.  
- Update weekly meal plan to exclude trigger foods, e.g., replace coffee with herbal tea and avoid fried foods.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system with progress and state the current goal.  
- **Goal**: Prevent acid reflux during pregnancy  
  - Subgoal 1: Avoid spicy foods to reduce irritation of the stomach lining. *(Completed)*  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and avoid other trigger foods for acid reflux. *(In Progress)*  
  - Subgoal 3: Adopt eating habits that minimize acid reflux (smaller, frequent meals; thorough chewing).  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate post-meal practices (drink milk, avoid lying down immediately).  
  - Subgoal 5: Support digestive health (stay active, manage stress).  
**Current Goal**: Adopt eating habits that minimize acid reflux (Subgoal 3).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to adopt eating habits that minimize acid reflux, specifically eating smaller, more frequent meals and chewing food well. This will be achieved by restructuring meal schedules and focusing on mindful eating.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To adopt better eating habits:  
- Plan 5–6 small meals per day instead of 3 large ones (e.g., breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner).  
- Chew food slowly, aiming for 20–30 chews per bite to aid digestion.  
- Set reminders for meal times to maintain consistency.  
- Keep portions small to avoid overloading the stomach.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to adopt post-meal practices (drink milk, avoid lying down). Retrieve past information related to eating habits and trigger foods to ensure alignment with these practices.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Summarize information related to the current goal:  
- Previous steps confirmed spicy foods and non-spicy triggers (citrus, caffeine, fatty foods) should be avoided to reduce acid reflux.  
- Smaller, frequent meals and thorough chewing (Step 8) support digestion, aligning with post-meal practices to prevent stomach overload.  
- No prior mention of milk or lying down, but these practices complement avoiding triggers and improving digestion.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate post-meal practices, specifically drinking a small glass of milk and avoiding lying down after meals. This will be achieved by integrating these habits into daily routines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To incorporate post-meal practices:  
- Drink a small glass (4–6 oz) of low-fat or non-dairy milk (e.g., almond milk) after each meal to neutralize stomach acid.  
- Wait at least 2–3 hours after eating before lying down to allow digestion.  
- Use a timer or schedule activities (e.g., light walking, reading) post-meal to stay upright.  
[/IMP]
