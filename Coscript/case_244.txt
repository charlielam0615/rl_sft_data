### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the Messenger app on the Android device. This will be achieved by locating the Messenger app icon on the home screen or app drawer and tapping it to launch the app.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the Messenger app icon on the Android device’s home screen or app drawer. Tap the icon to open the app. Ensure the app loads successfully. This step should take less than 1 minute, aligning with the constraint of under 1 hour per day.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the next goal in the sequence.  

[/PLANNING]

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Messenger app, locate the "People" tab, typically found at the bottom or top of the screen (often represented by an icon of two people or labeled "People"). Tap the tab to enter the "People" section. This step should take less than 30 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the "All People" list. This will be achieved by tapping the "All People" option within the "People" section of the Messenger app.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the "People" section, find and tap the "All People" option to display the full list of contacts. This option is typically available as a tab or menu item. This step should take less than 30 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select a contact to delete by tapping the "i" in a circle next to their name. This will be achieved by identifying the target contact in the "All People" list and tapping the info icon next to their name.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the "All People" list, scroll to find the contact you want to delete. Tap the "i" in a circle (info icon) next to their name to access their contact details. This step should take approximately 1 minute per contact.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to delete the selected contact. This will be achieved by tapping the "Delete" option in the contact’s details screen.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
On the contact’s details screen, locate and tap the "Delete" option (may appear as "Delete Contact" or similar). Confirm the deletion if prompted. This step should take less than 30 seconds per contact.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to delete additional contacts within the 1-hour daily limit. Retrieve information from previous steps to confirm the process for deleting contacts and the time constraint.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Delete additional contacts within the 1-hour daily limit.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Steps 6–9 outline the process: Navigate to "People" (30 seconds), access "All People" (30 seconds), select a contact via the "i" icon (1 minute), and delete the contact (30 seconds). Total time per contact: ~2.5 minutes.  
- Constraint: All actions must be completed within 1 hour per day. At ~2.5 minutes per contact, approximately 24 contacts can be deleted within 60 minutes.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the subgoals to account for the time constraint and ensure efficient repetition for multiple contacts.  

- Subgoal 1: Open the Messenger app on the Android device. (Completed)  
- Subgoal 2: Navigate to the "People" section. (Completed)  
- Subgoal 3: Access the "All People" list. (Completed)  
- Subgoal 4: For each contact (up to 24 per day, based on ~2.5 minutes per contact):  
  - Select a contact by tapping the "i" in a circle.  
  - Delete the selected contact.  
- Subgoal 5: Track time to ensure the process stays under 1 hour per day.  
- Subgoal 6: Verify that the contacts were deleted successfully.  

[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to delete up to 24 contacts by repeating the deletion process, tracking time to stay under 1 hour. This will be achieved by iterating through the "All People" list, selecting and deleting contacts as described in previous steps.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the "All People" list, repeat the following for each contact (up to 24):  
1. Tap the "i" in a circle next to a contact’s name (~1 minute).  
2. Tap "Delete" and confirm if prompted (~30 seconds).  
Track the time spent using a timer or clock to ensure the total time does not exceed 60 minutes. Stop after deleting 24 contacts or when nearing the 1-hour limit.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the contacts were deleted successfully. This will be achieved by checking the "All People" list to ensure the deleted contacts no longer appear.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Return to the "All People" list in the Messenger app. Scroll through or search for the contacts deleted in the previous step to confirm they are no longer listed. If any contacts still appear, repeat the deletion process for those contacts. This verification should take approximately 5–10 minutes, depending on the number of contacts checked.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm that all subgoals have been addressed.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Delete Messenger contacts on Android within 1 hour per day.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Messenger app on the Android device. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the "People" section. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Access the "All People" list. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: For each contact (up to 24 per day):  
    - Select a contact by tapping the "i" in a circle. (Completed)  
    - Delete the selected contact. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Track time to ensure the process stays under 1 hour per day. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 6: Verify that the contacts were deleted successfully. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed. The plan to delete Messenger contacts within 1 hour per day is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Summary**: The plan to delete Messenger contacts on an Android device within 1 hour per day has been completed. The process involves opening the Messenger app, navigating to the "All People" list, deleting up to 24 contacts per day (each taking ~2.5 minutes), and verifying the deletions, all while adhering to the time constraint.
