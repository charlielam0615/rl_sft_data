**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for editing a PDF file in Preview, adhering to the provided script and the meta-cognitive action set framework. The task must be performed within the Preview application, following the ordered steps: open the PDF, access the Markup Toolbar, select and edit text using the Rectangular Selection tool, highlight text, add a note, and export the file with reduced size using the Quartz Filter. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step, categorized as Planning, Implementation, or Review, and follow the specified formatting with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of editing a PDF in Preview into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:
1. Open the PDF in Preview.
2. Edit text using the Markup Toolbar and Rectangular Selection tool.
3. Highlight text using the Annotate Toolbar.
4. Add a note using the Annotate Toolbar.
5. Export the file with reduced size using the Share Toolbar and Quartz Filter.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Edit a PDF file in Preview.
  - Subgoal 1: Open the PDF in Preview.
  - Subgoal 2: Edit text using the Markup Toolbar and Rectangular Selection tool.
  - Subgoal 3: Highlight text using the Annotate Toolbar.
  - Subgoal 4: Add a note using the Annotate Toolbar.
  - Subgoal 5: Export the file with reduced size using the Share Toolbar and Quartz Filter.

**Current Goal**: Open the PDF in Preview.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Open the PDF in Preview.
**How to Achieve**: Locate the PDF file on the computer and double-click it to open it in the Preview application, which is the default PDF viewer on macOS.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate the PDF file in Finder or on the desktop. Double-click the file, and it will automatically open in Preview, as Preview is the default application for PDFs on macOS.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Edit text using the Markup Toolbar and Rectangular Selection tool.
**How to Achieve**: Activate the Markup Toolbar in Preview, select the Rectangular Selection tool, select the target text, and type the new text.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In Preview, click the Markup Toolbar button (a pencil icon) in the top-right corner to display the editing tools. Select the Rectangular Selection tool from the toolbar. Click and drag over the text area to select the text you want to edit. Type the new text to replace the selected content.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Ensure the text edit was applied correctly.
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the new text appears correctly in the PDF and that no unintended changes were made.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the edited section in Preview to confirm that the new text replaced the selected content accurately. Check that the formatting and surrounding content remain intact.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)
**Current Goal**: Highlight text using the Annotate Toolbar.
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information about the tools available in Preview’s Annotate Toolbar to ensure the correct tool is used for highlighting.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Previous content indicates that after editing text, the next step involves using the Annotate Toolbar to highlight text. The Annotate Toolbar in Preview includes tools like the Highlight tool, which can be used to mark text for emphasis. This aligns with the script’s step to select the Highlight tool.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Highlight text using the Annotate Toolbar.
**How to Achieve**: Access the Annotate Toolbar, select the Highlight tool, and apply highlighting to the desired text.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In Preview, click the Annotate Toolbar button if not already active. Select the Highlight tool (typically a highlighter pen icon). Click and drag over the text you want to highlight to apply the highlighting effect.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Add a note using the Annotate Toolbar.
**How to Achieve**: Select the Note tool from the Annotate Toolbar, create a note in the desired location, and type the note content.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the Annotate Toolbar, select the Note tool (usually a sticky note icon). Click and drag on the PDF to place the note. Type the desired note content in the note box that appears.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
The current subgoal for exporting involves multiple steps (accessing the Share Toolbar, selecting File, Export, Quartz Filter, and Reduce File Size). Adjust this subgoal to break it into smaller, manageable subgoals:
1. Access the Share Toolbar and initiate export.
2. Apply the Quartz Filter to reduce file size.
3. Save the file.
[/PLANNING]

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate the exported PDF in Finder. Right-click the file, select “Get Info,” and check the file size to confirm it is smaller than the original. Open the PDF in Preview to ensure all edits (text, highlight, note) are intact.
