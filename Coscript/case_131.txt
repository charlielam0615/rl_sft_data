### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Get comfortable with the poem’s sound.  
**How to Achieve:** Read the poem aloud multiple times to familiarize yourself with its rhythm, tone, and pronunciation, focusing on the auditory experience without worrying about memorization yet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve familiarity with the poem’s sound, select a quiet environment to avoid distractions. Read the poem aloud at least three times, paying attention to its flow and sound patterns. If possible, listen to a recording of the poem to reinforce the auditory experience. This step builds a foundation for memorization by making the poem’s sound feel natural.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Get comfortable with the poem’s sound.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that you can read the poem aloud smoothly without stumbling over words or rhythms, indicating familiarity with its sound.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test your familiarity by reading the poem aloud once more without hesitation or errors in pronunciation. If you stumble or feel unsure, repeat the reading process a few more times. Confirm that the poem’s rhythm and tone feel natural when spoken.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the subgoals to ensure they align with the constraint of reciting aloud. The original subgoals are appropriate, but refine Subgoal 5 (practice in front of a mirror) to explicitly emphasize reciting aloud to reinforce the constraint. Adjusted Subgoal 5: Practice reciting the poem aloud from memory in front of a mirror to enhance confidence and delivery.
[/PLANNING]

  - **Subgoal 1:** Get comfortable with the poem’s sound (completed).
  - **Subgoal 2:** Break the poem into manageable sections.
  - **Subgoal 3:** Recite the poem aloud slowly.
  - **Subgoal 4:** Repeat each section until memorized.
  - **Subgoal 5:** Practice reciting the poem aloud from memory in front of a mirror.
  - **Subgoal 6:** Increase recitation speed.
  - **Subgoal 7:** Add inflection and feeling to the recitation.

**Current Goal:** Break the poem into manageable sections.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Break the poem into manageable sections.  
**How to Achieve:** Divide the poem into smaller parts, such as stanzas or groups of lines, to make memorization easier by focusing on one section at a time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Analyze the poem’s structure and divide it into logical sections, such as individual stanzas or groups of 4–6 lines, depending on the poem’s length. Write down or highlight each section to visually distinguish them. Ensure each section is short enough to memorize independently while maintaining the poem’s flow when recited aloud.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Recite the poem aloud slowly.  
**How to Achieve:** Read each section aloud at a slow pace, focusing on clarity and correct pronunciation to build familiarity with the words.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take one section at a time and recite it aloud slowly, emphasizing each word to ensure accuracy. Repeat the section 2–3 times, checking against the text to confirm correctness. Move to the next section only after reciting the current one comfortably.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to breaking the poem into sections and reciting aloud slowly to ensure progress aligns with previous steps.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:**
- In Step 7, the poem was divided into manageable sections (e.g., stanzas or groups of lines) to facilitate memorization.
- In Step 8, each section is recited aloud slowly to ensure clarity and accuracy, building on the familiarity established in Step 3.
This confirms that the current approach of reciting sections aloud slowly aligns with the structured breakdown and auditory focus established earlier.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Repeat each section until memorized.  
**How to Achieve:** Recite each section aloud multiple times, gradually reducing reliance on the text until you can recite it from memory.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For each section, recite it aloud 3–5 times while looking at the text, then attempt to recite it without looking. If errors occur, check the text and repeat until you can recite the section accurately without assistance. Combine sections gradually to recite larger portions from memory.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Practice reciting the poem aloud from memory in front of a mirror.  
**How to Achieve:** Recite the entire poem aloud from memory while observing yourself in a mirror to build confidence and monitor delivery.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Stand in front of a mirror and recite the poem aloud from memory, starting with individual sections and progressing to the full poem. Observe your facial expressions and posture to ensure a confident delivery. If you forget a line, refer to the text briefly and try again until the full poem is recited smoothly.
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Increase recitation speed.  
**How to Achieve:** Recite the poem aloud from memory at a gradually faster pace, maintaining accuracy and clarity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recite the poem aloud from memory at a comfortable pace, then incrementally increase the speed with each repetition. Focus on maintaining clear pronunciation and correct wording. If mistakes occur, slow down slightly and repeat until the faster pace is consistent and accurate.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Add inflection and feeling to the recitation.  
**How to Achieve:** Recite the poem aloud with emphasis on tone, emotion, and pauses to convey its meaning and enhance delivery.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Analyze the poem’s content to identify emotional cues and natural pauses. Recite the poem aloud, varying your tone and inflection to match the poem’s mood (e.g., joyful, somber). Practice 3–5 times, adjusting emphasis to make the recitation expressive while maintaining memorized accuracy.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Add inflection and feeling to the recitation.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that the poem can be recited aloud from memory with accurate wording, appropriate speed, and expressive inflection.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recite the poem aloud from memory in front of a mirror or another person, ensuring all words are correct, the pace is natural, and the delivery includes appropriate inflection and emotion. If any aspect is lacking, revisit the relevant step (e.g., Step 10 for memorization, Step 12 for speed, or Step 13 for inflection) and practice further.
