### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of dyeing hair brunette using coffee, break down the task into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare coffee suitable for hair application.  
2. Apply the coffee mixture to the hair evenly.  
3. Allow the coffee to set in the hair for 30 minutes to promote color absorption.  
4. Rinse the hair to remove excess coffee while retaining the brunette tint.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the process.

### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Dye hair brunette using coffee.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare coffee suitable for hair application.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the coffee mixture to the hair evenly.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the coffee to set in the hair for 30 minutes to promote color absorption.  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the hair to remove excess coffee while retaining the brunette tint.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare coffee suitable for hair application.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare coffee suitable for hair application.  
**How to Achieve**: Brew strong coffee using a high coffee-to-water ratio to ensure a dark, concentrated liquid that can effectively tint the hair brunette. Allow the coffee to cool to avoid scalp burns.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare coffee for hair dyeing:  
1. Use 4 tablespoons of ground coffee (preferably dark roast for deeper color) per 1 cup of water.  
2. Brew the coffee using a coffee maker or stovetop method.  
3. Let the coffee cool to room temperature to ensure it is safe for application.  
This step ensures a potent coffee mixture that aligns with the goal of achieving a brunette tint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare coffee suitable for hair application.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the brewed coffee is strong, dark, and cooled to room temperature to confirm it meets the requirements for hair application.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the coffee preparation:  
1. Observe the coffee’s color; it should be dark brown to black, indicating sufficient strength for dyeing.  
2. Test the temperature with a finger or thermometer to ensure it’s at room temperature (approximately 20-25°C) to prevent scalp discomfort or burns.  
3. Confirm the volume is sufficient (at least 2 cups for shoulder-length hair) to cover the hair adequately.  
The coffee meets the criteria for the next step of application.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the coffee mixture to the hair evenly.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour the cooled coffee over the hair, ensuring even coverage, and massage it into the strands to maximize contact with the hair for effective dyeing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To apply the coffee:  
1. Place a towel around the shoulders to protect clothing and skin.  
2. Pour the cooled coffee slowly over dry or slightly damp hair in sections, starting from the roots to the tips.  
3. Massage the coffee into the hair to ensure even distribution.  
4. Use a comb to spread the coffee uniformly if needed.  
This ensures the coffee coats all hair strands to achieve a consistent brunette color.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of allowing the coffee to set in the hair for 30 minutes, focusing on the purpose of this step and any relevant details from prior steps that inform the process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Allow the coffee to set in the hair for 30 minutes to promote color absorption.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 1 (Forward Subgoaling): The subgoal of leaving coffee in the hair for 30 minutes was set to allow sufficient time for the coffee’s pigments to penetrate the hair and create a brunette tint.  
- From Step 5 (Reach Goal): The coffee was applied evenly to maximize contact with the hair, which supports the need for a setting period to ensure effective dyeing.  
This step is critical for the coffee’s natural dyes to bond with the hair, enhancing the brunette color outcome.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Allow the coffee to set in the hair for 30 minutes to promote color absorption.  
**How to Achieve**: Keep the coffee-soaked hair undisturbed for 30 minutes, optionally covering it to prevent dripping and enhance absorption.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To allow the coffee to set:  
1. Wrap the hair in a shower cap or plastic wrap to keep the coffee in place and prevent dripping.  
2. Set a timer for 30 minutes to ensure the coffee remains on the hair for the required duration.  
3. Avoid touching or rinsing the hair during this period to allow the coffee’s pigments to penetrate the hair strands.  
This step maximizes the dyeing effect for a brunette result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the final subgoal (rinse the hair) to ensure it aligns with achieving a brunette tint. Adjust the subgoal to specify rinsing with cool water to preserve the color and prevent fading, as hot water might strip the coffee’s pigments.  
**Adjusted Subgoal**: Rinse the hair with cool water to remove excess coffee while retaining the brunette tint.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the hair with cool water to remove excess coffee while retaining the brunette tint.  
**How to Achieve**: Rinse the hair thoroughly with cool water to remove coffee residue while preserving the brunette color, then dry and assess the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To rinse the hair:  
1. Rinse the hair under cool running water (15-20°C) until the water runs clear, indicating all excess coffee is removed.  
2. Gently squeeze out excess water and pat the hair dry with a towel.  
3. Check the hair color in natural light to confirm the brunette tint.  
This completes the dyeing process, achieving the desired brunette hair color.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the hair with cool water to remove excess coffee while retaining the brunette tint.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the hair has a brunette tint and no coffee residue remains, ensuring the dyeing process was successful.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the rinsing and dyeing outcome:  
1. Inspect the hair for any remaining coffee residue; it should feel clean and non-sticky.  
2. Observe the hair color under natural or bright light to confirm a brunette shade.  
3. If the color is not dark enough, note that the process may need to be repeated for a stronger effect.  
The hair should now exhibit a brunette tint, confirming the success of the dyeing process.  
[/IMP]
