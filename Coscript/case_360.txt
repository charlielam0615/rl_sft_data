### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to locate the specific land or area of interest within Google Earth. This will be achieved by using the search functionality to find the desired location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Google Earth interface, locate the search bar. Enter the name, address, or coordinates of the desired land or area (e.g., “Mount Everest” or “40.7128°N, 74.0060°W”). Press Enter to navigate to the specified location on the map.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the correct land or area has been located in Google Earth. This will be achieved by visually confirming the map displays the intended location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the map displays the correct area by checking landmarks, geographical features, or coordinates against known information about the location. Zoom in or out to confirm the area matches expectations. If incorrect, refine the search query and try again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the next goal after locating the area.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Obtain topography data from Google Earth using an internet connection.  
  - Subgoal 1: Establish a stable internet connection to access online resources (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Access the Google Earth website to begin the topography retrieval process (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Locate the specific land or area of interest within Google Earth (Completed).

[/REVIEW]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to configure the map settings in Google Earth to focus on the desired area for topography analysis. This will be achieved by adjusting the map view to display topographic details.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Google Earth interface, use the zoom and tilt controls to adjust the map view for optimal topographic visibility. Enable the “Terrain” layer (if available) via the layers menu to emphasize elevation and topographic features. Adjust the perspective to a 3D view if necessary for better visualization.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the map settings are correctly configured to display topographic details. This will be achieved by confirming the visibility of elevation and terrain features.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if the map displays clear topographic features, such as elevation contours or 3D terrain. Interact with the map to ensure the view is suitable for topography analysis (e.g., hills, valleys, or slopes are visible). If topographic details are unclear, adjust the terrain layer settings or zoom level.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the next goal after configuring the map settings.

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to extract and interpret the topography data from the configured map view in Google Earth. This will be achieved by analyzing the visible terrain features and, if needed, using available tools to export or record topographic data.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Analyze the map to identify key topographic features, such as elevation changes, slopes, or landforms. Use Google Earth’s measurement tools (e.g., elevation profile or ruler) to quantify topographic data if precise measurements are needed. Optionally, take screenshots or export the map view for documentation. Record observations, such as highest/lowest points or terrain characteristics, to complete the topography analysis.  
[/IMP]

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the extracted topography data is accurate and complete. This will be achieved by cross-checking the data against expectations or additional sources.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the extracted topographic data (e.g., elevation profiles, screenshots, or notes) to ensure it aligns with the expected characteristics of the area. If available, compare with external topographic data sources (e.g., USGS maps) to validate accuracy. If discrepancies are found, revisit the map view or refine the search and configuration steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
