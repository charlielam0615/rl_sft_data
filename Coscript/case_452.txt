### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Schedule a vet visit to initiate the process.  
- **How to Achieve**: Contact a veterinarian to book an appointment, ensuring the visit is scheduled at a convenient time and the vet is informed that the visit includes a hoof assessment.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To schedule a vet visit, identify a qualified equine veterinarian in your area. Call or email their office to book an appointment, specifying that the visit is to evaluate whether your horse needs shoes. Provide details such as the horse’s breed, age, and any observed hoof issues (e.g., cracks, uneven wear). Confirm the appointment time and any preparation requirements, such as ensuring the horse is accessible and calm.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the vet visit is properly scheduled.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the appointment is confirmed and that the vet understands the purpose of the visit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the appointment confirmation from the veterinarian’s office (e.g., email or phone confirmation). Ensure the vet is aware that the visit includes a hoof assessment to determine if shoes are needed. If necessary, follow up to clarify any details, such as the horse’s condition or specific concerns about its hooves.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of discussing concerns with the vet to provide context for the hoof assessment. The core content is the need to communicate relevant details about the horse’s hoof condition and activity level.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Discuss concerns with the vet to provide context.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 1 (Forward Subgoaling): The process includes discussing concerns with the vet to provide context for the hoof assessment.  
- From Step 3 (Reach Goal): Details about the horse’s breed, age, and observed hoof issues (e.g., cracks, uneven wear) were noted as relevant for the vet visit.  
This information ensures the discussion with the vet is focused on the horse’s hoof condition and any factors influencing the need for shoes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Discuss concerns with the vet to provide context.  
- **How to Achieve**: Prepare a list of concerns about the horse’s hooves and activity level, and communicate these clearly during the vet visit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
During the vet visit, explain any observed issues with the horse’s hooves, such as cracks, sensitivity, or uneven wear. Mention the horse’s activity level (e.g., trail riding, competition, or pasture use) and any recent changes in behavior or performance that might relate to hoof health. Ask the vet to consider these factors when evaluating the need for shoes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Request a hoof examination to assess the need for shoes.  
- **How to Achieve**: Ask the vet to thoroughly inspect the horse’s hooves and provide a professional opinion on whether shoes are necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Request that the veterinarian perform a detailed examination of the horse’s hooves, checking for signs of wear, cracks, or imbalances. Ask specific questions, such as whether the horse’s current hoof condition warrants shoes, considering its workload and environment. Ensure the vet explains their findings clearly.  
[/IMP]

- Main Goal: Determine if the horse needs shoes for a vet visit.  
  - Subgoal 1: Schedule a vet visit to initiate the process (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Discuss concerns with the vet to provide context (In Progress).  
  - Subgoal 3: Request a hoof examination to assess the need for shoes (In Progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Implement the vet’s recommendations to finalize the decision.  
**Current Goal**: Implement the vet’s recommendations to finalize the decision.  
The hierarchy reflects progress, with the first subgoal completed and the second and third in progress, leading to the final subgoal.

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Implement the vet’s recommendations to finalize the decision.  
- **How to Achieve**: Follow the vet’s advice regarding whether to shoe the horse, including arranging for a farrier if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Based on the vet’s assessment, proceed with their recommendations. If shoes are advised, contact a qualified farrier to fit them, ensuring they match the vet’s specifications (e.g., type of shoe, frequency of replacement). If shoes are not needed, follow any alternative care suggestions, such as trimming schedules or hoof supplements. Monitor the horse’s hoof health post-visit to ensure the recommendations are effective.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the vet’s recommendations are correctly implemented.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the actions taken align with the vet’s advice and that the horse’s hoof condition is addressed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the farrier’s work (if shoes were recommended) matches the vet’s specifications or that alternative care measures (e.g., trimming, supplements) are in place. Observe the horse for improved comfort or performance, and schedule follow-up vet visits if needed to ensure ongoing hoof health.
