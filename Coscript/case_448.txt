### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for cutting sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces, as part of preparing sweet potato fries, while adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The constraint is that the sweet potatoes must be cut into bite-sized pieces. The provided script outlines the steps: preheat the oven, peel and cut sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces, toss with olive oil and salt, spread on a baking sheet, and bake. The plan will focus on the cutting step but consider the full context to ensure a comprehensive approach.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of cutting sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.  
- Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools (knife, cutting board, peeler).  
- Subgoal 2: Peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin.  
- Subgoal 3: Cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the size and uniformity of the pieces to meet the bite-sized constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather necessary tools (knife, cutting board, peeler) to enable peeling and cutting. This will be achieved by identifying and collecting the required kitchen tools.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Identify a sharp chef’s knife for precise cutting.  
- Select a sturdy cutting board with a non-slip surface.  
- Choose a vegetable peeler for efficient skin removal.  
- Place all tools on the countertop for easy access.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cut sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin (current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the size and uniformity of the pieces.  
**Current Goal**: Peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin. This will be achieved by using the vegetable peeler to carefully remove the outer skin of the sweet potatoes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Rinse the sweet potatoes under cold water to remove dirt.  
- Hold a sweet potato firmly and use the vegetable peeler to remove the skin in long, even strokes.  
- Rotate the sweet potato to ensure all sides are peeled.  
- Repeat for all sweet potatoes.  
- Collect and discard the peels.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the sweet potatoes are fully peeled. This will be achieved by inspecting each sweet potato to ensure no skin remains.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Visually inspect each sweet potato for any remaining skin patches.  
- Feel the surface for smoothness to confirm complete peeling.  
- If any skin remains, use the peeler to remove it.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cut sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces (current).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the size and uniformity of the pieces.  
**Current Goal**: Cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces. This will be achieved by using the chef’s knife to cut the peeled sweet potatoes into pieces approximately 1/2 inch in size.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Place a peeled sweet potato on the cutting board.  
- Use the chef’s knife to cut the sweet potato lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  
- Stack the slices and cut them into 1/2-inch wide strips.  
- Cut the strips crosswise into 1/2-inch cubes to create bite-sized pieces.  
- Repeat for all sweet potatoes, ensuring consistency in size.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the size and uniformity of the cut pieces. Retrieve information related to the bite-sized constraint and cutting process to ensure compliance.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- The constraint specifies that the sweet potatoes must be cut into bite-sized pieces, typically 1/2 inch in size for uniform cooking.  
- Previous steps (Step 7) described cutting the sweet potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes to meet this constraint.  
- Uniformity is critical for even baking, as outlined in the script’s baking step (Step 5 of the script).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the size and uniformity of the cut sweet potato pieces. This will be achieved by measuring and inspecting the pieces to ensure they meet the 1/2-inch bite-sized standard.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Use a ruler to measure a sample of cut pieces, confirming they are approximately 1/2 inch in size.  
- Visually inspect the pieces to ensure uniformity in shape and size.  
- If any pieces are significantly larger or smaller, trim them to match the 1/2-inch standard.  
- Confirm that all pieces are consistent for even cooking.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cut sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather necessary tools (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Peel the sweet potatoes to remove the skin (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the sweet potatoes into uniform bite-sized pieces (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the size and uniformity of the pieces (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The main goal of cutting sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces has been achieved, with all pieces peeled, cut, and verified for uniformity and size.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to cut sweet potato fries into bite-sized pieces is complete. All subgoals—gathering tools, peeling, cutting, and verifying—have been addressed, ensuring the sweet potatoes are uniformly cut into approximately 1/2-inch pieces, ready for the next steps in the provided script (tossing with olive oil and salt, spreading on a baking sheet, and baking).
