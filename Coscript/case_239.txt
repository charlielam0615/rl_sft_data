**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make cookie butter in the microwave, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response must use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, ensuring all content aligns with the microwave constraint and the script: ['1. Microwave the cookies until they are soft.', '2. Use a fork to mash the cookies.', '3. Add the butter, sugar, and milk.', '4. Microwave the mixture for 30 seconds.', '5. Stir the mixture and microwave for 30 more seconds.', '6. Enjoy your cookie butter!'].

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making cookie butter in the microwave into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Soften cookies in the microwave.  
2. Mash the softened cookies.  
3. Combine cookies with butter, sugar, and milk to form a mixture.  
4. Heat the mixture in the microwave for 30 seconds.  
5. Stir the mixture and heat again for 30 seconds.  
6. Finalize the cookie butter for consumption.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make cookie butter in the microwave.  
  - Subgoal 1: Soften cookies in the microwave.  
  - Subgoal 2: Mash the softened cookies.  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine cookies with butter, sugar, and milk.  
  - Subgoal 4: Heat the mixture for 30 seconds.  
  - Subgoal 5: Stir and heat the mixture again for 30 seconds.  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the cookie butter for consumption.  
**Current Goal**: Soften cookies in the microwave (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to soften cookies in the microwave. This will be achieved by placing the cookies in a microwave-safe container and heating them until soft, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the cookies in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 20-30 seconds, checking frequently to ensure they are soft but not melted or burned.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the cookies are softened as intended. This will be achieved by checking the texture of the cookies after microwaving.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the bowl from the microwave and touch the cookies to verify they are soft and pliable, suitable for mashing. If they are not soft, microwave for an additional 10 seconds and recheck.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mash the softened cookies. This will be achieved by using a fork to break down the cookies into a fine consistency, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a fork, mash the softened cookies in the microwave-safe bowl until they form a crumbly, uniform texture. Ensure no large chunks remain.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the mashed cookies with butter, sugar, and milk. This will be achieved by adding these ingredients to the mashed cookies and mixing thoroughly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add 2 tablespoons of softened butter, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1-2 tablespoons of milk to the mashed cookies. Stir the mixture until all ingredients are well combined into a smooth paste.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to heat the mixture in the microwave for 30 seconds. Retrieve information from previous steps related to microwave use to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps involving the microwave (Step 3) indicate using a microwave-safe bowl and heating on high for short intervals (20-30 seconds) to avoid burning. This suggests the current step should follow similar precautions, using the same container and monitoring closely during heating.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to microwave the mixture for 30 seconds. This will be achieved by heating the combined mixture in the microwave-safe bowl.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the bowl with the cookie mixture in the microwave. Heat on high for 30 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to stir the mixture and microwave it for an additional 30 seconds. This will be achieved by mixing the heated mixture to ensure even consistency and then heating again.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir the mixture thoroughly to blend any melted butter or sugar. Return the bowl to the microwave and heat on high for another 30 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the cookie butter has the desired consistency after the final heating. This will be achieved by checking the texture and ensuring it is smooth and spreadable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the bowl from the microwave. Stir the mixture and check that it has a smooth, spreadable consistency, similar to peanut butter. If itâ€™s too thick, add a teaspoon of milk and stir; if too thin, microwave for an additional 10-15 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 11**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been addressed.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make cookie butter in the microwave.  
  - Subgoal 1: Soften cookies in the microwave (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Mash the softened cookies (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine cookies with butter, sugar, and milk (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Heat the mixture for 30 seconds (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Stir and heat the mixture again for 30 seconds (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the cookie butter for consumption (Current).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the cookie butter for consumption. All prior subgoals have been completed, and the mixture should now be ready for enjoyment.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 12**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the cookie butter for consumption. This will be achieved by transferring the mixture to a serving container or consuming it directly, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Transfer the cookie butter to a small jar or bowl for storage or serve immediately with toast, crackers, or as desired. Enjoy your cookie butter!  
[/IMP]

**Conclusion**: The plan to make cookie butter in the microwave has been completed by following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed through a combination of planning, implementation, and review actions, ensuring the process was systematic and aligned with the constraint of using the microwave.
