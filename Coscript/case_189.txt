### Step 2: Organize and Track the Goal Hierarchy

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to track the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Reduce menstrual cramps with exercise.  
  - Subgoal 1: Incorporate aerobic exercise to improve blood flow and reduce cramping.  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform strength training to enhance muscle resilience and reduce pain perception.  
  - Subgoal 3: Practice yoga or Pilates to promote relaxation and flexibility.  
  - Subgoal 4: Include stretching to relieve muscle tension and improve comfort.  
**Current Goal**: Incorporate aerobic exercise to improve blood flow and reduce cramping (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in Step 1 and sets the focus for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Implement Aerobic Exercise

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate aerobic exercise to improve blood flow and reduce menstrual cramps. This will be achieved by selecting low-impact aerobic activities suitable for someone experiencing menstrual discomfort, such as brisk walking or cycling, for 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times per week.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, engage in low-impact aerobic exercises like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Aim for 20-30 minutes per session, 3-4 times per week, at a moderate intensity (heart rate at 50-70% of maximum). These activities increase blood circulation, which can reduce menstrual cramp severity. Start with a 5-minute warm-up and ensure proper hydration. If discomfort persists, adjust intensity or duration.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validate the Aerobic Exercise Approach

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the aerobic exercise approach for reducing menstrual cramps. This will be achieved by checking if the selected exercises are suitable, feasible, and aligned with the goal of improving blood flow and reducing pain.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that brisk walking, cycling, or swimming (20-30 minutes, 3-4 times per week) is appropriate for individuals with menstrual cramps. These exercises are low-impact, widely accessible, and promote blood flow, which aligns with reducing cramp severity. Confirm that the duration and frequency are manageable and that no medical contraindications exist (e.g., consult a doctor if severe pain or conditions like endometriosis are present). The approach is valid as it aligns with health guidelines for exercise during menstruation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Review Progress and Recall Information

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate aerobic exercise to reduce menstrual cramps. Retrieve past information related to the aerobic exercise subgoal to ensure the plan is on track and to identify any additional considerations.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Recalling information from previous steps:  
- Step 1 established aerobic exercise as Subgoal 1 to improve blood flow and reduce cramping.  
- Step 3 implemented aerobic exercises (brisk walking, cycling, swimming) for 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times per week, at moderate intensity.  
- Step 4 validated the approach as suitable and feasible, emphasizing low-impact activities and medical consultation if needed.  
Additional consideration: Ensure exercises are performed in a comfortable environment, and monitor for fatigue or increased discomfort, adjusting as necessary. The plan for Subgoal 1 is consistent and progressing appropriately.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals for Next Phase

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review and refine the remaining subgoals to ensure they are specific and actionable:  
- Subgoal 2: Perform strength training, focusing on core and lower body exercises (e.g., bodyweight squats, planks) for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times per week, to enhance muscle resilience.  
- Subgoal 3: Practice yoga or Pilates, emphasizing poses like child’s pose or pelvic tilts, for 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times per week, to promote relaxation.  
- Subgoal 4: Include daily stretching routines, focusing on hip and lower back stretches, for 10-15 minutes to relieve tension.  
These adjustments clarify the frequency, duration, and specific exercises for each subgoal, ensuring practicality.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7: Track Updated Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Updated goal hierarchy:  
- **Main Goal**: Reduce menstrual cramps with exercise.  
  - Subgoal 1: Incorporate aerobic exercise to improve blood flow and reduce cramping (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform strength training, focusing on core and lower body exercises for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times per week, to enhance muscle resilience.  
  - Subgoal 3: Practice yoga or Pilates, emphasizing poses like child’s pose or pelvic tilts, for 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times per week, to promote relaxation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Include daily stretching routines, focusing on hip and lower back stretches, for 10-15 minutes to relieve tension.  
**Current Goal**: Perform strength training to enhance muscle resilience (Subgoal 2).  
This reflects the adjusted subgoals from Step 6 and shifts focus to the next subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]
