### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Select a suitable location for the firepit.  
- **How to Achieve**: Choose a flat, open area in the backyard, at least 10 feet from structures or flammable materials, ensuring compliance with local fire safety regulations.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To select a suitable location, inspect the backyard for a level area with good drainage, ideally 10-15 feet away from buildings, trees, or other flammable objects. Check local regulations or homeowner association rules for firepit placement restrictions. Mark the chosen spot with stakes or chalk for reference.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the selected location for the firepit.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm the chosen spot meets safety and regulatory requirements and is suitable for construction.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Measure the distance from the marked spot to nearby structures, ensuring it’s at least 10 feet away. Verify the ground is level using a spirit level. Consult local fire codes or contact the fire department to confirm compliance. If the spot is non-compliant or uneven, consider an alternative location.

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the firepit’s dimensions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Decide on a circular or square firepit shape and calculate dimensions based on available space and typical cinder block sizes.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose a circular firepit for aesthetic appeal, with an inner diameter of 36 inches (outer diameter ~48 inches, accounting for cinder block width). Standard cinder blocks are 8x8x16 inches, so plan for approximately 12-14 blocks per layer for a 48-inch outer diameter. Confirm the dimensions fit the selected location by measuring the marked area.  

[/IMP]
