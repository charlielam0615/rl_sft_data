**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for writing legal briefs using OpenOffice on the desktop, following the provided script and constraints, and create a plan using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) until all plans are completed.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of writing legal briefs using OpenOffice on the desktop into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Launch OpenOffice and access the Writer application.  
- Subgoal 2: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief.  
- Subgoal 3: Save the legal brief to a specified location.  
- Subgoal 4: Print the legal brief if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Launch OpenOffice and access the Writer application.  
- **How to Achieve**: Double-click the OpenOffice icon on the desktop to open the application, then select the Writer icon from the Welcome Screen to start a new document.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Double-click the OpenOffice icon on the desktop. When the OpenOffice Welcome Screen appears, click the Writer icon to open a new, blank Writer document window.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Write legal briefs using OpenOffice on the desktop.  
  - Subgoal 1: Launch OpenOffice and access the Writer application (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Save the legal brief to a specified location (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Print the legal brief if needed (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief.  
- **How to Achieve**: Click in the blank Writer document to start typing and draft the legal brief content.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Click in the blank Writer document window where you want to start typing. Begin typing the legal brief content.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the legal brief is being drafted correctly in the Writer document.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the document is open, text can be entered, and the content aligns with the requirements of a legal brief.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify that the Writer document window is active and accepts text input. Review the typed content to ensure it meets the structure and requirements of a legal brief (e.g., proper headings, formatting, and legal terminology).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Save the legal brief to a specified location.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the File > Save As option to browse to a desired location, name the file, and save it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Click File > Save As in the OpenOffice Writer menu. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the desired location on the desktop or another folder. Enter a name for the legal brief in the File name text box, then click the Save button.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Write legal briefs using OpenOffice on the desktop.  
  - Subgoal 1: Launch OpenOffice and access the Writer application (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Save the legal brief to a specified location (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Print the legal brief if needed (Current).  
**Current Goal**: Print the legal brief if needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoal 4 assumes printing is needed, but the script indicates it is optional ("if you want to print"). Adjust the subgoal to reflect this conditionality.  
- Adjusted Subgoal 4: Print the legal brief only if required by the user.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Print the legal brief if required.  
- **How to Achieve**: If printing is needed, use the File > Print option, select the printer, and print the document.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
If a printed copy of the legal brief is required, click File > Print in the OpenOffice Writer menu. In the Print dialog box, select the desired printer from the Name drop-down list, then click the Print button to print the document.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Write legal briefs using OpenOffice on the desktop.  
  - Subgoal 1: Launch OpenOffice and access the Writer application (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a new document and begin drafting the legal brief (Completed).
