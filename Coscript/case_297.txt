[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Teach basic shapes and lines to build foundational skills.  
- **How to Achieve**: Introduce simple shapes (e.g., circles, lines, squares) using guided drawing exercises to develop motor skills before progressing to letters.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Begin the lesson by demonstrating how to draw basic shapes like straight lines, circles, and squares on unlined paper. Use large, clear motions and explain each step (e.g., “Draw a straight line from top to bottom”). Guide the child to trace over your examples, then draw the shapes independently. Provide verbal feedback and keep the activity engaging with praise or fun examples, like drawing shapes to form a simple picture (e.g., a house). Limit the session to 10-15 minutes to maintain the child’s attention.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Teach basic shapes and lines to build foundational skills.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to the child’s progress in drawing shapes and any challenges observed during the lesson.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**: Review the child’s performance during the shape-drawing lesson. The child successfully traced straight lines and circles but struggled with squares, often making uneven sides. Positive engagement was noted when shapes were linked to a fun activity (e.g., drawing a house). This suggests the child responds well to creative, contextual exercises, which can be applied to future lessons. Challenges with fine motor control for complex shapes like squares indicate a need for additional practice with simpler shapes before advancing.

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Extend practice with simple shapes (lines, circles) and introduce creative exercises to reinforce skills.  
- **How to Achieve**: Design engaging activities where the child draws lines and circles as parts of simple pictures (e.g., a sun, a stick figure) to build confidence and motor skills.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Plan a 15-minute session where the child practices drawing lines and circles by creating simple pictures, such as a sun (circle with lines for rays) or a stick figure. Demonstrate each shape slowly, then have the child trace and draw independently. Use colorful paper or pencils to maintain interest and provide positive feedback, such as “Your sun looks so bright!” If the child struggles, simplify the task by focusing on one shape at a time. Ensure the activity feels like a game to keep the child motivated.
