### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to regularly inspect circuit breakers to ensure they are functioning. This will be achieved by checking the circuit breaker panel for signs of wear, damage, or tripped breakers, and establishing a routine inspection schedule.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of regularly inspecting circuit breakers:  
- Locate the circuit breaker panel in the home (typically in a basement, garage, or utility area).  
- Visually inspect each breaker for signs of damage, such as burn marks, corrosion, or loose connections.  
- Check for tripped breakers, which may indicate an overload or fault.  
- Set a recurring schedule (e.g., every 3–6 months) to perform these inspections.  
- Document findings to track the condition of breakers over time.  
This ensures circuit breakers are functioning properly and helps identify potential issues before they lead to overloading.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the inspection of circuit breakers is valid and effective. This will be achieved by verifying that the inspection process covers all necessary aspects and aligns with safety standards.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the inspection process:  
- Confirm that all breakers in the panel were checked for damage, wear, or tripping.  
- Ensure the inspection schedule (e.g., every 3–6 months) is practical and documented.  
- Cross-reference findings with basic electrical safety guidelines (e.g., no exposed wires, no overheating signs).  
- If any breakers show signs of damage or frequent tripping, note this for further action (e.g., electrician consultation).  
This validation ensures the inspection process is thorough and contributes to preventing overloading.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the amperage capacity of circuit breakers. This will be achieved by identifying and recording the amperage ratings of each breaker in the panel.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of understanding circuit breaker amperage:  
- Open the circuit breaker panel and locate the amperage rating printed on each breaker (e.g., 15A, 20A, or 30A).  
- Create a list or diagram of the panel, noting the amperage rating for each circuit.  
- Calculate the total amperage capacity of the panel if needed (sum of individual breaker ratings, considering the main breaker’s limit).  
- Research or refer to a basic guide on typical amperage requirements for household appliances to understand safe load limits.  
This information ensures awareness of the electrical system’s capacity to prevent overloading.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy:  
- **Main Goal**: Prevent overloading in the home electrical system.  
  - Subgoal 1: Regularly inspect circuit breakers to ensure they are functioning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Understand the amperage capacity of circuit breakers (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Avoid exceeding the circuit breakers' capacity.  
  - Subgoal 4: Implement surge protection for appliances.  
  - Subgoal 5: Seek professional help if uncertain about electrical safety.  
**Current Goal**: Avoid exceeding the circuit breakers’ capacity (Subgoal 3).  
This updated hierarchy reflects progress and focuses on the next subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to avoid exceeding the circuit breakers’ capacity. This will be achieved by calculating appliance loads and ensuring they stay within the breaker’s amperage limits.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To avoid exceeding circuit breaker capacity:  
- Use the amperage ratings recorded in Step 5 to identify the capacity of each circuit.  
- List major appliances and their power requirements (e.g., check appliance labels or manuals for wattage/amperage).  
- Convert wattage to amperage if needed (Amps = Watts ÷ Volts, typically 120V for US households).  
- Ensure the total load on each circuit does not exceed 80% of the breaker’s rated capacity (e.g., max 12A on a 15A breaker).  
- Redistribute appliances across circuits if any circuit is at risk of overloading.  
This proactive management prevents circuit breakers from tripping due to overload.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to implement surge protection for appliances. This will be achieved by installing surge protectors to safeguard appliances and reduce the risk of overloading circuits.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To implement surge protection:  
- Purchase high-quality surge protectors or power strips with a joule rating of at least 1000–2000 joules.  
- Plug major appliances (e.g., computers, TVs, refrigerators) into surge protectors instead of directly into outlets.  
- For whole-house protection, consider consulting an electrician to install a surge protection device (SPD) at the main panel.  
- Regularly inspect surge protectors for wear and replace them if they show signs of damage or after a major surge event.  
This protects appliances from voltage spikes, reducing the risk of circuit overloads.  
[/IMP]
