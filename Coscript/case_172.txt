- **How to Achieve**: Use the hair clipper with the selected guard to cut the hair at the nape of the neck, moving upward in smooth, even strokes.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Position the person comfortably and section off the hair at the nape of the neck.  
- Turn on the clipper and start at the base of the neck, moving upward in small, overlapping strokes.
