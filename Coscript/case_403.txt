### Problem Statement
The goal is to access Facebook at work, where it is blocked, while adhering to the constraints of the workplace environment. The provided script outlines a sequence of steps: first, ask the boss for permission to access Facebook for work-related reasons; if denied, try alternative methods such as using a proxy server, a VPN, or a web-based Facebook proxy. The solution will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the defined set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the structured format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of accessing Facebook at work into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons.  
- Subgoal 2: If permission is denied, explore alternative methods to bypass the block.  
- Subgoal 3: Attempt to use a proxy server to access Facebook.  
- Subgoal 4: Attempt to use a VPN to access Facebook.  
- Subgoal 5: Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Access Facebook at work despite the block.  
  - Subgoal 1: Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons (Current).  
  - Subgoal 2: If permission is denied, explore alternative methods to bypass the block.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to use a proxy server to access Facebook.  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to use a VPN to access Facebook.  
  - Subgoal 5: Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy.  
**Current Goal:** Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons.  
**How to Achieve:** Prepare a professional and concise explanation highlighting legitimate work-related reasons for needing access to Facebook (e.g., managing a company social media account or conducting market research). Schedule a meeting or send a formal request to the boss.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the current goal, draft a brief and professional email or verbal request to the boss. For example:  
"Dear [Boss's Name], I am requesting access to Facebook for work-related purposes, such as [specific reason, e.g., monitoring our company’s social media presence or researching industry trends]. Please let me know if this can be accommodated or if we can discuss further. Thank you!"  
Submit the request and await the boss’s response.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm whether the boss grants permission to access Facebook.  
**How to Achieve:** Review the boss’s response to the request and determine if access is granted or denied.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the boss’s response (e.g., email reply or verbal feedback). If the boss approves, proceed to access Facebook as permitted. If the boss denies the request, note that alternative methods (proxy server, VPN, or web-based proxy) must be explored as per the script. For this simulation, assume the boss responds with: “No, access to Facebook is not permitted for any reason due to company policy.” Therefore, the next step is to explore alternative methods.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Since the boss denied the request, adjust the subgoals to focus on alternative methods to bypass the block.  
- Updated Subgoal 2: Explore and select an alternative method to bypass the Facebook block (proxy server, VPN, or web-based proxy).  
- Subgoal 3: Attempt to use a proxy server to access Facebook.  
- Subgoal 4: Attempt to use a VPN to access Facebook.  
- Subgoal 5: Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the updated hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Access Facebook at work despite the block.  
  - Subgoal 1: Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons (Completed, denied).  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore and select an alternative method to bypass the Facebook block (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to use a proxy server to access Facebook.  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to use a VPN to access Facebook.  
  - Subgoal 5: Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy.  
**Current Goal:** Explore and select an alternative method to bypass the Facebook block.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Explore and select an alternative method to bypass the Facebook block.  
**How to Achieve:** Research the feasibility of using a proxy server, VPN, or web-based Facebook proxy, considering factors like ease of use, security, and workplace IT restrictions. Select the most viable option to try first.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate the three options:  
- **Proxy Server:** Redirects internet traffic through an intermediary server, potentially bypassing workplace filters. Requires finding a reliable proxy service.  
- **VPN:** Encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, offering higher security but may require software installation, which could be restricted.  
- **Web-based Facebook Proxy:** Accesses Facebook through a third-party website, requiring no software installation, making it easier to use but potentially less secure.  
Given workplace IT restrictions (e.g., software installation may be blocked), the web-based Facebook proxy is the simplest to try first, as it only requires a browser. Select this method for the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy to access Facebook.  
**How to Achieve:** Identify a reputable web-based proxy service, access its website, and use it to navigate to Facebook.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Search for a reputable web-based proxy service (e.g., HideMyAss, Kproxy, or ProxySite.com). For this simulation, assume ProxySite.com is selected. Navigate to the proxy website using the workplace computer’s browser, enter “facebook.com” in the proxy’s URL field, and attempt to access Facebook. If successful, log in to Facebook and verify functionality. If the proxy is blocked or fails, proceed to the next alternative method (proxy server or VPN). For this simulation, assume the web-based proxy successfully loads Facebook.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm whether the web-based Facebook proxy successfully allows access to Facebook.  
**How to Achieve:** Test the functionality of Facebook through the proxy and check for any issues (e.g., slow loading, restricted features, or detection by workplace IT).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Access Facebook via the web-based proxy (ProxySite.com). Log in with valid credentials and verify that key features (e.g., news feed, messaging) are functional. For this simulation, assume the proxy works, and Facebook is accessible with full functionality. The main goal of accessing Facebook at work is achieved. However, note potential risks, such as IT monitoring or policy violations, which should be considered for long-term use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the final hierarchy of goals and confirm the completion status.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Access Facebook at work despite the block (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Request permission from the boss to access Facebook for work-related reasons (Completed, denied).  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore and select an alternative method to bypass the Facebook block (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attempt to use a proxy server to access Facebook (Not attempted).  
  - Subgoal 4: Attempt to use a VPN to access Facebook (Not attempted).  
  - Subgoal 5: Attempt to use a web-based Facebook proxy (Completed, successful).  
**Current Goal:** None (main goal achieved).  
The plan is complete, as Facebook is successfully accessed using a web-based proxy.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Notes
The plan to access Facebook at work has been completed by following the provided script and using the meta-cognitive action set. The successful method was using a web-based Facebook proxy after the boss denied permission. Note that bypassing workplace restrictions may violate company policies, and users should consider ethical and professional implications before proceeding with such methods.
