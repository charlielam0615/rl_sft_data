**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of finding a WiFi password by brute-forcing into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:
- Subgoal 1: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng).
- Subgoal 2: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network.
- Subgoal 3: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find a WiFi password by brute-forcing.
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng).
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network.
  - Subgoal 3: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.
**Current Goal**: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng).
**How to Achieve**: Download Aircrack-ng from its official source and install it on a compatible system with administrative privileges.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the current goal, visit the official Aircrack-ng website (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) and download the latest version compatible with the operating system (e.g., Linux, as Aircrack-ng is primarily Linux-based). Ensure the system has a compatible wireless adapter supporting monitor mode. Install the tool by following the provided installation instructions, which typically involve extracting the package and running a setup command (e.g., `sudo apt install aircrack-ng` on Debian-based systems). Verify the installation by checking the tool’s version (e.g., `aircrack-ng --version`).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Validate the installation of the WiFi password brute-forcing tool.
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that Aircrack-ng is correctly installed and operational by running a test command and ensuring the system meets hardware requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Run the command `aircrack-ng --version` in the terminal to verify that Aircrack-ng is installed and returns a valid version number. Additionally, check if the wireless adapter supports monitor mode by using `iwconfig` to list interfaces and confirm one can be set to monitor mode (e.g., `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`). If the tool or adapter fails, troubleshoot by reinstalling or checking hardware compatibility.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find a WiFi password by brute-forcing.
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng). [Completed]
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network.
  - Subgoal 3: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.
**Current Goal**: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network.
**How to Achieve**: Use Aircrack-ng to scan for the target WiFi network and prepare the tool for capturing packets.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start by enabling monitor mode on the wireless adapter using `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`. Then, scan for available WiFi networks with `sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon` to identify the target network’s BSSID and channel. Configure Aircrack-ng to focus on the target network by running `sudo airodump-ng --bssid [BSSID] --channel [CHANNEL] --write capture wlan0mon`, which captures packets for the brute-force process.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Validate the configuration and packet capture process.
**How to Achieve**: Ensure Aircrack-ng is capturing packets from the target WiFi network and that sufficient data is being collected for the brute-force attack.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the terminal output from the `airodump-ng` command to confirm that packets (especially handshake packets) are being captured for the target network’s BSSID. If no handshake is captured, consider forcing a handshake by deauthenticating a connected client using `sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [BSSID] wlan0mon`. Verify that the capture file (`capture.cap`) is being generated and contains relevant data.
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find a WiFi password by brute-forcing.
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain and install a WiFi password brute-forcing tool (e.g., Aircrack-ng). [Completed]
  - Subgoal 2: Configure the tool to connect to the target WiFi network. [Completed]
  - Subgoal 3: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.
**Current Goal**: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Execute the brute-force attack to retrieve the password.
**How to Achieve**: Use Aircrack-ng with a wordlist to attempt cracking the captured handshake and retrieve the WiFi password.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Run the brute-force attack using the command `sudo aircrack-ng -w [WORDLIST] -b [BSSID] capture.cap`, where [WORDLIST] is a file containing potential passwords (e.g., `rockyou.txt`). Ensure the wordlist is accessible and contains a comprehensive set of possible passwords. Aircrack-ng will attempt to match the captured handshake against the wordlist entries. If successful, the tool will display the WiFi password.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Validate the success of the brute-force attack.
**How to Achieve**: Confirm whether Aircrack-ng successfully retrieved the WiFi password and test connectivity using the password.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the Aircrack-ng output for a message indicating a successful key recovery (e.g., “KEY FOUND: [PASSWORD]”). Copy the retrieved password and attempt to connect to the WiFi network using the system’s network manager or `nmcli` (e.g., `nmcli dev wifi connect [SSID] password [PASSWORD]`). If the connection fails, verify the captured handshake’s integrity or try a different wordlist.
[/IMP]

**Final Note**: The plan to find a WiFi password by brute-forcing has been completed through the steps above, following the provided script and meta-cognitive action set. Each step adhered to the specified format, using planning, implementation, and review actions to systematically achieve the goal.

**Disclaimer**: Brute-forcing WiFi passwords without permission is illegal and unethical. This simulation is for educational purposes only and assumes the user has authorization to access the target network. Always comply with applicable laws and regulations.
