### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making M&M chocolate chip cookies using brown sugar, following a provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response must be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, based on the action's category. The constraint is to use brown sugar, and the script provides a 10-step process to achieve the task.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals. The goals from the previous step are:  
- **Main Goal**: Make M&M chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking sheet.  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix the wet ingredients (including brown sugar).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine dry ingredients separately.  
  - Subgoal 4: Merge wet and dry ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 5: Add chocolate chips and M&Ms.  
  - Subgoal 6: Shape the cookie dough.  
  - Subgoal 7: Bake the cookies.  
  - Subgoal 8: Cool and serve the cookies.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the oven and baking sheet.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the oven and baking sheet. This will be achieved by preheating the oven to 350°F (176°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking and ensure even baking.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the oven and baking sheet are properly prepared. This will be achieved by checking that the oven is at 350°F (176°C) and the baking sheet is correctly lined with parchment paper.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the oven has reached 350°F (176°C) using an oven thermometer or the oven’s display. Confirm that the parchment paper is flat and covers the baking sheet fully, with no gaps or overlaps that could affect cookie placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the wet ingredients (including brown sugar). This will be achieved by creaming the butter, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cream together softened butter, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer until the mixture is smooth and well-combined, ensuring the brown sugar is fully incorporated as per the constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine dry ingredients separately. This will be achieved by whisking flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt until evenly mixed, ensuring no clumps remain for proper incorporation into the wet ingredients.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to merge wet and dry ingredients. This will be achieved by pouring the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mixing until well combined, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gradually pour the dry ingredient mixture into the wet ingredient mixture, mixing with an electric mixer or spatula until fully combined into a uniform cookie dough.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add chocolate chips and M&Ms. This will be achieved by stirring them into the cookie dough until evenly distributed, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add chocolate chips and M&Ms to the cookie dough, stirring gently with a spatula or wooden spoon until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cookie dough is properly mixed with chocolate chips and M&Ms. This will be achieved by checking that the dough is uniform and the mix-ins are evenly distributed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the cookie dough to confirm that the chocolate chips and M&Ms are evenly distributed with no clumps of ingredients and that the dough has a consistent texture suitable for scooping.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape the cookie dough. This will be achieved by scooping the dough into balls and placing them on the prepared baking sheet, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Scoop the cookie dough into evenly sized balls using a cookie scoop or spoon, and place them flat on the parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading during baking.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to bake the cookies. This will be achieved by baking the dough balls in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes until golden brown, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the baking sheet in the preheated 350°F (176°C) oven and bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, checking for a golden-brown color and slightly set edges.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cookies are properly baked. This will be achieved by checking that the cookies are golden brown and have the right texture.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the cookies are golden brown with slightly firm edges and a soft center. If needed, bake for an additional 1-2 minutes, ensuring they don’t overbake.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cool and serve the cookies. This will be achieved by allowing the cookies to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes and then serving them, as per the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Once cooled, serve the M&M chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Review the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion:  
- **Main Goal**: Make M&M chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking sheet (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix the wet ingredients (including brown sugar) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine dry ingredients separately (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Merge wet and dry ingredients (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Add chocolate chips and M&Ms (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Shape the cookie dough (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 7: Bake the cookies (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 8: Cool and serve the cookies (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 15: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the completion of the M&M chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar. Retrieve information related to the use of brown sugar and key steps to ensure the constraint was met.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The constraint of using brown sugar was addressed in Step 5, where brown sugar was creamed with butter, eggs, and vanilla extract to form the wet ingredients. Key steps included preheating the oven (Step 3), mixing dry ingredients (Step 6), combining wet and dry ingredients (Step 7), adding chocolate chips and M&Ms (Step 8), shaping the dough (Step 10), baking for 8-10 minutes (Step 11), and cooling for 10 minutes before serving (Step 13). All steps followed the script, ensuring the cookies were made with brown sugar as required.  
[/REVIEW]

---

The plan for making M&M chocolate chip cookies with brown sugar is now complete, with all subgoals achieved and the constraint of using brown sugar met.
