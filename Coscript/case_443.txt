**Problem Statement**: Plan and execute the preparation of street enchiladas for Saturday night dinner, adhering to the provided script and constraint. The script outlines the steps: cook enchilada sauce with broth and honey, heat oil in a skillet, dip tortillas in sauce, fry them, fill with shredded meat, assemble in a cast iron pan, top with cheese, cilantro, and onion, bake if desired, and serve immediately on Saturday night. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action and following the specified format for [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making street enchiladas for Saturday night dinner into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare the enchilada sauce with broth and honey.  
2. Set up the cooking station (heat oil in skillet).  
3. Process tortillas (dip in sauce and fry).  
4. Fill tortillas with shredded meat.  
5. Assemble enchiladas in a cast iron pan.  
6. Add toppings (cheese, cilantro, onion).  
7. Bake enchiladas (optional).  
8. Serve enchiladas on Saturday night.  
These subgoals align with the script and ensure all steps are covered.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Make street enchiladas for Saturday night dinner.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the enchilada sauce with broth and honey.  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the cooking station (heat oil in skillet).  
  - Subgoal 3: Process tortillas (dip in sauce and fry).  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill tortillas with shredded meat.  
  - Subgoal 5: Assemble enchiladas in a cast iron pan.  
  - Subgoal 6: Add toppings (cheese, cilantro, onion).  
  - Subgoal 7: Bake enchiladas (optional).  
  - Subgoal 8: Serve enchiladas on Saturday night.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the enchilada sauce with broth and honey (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the forward subgoaling from Step 1, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the enchilada sauce with broth and honey. This will be achieved by combining the ingredients and cooking them for 20 minutes, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To prepare the enchilada sauce:  
- Gather ingredients: enchilada sauce base (e.g., tomato-based or chili-based), broth (chicken or vegetable), and honey.  
- In a saucepan, combine the enchilada sauce base, broth (approximately 1 cup for a standard batch), and 1-2 tablespoons of honey for sweetness.  
- Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes until the sauce thickens and flavors meld.  
- Set aside the sauce for use in later steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the enchilada sauce is properly prepared. This will be achieved by checking the sauce’s consistency, taste, and readiness for use in the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Verify the sauce has cooked for 20 minutes and has a smooth, thickened consistency suitable for dipping tortillas.  
- Taste the sauce to ensure a balanced flavor (tangy, slightly sweet from honey, and savory from broth). Adjust seasoning if necessary.  
- Confirm the sauce is ready for the tortilla-dipping step by ensuring it is warm and pourable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the cooking station by heating oil in a skillet over medium heat, as per the script’s second step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Select a skillet (preferably non-stick or cast iron) suitable for frying tortillas.  
- Add 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil (or enough to coat the pan’s bottom).  
- Heat the oil over medium heat until it shimmers, indicating it’s ready for frying.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to process tortillas by dipping them in the enchilada sauce and frying them, combining steps 3 and 4 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Take a corn tortilla and dip it fully into the prepared enchilada sauce, ensuring both sides are coated.  
- Carefully place the dipped tortilla into the hot skillet with oil.  
- Fry the tortilla for about 30 seconds per side until slightly crispy but still pliable.  
- Remove the tortilla and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.  
- Repeat for the desired number of tortillas (e.g., 8-12 for a family dinner).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill tortillas with shredded meat. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the preparation of tortillas and any relevant ingredients.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 3: Enchilada sauce was prepared with broth and honey, cooked for 20 minutes, and is ready for dipping tortillas.  
- From Step 4: The sauce was validated for consistency and flavor, ensuring it’s suitable for the tortilla-dipping process.  
- From Step 6: Tortillas have been dipped in sauce and fried, making them ready for filling with shredded meat.  
This information confirms that the tortillas and sauce are prepared, and the next step involves filling with shredded meat.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill the fried tortillas with shredded meat, as per step 5 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Prepare shredded meat (e.g., chicken, beef, or pork), precooked and seasoned (e.g., with cumin, chili powder, or garlic).  
- Place a fried tortilla flat on a work surface.  
- Add 2-3 tablespoons of shredded meat along the center of the tortilla.  
- Roll the tortilla tightly around the filling to form an enchilada.  
- Repeat for all fried tortillas.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assemble the enchiladas in a cast iron pan, as per step 6 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Select a cast iron pan large enough to hold the enchiladas (e.g., 10-12 inches).  
- Place the rolled enchiladas seam-side down in the pan, arranging them tightly side by side.  
- Ensure all enchiladas fit snugly to maintain their shape during baking or serving.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to top the enchiladas with cheese, cilantro, and onion, as per step 7 of the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Sprinkle shredded cheese (e.g., cheddar, Monterey Jack, or queso fresco) generously over the enchiladas.  
- Finely chop fresh cilantro and sprinkle it evenly over the cheese.  
- Dice a small onion (white or red) and scatter it over the top for added flavor and crunch.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the optional step of baking the enchiladas (step 8 of the script). Since the script states “if desired,” adjust the subgoal to decide whether baking is necessary based on preference for texture (e.g., melted cheese vs. fresh toppings). Decision: Bake the enchiladas to melt the cheese and enhance flavors, updating the subgoal to include baking at 350°F for 10-15 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]
