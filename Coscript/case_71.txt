### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format and highlight the current goal. Based on the previous [PLANNING] block, the hierarchy of goals is:  
- Main Goal: Differentiate exponential functions by graphing  
  - Subgoal 1: Graph the exponential function  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the asymptotes  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the intercepts  
  - Subgoal 4: Find the domain and range  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify increasing and decreasing intervals  
  - Subgoal 6: Locate local maximum and minimum points  
  - Subgoal 7: Find the point of inflection  
  - Subgoal 8: Determine the concavity  
  - Subgoal 9: Sketch the final graph  
**Current Goal**: Graph the exponential function (Subgoal 1).  
This structure ensures focus on the current step while keeping the overall plan in context.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to graph the exponential function. This will be achieved by selecting a sample exponential function (e.g., \( f(x) = e^x \)) and plotting its points to visualize its shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To graph the function, choose a simple exponential function, \( f(x) = e^x \). Calculate key points:  
- At \( x = -2 \), \( f(-2) = e^{-2} \approx 0.135 \).  
- At \( x = -1 \), \( f(-1) = e^{-1} \approx 0.368 \).  
- At \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = e^0 = 1 \).  
- At \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = e^1 \approx 2.718 \).  
- At \( x = 2 \), \( f(2) = e^2 \approx 7.389 \).  
Plot these points and connect them to form a smooth curve, noting the exponential growth as \( x \) increases.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the accuracy of the graphed function \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be done by checking if the plotted points align with the expected behavior of an exponential function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- The plotted points (e.g., (0,1), (1,2.718), (-1,0.364)) should form a smooth, increasing curve.  
- Check that as \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \), and as \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to 0^+ \), indicating a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \).  
- Confirm the graph passes through (0,1), as \( e^0 = 1 \).  
The graph aligns with the expected exponential behavior, confirming its validity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoals are appropriate, but for clarity, refine the order to ensure logical progression:  
1. Graph the exponential function (completed).  
2. Find the asymptotes (next, as it’s a key feature for understanding the graph’s behavior).  
3. Find the intercepts.  
4. Find the domain and range.  
5. Find the increasing and decreasing intervals.  
6. Find the local maximum and minimum points.  
7. Find the point of inflection.  
8. Determine the concavity.  
9. Sketch the final graph.  
This adjustment prioritizes foundational features (asymptotes, intercepts) before analyzing behavior (intervals, extrema, concavity).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal hierarchy based on the adjusted subgoals from the previous [PLANNING] block:  
- Main Goal: Differentiate exponential functions by graphing  
  - Subgoal 1: Graph the exponential function (completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the asymptotes (current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the intercepts  
  - Subgoal 4: Find the domain and range  
  - Subgoal 5: Find the increasing and decreasing intervals  
  - Subgoal 6: Find the local maximum and minimum points  
  - Subgoal 7: Find the point of inflection  
  - Subgoal 8: Determine the concavity  
  - Subgoal 9: Sketch the final graph  
**Current Goal**: Find the asymptotes (Subgoal 2).  
This ensures the next step focuses on identifying asymptotes while maintaining context.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the asymptotes of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the function’s behavior as \( x \) approaches positive and negative infinity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- As \( x \to \infty \), \( e^x \to \infty \), so there is no vertical or horizontal asymptote in this direction.  
- As \( x \to -\infty \), \( e^x \to 0^+ \), indicating a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \).  
Thus, the graph has a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the intercepts of the graph. Retrieve past information related to the function \( f(x) = e^x \) and its graph to support identifying intercepts.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 3 ([IMP]): The function \( f(x) = e^x \) was graphed, with the point (0,1) calculated, indicating a potential y-intercept.  
- Step 7 ([IMP]): The horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \) suggests the graph approaches but does not cross the x-axis as \( x \to -\infty \).  
This information will guide the identification of intercepts in the next step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the intercepts of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by determining where the graph crosses the x-axis (x-intercepts) and y-axis (y-intercepts).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- **Y-intercept**: Set \( x = 0 \). Then \( f(0) = e^0 = 1 \), so the y-intercept is at (0,1).  
- **X-intercept**: Set \( f(x) = 0 \). Solve \( e^x = 0 \), but since \( e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \), there is no solution. Thus, there are no x-intercepts.  
The graph has a y-intercept at (0,1) and no x-intercepts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the domain and range of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the possible input and output values of the function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- **Domain**: The exponential function is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is \( (-\infty, \infty) \).  
- **Range**: Since \( e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \) and \( e^x \to \infty \) as \( x \to \infty \), while \( e^x \to 0^+ \) as \( x \to -\infty \), the range is \( (0, \infty) \).  
Thus, the domain is \( (-\infty, \infty) \), and the range is \( (0, \infty) \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the increasing and decreasing intervals of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the derivative to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- Compute the first derivative: \( f'(x) = e^x \).  
- Since \( e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \), the derivative is always positive, indicating the function is increasing everywhere.  
- There are no points where \( f'(x) < 0 \), so there are no decreasing intervals.  
Thus, the function is increasing on \( (-\infty, \infty) \) and has no decreasing intervals.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the local maximum and minimum points of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by finding critical points using the first derivative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- From Step 11, the first derivative is \( f'(x) = e^x \), which is always positive and never zero.  
- Since there are no critical points (where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or undefined), there are no local maximum or minimum points.  
Thus, the graph has no local maxima or minima.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the point of inflection of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the second derivative to identify where the concavity changes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- First derivative: \( f'(x) = e^x \).  
- Second derivative: \( f''(x) = e^x \).  
- Since \( f''(x) = e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \), the second derivative is never zero or negative, indicating no change in concavity.  
Thus, there are no points of inflection.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the concavity of the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the second derivative to determine where the function is concave up or concave down.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 13, the second derivative is \( f''(x) = e^x \).  
- Since \( f''(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \), the function is concave up on \( (-\infty, \infty) \).  
- There are no intervals where \( f''(x) < 0 \), so the function is never concave down.  
Thus, the graph is concave up on \( (-\infty, \infty) \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal hierarchy to reflect progress:  
- Main Goal: Differentiate exponential functions by graphing  
  - Subgoal 1: Graph the exponential function (completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the asymptotes (completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the intercepts (completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Find the domain and range (completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Find the increasing and decreasing intervals (completed)  
  - Subgoal 6: Find the local maximum and minimum points (completed)  
  - Subgoal 7: Find the point of inflection (completed)  
  - Subgoal 8: Determine the concavity (completed)  
  - Subgoal 9: Sketch the final graph (current)  
**Current Goal**: Sketch the final graph (Subgoal 9).  
This confirms that all prior subgoals are complete, and the final step is to synthesize the findings into a sketch.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sketch the final graph of \( f(x) = e^x \), incorporating all analyzed features. This will be achieved by combining the results from previous steps into a comprehensive graph.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To sketch the graph of \( f(x) = e^x \):  
- **Shape**: From Step 3, the graph is a smooth, increasing curve passing through points like (-2,0.135), (-1,0.368), (0,1), (1,2.718), (2,7.389).  
- **Asymptote**: From Step 7, there is a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \).  
- **Intercepts**: From Step 9, the y-intercept is at (0,1), and there are no x-intercepts.  
- **Domain and Range**: From Step 10, the domain is \( (-\infty, \infty) \), and the range is \( (0, \infty) \).  
- **Intervals**: From Step 11, the function is increasing on \( (-\infty, \infty) \).  
- **Extrema**: From Step 12, there are no local maxima or minima.  
- **Concavity**: From Step 14, the graph is concave up on \( (-\infty, \infty) \).  
- **Inflection Points**: From Step 13, there are no points of inflection.  
Sketch the graph by plotting the key points, drawing a smooth curve that approaches \( y = 0 \) as \( x \to -\infty \), rises through (0,1), and increases rapidly as \( x \to \infty \), maintaining concavity upward.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the accuracy of the final sketch of \( f(x) = e^x \). This will be achieved by ensuring all identified features are correctly represented in the sketch.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the final sketch:  
- The curve passes through (0,1) and key points from Step 3.  
- It approaches the horizontal asymptote \( y = 0 \) as \( x \to -\infty \).  
- It is increasing everywhere (Step 11) and concave up (Step 14).  
- It has no x-intercepts, no local extrema, and no points of inflection (Steps 9, 12, 13).  
- The domain \( (-\infty, \infty) \) and range \( (0, \infty) \) are visually consistent (Step 10).  
The sketch accurately reflects all analyzed features, confirming its correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The planning case for differentiating exponential functions by graphing has been completed. All subgoals from the script were addressed using the meta-cognitive action framework, ensuring a systematic approach to graphing \( f(x) = e^x \) and analyzing its features. The final sketch incorporates all identified characteristics, validated for accuracy.
