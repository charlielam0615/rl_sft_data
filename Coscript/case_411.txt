### Problem Restatement
The task is to simulate a planning case for using apostrophes to show contraction, adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review). The goal is to create a complete plan that follows the given script while considering the constraint of showing contraction correctly, being mindful of the "its/it's" trap, and avoiding non-existent contractions. The task falls under the category of Education and Communications.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of using apostrophes to show contraction into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly.  
- Subgoal 2: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage.  
- Subgoal 3: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format and highlight the current goal.  
- **Main Goal**: Simulate a planning case for using apostrophes to show contraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly.  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage.  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones.  
**Current Goal**: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Research the rules for forming contractions using apostrophes, provide examples, and explain the grammatical structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Contractions combine two words by omitting letters and replacing them with an apostrophe. For example:  
- "Do not" becomes "don't" (omitting "o" from "not").  
- "I am" becomes "I'm" (omitting "a" from "am").  
The apostrophe indicates where letters are omitted. Common contractions include "can't" (cannot), "won't" (will not), and "they're" (they are). The rule is to place the apostrophe precisely where the letters are removed, ensuring clarity and correctness in writing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress.  
- **Main Goal**: Simulate a planning case for using apostrophes to show contraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage.  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones.  
**Current Goal**: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage.  
**How to Achieve**: Explain the difference between "its" and "it's," provide examples, and clarify their appropriate contexts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
"It's" is a contraction of "it is" or "it has" (e.g., "It's raining" = "It is raining"; "It's been fun" = "It has been fun"). "Its" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership (e.g., "The dog wagged its tail"). To avoid the trap:  
- Test if "it's" can be expanded to "it is" or "it has." If not, use "its."  
- Example error: "The car lost it's tire" (incorrect; should be "its" as it shows possession).  
Correct usage ensures clarity in writing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system.  
- **Main Goal**: Simulate a planning case for using apostrophes to show contraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones (Subgoal 3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify valid contractions, highlight examples of non-existent contractions, and provide guidance on verifying contraction validity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Valid contractions are standardized in English, such as "don't," "I'm," "you're," and "would've" (would have). Non-existent contractions include incorrect forms like "would'nt" (should be "wouldn't") or "is'nt" (should be "isn't"). To avoid errors:  
- Use a dictionary or grammar resource to confirm valid contractions.  
- Avoid creating contractions for words that don’t contract in standard English (e.g., "have'nt" is incorrect; "haven't" is correct).  
- Example: "They would'nt go" is wrong; correct is "They wouldn't go."  
Sticking to recognized contractions ensures proper communication.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system.  
- **Main Goal**: Simulate a planning case for using apostrophes to show contraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and apply apostrophes to form contractions correctly (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recognize and avoid the "its/it's" trap by distinguishing their correct usage (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure only valid contractions are used, avoiding non-existent ones (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the plan addresses all aspects of the task and meets the constraint of showing contraction correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the completed subgoals against the script and constraint, ensuring all requirements are met without errors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The plan addresses all script steps:  
1. **Using apostrophes for contraction**: Explained rules and examples (e.g., "don't," "I'm") in Step 3.  
2. **Awareness of the its/it's trap**: Clarified "its" vs. "it's" with examples in Step 5.  
3. **Avoiding non-existent contractions**: Provided guidance on valid vs. invalid contractions in Step 7.  
The constraint of showing contraction correctly is met by ensuring accurate apostrophe placement, addressing the "its/it's" distinction, and confirming only valid contractions are used. No discrepancies found.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the main goal of using apostrophes to show contraction, focusing on key rules, examples, and pitfalls.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Summarized information related to the main goal:  
- Apostrophes in contractions replace omitted letters (e.g., "do not" → "don't"; Step 3).  
- "It's" (it is/has) vs. "its" (possessive) is a common pitfall; use expansion test to avoid errors (Step 5).  
- Only use valid contractions (e.g., "wouldn't," not "would'nt") and verify with reliable resources (Step 7).  
- Plan validated as complete and accurate (Step 9).  
This summary serves as a pointer to the detailed content in previous steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Note
All subgoals and the main goal have been addressed, validated, and reviewed. The plan is complete, adhering to the meta-cognitive action set and the provided script while meeting the constraint of showing contraction correctly.
