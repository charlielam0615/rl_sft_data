**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Choose a corset that fits the costume party theme.  
How to Achieve: Research the costume party theme (e.g., Victorian, Steampunk, Renaissance) and identify corset options that align with the theme’s aesthetic and historical or stylistic elements.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assuming the costume party has a Victorian theme (common for corsets), I will search for corsets with Victorian-era characteristics, such as structured boning, lace-up backs, and ornate details like lace or embroidery. Using web search, I find options like:  
- Overbust corsets with floral patterns for a classic Victorian look.  
- Underbust corsets for versatility with Victorian-inspired dresses.  
These align with the theme’s elegant and historical aesthetic.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Choose a corset that fits the costume party theme.  
How to Achieve: Verify that the selected corset options align with the Victorian theme by checking their design elements against theme requirements.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The overbust and underbust corsets identified have lace-up backs, boning, and ornate details like lace, which match Victorian aesthetics. Customer reviews on retailer sites (e.g., Corset Story, Amazon) confirm these corsets are used in Victorian-themed costumes, validating their suitability.

Subgoal 1 is complete, as a Victorian-themed corset (overbust or underbust) has been validated. The focus now shifts to selecting a style that complements the costume.  

[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Select a style that complements the costume.  
How to Achieve: Determine the costume’s overall design (e.g., dress, skirt, or top) and choose a corset style (overbust or underbust) that enhances its appearance and functionality.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assuming the costume includes a Victorian-inspired ball gown, an overbust corset would complement it by providing a structured silhouette and enhancing the gown’s elegance. If the costume is a skirt and blouse, an underbust corset would offer flexibility and highlight the waist. Based on availability from retailers like Timeless Trends, I select an overbust corset for a ball gown to ensure a cohesive, elegant look.  

[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Select a style that complements the costume.  
How to Achieve: Confirm that the overbust corset suits the ball gown by reviewing its compatibility with the costume’s design and fit.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The overbust corset from Timeless Trends has a fitted design with boning that shapes the torso, complementing the ball gown’s silhouette. Product descriptions and user reviews indicate it pairs well with voluminous gowns, ensuring comfort and style. This validates the choice of an overbust corset.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a Victorian ball gown, the corset should use materials like satin or brocade for elegance, with cotton lining for comfort. Searching retailer sites, I find an overbust corset with a satin outer layer, steel boning, and cotton lining from Orchard Corset. These materials align with the gown’s luxurious look and ensure wearability for the party.

The satin outer layer matches the ball gown’s fabric, creating a cohesive look.
