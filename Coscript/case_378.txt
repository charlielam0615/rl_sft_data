**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to remove blood from satin sheets using only household cleaning products, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and the response will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, ensuring all content aligns with the specified format and constraints.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of removing blood from satin sheets into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare materials (cold water, white cotton ball or cloth, salt, rubbing alcohol).  
- Subgoal 2: Apply initial cleaning to remove fresh blood.  
- Subgoal 3: Treat persistent stains with a salt paste.  
- Subgoal 4: Use rubbing alcohol to further treat the stain.  
- Subgoal 5: Rinse and repeat if necessary.  
- Subgoal 6: Dry the sheets appropriately.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Remove blood from satin sheets using household cleaning products.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials (cold water, white cotton ball or cloth, salt, rubbing alcohol).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply initial cleaning to remove fresh blood.  
  - Subgoal 3: Treat persistent stains with a salt paste.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use rubbing alcohol to further treat the stain.  
  - Subgoal 5: Rinse and repeat if necessary.  
  - Subgoal 6: Dry the sheets appropriately.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare materials (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare materials for cleaning blood from satin sheets. This involves gathering cold water, a white cotton ball or clean cloth, salt, and rubbing alcohol from household supplies.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gather the following household items:  
- Cold water (available from a faucet).  
- A white cotton ball or clean white cloth (to avoid color bleeding).  
- Table salt (commonly found in the kitchen).  
- Rubbing alcohol (often in a first aid kit or bathroom cabinet).  
Ensure all items are accessible before starting the cleaning process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply initial cleaning to remove fresh blood (Subgoal 2). This involves dampening a cloth with cold water and blotting the blood stain to lift as much blood as possible.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Take a white cotton ball or clean white cloth.  
- Dampen it with cold water from the faucet.  
- Gently blot the blood stain on the satin sheets, working from the outside inward to avoid spreading the stain.  
- Continue blotting until no more blood transfers to the cloth.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check if the initial cleaning (blotting with cold water) has reduced the blood stain. This involves inspecting the stain to determine if further treatment is needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Examine the blood stain on the satin sheets under good lighting.  
- Check if the stain has lightened significantly or if any blood remains.  
- If the stain is still visible, proceed to the next cleaning step; if mostly gone, consider rinsing or drying.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to treat persistent stains with a salt paste (Subgoal 3). This involves creating a paste with salt and water and applying it to the remaining blood stain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Mix 1/4 teaspoon of table salt with 1 tablespoon of cold water in a small bowl to form a paste.  
- Apply the paste directly to the blood stain on the satin sheets.  
- Gently rub the paste into the stain using your fingers or a clean cloth, being careful not to damage the delicate satin fabric.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use rubbing alcohol to further treat the stain (Subgoal 4). This involves blotting the stain with a cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol to break down remaining blood.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Dampen a clean white cloth with rubbing alcohol.  
- Gently blot the blood stain area where the salt paste was applied.  
- Work carefully to avoid over-saturating the satin, as excessive liquid could damage the fabric.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rinse and repeat if necessary (Subgoal 5). Retrieve information about previous cleaning steps to ensure proper rinsing and determine if repetition is needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- Previous steps involved blotting with cold water (Step 4), applying a salt paste (Step 6), and blotting with rubbing alcohol (Step 7).  
- These steps targeted lifting fresh blood and breaking down persistent stains using household products.  
- The script indicates rinsing the sheets in cold water after these treatments and repeating Steps 1–6 if the stain persists.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rinse the satin sheets in cold water (Subgoal 5). This involves rinsing the treated area to remove cleaning residues and checking if the stain persists.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Rinse the treated area of the satin sheets under cold running water to remove salt paste and rubbing alcohol residues.  
- Gently squeeze (do not wring) the fabric to avoid damaging the satin.  
- Inspect the stain after rinsing to determine if it is fully removed or if repetition of previous steps is needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check if the blood stain is fully removed after rinsing (part of Subgoal 5). This involves inspecting the sheets and deciding whether to repeat cleaning steps or proceed to drying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Examine the rinsed area of the satin sheets under good lighting.  
- If the blood stain is gone, proceed to drying; if any stain remains, repeat the cleaning process (blotting with cold water, salt paste, rubbing alcohol, and rinsing).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
If the stain persists after validation, adjust the plan to repeat cleaning steps (Subgoals 2–5) before drying. If the stain is gone, proceed to the final drying subgoal.  
- Updated Subgoals (if stain persists):  
  - Repeat Subgoal 2: Apply initial cleaning with cold water.  
  - Repeat Subgoal 3: Treat with salt paste.  
  - Repeat Subgoal 4: Use rubbing alcohol.  
  - Repeat Subgoal 5: Rinse and recheck.  
- Updated Subgoal (if stain is gone):  
  - Subgoal 6: Dry the sheets appropriately.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dry the sheets appropriately (Subgoal 6), assuming the stain is removed. This involves air-drying the satin sheets to prevent damage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Lay the satin sheets flat on a clean, dry surface or hang them in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources.  
- Allow the sheets to air dry completely to preserve the fabric’s texture and avoid shrinkage or damage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Remove blood from satin sheets using household cleaning products.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply initial cleaning to remove fresh blood (completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 3: Treat persistent stains with a salt paste (completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 4: Use rubbing alcohol to further treat the stain (completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 5: Rinse and repeat if necessary (completed, repeated if necessary).  
  - Subgoal 6: Dry the sheets appropriately (completed).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; main goal achieved.  
[/REVIEW]
