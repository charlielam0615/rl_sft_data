**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make a fabric belt by hand.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate fabric for the belt (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cut the fabric to the desired length with an extra 2 inches.  
  - Subgoal 3: Fold and press the fabric to shape it into a belt.  
  - Subgoal 4: Stitch the fabric to complete the belt.  
**Current Goal:** Select appropriate fabric for the belt.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to select appropriate fabric for the belt. This will be achieved by choosing a fabric that is durable, suitable for a belt, and aligns with personal style preferences, ensuring it can be worked by hand.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To select the fabric, consider materials like cotton, denim, or canvas, which are sturdy and suitable for a belt. Ensure the fabric is not too stretchy to maintain the belt’s shape. Choose a color and pattern that match the desired style. Verify that the fabric is available and can be cut and sewn by hand without requiring specialized tools. For example, a medium-weight cotton fabric with a width of at least 2–3 inches is ideal for a standard belt.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to select appropriate fabric for the belt. Validate that the chosen fabric meets the requirements for durability, workability by hand, and style preferences.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the selected fabric (e.g., medium-weight cotton) for the following:  
- **Durability:** Confirm the fabric is strong enough to withstand wear as a belt (e.g., no thin or flimsy materials).  
- **Workability:** Ensure the fabric can be easily cut, folded, and sewn by hand without fraying excessively.  
- **Style:** Verify the color and pattern align with the intended aesthetic.  
If the fabric does not meet these criteria, revisit the selection process to choose a more suitable option.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and highlight the next goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make a fabric belt by hand.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate fabric for the belt (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cut the fabric to the desired length with an extra 2 inches (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Fold and press the fabric to shape it into a belt.  
  - Subgoal 4: Stitch the fabric to complete the belt.  
**Current Goal:** Cut the fabric to the desired length with an extra 2 inches.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to cut the fabric to the desired length plus an extra 2 inches. This will be achieved by measuring the wearer’s waist, adding the extra length, and cutting the fabric accurately by hand.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure the waist where the belt will be worn, typically adding 6–8 inches for overlap and fastening (e.g., for a 32-inch waist, the belt length would be 38–40 inches). Add an additional 2 inches as specified, resulting in a total length of 40–42 inches. Use a ruler or measuring tape to mark the fabric with chalk or a fabric marker. Cut the fabric along the marked line using sharp fabric scissors, ensuring a straight edge for a clean finish.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to cut the fabric to the desired length plus an extra 2 inches. Validate that the fabric has been cut to the correct length and the edges are straight.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure the cut fabric to confirm it matches the intended length (e.g., 40–42 inches for a 32-inch waist). Check that the cut is straight and the edges are clean without fraying. If the length is incorrect or the edges are uneven, re-measure and re-cut a new piece of fabric to meet the specifications.  
[/IMP]

Break down the subgoal of folding and pressing the fabric into specific steps based on the script to shape the belt properly.  
- Subtask 3.1: Fold the fabric in half lengthwise and press.  
- Subtask 3.2: Unfold the fabric and fold each side to the center crease, then press.  
- Subtask 3.3: Fold the fabric in half again, enclosing raw edges, and press.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fold and press the fabric to shape it into a belt, starting with folding the fabric in half lengthwise and pressing. This will be achieved by folding the fabric evenly and using an iron to press it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take the cut fabric and fold it in half lengthwise, ensuring the edges align evenly. Use pins to hold the fold in place if needed. Set an iron to the appropriate heat setting for the fabric (e.g., medium for cotton). Press the folded fabric with the iron to create a sharp center crease, moving slowly to avoid wrinkles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fold and press the fabric in half lengthwise. Validate that the fold is even and the crease is sharp.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the folded fabric to ensure the edges are aligned and the fold is straight. Check that the pressed crease is crisp and free of wrinkles. If the fold is uneven or the crease is not sharp, re-fold the fabric and press again with the iron, adjusting the heat if necessary.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to unfold the fabric and fold each side to the center crease, then press. This will be achieved by unfolding the fabric, folding each side to the center, and pressing with an iron.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Unfold the fabric to reveal the center crease. Fold one long edge of the fabric to the center crease and press with an iron to set the fold. Repeat for the other long edge, ensuring both sides meet at the center crease without overlapping. Press both folds to create sharp creases, checking for evenness.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to unfold the fabric and fold each side to the center crease, then press. Validate that both sides are folded evenly to the center and the creases are sharp.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check that both long edges of the fabric are folded precisely to the center crease and are symmetrical. Ensure the pressed creases are crisp and the fabric lies flat without puckering. If the folds are uneven or the creases are not sharp, re-fold and re-press the fabric, ensuring proper alignment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fold the fabric in half again, enclosing raw edges, and press. This will be achieved by folding the fabric along the center crease and pressing to finalize the belt shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Fold the fabric in half along the center crease, enclosing the raw edges inside the fold. Align the edges carefully to ensure a uniform width (e.g., 1–1.5 inches for a standard belt). Press the folded fabric with an iron to set the final shape, creating a smooth, professional finish. Use pins to secure the fold if needed before pressing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to fold the fabric in half again, enclosing raw edges, and press. Validate that the raw edges are fully enclosed and the belt has a uniform width.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the folded fabric to confirm that all raw edges are enclosed within the fold. Measure the width of the belt to ensure it is consistent (e.g., 1–1.5 inches). Check that the pressed fold is smooth and free of wrinkles. If raw edges are visible or the width is uneven, unfold, adjust the folds, and re-press.  
[/IMP]

### Step 17
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to stitch the fabric to complete the belt. This will be achieved by hand-stitching around the entire perimeter of the belt with a 1/2-inch seam allowance using a durable thread.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Thread a hand-sewing needle with strong thread (e.g., polyester or heavy-duty cotton) that matches the fabric color. Start at one end of the belt and stitch along the perimeter, maintaining a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Use a straight stitch or backstitch for durability, sewing along both long edges and across the ends to secure the folds. Knot the thread securely at the start and end. Ensure stitches are even and tight to prevent the belt from unraveling.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 18
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to stitch the fabric to complete the belt. Validate that the stitching is even, secure, and follows the 1/2-inch seam allowance around the entire perimeter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the stitching to ensure it is even, with consistent stitch length and a 1/2-inch seam allowance along all edges. Check that the stitches are tight and the thread is securely knotted at both ends. Tug gently on the belt to confirm the stitching holds under tension. If stitches are uneven, loose, or deviate from the seam allowance, remove them and re-stitch the affected areas.
