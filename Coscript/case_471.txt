**Problem Statement**: Simulate the planning process for drawing an equilateral triangle using only a ruler, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response must use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, ensuring all planning steps are completed according to the script: (1) Draw a straight line, (2) Place the ruler at the midpoint of the line, (3) Mark a point the length of the line away from the midpoint, (4) Move the ruler to the other side of the line, (5) Mark another point the length of the line away from the midpoint, (6) Join the points to create the triangle.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To draw an equilateral triangle using a ruler, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Draw a base line segment.  
2. Locate the midpoint of the base line.  
3. Mark a point at a distance equal to the line’s length from the midpoint on one side.  
4. Mark another point at the same distance on the opposite side.  
5. Connect the marked points to form the triangle.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Draw an equilateral triangle using a ruler.  
  - Subgoal 1: Draw a base line segment.  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the midpoint of the base line.  
  - Subgoal 3: Mark a point at a distance equal to the line’s length from the midpoint on one side.  
  - Subgoal 4: Mark another point at the same distance on the opposite side.  
  - Subgoal 5: Connect the marked points to form the triangle.  
**Current Goal**: Draw a base line segment (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to draw a base line segment. This will be achieved by using the ruler to draw a straight line of arbitrary length, which will serve as the base of the equilateral triangle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use the ruler to draw a straight line segment on the paper, labeling the endpoints as A and B. This line (AB) forms the base of the triangle.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the base line segment is valid. This will be achieved by checking that the line is straight and has two defined endpoints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the line segment AB is straight by ensuring it aligns with the ruler’s edge and has no curves. Confirm that endpoints A and B are clearly marked.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate the midpoint of the base line. This will be achieved by measuring the length of line AB and marking its midpoint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the length of line AB using the ruler. Divide the length by 2 to find the midpoint. Place the ruler along AB, and mark the midpoint as point M.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the midpoint is correctly placed. This will be achieved by checking that the distances AM and MB are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the distance from A to M and from M to B using the ruler. Confirm that AM equals MB, ensuring M is the midpoint of AB.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mark a point at a distance equal to the line’s length from the midpoint on one side. This will be achieved by measuring the length of AB and marking a point at that distance from M.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the length of AB. Place the ruler such that one end is at M, and mark a point C at a distance equal to AB’s length on one side of the line, ensuring the ruler is positioned perpendicular to AB or at an angle to form a potential vertex.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
To ensure an equilateral triangle, refine the subgoal for marking point C to specify that the point must be positioned such that MC equals AB. Adjust the subgoal to: Mark point C such that the distance from M to C equals the length of AB, ensuring C lies above or below the line to form a vertex.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Draw an equilateral triangle using a ruler.  
  - Subgoal 1: Draw a base line segment (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the midpoint of the base line (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Mark point C such that the distance from M to C equals the length of AB, ensuring C lies above or below the line to form a vertex.  
  - Subgoal 4: Mark another point at the same distance on the opposite side.  
  - Subgoal 5: Connect the marked points to form the triangle.  
**Current Goal**: Mark point C such that MC equals AB (Subgoal 3).

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mark point C such that the distance from M to C equals the length of AB. This will be achieved by using the ruler to measure AB’s length from M in a direction that forms a vertex above or below the line.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the length of AB. Place the ruler at M, and mark point C at a distance equal to AB’s length, ensuring C is positioned above the line (e.g., by estimating a perpendicular direction or using a compass-like motion with the ruler if possible).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mark another point at the same distance on the opposite side. This will be achieved by measuring AB’s length from M in the opposite direction to mark point D.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the length of AB. Place the ruler at M, and mark point D at a distance equal to AB’s length on the opposite side of the line from C (e.g., below the line if C is above).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that points C and D are correctly placed. This will be achieved by checking that MC and MD equal AB and that C and D form vertices of an equilateral triangle.
