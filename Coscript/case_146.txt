### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- **Main Goal**: Use marjoram in cooking.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Purchase fresh or dried marjoram (current goal).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add marjoram to your cooking.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Store any excess marjoram.  
The current focus is on Subgoal 1: purchasing fresh or dried marjoram, which is the first step in the script and sets the foundation for using marjoram in cooking.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Purchase fresh or dried marjoram.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify a reliable source (e.g., grocery store, farmers' market, or online retailer) to acquire fresh or dried marjoram, ensuring it is of good quality for culinary use.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the subgoal of purchasing marjoram, visit a local grocery store or farmers' market to find fresh marjoram, which offers a vibrant flavor, or dried marjoram, which is more concentrated and shelf-stable. Alternatively, order from a reputable online retailer if local options are limited. Check for quality by ensuring fresh marjoram has bright green leaves with no wilting, and dried marjoram is aromatic and stored in an airtight container. Purchase a quantity suitable for immediate use (e.g., a small bunch of fresh or a 1-ounce jar of dried marjoram).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Purchase fresh or dried marjoram.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the purchased marjoram meets quality standards and is suitable for cooking.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the purchased marjoram to ensure it is fresh (bright, non-wilted leaves with a strong aroma) or dried (aromatic, no signs of moisture or clumping). Confirm the quantity is appropriate for cooking needs (e.g., enough for a few dishes without excessive surplus). If purchased online, check the packaging for integrity and expiration date. The marjoram is valid for use if it meets these criteria; otherwise, consider returning or replacing it.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The next subgoal in the script is to "add marjoram to your cooking." Refine this subgoal to specify selecting a recipe that complements marjoram’s flavor profile (e.g., Mediterranean or Italian dishes) and determining the appropriate form (fresh or dried) and quantity to use based on the recipe. This adjustment ensures the subgoal is actionable and tailored to effective culinary application.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Add marjoram to your cooking.  
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to using marjoram in cooking, including its culinary applications and considerations for fresh versus dried forms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Marjoram is an herb with a sweet, slightly citrusy flavor, commonly used in Mediterranean and Italian dishes such as soups, stews, sauces, and roasted meats.  
- Fresh marjoram has a milder flavor and is best added toward the end of cooking to preserve its aroma.  
- Dried marjoram is more potent and should be used sparingly (e.g., 1 tsp dried = 1 tbsp fresh) and added earlier in the cooking process to release its flavor.  
- Previous steps confirmed the acquisition of quality marjoram (fresh or dried), which is ready for use in cooking.  
This information guides the next implementation step by highlighting marjoram’s culinary uses and handling requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Add marjoram to your cooking.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a recipe that complements marjoram’s flavor, measure the appropriate amount of fresh or dried marjoram, and incorporate it into the dish according to best practices for its form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose a simple Mediterranean recipe, such as a tomato-based pasta sauce, which pairs well with marjoram. For a sauce serving 4, use 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh marjoram (added in the last 5 minutes of cooking) or 1 teaspoon of dried marjoram (added at the start of simmering). Stir the marjoram into the sauce, ensuring even distribution, and taste to adjust seasoning if needed. This enhances the dish with marjoram’s sweet, aromatic flavor.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Add marjoram to your cooking.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that marjoram was added correctly to the dish and enhances its flavor without overpowering other ingredients.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Taste the dish to ensure marjoram’s flavor is present but balanced, complementing the other ingredients without dominating. Check that fresh marjoram was added late in cooking or dried marjoram was added early, as per guidelines. If the flavor is too subtle, add a small additional amount (e.g., ¼ tsp dried or ½ tsp fresh) and cook briefly. If overpowering, balance with additional base ingredients (e.g., more tomato sauce). The dish is valid if the marjoram enhances the overall flavor profile.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- **Main Goal**: Use marjoram in cooking.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Purchase fresh or dried marjoram (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add marjoram to your cooking (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Store any excess marjoram (current goal).  
The current focus is on Subgoal 3: storing any excess marjoram to maintain its quality for future use, which is the final step in the script.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Store any excess marjoram.  
**How to Achieve**: Store fresh or dried marjoram in a way that preserves its flavor and quality, using appropriate containers and conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For fresh marjoram, wrap the leaves loosely in a damp paper towel and place them in a perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator’s crisper drawer, where they can last up to 1–2 weeks. For dried marjoram, transfer it to an airtight container (e.g., a glass jar with a tight lid) and store in a cool, dark, dry place, such as a pantry, to maintain potency for up to 6 months. Label the container with the storage date to track freshness.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Store any excess marjoram.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the storage method preserves marjoram’s quality and prevents spoilage or flavor loss.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that fresh marjoram is stored in a damp paper towel within a perforated bag in the refrigerator, ensuring no excess moisture that could cause mold. For dried marjoram, confirm it is in an airtight container in a cool, dark, dry location, with no exposure to heat or humidity. After one week, inspect fresh marjoram for freshness (no wilting or odor) and dried marjoram for aroma retention. The storage is valid if these conditions are met, ensuring the marjoram remains usable for future cooking.
