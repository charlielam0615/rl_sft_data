**Problem Statement**: Create a plan for crocheting boot cuffs without using a pre-existing pattern, following the provided script of crochet steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The plan must account for the constraint of not using a pattern, meaning the steps must be logically derived or validated as the process unfolds. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and responses will be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of crocheting boot cuffs into intermediate subgoals to structure the process logically. The main goal is to create functional boot cuffs without a pattern. Subgoals include:  
1. Determine the starting chain size and ensure it’s adjustable (multiple of 2).  
2. Establish a foundation row to build the cuff structure.  
3. Create subsequent rows to shape the cuff, incorporating increases for width.  
4. Validate stitch counts and row progression to ensure the cuff fits and looks balanced.  
5. Complete the cuff with finishing rows to achieve desired length and structure.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to start the boot cuff by creating the initial chain, ensuring it is adjustable to fit different sizes (multiple of 2 stitches). This will be achieved by following the script’s first step to chain 22 stitches and noting the flexibility to adjust the number of stitches.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Begin crocheting by chaining 22 stitches, as specified in the script. This number is a multiple of 2 (22 ÷ 2 = 11), which aligns with the requirement for flexibility in sizing. If a different size is needed, adjust the chain count while maintaining a multiple of 2 (e.g., 20 or 24 stitches). Use a crochet hook appropriate for the yarn weight (e.g., 5mm for worsted weight yarn). Ensure the chain is not twisted before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Crochet boot cuffs without a pattern.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the starting chain size (complete: chained 22 stitches, adjustable as a multiple of 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Establish a foundation row (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Create subsequent rows with increases (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate stitch counts and row progression (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Complete the cuff with finishing rows (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Establish the foundation row for the boot cuff.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to establish the foundation row by crocheting single crochets (sc) across the starting chain, as per the script’s second step (Row 1: sc in second chain from hook and each chain across - 21 sc). This will be achieved by following the script and ensuring the stitch count is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 1, single crochet (sc) in the second chain from the hook and in each chain across, resulting in 21 single crochets (since the first chain is skipped). Count the stitches carefully to confirm there are exactly 21 sc to maintain the cuff’s structure. Keep tension consistent for even stitches.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the foundation row (Row 1) to ensure the stitch count is correct (21 sc) and the row is even, setting a proper base for subsequent rows. This will be achieved by counting stitches and inspecting the row’s appearance.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in Row 1 to confirm there are 21 single crochets. Check that the row is flat, with no twisting or uneven tension. If the count is incorrect (e.g., 20 or 22 stitches), unravel and redo the row to achieve exactly 21 sc. Ensure the row measures appropriately for the desired cuff width (e.g., ~6-7 inches for 21 stitches with worsted weight yarn).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To progress toward completing the boot cuff, work backward from the desired outcome (a flared cuff that fits over boots). The cuff requires increasing stitch counts in specific rows to create a wider shape. Intermediate subgoals include:  
1. Crochet stable rows (Rows 2-3) with no increases to build height.  
2. Introduce increase rows (e.g., Rows 4, 8, 9, 12, 19, 23) to gradually widen the cuff, as per the script.  
3. Maintain consistent single crochet rows between increases to ensure structural integrity.  
4. Monitor stitch counts after each increase to align with the script’s specified counts (e.g., 32 sc, 42 sc, etc.).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Rows 2 and 3, which involve single crochets across each row with no increases, as per the script (Row 2: ch 1, turn, sc in each stitch across; Row 3: same). This will be achieved by following the script to maintain 21 sc per row.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 2: Chain 1, turn, and single crochet in each of the 21 stitches across. For Row 3: Repeat the process (chain 1, turn, sc in each stitch across). Count stitches after each row to ensure there are still 21 sc. Keep edges straight and tension even to maintain a uniform cuff height.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Crochet boot cuffs without a pattern.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the starting chain size (complete: 22 stitches).  
  - Subgoal 2: Establish a foundation row (complete: Row 1, 21 sc).  
  - Subgoal 3: Create subsequent rows with increases.  
    - Subtask: Crochet stable rows (Rows 2-3 complete: 21 sc each).  
    - Subtask: Introduce increase rows (pending: Row 4 onward).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate stitch counts and row progression (partially complete: Row 1 validated).  
  - Subgoal 5: Complete the cuff with finishing rows (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Begin the first increase row (Row 4) to widen the cuff.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Row 4, the first increase row, as per the script (Row 4: ch 1, turn, *sc in next stitch, 2 sc in next stitch; repeat from * across - 32 sc). This will be achieved by following the pattern of alternating single crochets and increases to achieve 32 sc.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 4: Chain 1, turn. Work the pattern: single crochet in the next stitch, then 2 single crochets in the following stitch; repeat this sequence across the row. This increases the stitch count from 21 to 32 sc (21 ÷ 2 ≈ 10 full repeats, plus 1 extra sc). Count stitches at the end to confirm 32 sc. Ensure the row remains flat and even.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate Row 4’s stitch count (32 sc) and ensure the row’s structure supports the cuff’s widening shape. This will be achieved by counting stitches and checking for evenness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in Row 4 to verify there are 32 single crochets. Inspect the row for consistency in stitch size and tension. If the count is incorrect (e.g., 31 or 33 stitches), identify the error (missed increase or extra stitch) and unravel to correct it. Confirm the row’s width has increased proportionally (e.g., ~9-10 inches with worsted weight yarn).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoals assumed a straightforward progression, but the significant stitch increases (e.g., 32 to 63 to 126 sc) suggest a rapidly widening cuff, which may be excessive for a standard boot cuff. Adjust subgoals to:  
1. Continue increase rows (Rows 8, 9, 12, 19, 23) but monitor cuff width after each to ensure it remains practical (e.g., fits over a boot without excessive flare).  
2. Introduce periodic validation after each increase row to confirm functionality.  
3. Consider stopping increases earlier if the cuff reaches a suitable width (e.g., after Row 12, 84 sc).  
4. Complete with stable rows for length, folding, and finishing the cuff.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Rows 5-7, which include stable rows (Rows 5-6) and an increase row (Row 7: *sc in next 2 stitches, 2 sc in next stitch; repeat from * across - 42 sc). This will be achieved by following the script’s instructions for each row.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 5: Chain 1, turn, single crochet in each of the 32 stitches across. For Row 6: Repeat (chain 1, turn, sc in each stitch across, 32 sc). For Row 7: Chain 1, turn, work the pattern: single crochet in next 2 stitches, then 2 single crochets in the next stitch; repeat across. This increases the stitch count to 42 sc. Count stitches after each row to ensure accuracy (32 sc for Rows 5-6, 42 sc for Row 7).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Row 8 (sc in each stitch across - 42 sc). Retrieve information from previous steps about maintaining stitch counts and ensuring evenness to inform this step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- Row 1 established 21 sc, validated for accuracy (Step 5).  
- Rows 2-3 maintained 21 sc with consistent tension (Step 7).  
- Row 4 increased to 32 sc, validated for correct count and evenness (Steps 9-10).  
- Rows 5-6 maintained 32 sc; Row 7 increased to 42 sc (Step 12).  
This indicates a pattern of stable rows between increases, with validations ensuring correct stitch counts. For Row 8, maintain 42 sc with consistent tension, as done in previous stable rows.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Row 8, a stable row (ch 1, turn, sc in each stitch across - 42 sc), as per the script. This will be achieved by single crocheting across all 42 stitches.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 8: Chain 1, turn, single crochet in each of the 42 stitches across. Count stitches to confirm there are 42 sc. Ensure tension remains consistent to keep the cuff’s shape uniform.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate Row 8’s stitch count (42 sc) and ensure the cuff’s structure is progressing correctly. This will be achieved by counting stitches and checking the cuff’s width and shape.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in Row 8 to verify there are 42 single crochets. Inspect the cuff’s width (e.g., ~12-13 inches with worsted weight yarn) to ensure it’s suitable for fitting over a boot. Check for evenness and no curling. If the count is incorrect, unravel and correct the row.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
The script’s rapid stitch increases (e.g., Row 9: 63 sc, Row 12: 84 sc, Row 19: 126 sc, Row 23: 168 sc) suggest an unusually wide cuff, which may not align with typical boot cuff dimensions (usually 10-14 inches wide). Backtrack to reassess the increase pattern after Row 8 (42 sc). Propose testing the cuff’s fit after the next increase (Row 9) and potentially stopping increases earlier (e.g., after Row 12, 84 sc) if the width is sufficient.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Row 9, an increase row (ch 1, turn, *sc in next stitch, 2 sc in next stitch; repeat from * across - 63 sc), as per the script. This will be achieved by following the increase pattern and counting stitches carefully.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 9: Chain 1, turn, work the pattern: single crochet in the next stitch, then 2 single crochets in the next stitch; repeat across. This increases the stitch count from 42 to 63 sc. Count stitches at the end to confirm 63 sc. Check the cuff’s width to assess if it’s becoming too wide for practical use (e.g., ~18-20 inches).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 18
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate Row 9’s stitch count (63 sc) and assess whether the cuff’s width is still practical for a boot cuff. This will be achieved by counting stitches and measuring the cuff’s width.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in Row 9 to verify there are 63 single crochets. Measure the cuff’s width (likely ~18-20 inches). If the width is excessive for a boot cuff (e.g., too loose or flared), consider stopping increases after the next validation (e.g., after Row 12, 84 sc). Ensure the row is even and structurally sound.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 19
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Given the validation in Step 18, the cuff’s width at 63 sc may already be sufficient for many boot sizes. Adjust subgoals to:  
1. Crochet and validate Row 10 (stable, 63 sc) and Row 11 (increase to 84 sc).  
2. Test the cuff’s fit after Row 12 (84 sc) to decide whether to continue increases or proceed to stable rows for length.  
3. If increases stop after Row 12, complete the cuff with stable rows (similar to Rows 13-18) to achieve desired length (e.g., 4-6 inches).  
4. Finish by folding and sewing the cuff to form a tube.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 20
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet Rows 10-11 (Row 10: ch 1, turn, sc in each stitch across - 63 sc; Row 11: ch 1, turn, *sc in next 2 stitches, 2 sc in next stitch; repeat from * across - 84 sc). This will be achieved by following the script’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Row 10: Chain 1, turn, single crochet in each of the 63 stitches across. For Row 11: Chain 1, turn, work the pattern: single crochet in next 2 stitches, then 2 single crochets in the next stitch; repeat across to reach 84 sc. Count stitches after each row (63 sc for Row 10, 84 sc for Row 11).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 21
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate Row 11’s stitch count (84 sc) and test the cuff’s fit to determine if further increases are needed. This will be achieved by counting stitches and trying the cuff on a boot or measuring against a calf.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in Row 11 to confirm there are 84 single crochets. Measure the cuff’s width (likely ~24-26 inches). Test the cuff by wrapping it around a boot or calf to check fit. If the width is sufficient (comfortably fits over a boot with slight stretch), consider stopping increases. If too tight, proceed with the next increase (Row 12). Ensure the row is even.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 22
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Crochet boot cuffs without a pattern.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the starting chain size (complete: 22 stitches).  
  - Subgoal 2: Establish a foundation row (complete: Row 1, 21 sc).  
  - Subgoal 3: Create subsequent rows with increases.  
    - Subtask: Crochet stable rows (Rows 2-3, 5-6, 8, 10 complete).  
    - Subtask: Introduce increase rows (Rows 4, 7, 9, 11 complete: 32, 42, 63, 84 sc).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate stitch counts and row progression (complete for Rows 1, 4, 8, 9, 11).  
  - Subgoal 5: Complete the cuff with finishing rows (pending: assess fit to decide on further increases or stable rows).  
**Current Goal**: Decide whether to stop increases after Row 11 (84 sc) or proceed with Row 12, then complete the cuff.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 23
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
The cuff at 84 sc (Row 11) is likely wide enough for most boot cuffs (24-26 inches). Backtrack to reassess the need for further increases (e.g., Row 12: 84 sc, Rows 19 and 23: 126 and 168 sc). Given typical boot cuff dimensions, stop increases after Row 11 and proceed with stable rows (similar to Rows 13-18) to achieve a height of 4-6 inches, then finish by sewing into a tube.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 24
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet stable rows (Rows 12-18, ch 1, turn, sc in each stitch across - 84 sc) to build the cuff’s height to 4-6 inches. This will be achieved by repeating single crochet rows, maintaining 84 sc per row.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Rows 12-18: For each row, chain 1, turn, and single crochet in each of the 84 stitches across. Count stitches after each row to ensure 84 sc. Continue until the cuff measures 4-6 inches in height (approximately 7 rows with worsted weight yarn). Check the height periodically with a ruler.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 25
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate Rows 12-18, ensuring each row has 84 sc and the cuff’s height is 4-6 inches. This will be achieved by counting stitches and measuring the height.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Count the stitches in each of Rows 12-18 to confirm 84 single crochets per row. Measure the cuff’s height from the starting chain to Row 18 (should be ~4-6 inches). Ensure the cuff is even, with no curling or distortion. If the height is insufficient, add more stable rows (e.g., Rows 19-20 as stable rows instead of increases).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 26
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finish the boot cuff by folding and sewing it into a tube, ensuring it fits over a boot. This will be achieved by folding the piece lengthwise and slip-stitching the edges together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Fold the crocheted piece lengthwise so the starting chain meets the final row (Row 18). Use a slip stitch or whip stitch to sew the edges together, forming a tube. Test the cuff by sliding it over a boot to ensure it fits comfortably with slight stretch. Trim any excess yarn and weave in ends. Repeat the entire process for the second cuff.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 27
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Crochet boot cuffs without a pattern (complete).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the starting chain size (complete: 22 stitches).  
  - Subgoal 2: Establish a foundation row (complete: Row 1, 21 sc).  
  - Subgoal 3: Create subsequent rows with increases (complete: Rows 4, 7, 9, 11; stopped at 84 sc).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate stitch counts and row progression (complete for Rows 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12-18).  
  - Subgoal 5: Complete the cuff with finishing rows (complete: Rows 12-18, sewn into a tube).  
**Current Goal**: None; all goals completed. The boot cuff is finished, with a second cuff to be made by repeating the process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Notes**: The plan successfully produced one boot cuff by chaining 22 stitches, building a foundation row, incorporating increases up to 84 sc, adding stable rows for height, and sewing into a tube. The constraint of no pattern was addressed by validating stitch counts and fit at key stages. To complete the pair, repeat the process for the second cuff.
