**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to eat fish once a week, adhering to the provided script while considering the constraint of eating fish once weekly. The plan should incorporate steps from the script, adjusted to meet the constraint, and be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of eating fish once a week into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script, adjusted for the once-a-week constraint.  
- Subgoal 1: Select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week.  
- Subgoal 2: Ensure the chosen fish is nutritious and sustainable.  
- Subgoal 3: Prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings.  
- Subgoal 4: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Eat fish once a week.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week.  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the chosen fish is nutritious and sustainable.  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings.  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week.  
**Current Goal**: Select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week.  
The goal hierarchy is established to provide context for future steps, with the current focus on selecting a new dish.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week. This will be achieved by researching a variety of fish or seafood options and choosing one that hasn’t been tried before, aligning with the script’s first step.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Research online or consult a cookbook for fish or seafood dishes. For example, consider trying grilled salmon with a citrus glaze, as salmon is widely available and versatile. Ensure the dish is new by recalling past meals and avoiding repeats. This week, select grilled salmon as the dish.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the chosen fish is nutritious and sustainable, as per subgoal 2. Retrieve information from the script related to checking nutrition facts and sustainability recommendations.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The script advises:  
- Step 2: Check the nutrition facts label to find a fish or seafood with less saturated fat and cholesterol.  
- Step 3: Ask your grocery store or seafood market for recommendations on sustainable and wild-caught fish.  
This information will guide the next step to verify that the selected fish (salmon) meets nutritional and sustainability criteria.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the chosen fish (salmon) is nutritious and sustainable. This will be achieved by checking salmon’s nutritional profile for low saturated fat and cholesterol and confirming it is wild-caught and sustainable, per the script’s steps 2 and 3.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Salmon has approximately 1g saturated fat and 55mg cholesterol per 3oz serving, which is relatively low compared to other proteins. At the grocery store, ask the seafood counter staff if the salmon is wild-caught and sourced sustainably, or check for certifications like MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) on packaging. Choose wild-caught Alaskan salmon, which is often recommended for sustainability.  

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The script’s step 7 suggests eating fish twice a week, which conflicts with the constraint of once a week. Adjust the subgoal to align with the constraint while maintaining the plan’s intent.  
- Adjusted Subgoal 4: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week, replacing the twice-a-week recommendation.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Eat fish once a week.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week (completed: chose grilled salmon).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the chosen fish is nutritious and sustainable (completed: verified salmon).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings.  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week (adjusted to once weekly).  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings.  
The hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoal and completed steps, focusing now on preparation.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings, per script steps 4 and 5. This will be achieved by grilling the salmon and seasoning it with herbs and citrus, as suggested.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Grill the wild-caught Alaskan salmon using a grill pan or outdoor grill to avoid added fats, per the script’s recommendation to bake, broil, grill, or poach. Season with fresh dill, lemon zest, and black pepper for flavor, incorporating herbs and fruit as advised. Cook for 4-6 minutes per side until the internal temperature reaches 145°F.  

[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the plan aligns with the once-a-week constraint and script steps. This will be achieved by checking that the meal is prepared and consumed once this week and follows the script’s guidelines.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Confirm that the grilled salmon dish is scheduled for one meal this week, e.g., Wednesday dinner. Verify that the preparation (grilling, seasoning with herbs and citrus) aligns with script steps 4 and 5, and the fish selection (wild-caught, nutritious) follows steps 2 and 3. The once-a-week constraint is met, as only one fish meal is planned.  

[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Eat fish once a week.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select a new fish or seafood dish to try each week (completed: chose grilled salmon).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the chosen fish is nutritious and sustainable (completed: verified salmon).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the fish using healthy cooking methods and flavorful seasonings (completed: grilled with dill and lemon).  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week.  
**Current Goal**: Incorporate the fish into a meal once a week.  
All subgoals except the final incorporation are complete, with the plan aligned to the constraint.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate the fish into a meal once a week, per the adjusted subgoal 4. This will be achieved by preparing and eating the grilled salmon dish as planned for one meal this week.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Prepare the grilled salmon with dill and lemon zest for Wednesday dinner, accompanied by steamed vegetables and quinoa for a balanced meal. Eat the meal as planned, ensuring the once-a-week fish consumption goal is met.  

[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the entire plan was executed correctly, meeting the once-a-week constraint and script steps. This will be achieved by reviewing the completion of all subgoals and confirming the meal was consumed.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Review the plan: A new dish (grilled salmon) was selected, verified as nutritious and sustainable, prepared using healthy methods (grilling) with flavorful seasonings (dill, lemon), and consumed once this week (Wednesday dinner). The script’s steps 1-5 were followed, and the twice-a-week step was adjusted to once a week, meeting the constraint. The plan is complete and successful.  

[/IMP]

**Final Note**: The plan to eat fish once a week has been fully developed and executed, adhering to the script (with the adjusted frequency) and using the meta-cognitive action set. For the following week, the process can restart from Step 3 to select a new fish dish, such as baked cod or poached halibut, repeating the cycle.
