**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for taking a screenshot in Microsoft Windows to send in an email, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task involves creating a plan based on the given script: ['1. Open the Snipping Tool.', '2. Choose the shape of the Snip.', '3. Adjust the Snip border.', '4. Create a new Snip.', '5. Annotate the Snip.', '6. Send the Snip in an email.'], with the constraint that the screenshot must be sent via email, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of taking a screenshot in Microsoft Windows to send in an email into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Open the Snipping Tool to initiate the screenshot process.  
2. Select the shape of the snip to define the capture area.  
3. Adjust the snip border to refine the capture area.  
4. Create the new snip to capture the screenshot.  
5. Annotate the snip to add any necessary markings or notes.  
6. Send the annotated screenshot in an email.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block, and highlighting the current goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Take a screenshot in Microsoft Windows and send it in an email.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Snipping Tool to initiate the screenshot process.  
  - Subgoal 2: Select the shape of the snip to define the capture area.  
  - Subgoal 3: Adjust the snip border to refine the capture area.  
  - Subgoal 4: Create the new snip to capture the screenshot.  
  - Subgoal 5: Annotate the snip to add any necessary markings or notes.  
  - Subgoal 6: Send the annotated screenshot in an email.  

**Current Goal**: Open the Snipping Tool to initiate the screenshot process.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the Snipping Tool to initiate the screenshot process. This will be achieved by accessing the Snipping Tool application on a Windows computer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To open the Snipping Tool:  
1. Click the Windows Start button (bottom-left corner of the screen).  
2. Type "Snipping Tool" in the search bar.  
3. Click on the Snipping Tool app from the search results to launch it.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the Snipping Tool is open and ready for use. This will be achieved by verifying that the Snipping Tool window is visible and functional.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the Snipping Tool window is open on the screen. Confirm that the toolbar with options like "New" and "Mode" is visible, indicating the tool is ready for the next step. If the tool does not open, repeat the steps to launch it or troubleshoot by checking if the app is installed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the shape of the snip to define the capture area. This will be achieved by choosing the appropriate snip mode in the Snipping Tool.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Snipping Tool:  
1. Click on the "Mode" dropdown menu.  
2. Select the desired snip shape (e.g., Rectangular Snip, Free-form Snip, Window Snip, or Full-screen Snip).  
3. For this task, choose "Rectangular Snip" as it is commonly used for precise captures.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to adjust the snip border to refine the capture area. This will be achieved by dragging the cursor to select the specific area of the screen to capture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With the Snipping Tool in Rectangular Snip mode:  
1. Click and drag the cursor over the desired area of the screen to define the snip border.  
2. Release the mouse button to preview the selected area.  
3. If the border needs adjustment, click "New" and repeat the selection process to refine the capture area.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create a new snip to capture the screenshot. This will be achieved by finalizing the capture in the Snipping Tool.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After adjusting the snip border:  
1. Release the mouse button to capture the screenshot.  
2. The Snipping Tool will display the captured image in its window.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to annotate the snip. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the screenshot capture process to ensure the snip is ready for annotation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The screenshot has been captured using the Snipping Tool in Rectangular Snip mode, with the border adjusted to define the capture area. The captured image is now displayed in the Snipping Tool window, ready for annotation.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to annotate the snip to add necessary markings or notes. This will be achieved by using the Snipping Tool’s annotation features.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Snipping Tool window with the captured screenshot:  
1. Use the Pen or Highlighter tool from the toolbar to add markings (e.g., circling important areas or adding arrows).  
2. Use the Text tool, if available, to add notes or labels.  
3. Save the annotated screenshot by clicking "File" > "Save As" and choosing a file format (e.g., PNG or JPEG).

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to send the annotated screenshot in an email. This will be achieved by attaching the saved screenshot to an email and sending it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To send the screenshot in an email:  
1. Open an email client (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Gmail in a browser, or Windows Mail).  
2. Create a new email by clicking "Compose" or "New Email."  
3. Enter the recipient’s email address, subject, and any message text.  
4. Attach the saved screenshot by clicking "Attach File" (or equivalent), navigating to the saved screenshot file (e.g., PNG or JPEG), and selecting it.  
5. Click "Send" to deliver the email with the attached screenshot.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the email with the screenshot was sent successfully. This will be achieved by checking the email client’s sent folder and confirming delivery.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Navigate to the "Sent" folder in the email client.  
2. Verify that the email with the attached screenshot appears in the sent items.  
3. If available, check for delivery confirmation (e.g., read receipt or server acknowledgment).  
4. If the email is not in the sent folder, troubleshoot by checking the email client’s connection or re-sending the email.
