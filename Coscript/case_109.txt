### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for logging out of Hotmail (now Outlook) after reading all emails, adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the specified response format. The script provided includes the following steps: (1) Go to https://www.outlook.com in a web browser, (2) Click the folder containing the email to read, (3) Click the email to read, (4) Click Print, (5) Close the print preview window, (6) Click the username, (7) Click Sign Out. The constraint is that all emails must be read before logging out. The solution will use one meta-cognitive action per step, ensuring all planning, implementation, and review actions are enclosed in their respective blocks ([PLANNING], [IMP], [REVIEW]) as per the guidelines.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for the Task
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of "logging out of Hotmail after reading all emails" into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Access the Outlook website.  
2. Navigate to the email folder.  
3. Read all emails in the folder.  
4. Print each email after reading.  
5. Close the print preview for each email.  
6. Access the user profile.  
7. Log out of the account.  
These subgoals align with the provided script and ensure the constraint of reading all emails is met.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**  
- Main Goal: Log out of Hotmail after reading all emails.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Outlook website.  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the email folder.  
  - Subgoal 3: Read all emails in the folder.  
  - Subgoal 4: Print each email after reading.  
  - Subgoal 5: Close the print preview for each email.  
  - Subgoal 6: Access the user profile.  
  - Subgoal 7: Log out of the account.  
**Current Goal**: Access the Outlook website (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals defined in the previous planning step, providing context for subsequent actions.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Access the Outlook Website
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the Outlook website. This will be achieved by opening a web browser and navigating to https://www.outlook.com.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and enter "https://www.outlook.com" in the address bar. Press Enter to load the Outlook login page. If not already logged in, enter the Hotmail/Outlook credentials to access the email account.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Navigate to the Email Folder
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the email folder containing the emails to read. This will be achieved by clicking on the appropriate folder (e.g., Inbox) in the Outlook interface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Outlook interface, locate the folder pane on the left side. Click on the folder containing the emails to read, such as the "Inbox" or another relevant folder.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validate Folder Selection
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the correct folder has been selected. This will be achieved by verifying that the folder opened contains the emails intended for reading.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the folder’s contents to confirm it displays the emails intended for reading. Ensure the folder name (e.g., "Inbox") matches the expected folder. If the wrong folder was selected, return to the folder pane and select the correct one.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Read All Emails
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to read all emails in the selected folder. This will be achieved by clicking on each unread email to view its contents, ensuring all emails are read to satisfy the constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the selected folder, identify unread emails (typically marked with a bold subject line or an unread indicator). Click on each unread email to open and read its contents. Repeat this process until all emails in the folder have been read. If there are multiple pages of emails, navigate through the pages to ensure no emails are missed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Information About Printing
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to print each email after reading. Retrieve information from the provided script related to printing emails.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies: "4. Click Print" and "5. Click the X to close the print preview window." This indicates that after reading each email, the user must initiate the print function and then close the print preview window before proceeding to the next email or action.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Print Each Email
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to print each email after reading. This will be achieved by opening each email and selecting the print option from the Outlook interface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each email read, open the email and locate the "More actions" menu (typically represented by three dots or a similar icon). Select "Print" from the menu to open the print dialog. Confirm the print settings and send the email to the printer.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Close Print Preview
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to close the print preview window after printing each email. This will be achieved by clicking the "X" or close button on the print preview window.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After initiating the print action, a print preview window will appear in the browser. Locate the "X" or close button (usually in the top-right corner of the print preview window) and click it to close the window. Repeat this for each email printed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals for Completion
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The subgoals for reading and printing emails (Subgoals 3, 4, and 5) may need adjustment to account for multiple emails. Update these subgoals to explicitly handle iteration:  
- Subgoal 3: Read each email in the folder, iterating through all emails.  
- Subgoal 4: Print each email after reading, iterating through all emails.  
- Subgoal 5: Close the print preview for each email after printing, iterating through all emails.  
This ensures the plan accounts for processing multiple emails sequentially.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11: Track Updated Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**  
- Main Goal: Log out of Hotmail after reading all emails.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Outlook website (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the email folder (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Read each email in the folder, iterating through all emails (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Print each email after reading, iterating through all emails (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Close the print preview for each email after printing, iterating through all emails (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Access the user profile.  
  - Subgoal 7: Log out of the account.  
**Current Goal**: Access the user profile (Subgoal 6).  
The hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals and marks completed steps based on prior actions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 12: Access the User Profile
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the user profile. This will be achieved by clicking on the username or profile icon in the Outlook interface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Outlook interface, locate the username or profile icon (typically in the top-right corner, displaying the user’s initials or profile picture). Click on the username or icon to open the profile menu.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Log Out of the Account
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to log out of the account. This will be achieved by selecting the "Sign Out" option from the profile menu.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the profile menu, locate and click the "Sign Out" option. This will log the user out of the Outlook account, completing the task.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Validate Task Completion
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the user has logged out and all emails were read. This will be achieved by checking the browser for the Outlook login page and confirming all emails were read and printed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the browser displays the Outlook login page, indicating a successful logout. Verify that all emails in the target folder were marked as read and printed by navigating back to the folder (if needed, log back in temporarily to check). Ensure no unread emails remain in the folder.  
[/IMP]
