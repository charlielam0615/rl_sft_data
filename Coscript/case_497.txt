**Problem Restatement**: The task is to simulate planning a process to switch a Nikon camera to use back button focus by changing the Custom Setting f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button). The process must follow the provided script and adhere to the constraint of modifying the f1 setting to enable back button focus. The solution will use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a structured plan, selecting one action per step and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the guidelines.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the camera’s screen to confirm that the menu interface is visible, indicating successful access to the menu system.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to navigate to the Custom Setting menu. This will be achieved by locating the pencil icon representing the Custom Setting menu and selecting it using the multiselector.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find the Custom Setting menu (indicated by a pencil icon) in the menu system and navigate to it by pressing the appropriate multiselector button.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to locate the Controls tab within the Custom Setting menu. This will be achieved by pressing right on the multiselector to access the Controls tab.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Press right on the multiselector until the Controls tab is highlighted or selected within the Custom Setting menu.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to select the f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button) setting. This will be achieved by finding the f1 option in the Controls tab and pressing right on the multiselector to select it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Locate the f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button) option in the Controls tab and press the multiselector right to select it.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to configure the f1 setting to AF-On. This will be achieved by selecting the AF-On option from the drop-down menu for the f1 setting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose AF-On from the drop-down menu for the f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button) setting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to exit the menu to save changes. This will be achieved by pressing the MENU button to exit the menu system.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Press the MENU button to exit the menu system and save the changes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to confirm that the camera is now set to use back button focus. This will be achieved by testing the AE-L/AF-L button to ensure it activates autofocus and checking that the shutter button no longer triggers autofocus.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the AE-L/AF-L button by pressing it to confirm it activates autofocus. Verify that pressing the shutter button halfway does not trigger autofocus, confirming successful configuration of back button focus.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Switch the Nikon camera to use back button focus by changing Custom Setting f1 (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the camera's menu system (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the Custom Setting menu (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Locate the Controls tab within the Custom Setting menu (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button) setting (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Configure the f1 setting to AF-On (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Exit the menu to save changes (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, main goal achieved).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 12: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: The core content is the process of switching the Nikon camera to back button focus by modifying the f1 setting. Retrieve a summary of the steps taken to achieve this goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The process to switch the Nikon camera to back button focus involved: accessing the menu system by pressing the Menu button, navigating to the Custom Setting menu (pencil icon), selecting the Controls tab, choosing the f1 (Assign AE-L/AF-L Button) setting, setting it to AF-On, and exiting the menu. Validation confirmed the AE-L/AF-L button activates autofocus, and the shutter button no longer triggers autofocus.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Note**: The planning process is complete, as all subgoals and the main goal have been achieved, and the final review confirms the successful configuration of back button focus on the Nikon camera.
