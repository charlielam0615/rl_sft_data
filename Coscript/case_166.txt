### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for applying lip liner without using a mirror, categorized under Personal Care and Style. The constraint is that no mirror can be used during the process. The provided script outlines six steps: 1) Choose your colors, 2) Find your lip line, 3) Go slowly and carefully, 4) Fill in your lips, 5) Check your work, and 6) You're done. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for the Task
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of applying lip liner without a mirror into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Select an appropriate lip liner color.  
2. Locate the natural lip line using touch.  
3. Apply the lip liner accurately and slowly.  
4. Fill in the lips with lip liner or lipstick.  
5. Verify the application without a mirror.  
6. Finalize the process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Organize the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1:  
- **Main Goal**: Apply lip liner without using a mirror.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate lip liner color.  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the natural lip line using touch.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the lip liner accurately and slowly.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill in the lips with lip liner or lipstick.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the application without a mirror.  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the process.  
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate lip liner color.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Choose the Lip Liner Color
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select an appropriate lip liner color. This will be achieved by recalling a familiar color that matches the user’s skin tone or outfit, considering the context of personal care and style, without needing a mirror.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To choose the lip liner color, rely on prior knowledge of what colors work well with your skin tone or the occasion (e.g., neutral for daily wear, bold for events). For example, select a nude or pink shade for a natural look or a red shade for a dramatic effect. Pick a lip liner you’ve used before and can identify by its packaging or texture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Recall Information for Locating the Lip Line
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate the natural lip line using touch. Retrieve information related to techniques for identifying the lip line without visual aid, focusing on tactile methods.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to locate the natural lip line using touch. From prior steps, the task involves personal care and style without a mirror, emphasizing tactile precision. Relevant information includes using fingers to feel the edge where the lip’s smooth skin meets the surrounding textured skin. Past experience with lip anatomy or previous applications can guide this process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Locate the Lip Line
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate the natural lip line using touch. This will be achieved by using fingers to feel the lip’s edge and mentally mapping the lip shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gently run your index finger along the edge of your lips to feel where the smooth lip tissue transitions to the surrounding skin. Start at the cupid’s bow (the V-shape at the top center of your upper lip) and trace outward to the corners. Repeat for the lower lip. Mentally note the shape to guide the application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals for Application Precision
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoal for applying the lip liner to emphasize precision without a mirror. The adjusted subgoal is: Apply the lip liner with small, controlled strokes, using tactile feedback to stay on the lip line, ensuring symmetry and smoothness.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Update Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoal from Step 6:  
- **Main Goal**: Apply lip liner without using a mirror.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate lip liner color (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the natural lip line using touch (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the lip liner with small, controlled strokes, using tactile feedback to stay on the lip line, ensuring symmetry and smoothness.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill in the lips with lip liner or lipstick.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the application without a mirror.  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the process.  
**Current Goal**: Apply the lip liner with small, controlled strokes, using tactile feedback.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Apply the Lip Liner
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the lip liner with small, controlled strokes, using tactile feedback. This will be achieved by holding the lip liner firmly and tracing the lip line slowly, guided by the mental map from Step 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the lip liner at a slight angle for precision. Start at the cupid’s bow and use short, light strokes to trace along the lip line, feeling the edge with your other hand to stay on track. Work from the center to the corners of the upper lip, then repeat for the lower lip. Move slowly to ensure even application and symmetry.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validate the Application
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the lip liner application. This will be achieved by using touch to detect any unevenness or gaps in the application without a mirror.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Run a clean finger gently along the lip line to feel for any irregularities, such as clumps or areas where the liner feels too thick or missing. If uneven spots are detected, smooth them out by lightly reapplying or blending with your finger. Ensure the texture feels consistent across both lips.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Fill in the Lips
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill in the lips with lip liner or lipstick. This will be achieved by applying the product within the outlined lip line, using tactile feedback to stay within bounds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the same lip liner or a matching lipstick, start at the center of the lips and apply in small, even strokes, moving outward. Use your finger to feel the boundaries set by the lip liner to avoid going outside the lines. Blend gently with your finger for a smooth finish.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Verify the Final Application
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the application without a mirror. This will be achieved by using touch and other senses to ensure the application is complete and polished.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Feel the entire lip surface with a clean finger to check for even coverage and smoothness. Ensure no sticky or uneven patches exist. If possible, ask a trusted person for feedback or use a phone camera (if allowed) to confirm the result. Adjust any minor issues by blending or reapplying lightly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Finalize the Process
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the process. This will be achieved by ensuring all steps are complete and cleaning up any tools used.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the lip liner and lipstick (if used) are applied evenly and the desired look is achieved. Clean the lip liner tip if necessary and store it properly. The process is now complete.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Final Review of Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Review the goal hierarchy to confirm completion:  
- **Main Goal**: Apply lip liner without using a mirror (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate lip liner color (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the natural lip line using touch (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the lip liner with small, controlled strokes, using tactile feedback (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill in the lips with lip liner or lipstick (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the application without a mirror (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the process (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None; all subgoals completed.  
[/REVIEW]
