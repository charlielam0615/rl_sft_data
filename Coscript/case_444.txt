**Problem Statement**: The task is to reinforce a sagging shelf by replacing it with a new shelf of the same size, ensuring the new shelf eliminates the sag. The process involves measuring the sag, finding a replacement shelf, removing the old shelf, installing the new one, and confirming the sag is resolved, as outlined in the provided script. All steps must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and formatting responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To address the task of reinforcing a sagging shelf by replacement, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Measure the sag in the shelf to understand the extent of the issue.  
2. Identify and acquire a replacement shelf matching the original dimensions.  
3. Remove the old shelf and install the new one.  
4. Verify that the new shelf is installed correctly and no longer sags.  
These subgoals align with the script and provide a structured path to achieve the task.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reinforce a sagging shelf by replacing it.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the sag in the shelf.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and acquire a replacement shelf matching the original dimensions.  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove the old shelf and install the new one.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify that the new shelf is installed correctly and no longer sags.  
**Current Goal**: Measure the sag in the shelf (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next actions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Measure the sag in the shelf.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a level and a measuring tape to determine the extent of the shelf’s sagging by checking its deviation from horizontal and measuring the vertical dip at the center.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To measure the sag, place a level on the shelf to confirm it is not horizontal and identify the lowest point, typically the center. Use a measuring tape to measure the vertical distance from the lowest point to a reference point (e.g., where the shelf should be if level). Record the measurement, for example, a 2-inch sag at the center. This quantifies the issue and informs the requirements for the replacement shelf’s strength.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the measurement of the sag to ensure the next steps account for the shelf’s condition and dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Measure the sag in the shelf (Subgoal 1).  
**Recalled Information**: The previous step involved measuring the sag using a level and measuring tape, determining the vertical dip (e.g., 2 inches at the center). This information is critical for selecting a replacement shelf that can withstand similar loads without sagging. Additionally, the shelf’s dimensions (length, width, depth) should be noted during measurement to ensure the replacement matches.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and acquire a replacement shelf matching the original dimensions.  
**How to Achieve**: Measure the existing shelf’s dimensions (length, width, depth) and source a new shelf of the same size, ensuring it is made of a material strong enough to prevent sagging.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Measure the current shelf’s dimensions using a measuring tape (e.g., 36 inches long, 12 inches deep, 1 inch thick). Note the material (e.g., particleboard) and assess if a stronger material (e.g., plywood or solid wood) is needed based on the 2-inch sag observed. Visit a hardware store or online retailer to find a shelf with identical dimensions and improved load-bearing capacity. Purchase the replacement shelf, ensuring it fits the existing brackets or supports.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the replacement shelf matches the original dimensions and is suitable to prevent sagging.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the purchased shelf’s dimensions and material specifications to the original shelf and the recorded sag measurement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the new shelf’s dimensions (e.g., 36 inches long, 12 inches deep, 1 inch thick) match the original shelf. Check the material specifications (e.g., solid wood rated for higher weight capacity than particleboard). Confirm the shelf is compatible with existing brackets or supports. If the dimensions or material do not meet requirements, return to the previous step to source a correct replacement. Assuming the shelf matches and is rated for sufficient load, proceed to installation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoals remain appropriate, but refine Subgoal 3 for clarity based on progress:  
1. Measure the sag in the shelf (completed).  
2. Identify and acquire a replacement shelf matching the original dimensions (completed).  
3. Remove the old shelf, install the new shelf, and secure it to the existing supports.  
4. Verify that the new shelf is level and does not sag under load.  
This adjustment ensures the installation step explicitly includes securing the shelf.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Remove the old shelf, install the new shelf, and secure it to the existing supports.  
**How to Achieve**: Clear the shelf, detach it from its supports, install the new shelf, and secure it properly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Remove all items from the sagging shelf. Unscrew or detach the old shelf from its brackets or supports, noting their positions. Place the new shelf (36 inches by 12 inches, solid wood) onto the brackets or supports, ensuring it sits flush. Secure the shelf using screws or fasteners compatible with the brackets, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Use a level to confirm the shelf is horizontal during installation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the new shelf is installed correctly and does not sag.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the shelf’s alignment with a level and test its load-bearing capacity by placing items on it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place a level on the new shelf to confirm it is horizontal. Gradually add weight (e.g., books or items similar to the original load) and observe for any sagging. Measure any dip with a measuring tape to ensure it is negligible (e.g., less than 0.1 inches). If the shelf remains level and stable, the installation is successful. If sagging occurs, revisit the material choice or support structure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reinforce a sagging shelf by replacing it.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the sag in the shelf (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and acquire a replacement shelf matching the original dimensions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove the old shelf, install the new shelf, and secure it to the existing supports (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify that the new shelf is level and does not sag under load (completed).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; main goal achieved.  
The goal hierarchy confirms all subgoals have been addressed, and the shelf replacement is complete with no sagging observed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Confirmation**: The sagging shelf has been successfully reinforced by replacing it with a new shelf of the same dimensions (e.g., 36 inches by 12 inches, solid wood), which was measured, sourced, installed, and verified to be level and sag-free under load. All steps followed the meta-cognitive action framework, and the task is complete.
