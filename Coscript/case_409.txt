### Problem Restatement
The task is to simulate planning for asking a question intelligently on a forum, adhering to the provided script and constraints. The script includes six steps: checking forum rules, choosing an appropriate title, being clear and concise, providing relevant information, proofreading the question, and following up if no response is received. The constraint is that the task must be performed on a forum, and it falls under the category of Education and Communications. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

I will create a plan by breaking down the task into subgoals and systematically addressing each step in the script, using the meta-cognitive actions to ensure a structured and thoughtful approach.

### Step 1: Break down the task into subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To simulate asking a question intelligently on a forum, I will break down the provided script into forward-looking subgoals that align with the six steps. The subgoals are:  
1. Understand and adhere to forum rules.  
2. Create a clear and relevant question title.  
3. Draft a concise and clear question body.  
4. Include all necessary details in the question.  
5. Review and edit the question for clarity and errors.  
6. Monitor and follow up on the question if needed.  
These subgoals will guide the planning process for completing the task.

### Step 2: Organize the goal hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Track Goals**  
To provide context for future steps, I will organize the hierarchy of goals based on the subgoals identified in Step 1. The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Ask a question intelligently on a forum.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Understand and adhere to forum rules.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Create a clear and relevant question title.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Draft a concise and clear question body.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Include all necessary details in the question.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Review and edit the question for clarity and errors.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Monitor and follow up on the question if needed.  
**Current Goal**: Understand and adhere to forum rules (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy ensures focus on the first step while keeping the overall task in view.

### Step 3: Plan to check forum rules
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Understand and adhere to forum rules.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate the forum’s rules or guidelines section, read through them carefully, and note any specific requirements for posting questions (e.g., formatting, content restrictions, or tone).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of understanding and adhering to forum rules, I will:  
1. Navigate to the forum’s homepage or help section.  
2. Look for a “Rules,” “Guidelines,” or “FAQ” link, typically found in the footer or sidebar.  
3. Read the rules thoroughly, focusing on posting etiquette, question formats, and any prohibited content.  
4. Summarize key points, such as whether questions need to be tagged, if links are allowed, or if there are word limits.  
This ensures the question complies with forum standards, increasing the likelihood of a positive response.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Review forum rules information
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of understanding and adhering to forum rules, focusing on key requirements for posting questions.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**  
Based on the previous step, the relevant information includes:  
- The need to locate and read the forum’s rules or guidelines.  
- Key points to note include posting etiquette, question formatting, content restrictions, and specific requirements like tags or word limits.  
This information serves as a foundation for drafting a compliant question in subsequent steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Adjust subgoals for clarity
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Upon reflection, the subgoals for drafting the question body and including relevant details (Subgoals 3 and 4) are closely related and could be merged for efficiency. I will adjust the subgoals as follows:  
- **Revised Subgoals**:  
  1. Understand and adhere to forum rules.  
  2. Create a clear and relevant question title.  
  3. Draft a clear and concise question with all relevant details.  
  4. Review and edit the question for clarity and errors.  
  5. Monitor and follow up on the question if needed.  
This adjustment streamlines the process while ensuring all script steps are covered.

### Step 9: Validate the drafted question
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the drafted question.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the question for clarity, conciseness, completeness, and compliance with forum rules, ensuring it meets the criteria for an intelligent question.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the drafted question:  
1. Confirm the question is clear and specific (e.g., does it ask a single, focused question?).  
2. Verify all relevant details are included (e.g., context, code, or steps tried).  
3. Check for conciseness (e.g., no unnecessary details; under 200 words).  
4. Cross-reference with forum rules to ensure compliance (e.g., proper tags, no prohibited content).  
5. Test readability by reviewing the question as if I were a forum user.  
If issues are found, revise the question before proceeding to proofreading.
