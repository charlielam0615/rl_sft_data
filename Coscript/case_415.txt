### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for adding a Visa credit card to Passbook on a phone, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The constraint is that the credit card must be a Visa card. The script outlines six steps: opening Passbook, tapping the "+" icon, selecting "Use a Different Credit or Debit Card," entering the Visa credit card number, entering the security code, and waiting for the verification process to complete. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of adding a Visa credit card to Passbook into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:
1. Open the Passbook application on the phone.
2. Initiate the process to add a new card.
3. Specify the card type as a credit or debit card.
4. Input the Visa credit card number.
5. Provide the security code for the card.
6. Complete the verification process.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the Passbook application on the phone. This will be achieved by locating and launching the Passbook app on the phone’s home screen or app menu.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate the Passbook app on the phone’s home screen or within the app menu. Tap the Passbook icon to open the application.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Add a Visa credit card to Passbook
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Passbook application on the phone (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Initiate the process to add a new card
  - Subgoal 3: Specify the card type as a credit or debit card
  - Subgoal 4: Input the Visa credit card number
  - Subgoal 5: Provide the security code for the card
  - Subgoal 6: Complete the verification process

**Current Goal**: Initiate the process to add a new card.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to initiate the process to add a new card. This will be achieved by tapping the "+" icon in the Passbook app to start adding a card.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Passbook app, locate the "+" icon, typically found at the top-right corner of the screen. Tap the "+" icon to begin the process of adding a new card.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the process to add a new card has been correctly initiated. This will be achieved by confirming that the Passbook app displays the card addition interface after tapping the "+" icon.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check that the Passbook app now shows options for adding a card, such as a prompt to scan a card or manually enter card details. If the interface does not appear, repeat the action of tapping the "+" icon or ensure the app is functioning correctly.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to specify the card type as a credit or debit card. This will be achieved by selecting the "Use a Different Credit or Debit Card" option in the Passbook app.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the card addition interface, locate and tap the option labeled "Use a Different Credit or Debit Card" to proceed with entering the Visa card details.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to input the Visa credit card number. Retrieve information related to the constraint that the card must be a Visa card and the script’s requirement to enter the card number.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The constraint specifies that the card must be a Visa credit card. The script indicates that the next step after selecting "Use a Different Credit or Debit Card" is to type in the Visa credit card number. Ensure the card number entered corresponds to a valid Visa card, which typically starts with the digit 4 and is 16 digits long.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to input the Visa credit card number. This will be achieved by typing the 16-digit Visa card number into the provided field in the Passbook app.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the card entry interface, locate the field for the card number. Carefully type the 16-digit Visa credit card number, ensuring it starts with the digit 4 and is entered without spaces or errors.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to provide the security code for the Visa card. This will be achieved by entering the card’s security code (CVV) into the appropriate field in the Passbook app.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate the field for the security code in the card entry interface. Enter the 3-digit CVV code found on the back of the Visa credit card, typically in the signature strip.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the remaining subgoal (completing the verification process) to ensure it aligns with the script and constraint. The verification process may involve additional steps, such as confirming card details or receiving a verification code. Adjust the subgoal to explicitly include submitting the entered card details for verification.
Adjusted Subgoal: Submit the entered Visa card details and complete the verification process.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to submit the entered Visa card details and complete the verification process. This will be achieved by submitting the card information and waiting for Passbook to verify the card.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After entering the card number and security code, locate and tap the "Next" or "Submit" button to send the Visa card details for verification. Wait for the Passbook app to process the information and complete the verification, which may involve a bank confirmation or additional prompts.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Add a Visa credit card to Passbook
  - Subgoal 1: Open the Passbook application on the phone (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Initiate the process to add a new card (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Specify the card type as a credit or debit card (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Input the Visa credit card number (Completed)
  - Subgoal 5: Provide the security code for the card (Completed)
  - Subgoal 6: Submit the entered Visa card details and complete the verification process (Completed)

**Current Goal**: None. All subgoals have been completed, achieving the main goal of adding a Visa credit card to Passbook.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Conclusion
The plan to add a Visa credit card to Passbook has been completed by following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set framework. All subgoals were addressed through a combination of planning, implementation, and review actions, ensuring the process was systematic and aligned with the constraint that the card must be a Visa card.
