**Meta-data**: The current goal is to play on the floor with the toddler. This will be achieved by setting up a comfortable play area at home and engaging in simple, interactive activities like building blocks or rolling a ball.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Create a cozy play space on the living room floor with a soft blanket and a few favorite toys, such as blocks, stuffed animals, or a ball. Sit down with the toddler and start stacking blocks together or rolling the ball back and forth, encouraging laughter and interaction. Keep the activity light and engaging for 10-15 minutes.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Watch the toddler’s actions closely. If they pick up a toy car, join them in pushing it around or making car sounds. If they start “cooking” with play food, pretend to be a customer or chef’s helper. Mirror their actions and respond enthusiastically to their ideas for about 10-15 minutes, letting them guide the play.  
[/IMP]

[IMP]  
Set up a pretend tea party using plastic cups, plates, and stuffed animals as “guests.” Invite the toddler to pour “tea” or serve “cookies,” and play along by talking to the stuffed animals or making up a fun story about the party. Alternatively, if the toddler prefers, act as superheroes using towels as capes. Follow their imagination for 15 minutes.  
[/IMP]

Turn it into a game by saying, “Can you find all the socks before I count to 10?” or sing a cleanup song while they put toys into a basket. Praise their efforts enthusiastically, keeping the activity short (5-10 minutes).
