**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for connecting an HDMI cable from a computer to a TV to enable display output from the computer to the TV screen. The provided script outlines five steps: locate HDMI ports, plug the HDMI cable into the computer, plug the other end into the TV, switch the TV to the correct HDMI input, and adjust the computer’s display settings. The constraint is that the connection is specifically from the computer to the TV, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the defined set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for connecting an HDMI cable from the computer to the TV, break down the overall goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify the HDMI ports on both devices.  
2. Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the computer.  
3. Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the TV.  
4. Select the appropriate HDMI input on the TV.  
5. Configure the computer’s display settings to output to the TV.  
These subgoals will guide the subsequent steps to achieve the final objective of a functional HDMI connection.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the HDMI ports on both the computer and TV.  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the computer and TV to locate ports labeled “HDMI,” typically rectangular with a slightly tapered bottom and multiple pins.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To locate the HDMI ports, inspect the back or sides of the computer (laptop or desktop) for a port labeled “HDMI” or with a rectangular shape containing 19 pins. On the TV, check the back or side panels for similar ports, often labeled “HDMI 1,” “HDMI 2,” etc. Ensure both devices are accessible and powered off for safety during inspection.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the HDMI ports on both the computer and TV have been correctly identified.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the identified ports match the HDMI standard and are accessible for cable connection.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the ports identified on the computer and TV are indeed HDMI ports by confirming their shape (rectangular with a tapered bottom) and labeling. Ensure no obstructions block access to the ports and that they are free of debris. If multiple HDMI ports are available on the TV, note the specific port number (e.g., HDMI 1) for the next steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the computer.  
**How to Achieve**: Take an HDMI cable and securely insert one end into the computer’s HDMI port.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Obtain an HDMI cable compatible with both devices (standard HDMI or HDMI 2.0/2.1, depending on device specifications). Align the cable’s connector with the computer’s HDMI port and gently but firmly insert it until it is fully seated. Ensure the connection is secure to avoid signal issues.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the TV.  
**How to Achieve**: Insert the free end of the HDMI cable into the identified HDMI port on the TV.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the other end of the HDMI cable and align it with the chosen HDMI port on the TV (e.g., HDMI 1). Insert the connector carefully, ensuring it is fully plugged in and secure. Verify that the cable is not strained or bent excessively to maintain a stable connection.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Connect HDMI cable from computer to TV for display output.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify HDMI ports on both devices (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the computer (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the TV (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the appropriate HDMI input on the TV (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Configure the computer’s display settings (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Select the appropriate HDMI input on the TV.  
The completed subgoals confirm that the physical connection is established. The next steps focus on configuring the TV and computer to enable display output.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select the appropriate HDMI input on the TV.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the TV’s remote control to switch to the HDMI input corresponding to the port used.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Power on the TV and locate the “Input” or “Source” button on the TV remote. Press it to cycle through input options until the correct HDMI port (e.g., HDMI 1) is selected. Confirm the selection by checking if the TV displays the computer’s output or a signal detection message.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Configure the computer’s display settings to output to the TV.  
**How to Achieve**: Access the computer’s display settings and adjust them to detect and configure the TV as a display.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Power on the computer. On Windows, right-click the desktop and select “Display Settings”; on macOS, go to “System Preferences” > “Displays.” Detect the TV as an external display and choose the desired display mode (e.g., extend, mirror). Adjust resolution to match the TV’s native resolution (e.g., 1920x1080 or 4K) for optimal performance. Test the setup by ensuring the computer’s output appears correctly on the TV.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the HDMI connection and display configuration are functioning correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the computer’s output is displayed on the TV without issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the TV shows the computer’s screen content clearly. Test by opening an application or video to ensure audio and video are transmitted correctly via HDMI. If the display or audio is not working, check cable connections, ensure the correct HDMI input is selected, and verify display settings on the computer.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 1: Identify HDMI ports on both devices (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the computer (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the TV (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the appropriate HDMI input on the TV (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Configure the computer’s display settings (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been successfully completed, and the HDMI connection from the computer to the TV should be fully functional, with the computer’s display and audio output correctly transmitted to the TV.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Confirmation**: The plan to connect an HDMI cable from the computer to the TV has been completed. All steps in the provided script have been addressed through a series of planning, implementation, and review actions, ensuring a functional connection. If any issues arise, revisit the validation step to troubleshoot connections or settings.
