### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for making a Cotton Candy Martini using cotton candy, following a provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories. Each step must use the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks, depending on the action category, and incorporate the constraint of using cotton candy.

- Main Goal: Make a Cotton Candy Martini using cotton candy.
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the martini glass with cotton candy.
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the cocktail shaker with ice.
  - Subgoal 3: Add the necessary ingredients (vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice) to the shaker.
  - Subgoal 4: Mix the ingredients by shaking.
  - Subgoal 5: Strain the mixture into the martini glass.
  - Subgoal 6: Garnish the drink with cotton candy.
  - Subgoal 7: Complete the preparation and serve the martini.

**Current Goal**: Prepare the martini glass with cotton candy (Subgoal 1).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the martini glass with cotton candy. This will be achieved by placing a handful of cotton candy into the martini glass as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take a clean martini glass and place a handful of cotton candy inside it, ensuring it fills the base loosely to allow the liquid to interact with it later.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the martini glass is correctly prepared with cotton candy. This will be achieved by checking that the cotton candy is properly placed in the glass and the glass is clean.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the martini glass to confirm it is clean and free of debris. Verify that a handful of cotton candy is placed in the base of the glass, loosely arranged, and ready for the liquid mixture.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the cocktail shaker with ice. This will be achieved by filling a cocktail shaker ¾ of the way with ice as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take a cocktail shaker and fill it ¾ of the way with ice cubes, ensuring there is enough room for the liquid ingredients to be added.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the necessary ingredients to the cocktail shaker. This will be achieved by adding vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice to the shaker as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure and pour 2 oz of vodka, 1 oz of triple sec, and 1 oz of cranberry juice into the cocktail shaker containing the ice.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the necessary ingredients to the cocktail shaker. Retrieve past information related to the ingredients and their preparation to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The script specifies adding vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice to the cocktail shaker. From Step 6, the action involved measuring and pouring 2 oz of vodka, 1 oz of triple sec, and 1 oz of cranberry juice into the shaker with ice. This aligns with standard martini recipes and the provided script.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the ingredients by shaking. This will be achieved by shaking the cocktail shaker for 10 seconds as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Securely close the cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for 10 seconds to thoroughly mix the vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice with the ice.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to strain the mixture into the martini glass. This will be achieved by pouring the mixture through a cocktail strainer into the glass with cotton candy as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use a cocktail strainer to pour the shaken mixture from the cocktail shaker into the martini glass containing the cotton candy, allowing the liquid to dissolve the cotton candy partially for flavor and effect.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the mixture is correctly strained into the martini glass. This will be achieved by checking that the liquid has been poured properly and the cotton candy is dissolving as intended.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm that the mixture has been strained smoothly into the martini glass without ice or debris. Observe that the cotton candy in the glass is partially dissolving into the liquid, creating a sweet, colorful effect.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to garnish the drink with cotton candy. This will be achieved by adding a pinch of cotton candy as a garnish and preparing to serve as per the script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take a small pinch of cotton candy and place it on top of the martini as a garnish, ensuring it is visually appealing and ready to serve.
[/IMP]
