**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to simulate tying a Windsor knot for a tie, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format, selecting one action per step, and completing the planning process for all steps in the script. The constraint is that the knot must be a Windsor knot, and the task falls under the category of Hobbies and Crafts.

### Step 1: Define Initial Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of tying a Windsor knot into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script provides 8 sequential steps, each representing a subgoal to achieve the final Windsor knot. The subgoals are:  
1. Position the tie correctly around the neck.  
2. Cross the wide end over the narrow end.  
3. Pass the wide end through the neck loop (first time).  
4. Bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end.  
5. Pass the wide end through the neck loop again.  
6. Bring the wide end around the front of the narrow end.  
7. Insert the wide end through the formed loop.  
8. Tighten the knot by pulling the wide end.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Review Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the previous planning step, and highlight the current goal.  
- **Main Goal**: Tie a Windsor knot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the tie correctly around the neck (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cross the wide end over the narrow end.  
  - Subgoal 3: Pass the wide end through the neck loop (first time).  
  - Subgoal 4: Bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end.  
  - Subgoal 5: Pass the wide end through the neck loop again.  
  - Subgoal 6: Bring the wide end around the front of the narrow end.  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert the wide end through the formed loop.  
  - Subgoal 8: Tighten the knot by pulling the wide end.  
**Current Goal**: Position the tie correctly around the neck.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Execute First Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the tie correctly around the neck. This will be achieved by placing the tie around the neck with the wide end hanging lower on the right side, as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the tie around your neck so that the wide end hangs down on the right side and the narrow end on the left. Ensure the wide end is longer, approximately 12 inches below the narrow end, to provide enough length for the Windsor knot.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Verify Positioning
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the tie is positioned correctly. This will be achieved by checking that the wide end is on the right, longer than the narrow end, and properly aligned.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the tie is draped around the neck with the wide end on the right side, extending about 12 inches below the narrow end. Ensure the tie lies flat against the chest and the narrow end is on the left. Adjust if necessary to meet these conditions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Plan Next Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
The next subgoal is to cross the wide end over the narrow end. This step builds on the correct positioning of the tie and initiates the knot-forming process by creating the initial crossover, which is foundational for the Windsor knot’s structure.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Execute Second Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cross the wide end over the narrow end. This will be achieved by moving the wide end horizontally across the narrow end to form a cross shape.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the wide end of the tie and move it horizontally over the narrow end, forming a cross with the wide end lying on top of the narrow end, near the neck.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Review Progress
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress and highlight the current goal.  
- **Main Goal**: Tie a Windsor knot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the tie correctly around the neck (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cross the wide end over the narrow end (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Pass the wide end through the neck loop (first time) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end.  
  - Subgoal 5: Pass the wide end through the neck loop again.  
  - Subgoal 6: Bring the wide end around the front of the narrow end.  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert the wide end through the formed loop.  
  - Subgoal 8: Tighten the knot by pulling the wide end.  
**Current Goal**: Pass the wide end through the neck loop (first time).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Execute Third Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pass the wide end through the neck loop for the first time. This will be achieved by bringing the wide end up and threading it through the loop formed between the tie and the neck.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Lift the wide end of the tie and pass it upward through the loop between the tie and your neck, then pull it down through the other side, keeping the crossover intact.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Previous Steps
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pass the wide end through the neck loop. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the tie’s positioning and crossover to ensure the neck loop is correctly formed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The tie was positioned with the wide end on the right, longer than the narrow end (Step 3). The wide end was then crossed over the narrow end (Step 6), forming a cross near the neck. These steps ensure a neck loop exists between the tie and the neck, allowing the wide end to be passed through it as required in the current goal.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Execute Fourth Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end. This will be achieved by wrapping the wide end behind the narrow end to continue building the knot’s structure.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the wide end and bring it around the back of the narrow end, moving it horizontally from right to left, so it emerges on the left side of the narrow end.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Verify Knot Formation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the wide end has been correctly wrapped around the back of the narrow end. This will be achieved by checking the positioning and ensuring the knot is forming symmetrically.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the wide end is now on the left side of the narrow end after wrapping around the back. Check that the tie remains untangled and the crossover and neck loop are intact, with the knot beginning to take shape. Adjust if the wide end is twisted or misaligned.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Plan Next Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
The next subgoal is to pass the wide end through the neck loop again. This step continues the knot-forming process by threading the wide end through the neck loop a second time, adding to the Windsor knot’s fullness.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 13: Execute Fifth Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pass the wide end through the neck loop again. This will be achieved by bringing the wide end up and through the neck loop, pulling it down to add another layer to the knot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Lift the wide end and pass it upward through the loop between the tie and your neck, then pull it down through the other side, ensuring the tie remains smooth and untangled.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Execute Sixth Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to bring the wide end around the front of the narrow end. This will be achieved by wrapping the wide end across the front of the narrow end to form the front of the knot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the wide end and bring it horizontally across the front of the narrow end, moving from left to right, so it lies over the narrow end and contributes to the knot’s visible structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15: Review Progress
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]

- **Main Goal**: Tie a Windsor knot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the tie correctly around the neck (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cross the wide end over the narrow end (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Pass the wide end through the neck loop (first time) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Pass the wide end through the neck loop again (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Bring the wide end around the front of the narrow end (completed).  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert the wide end through the formed loop (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 8: Tighten the knot by pulling the wide end.  
**Current Goal**: Insert the wide end through the formed loop.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 16: Execute Seventh Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to insert the wide end through the formed loop. This will be achieved by threading the wide end through the loop created at the front of the knot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the wide end and insert it downward through the loop that has formed at the front of the knot, pulling it through gently to position it correctly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17: Execute Final Subgoal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to tighten the knot by pulling the wide end. This will be achieved by gently pulling the wide end and adjusting the knot to complete the Windsor knot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Pull the wide end downward to tighten the knot, then slide the knot up toward the collar while holding the narrow end to adjust its size and ensure it sits symmetrically against the collar.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 18: Final Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the Windsor knot is correctly formed. This will be achieved by checking the knot’s symmetry, tightness, and alignment with the collar.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the knot to ensure it is symmetrical, tight, and centered under the collar. Confirm the wide end is longer than the narrow end and the knot has the characteristic wide, triangular shape of a Windsor knot. Make minor adjustments to the knot or tie length if needed.  
[/IMP]
