### Step 5: Select Songs Matching Vocal Abilities

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to choose songs that the singer can perform well, ensuring they align with the upbeat requirement. This will be achieved by evaluating the singer’s vocal strengths (e.g., power, clarity, emotional delivery) against the demands of the shortlisted songs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assuming the singer has a versatile pop vocal style:  
- “Sweet Caroline” requires clear projection and crowd engagement, suitable for singers with strong, steady voices.

- “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” needs vocal power and range, fitting for singers with strong belting ability.

### Step 6: Check Vocal Range Compatibility

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the selected song (“I Wanna Dance with Somebody”) fits within the singer’s vocal range. This will be achieved by checking the song’s pitch range against a typical pop singer’s range (e.g., G3 to G5 for a mezzo-soprano).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
“I Wanna Dance with Somebody” has a vocal range roughly from A3 to F#5, requiring a strong mid-to-high range. For a typical pop singer (e.g., mezzo-soprano with a G3-G5 range), this is achievable, though the high notes (F#5) may need practice for control. The song’s upbeat tempo and energetic vibe align with audition goals. The range is validated as suitable for a singer with moderate to advanced vocal ability.
