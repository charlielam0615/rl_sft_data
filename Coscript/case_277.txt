### Problem Statement
I need to create a plan to make fried chicken in the oven due to hot weather preventing outdoor cooking. The plan must follow the provided script of steps and adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action, and the response will use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, ensuring the constraint of avoiding outdoor cooking is respected.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making oven-fried chicken into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals:  
1. Prepare the oven and baking dish.  
2. Create the wet mixture (egg and milk).  
3. Prepare the dry coating.  
4. Coat the chicken (cutting, dipping in dry coating, egg mixture, then dry coating again).  
5. Prepare the baking pan with butter and add chicken.  
6. Bake the chicken, flipping midway to ensure even cooking.  
These subgoals align with the script and account for the constraint of cooking indoors.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make fried chicken in the oven.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking dish.  
  - Subgoal 2: Create the wet mixture (egg and milk).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the dry coating.  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat the chicken (cutting, dipping in dry coating, egg mixture, dry coating again).  
  - Subgoal 5: Prepare the baking pan with butter and add chicken.  
  - Subgoal 6: Bake the chicken, flipping midway.  
**Current Goal:** Prepare the oven and baking dish (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to prepare the oven and baking dish. This involves preheating the oven to the appropriate temperature and ensuring the baking dish is ready for cooking, staying indoors due to hot weather.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), suitable for oven-fried chicken to achieve a crispy texture. Place an oven-safe baking dish inside during preheating to warm it, which helps with even cooking and crispiness. Ensure all actions are performed indoors using kitchen equipment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the oven and baking dish are properly prepared for the next steps of making oven-fried chicken.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the oven has reached 400°F using an oven thermometer or the oven’s display. Confirm the baking dish is hot and suitable for adding butter and chicken later. If the oven isn’t at the correct temperature, wait and recheck. Ensure no outdoor equipment is used, adhering to the constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to create the wet mixture by combining egg and milk, which will be used for coating the chicken.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a shallow bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs and ¼ cup of milk until fully combined. This mixture will help the dry coating adhere to the chicken, creating a crispy texture when baked. Perform this step in the kitchen.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to prepare the dry coating for the chicken.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper. This dry coating will provide flavor and crunch to the oven-fried chicken. Ensure preparation is done indoors.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure alignment with the script and progress.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make fried chicken in the oven.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking dish (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create the wet mixture (egg and milk) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the dry coating (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat the chicken (cutting, dipping in dry coating, egg mixture, dry coating again).  
  - Subgoal 5: Prepare the baking pan with butter and add chicken.  
  - Subgoal 6: Bake the chicken, flipping midway.  
**Current Goal:** Coat the chicken (Subgoal 4).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to coat the chicken by cutting it and dipping it into the dry coating, egg mixture, and dry coating again.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cut 4 chicken breasts or 8 drumsticks into even pieces. Dredge each piece in the dry coating (flour mixture), then dip into the egg-milk mixture, ensuring full coverage. Dredge again in the dry coating for a thick, crispy layer. Work indoors on a clean kitchen surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the chicken is properly coated and ready for baking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect each chicken piece to ensure it is evenly coated with the dry mixture on all sides after the double-dipping process. If any areas are uneven, re-dip in the egg mixture and dry coating as needed. Confirm all pieces are prepared indoors and ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to prepare the baking pan with butter and add the coated chicken pieces.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the preheated baking dish from the oven (using oven mitts). Add 4 tbsp of butter to the hot dish, allowing it to melt and coat the bottom. Place the coated chicken pieces in the dish in a single layer, ensuring they don’t overlap for even cooking. Perform all actions indoors.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Current goal is to bake the chicken and flip it midway to ensure even cooking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the baking dish with chicken in the oven at 400°F. Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the dish, flip each chicken piece using tongs, and return to the oven for another 15-20 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165°F and the coating is golden and crispy. All baking is done indoors.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the chicken is fully cooked and meets the desired texture.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the internal temperature of the chicken with a meat thermometer to confirm it reaches 165°F. Ensure the coating is golden and crispy on all sides. If not fully cooked, return to the oven for additional time. Verify all steps were completed indoors, satisfying the hot weather constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion of the plan.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make fried chicken in the oven (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking dish (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create the wet mixture (egg and milk) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the dry coating (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat the chicken (cutting, dipping in dry coating, egg mixture, dry coating again) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Prepare the baking pan with butter and add chicken (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Bake the chicken, flipping midway (Completed).  
**Current Goal:** None; all subgoals and the main goal are completed. The oven-fried chicken is ready to serve, prepared entirely indoors as required.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to make oven-fried chicken has been completed, following the provided script and respecting the constraint of avoiding outdoor cooking due to hot weather. All steps were executed using the meta-cognitive action set, with appropriate use of Planning, Implementation, and Review actions, structured in the specified [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks.
