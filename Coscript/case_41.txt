### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make carrot cake pancakes with walnuts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the cooking equipment (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix the wet ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine dry ingredients with the wet mixture.  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate carrots and walnuts.  
  - Subgoal 5: Cook the pancakes.  
  - Subgoal 6: Serve the pancakes.  
**Current Goal**: Mix the wet ingredients.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the wet ingredients. This involves whisking together eggs, milk, melted butter, and sugar in a large bowl to create a smooth base for the pancake batter.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In a large bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and 2 tablespoons of sugar until the mixture is smooth and well combined.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the wet ingredient mixture. This involves checking that the eggs, milk, melted butter, and sugar are thoroughly combined into a smooth mixture without lumps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the wet ingredient mixture to ensure it is smooth, with no visible egg streaks or unmixed sugar. If lumps are present, whisk further until the mixture is uniform.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine dry ingredients with the wet mixture. This involves adding flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon to the wet ingredients and mixing until well combined to form the pancake batter.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To the wet ingredient mixture, add 1 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix until the batter is well combined, ensuring no dry pockets of flour remain.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate carrots and walnuts. This involves folding grated carrots and chopped walnuts into the batter to add flavor and texture, ensuring the walnuts meet the constraint of being included.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Fold in 1 cup of grated carrots and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts into the batter, mixing gently to distribute them evenly without overworking the batter.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make carrot cake pancakes with walnuts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the cooking equipment (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix the wet ingredients (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine dry ingredients with the wet mixture (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Incorporate carrots and walnuts (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Cook the pancakes.  
  - Subgoal 6: Serve the pancakes.  
**Current Goal**: Cook the pancakes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cook the pancakes. This involves scooping 1/4 cup of batter onto the preheated griddle for each pancake and cooking for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Scoop 1/4 cup of batter onto the preheated, buttered griddle for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, flipping when bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, until the pancakes are golden brown.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the cooked pancakes. This involves checking that the pancakes are golden brown on both sides and cooked through, with no raw batter in the center.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the pancakes to ensure they are golden brown on both sides and fully cooked. Cut into one pancake to confirm the center is set and not runny. If undercooked, return to the griddle for an additional 1-2 minutes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve the pancakes. Retrieve information related to serving instructions from the script to ensure proper presentation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script specifies: "Serve with butter and your favorite syrup. Add a cream cheese topping, if desired." This indicates the pancakes should be served with butter and syrup, with an optional cream cheese topping for enhanced flavor.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve the pancakes. This involves plating the pancakes and adding butter, syrup, and an optional cream cheese topping as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Plate the cooked pancakes, spreading a small amount of butter on top of each. Drizzle with your favorite syrup, such as maple syrup. If desired, add a dollop of cream cheese topping for extra flavor. Serve immediately while warm.  
[/IMP]
