[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the accuracy of the calculated slope (2) and y-intercept (3). This can be achieved by checking if the points (0, 3) and (1, 5) satisfy the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \) and ensuring the calculator’s output aligns with manual calculations.

Manually verify:  
- For (0, 3): \( y = 2(0) + 3 = 3 \). Satisfied.  
- For (1, 5): \( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \). Satisfied.
