### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Discuss concerns about potential learning disabilities with the doctor.  
**How to Achieve:** Prepare a list of specific concerns and symptoms related to learning difficulties and communicate them clearly during the appointment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Before the appointment, write down symptoms (e.g., difficulty reading, trouble focusing, or challenges with memory) and how they impact daily life. During the visit, clearly explain these concerns to the doctor, providing examples (e.g., struggling with written instructions or slow processing of information). Be honest and specific to help the doctor understand your situation. Ask questions to clarify the doctor’s feedback.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal:** Request a screening for a learning disability during the appointment.  
**Meta-Data:** Retrieve information from previous steps related to preparing for and communicating with the doctor to ensure the screening request is well-informed.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 3 (Reach Goal): Identified the need to schedule an appointment with a doctor qualified to address learning disabilities and to provide a brief reason for the visit.  
- Step 5 (Reach Goal): Prepared a list of symptoms and concerns to discuss with the doctor, emphasizing clear communication.  
This information ensures the screening request is supported by prior preparation and clear articulation of symptoms during the appointment.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Request a screening for a learning disability during the appointment.  
**How to Achieve:** Directly ask the doctor to conduct or refer you for a formal screening for learning disabilities, referencing your discussed concerns.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
During the appointment, after discussing your concerns, say, “Based on these difficulties, could you screen me for a learning disability or refer me to a specialist for testing?” Provide any additional details the doctor requests. Note any recommended tests (e.g., cognitive assessments or neuropsychological evaluations) and the process for scheduling them.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Depending on the doctor’s response to the screening request, adjust the remaining subgoal (following recommendations) to reflect specific actions, such as scheduling a specialist visit or completing recommended tests.  
If the doctor recommends immediate screening, the subgoal remains unchanged. If a referral or additional steps are suggested, refine the subgoal to incorporate these. For example:  
- Adjusted Subgoal 4: Follow the doctor’s recommendations, which may include scheduling a specialist visit, completing specific tests, or pursuing further evaluations.  
[/PLANNING]
