### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for sorting strawberries by hulling them, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions categorized as Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R). The constraint is to sort the strawberries by hulling them, and the script outlines four steps: purchasing a strawberry huller, hulling the strawberries and discarding the hulls, rinsing and draining the strawberries, and placing them in a serving dish. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and ensuring all steps are completed systematically.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of sorting strawberries by hulling them into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:
1. Acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling.
2. Remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls.
3. Clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them.
4. Arrange the strawberries in a serving dish for presentation.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals. The goals from the previous planning step are:
- **Main Goal**: Sort strawberries by hulling them.
  - Subgoal 1: Acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling.
  - Subgoal 2: Remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls.
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them.
  - Subgoal 4: Arrange the strawberries in a serving dish for presentation.

**Current Goal**: Acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling. This will be achieved by purchasing a strawberry huller from a store or online.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of acquiring a strawberry huller, identify a reliable source such as a kitchen supply store or an online retailer. Purchase a strawberry huller, ensuring it is suitable for efficiently removing strawberry hulls. Confirm the purchase and arrange for delivery or pickup.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the strawberry huller has been acquired. Validate by confirming the huller is in hand and functional.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check that the strawberry huller has been successfully purchased and delivered or picked up. Inspect the huller to ensure it is in working condition and suitable for hulling strawberries. If there are any issues (e.g., damaged or missing item), contact the supplier to resolve them.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress:
- **Main Goal**: Sort strawberries by hulling them.
  - Subgoal 1: Acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls.
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them.
  - Subgoal 4: Arrange the strawberries in a serving dish for presentation.

**Current Goal**: Remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls. This will be achieved by using the strawberry huller to remove the green tops and cores, collecting the hulled strawberries, and disposing of the hulls.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Gather fresh strawberries and the strawberry huller. Use the huller to remove the green tops and cores from each strawberry, ensuring minimal waste of the fruit. Collect the hulled strawberries in a bowl and discard the hulls in a compost bin or trash.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the strawberries are properly hulled. Validate by checking that all strawberries have their hulls removed and the hulls are discarded.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the strawberries to confirm that all hulls (green tops and cores) have been removed cleanly. Ensure no strawberries are missed and that the hulls have been properly discarded. If any strawberries still have hulls, use the huller to complete the process.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:
- **Main Goal**: Sort strawberries by hulling them.
  - Subgoal 1: Acquire a strawberry huller to enable hulling. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Remove the hulls from the strawberries using the huller and discard the hulls. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them.
  - Subgoal 4: Arrange the strawberries in a serving dish for presentation.

**Current Goal**: Clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clean the hulled strawberries by rinsing and draining them. This will be achieved by rinsing the strawberries under cold water and allowing them to drain in a colander.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place the hulled strawberries in a colander and rinse them thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris. Shake the colander gently to remove excess water, then allow the strawberries to drain completely.
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the strawberries are clean and drained. Validate by checking that the strawberries are free of dirt and excess water.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the strawberries to confirm they are clean and free of dirt or debris. Ensure they are adequately drained and not overly wet. If any strawberries are still dirty, rinse them again. If excess water remains, allow additional draining time or pat dry with a clean towel.
[/IMP]
