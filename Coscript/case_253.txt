### Problem Statement
I need to create a plan for making caffeine jello shots with coffee, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The script includes four steps: making a coffee jello shot mix with coffee, gelatin, sugar, and water; pouring the mix into a coffee-filtered silicone mold; freezing the jello shots for 2 hours; and removing them from the mold to enjoy. The constraint is that the jello shots must include coffee, and the task falls under the category of Food and Entertaining. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the sets of Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.
