### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making a mouse pad with a kit into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script outlines two main steps: selecting a kit and following the instructions. These can be expanded into actionable subgoals to ensure a clear path forward.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify and choose an appropriate mouse pad kit.  
- Subgoal 2: Gather necessary tools and materials included in the kit.  
- Subgoal 3: Execute the kit’s instructions to assemble the mouse pad.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the completed mouse pad meets quality expectations.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a mouse pad with a kit.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and choose an appropriate mouse pad kit.  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather necessary tools and materials included in the kit.  
  - Subgoal 3: Execute the kit’s instructions to assemble the mouse pad.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the completed mouse pad meets quality expectations.  
**Current Goal**: Identify and choose an appropriate mouse pad kit.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and choose an appropriate mouse pad kit.  
**How to Achieve**: Research available mouse pad kits, considering factors such as material quality, design options, and compatibility with the task constraint (using a kit). Select a kit that is user-friendly and suitable for crafting a functional mouse pad.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of selecting a kit, I’ll outline the process for identifying an appropriate mouse pad kit. Mouse pad kits typically include materials like foam, fabric, and adhesive backing, along with instructions. Based on the constraint of using a kit, I’ll assume the kit provides all necessary components. A suitable kit should:  
- Include durable, smooth fabric for the mouse pad surface.  
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for assembly.  
- Allow customization (e.g., design or size) if desired.  
For this task, I’ll select a hypothetical kit, “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit,” which includes pre-cut foam, fabric, adhesive, and a design template, as it meets these criteria and is beginner-friendly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the selection of the mouse pad kit.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the chosen kit aligns with the task requirements and constraints, ensuring it contains all necessary materials and clear instructions for crafting a mouse pad.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the selection of the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit,” I’ll check its components against the task requirements:  
- **Constraint Check**: The kit is a complete package, including foam, fabric, adhesive, and instructions, satisfying the “with kit” constraint.  
- **Suitability Check**: The kit provides a durable fabric surface and a design template, ensuring functionality and ease of use. The instructions are described as clear, suitable for a Hobbies and Crafts project.  
- **Outcome**: The kit is valid for the task, as it meets all requirements for creating a functional mouse pad.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The initial subgoals are appropriate but can be refined for clarity and specificity based on the validated kit selection. Adjust the remaining subgoals to reflect the use of the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit.”  
- Subgoal 1: Completed (kit selected: “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit”).  
- Subgoal 2: Unpack the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” and verify all included materials (foam, fabric, adhesive, template).  
- Subgoal 3: Follow the kit’s instructions to assemble the mouse pad, including cutting, adhering, and designing.  
- Subgoal 4: Inspect the completed mouse pad for functionality and quality.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy based on the adjusted subgoals.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make a mouse pad with a kit.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and choose an appropriate mouse pad kit (Completed: “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” selected).  
  - Subgoal 2: Unpack the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” and verify all included materials (foam, fabric, adhesive, template).  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the kit’s instructions to assemble the mouse pad, including cutting, adhering, and designing.  
  - Subgoal 4: Inspect the completed mouse pad for functionality and quality.  
**Current Goal**: Unpack the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” and verify all included materials.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Unpack the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” and verify all included materials.  
**How to Achieve**: Open the kit, check the contents against the provided inventory list, and ensure all materials (foam, fabric, adhesive, template) are present and undamaged.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Unpack the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” and verify its contents:  
- **Foam Base**: Confirm the foam is the correct size and thickness for a mouse pad.  
- **Fabric Surface**: Ensure the fabric is smooth and suitable for mouse tracking.  
- **Adhesive**: Verify the adhesive is included and functional (e.g., sticky backing or glue).  
- **Design Template**: Check for a template or instructions for customization.  
Assume the kit includes all listed items in good condition, as it’s a standard craft kit. All materials are verified as present and ready for use.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Follow the kit’s instructions to assemble the mouse pad, including cutting, adhering, and designing.  
**How to Achieve**: Read the kit’s instructions carefully and execute each step, such as cutting materials to size, adhering the fabric to the foam, and applying any design elements using the template.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Following the “CraftEasy Mouse Pad Kit” instructions:  
1. **Cut Materials**: Use the template to cut the fabric and foam to the specified mouse pad size (e.g., 9x7 inches).  
2. **Adhere Fabric**: Apply the adhesive to attach the fabric securely to the foam base, ensuring no wrinkles or air bubbles.  
3. **Apply Design**: Use the design template to add a custom pattern or image (e.g., a printed design or hand-drawn elements) to the fabric surface.  
4. **Finish**: Smooth out the surface and let the adhesive set as per the instructions (e.g., 1 hour drying time).  
The mouse pad is assembled according to the kit’s guidelines.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Inspect the completed mouse pad for functionality and quality.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the mouse pad for smoothness, mouse tracking accuracy, and durability, ensuring it meets the expected standards for a functional mouse pad.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the completed mouse pad:  
- **Smoothness**: Check that the fabric surface is flat, with no wrinkles or loose edges.  
- **Mouse Tracking**: Test the mouse pad with a computer mouse to ensure accurate cursor movement.  
- **Durability**: Confirm the adhesive holds the fabric and foam securely, with no peeling after light use.  
- **Aesthetics**: Verify the design (if applied) is clear and visually appealing.  
Assume the mouse pad passes all checks: the surface is smooth, the mouse tracks accurately, and the materials are securely bonded. The mouse pad is functional and meets quality expectations.
