**Step 1: Decide on the scope of the playlist**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of creating a Michael Jackson playlist into intermediate subgoals. The first script step is to decide on the scope, which involves defining the playlist’s theme, length, and era of Michael Jackson’s music. Subgoals include:  
- Determine the playlist’s purpose (e.g., party, workout, or retrospective).  
- Set the target number of songs (e.g., 10–15 songs).  
- Choose whether to focus on a specific era (e.g., 1980s, solo career, or including Jackson 5).  
These subgoals will guide song selection and organization.
