**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to share a printer with a friend, ensuring the printer is accessible to both parties. The task involves following a provided script of steps while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the specified response format. The constraints include coordinating with a friend, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The script to follow is:

1. Find out what type of printer your friend has.
2. Install the drivers for that printer on your computer.
3. Share the printer.
4. Give your friend the printer's IP address.
5. Have your friend add the printer to their computer.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and ensuring all steps in the script are completed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of sharing a printer with a friend into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
- Identify the printer type used by the friend.  
- Install the necessary printer drivers on my computer.  
- Configure the printer for sharing on my computer.  
- Provide the printer’s IP address to the friend.  
- Assist the friend in adding the printer to their computer.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of printer the friend has. This will be achieved by contacting the friend and asking for details about their printer, such as the brand and model.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Contact the friend via a preferred communication method (e.g., phone, email, or messaging) and ask, “What type of printer do you have? Please provide the brand and model.” Record the response, for example, “HP LaserJet Pro M404n.”

### Step 3: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Share a printer with a friend.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the printer type used by the friend (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Install the necessary printer drivers on my computer (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Configure the printer for sharing on my computer (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Provide the printer’s IP address to the friend (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Assist the friend in adding the printer to their computer (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Install the necessary printer drivers on my computer.

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to install the drivers for the friend’s printer (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n) on my computer. This will be achieved by downloading the appropriate drivers from the manufacturer’s website and installing them.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visit the manufacturer’s website (e.g., hp.com for an HP printer). Search for the driver download section, enter the printer model (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n), and select the driver compatible with my computer’s operating system. Download and run the installer, following the prompts to complete the installation.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the printer drivers were installed correctly on my computer. This will be achieved by checking the printer status in the computer’s settings and ensuring it is recognized.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the “Printers & Scanners” or “Devices and Printers” section in the computer’s settings (e.g., Control Panel on Windows or System Preferences on macOS). Confirm that the printer (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n) appears in the list of installed printers. Optionally, print a test page to verify functionality.

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Share a printer with a friend.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the printer type used by the friend (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Install the necessary printer drivers on my computer (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Configure the printer for sharing on my computer (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Provide the printer’s IP address to the friend (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Assist the friend in adding the printer to their computer (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Configure the printer for sharing on my computer.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to configure the printer for sharing on my computer. This will be achieved by enabling printer sharing in the computer’s settings and ensuring the printer is accessible on the network.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the computer’s settings, navigate to “Printers & Scanners” or “Devices and Printers.” Select the printer (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n), access its properties, and enable the “Share this printer” option. Ensure both computers are on the same network (e.g., Wi-Fi or LAN). Note the printer’s network name or IP address assigned by the router.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to provide the printer’s IP address to the friend. This will be achieved by retrieving the printer’s IP address from my computer or router and sharing it with the friend via a reliable communication method.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Access the printer’s properties or the router’s admin panel to find the printer’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100). Send the IP address to the friend via email, text, or another method, along with a brief instruction: “This is the IP address of the shared printer.”

### Step 10: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assist the friend in adding the shared printer to their computer. This will be achieved by providing instructions to the friend on how to add the printer using the IP address.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Instruct the friend to open “Printers & Scanners” or “Devices and Printers” on their computer. Guide them to select “Add a Printer,” choose the option to add a network printer, and enter the printer’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100). If prompted, they should install the appropriate drivers for the printer model (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n). Confirm with the friend that the printer is added and functional by printing a test page.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the friend has successfully added the printer to their computer. This will be achieved by confirming with the friend that the printer appears in their settings and can print a test page.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Ask the friend to confirm that the printer (e.g., HP LaserJet Pro M404n) appears in their “Printers & Scanners” or “Devices and Printers” settings. Request that they print a test page and report the result. If successful, the printer-sharing setup is complete. If not, troubleshoot by verifying the IP address, network connection, and driver installation.
