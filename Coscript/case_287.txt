### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of cleaning pet vomit from the carpet using baking soda into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible.  
2. Apply baking soda to the soiled area.  
3. Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes.  
4. Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean pet vomit from carpet using baking soda.  
  - Subgoal 1: Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply baking soda to the soiled area.  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning.  
**Current Goal**: Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a clean, dry rag to gently press and blot the vomit on the carpet, absorbing as much of the mess as possible without spreading it further.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take a clean, dry rag and gently blot the pet vomit on the carpet. Press down to absorb the liquid and solid material, working from the outside inward to avoid spreading the mess. Continue blotting until no more vomit can be removed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the blotting step was effective.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the carpet to confirm that most of the vomit has been removed and the area is ready for the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the carpet visually and by touch to ensure the majority of the vomit has been blotted up. The area should appear less saturated and have minimal solid residue. If significant vomit remains, repeat the blotting process with a fresh rag.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply baking soda to the soiled area.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour a generous amount of baking soda evenly over the affected carpet area to absorb odors and remaining moisture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take a container of baking soda and pour a generous amount over the soiled area of the carpet, ensuring full coverage of the spot where the vomit was. Spread it evenly with your hand or a spoon if needed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean pet vomit from carpet using baking soda.  
  - Subgoal 1: Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply baking soda to the soiled area (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning.  
**Current Goal**: Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: Leave the baking soda undisturbed on the carpet for at least 15 minutes to allow it to absorb odors and moisture.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Leave the baking soda on the carpet for at least 15 minutes. Set a timer to ensure the time requirement is met, and avoid disturbing the area during this period.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of vacuuming the baking soda, focusing on ensuring the carpet is properly cleaned.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 1: The script specifies vacuuming the baking soda as the final step after it has sat for at least 15 minutes.  
- From Step 5: Baking soda was applied generously to cover the soiled area, which should have absorbed odors and moisture.  
- No prior issues were noted with the carpet or vacuuming process, indicating a standard vacuuming step should suffice.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a vacuum cleaner to thoroughly remove the baking soda from the carpet, ensuring the area is clean and free of residue.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment or standard setting to thoroughly vacuum the baking soda from the carpet. Move the vacuum slowly over the area to ensure all baking soda is removed. Check the carpet to confirm it looks and smells clean.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the carpet is clean and free of vomit and baking soda residue.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the carpet visually and by smell to ensure the vomit and baking soda are fully removed, and the carpet is restored.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the carpet for any remaining baking soda, vomit stains, or odors. Run your hand over the area to check for residue. If any baking soda or odor remains, vacuum again or repeat the baking soda application process as needed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean pet vomit from carpet using baking soda (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Blot the vomit to remove as much as possible (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply baking soda to the soiled area (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow baking soda to sit for at least 15 minutes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Vacuum the baking soda to complete the cleaning (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All goals completed).  
**Summary**: All subgoals have been successfully completed, and the carpet should now be clean and free of pet vomit and odors.  
[/REVIEW]
