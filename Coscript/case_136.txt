### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for blocking adult sites on a smartphone, adhering to the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) and response format. The constraint is that the task must be performed on a smartphone. The provided script outlines four steps: (1) Open the app menu, (2) Tap the Settings app, (3) Scroll down and tap Security, and (4) Tap the Block Adult Sites switch to turn it on. The solution will use the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a structured plan, selecting one action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find the Security settings to locate content restriction options.  
- **How to Achieve:** Scroll through the Settings app to find and tap the Security option to access security-related settings.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Settings app, scroll down the list of options to locate the “Security” or “Security & Privacy” option. Tap the Security option to open the security settings menu, which includes options for content restrictions or site blocking.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find the Security settings to locate content restriction options.  
- **How to Achieve:** Ensure the Security settings menu is open and contains options related to content restrictions or site blocking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm that the Security settings menu is displayed and includes options such as “Block Adult Sites” or similar content restriction settings. If the Security menu is not open or does not contain these options, scroll further or search for alternative menus like “Privacy” or “Parental Controls.”  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Enable the Block Adult Sites feature to restrict access to adult content.  
- **How to Achieve:** Locate the Block Adult Sites switch in the Security settings and tap it to enable the feature.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the Security settings menu, find the “Block Adult Sites” switch or similar option. Tap the switch to turn it on, enabling the restriction of adult content on the smartphone. If prompted, confirm the action or provide authentication (e.g., PIN or password) to activate the setting.
