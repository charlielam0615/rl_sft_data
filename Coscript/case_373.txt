[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Call or check online with the restaurant to verify the reservation details, including date, time, number of people, and any special requests (e.g., mom's favorite table or dietary needs).

From the family discussion in Step 2, mom’s preferences (e.g., favorite hobbies, colors, or interests like gardening or jewelry) were noted. Use this information to select a thoughtful gift that aligns with her tastes. If specific preferences weren’t mentioned, general insights about her likes (e.g., sentimental or practical items) can guide the choice.
