### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan to access Gmail, Calendar, and Drive with different Google accounts. The provided script outlines steps to sign in to Gmail with a primary account, add a second account, and switch between accounts. The constraint is that these services (Gmail, Calendar, and Drive) must be accessed using different Google accounts.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), categorized into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of accessing Gmail, Calendar, and Drive with different Google accounts into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Sign in to Gmail with the primary account.  
2. Add a second Google account to the browser.  
3. Access Gmail with the second account.  
4. Access Google Calendar with both accounts.  
5. Access Google Drive with both accounts.  
6. Enable switching between accounts for all services.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sign in to Gmail with the primary account. This will be achieved by navigating to the Gmail website and entering the primary account's credentials.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Navigate to [mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com). Enter the email address and password for the primary Google account. Click "Sign in" to access Gmail.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add a second Google account to the browser. This will be achieved by using the profile menu in Gmail to add another account and signing in with its credentials.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In Gmail, click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner. Select "Add account" from the drop-down menu. Enter the email address and password for the second Google account. Click "Sign in" to add the account.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that both Google accounts are added to the browser. This will be achieved by checking the profile menu to confirm both accounts are listed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner of Gmail. Verify that both the primary and second accounts appear in the drop-down menu, indicating successful addition of both accounts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access Gmail with the second account. This will be achieved by switching to the second account via the profile menu.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In Gmail, click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner. Select the second account from the drop-down menu to switch to it. Confirm that Gmail reloads with the second account’s inbox.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access Google Calendar with both accounts. This will be achieved by navigating to Google Calendar and ensuring both accounts can be accessed by switching between them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Navigate to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com). If prompted, sign in with the primary account. Click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner and switch to the second account. Confirm that Google Calendar displays the respective account’s events for each account.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access Google Drive with both accounts. This will be achieved by navigating to Google Drive and switching between accounts to access their respective files.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Navigate to [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com). If prompted, sign in with the primary account. Click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner and switch to the second account. Confirm that Google Drive displays the respective account’s files for each account.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Access Gmail, Calendar, and Drive with different Google accounts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Sign in to Gmail with the primary account (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add a second Google account to the browser (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Access Gmail with the second account (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Access Google Calendar with both accounts (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Access Google Drive with both accounts (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Enable switching between accounts for all services (In Progress).  

**Current Goal**: Enable switching between accounts for all services.  
All services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) have been accessed with both accounts. The remaining task is to ensure seamless switching between accounts across these services.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enable switching between accounts for all services. This will be achieved by confirming that the browser’s account switcher allows seamless transitions between the primary and second accounts in Gmail, Calendar, and Drive.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In each service (Gmail, Calendar, Drive), click the profile image or avatar in the top-right corner. Switch between the primary and second accounts, ensuring each service reloads with the selected account’s data (inbox for Gmail, events for Calendar, files for Drive). If prompted for permissions (e.g., "Allow" for access), click "Allow" to grant them.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all steps for accessing and switching between accounts are complete. Retrieve information from previous steps to confirm all subgoals have been addressed.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Signed into Gmail with the primary account.  
- Step 3: Added the second account via the profile menu.  
- Step 4: Validated that both accounts are listed in the profile menu.  
- Step 5: Accessed Gmail with the second account.  
- Step 6: Accessed Google Calendar with both accounts, switching between them.  
- Step 7: Accessed Google Drive with both accounts, switching between them.  
- Step 9: Ensured switching between accounts works across all services.  

All subgoals from Step 1’s forward subgoaling have been addressed. The process confirms that Gmail, Calendar, and Drive are accessible with different accounts, and switching is functional.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the entire process of accessing Gmail, Calendar, and Drive with different accounts is complete and functional. This will be achieved by testing account switching across all services and confirming data integrity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the account switcher in Gmail, Calendar, and Drive by repeatedly switching between the primary and second accounts. Verify that:  
- Gmail displays the correct inbox for each account.  
- Calendar shows the correct events for each account.  
- Drive shows the correct files for each account.  
If any issues arise (e.g., incorrect data or permission errors), re-sign in to the affected account and grant necessary permissions.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The plan to access Gmail, Calendar, and Drive with different Google accounts is complete. All subgoals have been achieved, and the process has been validated through account switching and data verification. The constraint of using different accounts for each service has been met, following the provided script and extending it to cover Calendar and Drive.
