**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to remove paint from wood using sandpaper, following the provided script and constraint, and create a plan using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and ensuring the plan is completed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for removing paint from wood using sandpaper, break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare materials, including selecting coarse sandpaper.  
2. Sand the wood surface in the direction of the grain to remove paint.  
3. Clean the surface by wiping away sanding debris.  
4. Assess the surface and repeat sanding with finer grits if needed.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and the constraint of using sandpaper.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove paint from wood using sandpaper.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials, including selecting coarse sandpaper.  
  - Subgoal 2: Sand the wood surface in the direction of the grain to remove paint.  
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the surface by wiping away sanding debris.  
  - Subgoal 4: Assess the surface and repeat sanding with finer grits if needed.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare materials, including selecting coarse sandpaper.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare materials, including selecting coarse sandpaper.  
**How to Achieve**: Gather coarse sandpaper (e.g., 60-80 grit), a clean dry cloth, and ensure the workspace is clear for safe sanding.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of preparing materials, select coarse sandpaper with a grit range of 60-80, suitable for initial paint removal from wood. Ensure a clean, dry cloth is available for later debris removal. Set up a well-ventilated workspace with adequate lighting to inspect the wood surface. Verify that the sandpaper is compatible with the wood type to avoid damage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the materials for sanding are correctly prepared.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the selected sandpaper is coarse (60-80 grit), the cloth is clean and dry, and the workspace is suitable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the sandpaper to confirm it is 60-80 grit, appropriate for removing paint without excessively damaging the wood. Verify the cloth is free of debris or moisture to ensure effective cleaning later. Ensure the workspace is clear, well-lit, and ventilated to support safe and effective sanding. If any materials are unsuitable (e.g., sandpaper is too fine or cloth is dirty), replace them before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sand the wood surface in the direction of the grain to remove paint.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the coarse sandpaper to sand the wood, following the grain direction to effectively remove paint while minimizing surface damage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the coarse sandpaper (60-80 grit) and begin sanding the wood surface, applying even pressure and moving in the direction of the wood grain, as specified in the script. Focus on areas with paint, ensuring consistent strokes to avoid scratches or uneven surfaces. Continue sanding until the majority of the paint is removed, periodically checking the surface for progress.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that sanding is effectively removing paint and following the grain.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the wood surface to ensure paint is being removed without damaging the wood and confirm sanding aligns with the grain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the sanded area to confirm that paint is being removed evenly and that the wood surface remains intact without deep scratches. Check that sanding strokes align with the wood grain, as deviating could cause visible damage. If paint remains or the surface is uneven, continue sanding with coarse sandpaper or adjust technique to maintain grain alignment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Clean the surface by wiping away sanding debris.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe the wood surface, removing all sanding dust and debris.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the clean, dry cloth prepared earlier and gently wipe the sanded wood surface to remove all sanding dust and debris, as per the script. Ensure thorough cleaning to prevent dust from interfering with further sanding or inspection. Check that the cloth remains clean during wiping; if it becomes soiled, replace it with a fresh one to avoid redistributing debris.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Remove paint from wood using sandpaper.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare materials, including selecting coarse sandpaper. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Sand the wood surface in the direction of the grain to remove paint. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the surface by wiping away sanding debris. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Assess the surface and repeat sanding with finer grits if needed.  
**Current Goal**: Assess the surface and repeat sanding with finer grits if needed.  
This updated hierarchy reflects completed subgoals and focuses on the final subgoal to assess and potentially repeat the process.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Assess the surface and repeat sanding with finer grits if needed.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the wood for remaining paint or rough patches, and if necessary, sand with finer grit sandpaper (e.g., 120-220 grit) to smooth the surface.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the wood surface under good lighting to check for any remaining paint or rough areas. If paint persists or the surface is not smooth, select finer grit sandpaper (120-220 grit) and sand again in the direction of the grain, as per the script’s guidance to work down to finer grits. Wipe away debris with the clean, dry cloth after sanding. If the surface is smooth and paint-free, the process is complete; otherwise, repeat sanding and cleaning as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the wood surface is paint-free and smooth.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the wood for any remaining paint or rough patches and verify the surface meets the desired quality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Carefully inspect the wood surface to ensure all paint has been removed and the surface is smooth to the touch. Run your hand over the surface to detect any rough patches or check visually for paint residue. If any issues are found, return to sanding with finer grit sandpaper and repeat cleaning. If the surface is smooth and paint-free, the goal of removing paint from wood using sandpaper is achieved.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
