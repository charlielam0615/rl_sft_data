[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step, highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find out who unfollowed you on Instagram using a tracking app.  
  - Subgoal 1: Install and open the tracking app.  
  - Subgoal 2: Authenticate the app with Instagram credentials.  
  - Subgoal 3: Authorize the app to access Instagram account data.  
  - Subgoal 4: Choose a specific time period for tracking unfollowers.  
  - Subgoal 5: Access and review the list of unfollowers.  

**Current Goal**: Install and open the tracking app.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Install and open the tracking app.  
**How to Achieve**: Download a reputable Instagram tracking app from the app store, install it on the device, and launch the app.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Search for a trusted Instagram tracking app (e.g., FollowMeter, Unfollowers for Instagram) in the App Store or Google Play Store. Download and install the app, then tap the app icon to open it. Ensure the device is connected to the internet for a smooth installation process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Install and open the tracking app.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the app is installed correctly and opens without errors.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the app icon appears on the device’s home screen. Launch the app and confirm it loads the initial interface without crashes or error messages. If errors occur, ensure the app is compatible with the device’s operating system and reinstall if necessary.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Authenticate the app with Instagram credentials.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the process of signing into the app with Instagram credentials, focusing on the steps or requirements for authentication.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The script indicates that the next step after opening the app is to “Sign in with your Instagram account.” This involves entering Instagram login credentials (username and password) into the tracking app to link it with the Instagram account. No prior steps mentioned specific authentication details, but the app is expected to prompt for login upon first use.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Authenticate the app with Instagram credentials.  
**How to Achieve**: Enter Instagram username and password in the app’s login interface to authenticate and link the account.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the “Sign in with Instagram” option in the app’s initial interface. Enter your Instagram username and password in the provided fields. If two-factor authentication is enabled, provide the verification code sent to your registered device or email. Confirm login by following any additional prompts, such as accepting terms of service.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Authorize the app to access Instagram account data.  
**How to Achieve**: Grant necessary permissions when prompted by the app to access Instagram account information, such as follower and following lists.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After signing in, the app will request permission to access your Instagram account data. Review the permissions (e.g., access to followers, following, and profile data) and tap “Authorize” or “Allow” to grant access. Ensure the app is legitimate to avoid security risks, and do not share sensitive personal information beyond what is required.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the remaining subgoals to ensure clarity and account for potential app-specific variations.  

- Subgoal 4 (Refined): Select a time period for tracking unfollowers, ensuring the app allows customizable time ranges or defaults to a recent period.  
- Subgoal 5 (Refined): View and interpret the list of unfollowers, noting any app-specific features like filters or detailed analytics.  

[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and update the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the refined subgoals and highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find out who unfollowed you on Instagram using a tracking app.  
  - Subgoal 1: Install and open the tracking app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Authenticate the app with Instagram credentials (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Authorize the app to access Instagram account data (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select a time period for tracking unfollowers, ensuring the app allows customizable time ranges or defaults to a recent period.  
  - Subgoal 5: View and interpret the list of unfollowers, noting any app-specific features like filters or detailed analytics.  

**Current Goal**: Select a time period for tracking unfollowers.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select a time period for tracking unfollowers.  
**How to Achieve**: Navigate to the app’s tracking or analytics section and choose a time period (e.g., last week, last month) to view unfollower data.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the app, locate the section labeled “Unfollowers,” “Analytics,” or similar. Select a time period from available options (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, or custom range) or use the app’s default setting. Confirm the selection to generate the unfollower report. If the app does not offer time period options, note the default period used.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select a time period for tracking unfollowers.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the selected time period is applied and the app displays relevant unfollower data.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the app updates to reflect the chosen time period and displays a list or report of unfollowers. Ensure the data corresponds to the selected timeframe (e.g., unfollowers from the last 7 days). If the report is empty or incorrect, reselect the time period or check for app updates or connectivity issues.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: View and interpret the list of unfollowers.  
**How to Achieve**: Access the unfollower report in the app and review the list of accounts that have unfollowed you, noting any additional details provided.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Navigate to the unfollower report in the app, typically found in the “Unfollowers” or “Insights” section. Review the list of Instagram accounts that have unfollowed you within the selected time period. Note any additional features, such as profile links, timestamps, or analytics (e.g., trends in unfollows). Take screenshots or export the list if needed for future reference.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals are completed and the main goal is achieved.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find out who unfollowed you on Instagram using a tracking app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Install and open the tracking app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Authenticate the app with Instagram credentials (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Authorize the app to access Instagram account data (Completed).

**Summary**: The plan to find out who unfollowed you on Instagram using a tracking app has been completed by systematically applying meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, and Review). Each step followed the provided script, incorporated the constraint of using a tracking app, and adhered to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks. The process involved installing and opening the app, authenticating and authorizing it, selecting a time period, and viewing the unfollower list, with validations and reviews ensuring accuracy and completion.
