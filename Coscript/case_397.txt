**Current Goal:** Understand the overall design by viewing the line drawings.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to understand the overall design by viewing the line drawings. This will be achieved by examining the line drawings included with the sewing pattern to grasp the garment’s structure and key features.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the line drawings provided with the sewing pattern, typically found on the instruction sheet. Focus on the front, back, and side views to understand the garment’s shape, seam placements, and key design elements. Note any specific details, such as darts or pleats, that will guide the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the line drawings were correctly interpreted. This will be achieved by cross-checking the observed design elements with the pattern instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the noted design elements (e.g., seams, darts, or pleats) from the line drawings with the written instructions or pattern envelope. Verify that the garment’s structure and key features align with the intended design. If discrepancies are found, revisit the line drawings to clarify.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and highlight the next goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Read a sewing pattern with a ruler to complete a sewing project.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the overall design by viewing the line drawings (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Familiarize with the pattern pieces by studying their layout and structure (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Recognize the symbols on the pattern pieces to understand their instructions.  
  - Subgoal 4: Accurately measure the pattern pieces using a ruler.  
  - Subgoal 5: Precisely cut the pattern pieces based on measurements.  
  - Subgoal 6: Sew the pattern pieces together to complete the project.

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to familiarize with the pattern pieces by studying their layout and structure. This will be achieved by laying out the pattern pieces and reviewing their shapes and labels.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Spread out the pattern pieces on a flat surface. Identify each piece by its label (e.g., front, back, sleeve) and examine its shape and edges. Note how the pieces correspond to the line drawings and the overall garment structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to recognize the symbols on the pattern pieces. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the pattern pieces and line drawings to support symbol identification.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Step 3 [IMP]: The line drawings showed the garment’s structure, including seams, darts, and pleats, which may correspond to symbols on the pattern pieces.  
- From Step 6 [IMP]: The pattern pieces were laid out, and their shapes and labels were studied, providing context for where symbols might appear (e.g., along seams or at dart points).  
This information helps identify symbols by connecting them to the garment’s design and structure.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to recognize the symbols on the pattern pieces. This will be achieved by examining the pattern pieces for common sewing symbols and referencing the pattern’s symbol key.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect each pattern piece for symbols such as notches, grainlines, darts, or fold lines. Refer to the pattern’s instruction sheet or symbol key to understand their meanings. For example, notches indicate where pieces align, and grainlines show fabric orientation. Make a list of symbols and their purposes for reference.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the symbols on the pattern pieces were correctly identified. This will be achieved by cross-referencing the listed symbols with the pattern instructions and line drawings.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the list of identified symbols with the pattern’s symbol key and the line drawings. Verify that each symbol’s purpose (e.g., notches for alignment, darts for shaping) aligns with the garment’s design. If any symbols are unclear, consult the pattern instructions or a sewing reference guide.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to accurately measure the pattern pieces using a ruler. This will be achieved by using a ruler to measure key dimensions of the pattern pieces, such as seam allowances and lengths.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a ruler to measure critical dimensions on each pattern piece, such as seam allowances (typically 5/8 inch or as specified), lengths of seams, and dart dimensions. Record measurements for accuracy and consistency. Double-check measurements against the pattern instructions to ensure they match the intended design.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the pattern pieces were measured accurately. This will be achieved by re-measuring key dimensions and comparing them with the pattern instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-measure the seam allowances, seam lengths, and other critical dimensions on each pattern piece using the ruler. Compare these measurements with the pattern instructions or symbol key to confirm accuracy. If discrepancies are found, adjust measurements as needed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to precisely cut the pattern pieces based on measurements. This will be achieved by using scissors to cut along the marked lines of the pattern pieces, guided by the measurements taken.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using sharp fabric scissors, carefully cut each pattern piece along the marked lines, following the measured dimensions (e.g., seam allowances). Ensure cuts are smooth and precise, especially around notches and curves. Verify that each piece is cut according to its labeled size and shape.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the pattern pieces were cut accurately. This will be achieved by checking the cut pieces against the original pattern and measurements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lay the cut pattern pieces over the original pattern to confirm they match in size and shape. Re-check key measurements (e.g., seam allowances, lengths) with a ruler to ensure accuracy. If any pieces are incorrectly cut, adjust or re-cut as necessary.
