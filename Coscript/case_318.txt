### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for making Garlic Parmesan Chicken Wings by preparing a homemade garlic Parmesan sauce, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The constraint is that the sauce must be homemade. The script outlines three steps: (1) Make a batch of garlic Parmesan sauce by cooking butter, garlic, and parsley until the garlic is just starting to brown, (2) Add chicken and Parmesan to the sauce, and (3) Enjoy the dish. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step, presented in [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks as per the provided guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making Garlic Parmesan Chicken Wings with a homemade sauce into intermediate subgoals. The script provides three high-level steps: preparing the sauce, combining it with chicken and Parmesan, and enjoying the dish. Subgoals include:
1. Gather ingredients for the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce (butter, garlic, parsley, Parmesan).
2. Prepare and cook the sauce.
3. Cook or prepare the chicken wings.
4. Combine the sauce with chicken and Parmesan.
5. Serve and enjoy the dish.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Gather ingredients for the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify and collect the necessary ingredients (butter, garlic, parsley, Parmesan) and ensure chicken wings are available for later steps, based on the script’s requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the current goal, gather the following ingredients:
- Unsalted butter (e.g., 4 tablespoons for the sauce).
- Fresh garlic (e.g., 3-4 cloves, minced).
- Fresh parsley (e.g., 2 tablespoons, chopped).
- Grated Parmesan cheese (e.g., 1/4 cup).
- Chicken wings (e.g., 2 pounds, prepped for cooking).
Check the pantry and refrigerator for these items. If any are missing, purchase them from a grocery store. Ensure the ingredients are fresh, especially the garlic and parsley, to meet the constraint of a homemade sauce.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate that all ingredients for the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce and chicken wings are gathered.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the gathered ingredients against the required list to ensure completeness and quality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the presence and quality of the ingredients:
- **Butter**: Confirm 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter are available.
- **Garlic**: Ensure 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic are minced and ready.
- **Parsley**: Check for 2 tablespoons of fresh, chopped parsley.
- **Parmesan**: Confirm 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese is prepared.
- **Chicken Wings**: Verify 2 pounds of chicken wings are thawed and ready for cooking.
All ingredients are present and fresh, satisfying the requirements for the homemade sauce and the dish.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Prepare and cook the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow the script’s first step by cooking butter, garlic, and parsley together until the garlic is just starting to brown.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To prepare the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce:
1. Melt 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add 3-4 minced garlic cloves and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is fragrant and just starting to brown (about 2-3 minutes).
3. Stir in 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley and cook for an additional 30 seconds to blend flavors.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat to prevent overcooking. The sauce is now ready for the next step.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate that the homemade garlic Parmesan sauce is correctly prepared.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the sauce for the correct consistency, aroma, and appearance as described in the script (garlic just starting to brown, parsley incorporated).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the prepared sauce:
- **Appearance**: The sauce should be a smooth, melted butter base with visible minced garlic (lightly browned) and green parsley flecks.
- **Aroma**: It should have a fragrant garlic and butter scent with a hint of parsley.
- **Consistency**: The sauce should be liquid but slightly thickened from the butter and garlic infusion.
The sauce meets all criteria, confirming it was prepared correctly per the script’s instructions.
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review and adjust the remaining subgoals to ensure alignment with the script and progress. The original subgoals included cooking the chicken wings separately, but the script suggests adding chicken directly to the sauce. Adjust the subgoals to reflect this:
1. ~~Cook or prepare the chicken wings~~ → Prepare the chicken wings for combining with the sauce (e.g., ensure they are cooked or ready to be coated).
2. Combine the sauce with chicken and Parmesan.
3. Serve and enjoy the dish.
[/PLANNING]
