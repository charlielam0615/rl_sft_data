### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Access the Google Forms platform to initiate survey creation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Navigate to the Google Forms website using a web browser and ensure a Google account is logged in to access the platform.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open a web browser and go to the Google Forms website at forms.google.com. If not already logged in, sign in with a Google account to access the platform for creating a new form.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Access the Google Forms platform to initiate survey creation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the Google Forms website has loaded correctly and the user is logged in, ensuring access to the form creation interface.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the browser displays the Google Forms homepage and that the user is logged into their Google account. Confirm that the interface shows options to create a new form, such as a "+" button or template options. If not, troubleshoot by ensuring a stable internet connection or re-logging into the Google account.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a new form on the Google Forms website.  
- **How to Achieve**: Click the "+" sign or "Blank Form" option on the Google Forms homepage to start creating a new survey form.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
On the Google Forms homepage, locate and click the "+" button or select "Blank Form" to initiate a new form. This will open a new form editing interface where the survey can be customized.  

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Customize the form with a title and description to define its purpose.  
- **How to Achieve**: In the form editing interface, enter a relevant title and description that clearly communicate the survey’s objective to respondents.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the form editing interface, click on the default "Untitled Form" field and enter a title, such as "Customer Feedback Survey." Below the title, add a description, for example, "We value your feedback! Please take a moment to share your thoughts on our services." Ensure the title and description are clear and concise.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Design and add survey questions to collect relevant data.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the Google Forms question editor to add various question types (e.g., multiple choice, text) that align with the survey’s objectives.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the form editing interface, click the "+" button to add questions. For each question:  
- Select a question type (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, or rating scale).  
- Enter the question text, such as “How satisfied are you with our service?”  
- Add response options if applicable (e.g., “Very Satisfied,” “Satisfied,” “Neutral,” “Dissatisfied”).  
- Mark questions as required if necessary. Add at least 3–5 questions to ensure sufficient data collection.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Distribute the form to survey respondents via email.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information about the form’s creation and customization to ensure it is ready for distribution.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recall Info**:  
- The Google Forms platform was accessed, and a new form was created (Steps 3–5).  
- The form was customized with a title (e.g., "Customer Feedback Survey") and a description explaining its purpose (Step 6).  
- Relevant survey questions (e.g., multiple choice, text) were added to collect data (Step 7).  
The form is now ready for distribution, as all prior steps have been completed.
