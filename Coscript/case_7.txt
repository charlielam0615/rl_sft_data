### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the appropriate location in the HTML code for inserting the password prompt.  
- **How to Achieve**: Inspect the HTML structure to find a suitable location, typically within the `<body>` tag or near the content to be protected, to insert the JavaScript code for the password prompt.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the text editor, review the HTML file’s structure. Locate the `<body>` tag, as the password prompt code should typically be placed here to ensure it executes when the page loads. Alternatively, if protecting specific content, identify the relevant section (e.g., a `<div>` containing restricted content). A common spot is just after the opening `<body>` tag or before the protected content to trigger the prompt early.

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Write and insert the JavaScript code for the password prompt.  
- **How to Achieve**: Write a JavaScript code snippet that prompts the user for a password and restricts access to the page content if the password is incorrect, then insert it into the identified location in the HTML.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the text editor, insert the following JavaScript code at the chosen location (e.g., within the `<body>` tag or in a `<script>` tag):

```javascript
<script>
  var password = prompt("Enter the password:");
  if (password !== "mySecretPassword") {
    alert("Incorrect password!");
    document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>Access Denied</h1>";
  }
</script>
```

This code prompts the user for a password, compares it to a predefined value (`mySecretPassword`), and either allows access or displays an "Access Denied" message by modifying the page content. Place this code just after the `<body>` tag or before the protected content.
