**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for controlling a mouse infestation using poison, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The plan must incorporate the constraint of using poison and follow the ordered steps: (1) Place poison in strategic locations, (2) Keep children and pets away from poison, (3) Check poison periodically and replenish as necessary, (4) Dispose of dead mice immediately, (5) Wash your hands after handling poison. Each step will be addressed using one meta-cognitive action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, with content organized in [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Strategically place poison to target mouse activity.
**How to Achieve**: Identify areas with high mouse activity (e.g., droppings, gnaw marks) and place poison baits in those locations, ensuring they are inaccessible to non-target animals and humans.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Identify common mouse activity areas such as along walls, near food sources, or in dark corners. Use tamper-resistant bait stations or secure poison in areas like behind appliances or in attics. Follow the poison manufacturer’s instructions for placement and quantity. Ensure baits are placed out of reach of children and pets to align with safety constraints.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Confirm that poison is placed effectively and safely.
**How to Achieve**: Check that poison placements are in high mouse activity areas and inaccessible to children and pets, ensuring alignment with the script and safety constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect all poison placements to verify they are in areas with signs of mouse activity (e.g., droppings, chew marks). Confirm that bait stations are secure and inaccessible to children and pets, such as placed in locked cabinets or high shelves. Ensure compliance with the poison’s safety guidelines.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

Refine the remaining subgoals to ensure clarity and feasibility:
- Subgoal 2 (adjusted): Implement safety measures to prevent children and pets from accessing poison.
- Subgoal 3 (unchanged): Monitor and maintain poison placements.
- Subgoal 4 (adjusted): Safely and promptly dispose of dead mice to prevent health risks.
- Subgoal 5 (unchanged): Maintain hygiene by washing hands after handling poison.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Control mouse infestation using poison
  - Subgoal 1: Strategically place poison to target mouse activity (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Implement safety measures to prevent children and pets from accessing poison (current subgoal).
  - Subgoal 3: Monitor and maintain poison placements.
  - Subgoal 4: Safely and promptly dispose of dead mice to prevent health risks.
  - Subgoal 5: Maintain hygiene by washing hands after handling poison.

**Current Goal**: Implement safety measures to prevent children and pets from accessing poison.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Implement safety measures to prevent children and pets from accessing poison.
**How to Achieve**: Use physical barriers or warnings to restrict access to poison locations and educate household members about risks.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place poison in locked or high areas, such as secured cabinets or shelves. Use child- and pet-proof bait stations. Inform household members about the poison locations and risks. Consider signage or barriers (e.g., locked doors) to restrict access to treated areas.
[/IMP]

**Step 8: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Core Content**: Safety measures for poison placement and mouse control.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- From Step 3 and 4: Poison must be placed in tamper-resistant bait stations or secure locations inaccessible to children and pets, following manufacturer guidelines.
- From Step 7: Safety measures include using child- and pet-proof stations, informing household members, and using physical barriers like locked cabinets or signage.
This ensures the current goal aligns with prior safety-focused actions.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 9: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Monitor and maintain poison placements.
**How to Achieve**: Regularly inspect poison baits to ensure they are active and replenish them as needed to maintain effectiveness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check bait stations every few days for signs of consumption or tampering. Replenish poison according to the manufacturer’s schedule or when depleted. Ensure placements remain secure and inaccessible to non-target animals or humans during inspections.
[/IMP]

**Step 10: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Safely and promptly dispose of dead mice to prevent health risks.
**How to Achieve**: Use protective gear to collect and dispose of dead mice in sealed bags, following local waste disposal guidelines.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Wear gloves and use tongs or a scoop to collect dead mice. Place them in sealed plastic bags and dispose of them in an outdoor trash bin, adhering to local regulations. Clean and disinfect the area where mice were found to prevent disease spread.
[/IMP]

**Step 11: Backtrack**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)

Review previous steps to ensure no safety or procedural oversights occurred, particularly in poison placement and disposal processes, before proceeding to the final subgoal.

**Step 12: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)

**Core Content**: Safety and hygiene practices related to handling poison and dead mice.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:
- From Step 4: Poison placements were validated to be secure and inaccessible to children and pets.
- From Step 7: Safety measures included child- and pet-proof stations and restricted access.
- From Step 10: Dead mice disposal involves using gloves, sealed bags, and disinfection to prevent health risks.
This ensures the final subgoal (washing hands) builds on established hygiene practices.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After handling poison, bait stations, or dead mice, wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Ensure no residue remains on skin or clothing. If contact with poison occurs, follow the manufacturer’s first-aid instructions.
