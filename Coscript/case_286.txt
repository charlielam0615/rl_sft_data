### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the customer base. This will be achieved by analyzing the target audience, such as students, professionals, or gamers, to understand their needs and preferences for the Internet Cafe.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To determine the customer base, consider the local demographic and market needs. For example, if the cafe is near a university, students may be the primary customers, requiring fast WiFi for studying or gaming. If near a business district, professionals may need reliable connectivity for remote work. Conduct a brief survey or research local competitors to identify demand. For this plan, assume the target is a mix of students and young professionals seeking high-speed internet for browsing, gaming, and work. This informs equipment and service choices.
