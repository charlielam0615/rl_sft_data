### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a daily self-care plan based on the provided script, ensuring that the plan adheres to the constraint of being practiced every day. The script includes five steps: (1) Get enough sleep, (2) Eat healthy foods, (3) Exercise regularly, (4) Take breaks when needed, and (5) Do something enjoyable every day. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, until the plan is fully completed.
