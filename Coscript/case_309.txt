### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for changing yarn while crocheting, adhering to the provided script and constraints, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) divided into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will involve selecting one action from the meta-cognitive action list, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and following the specified format for each action category.

The script for changing yarn in crocheting is:
1. Cut the working yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15 cm) tail.
2. Insert the hook into the next stitch.
3. Yarn over (yo) with the new yarn and draw the new yarn through the stitch and up to the level of the other loops on the hook (two loops on hook).
4. Yarn over and draw through both loops on hook (one loop remaining on hook).
5. Continue working with the new yarn.
6. When you reach the end of the row, turn your work and knit or crochet the next row as usual.

The constraint is that this plan is specifically for crocheting. The task falls under the category of Hobbies and Crafts. I will proceed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, until the plan is complete.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To create a plan for changing yarn in crocheting, I will break down the overall goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to successfully transition from the old yarn to the new yarn while maintaining the crochet work’s integrity. The subgoals are:
- Subgoal 1: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail.
- Subgoal 2: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn.
- Subgoal 3: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch.
- Subgoal 4: Continue crocheting with the new yarn seamlessly.
- Subgoal 5: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual.
These subgoals align with the steps in the provided script and will guide the implementation process.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
I will organize and review the hierarchy of goals to provide context for future steps.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**  
- Main Goal: Successfully change yarn in crocheting while maintaining work integrity.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail.  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn.  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch.  
  - Subgoal 4: Continue crocheting with the new yarn seamlessly.  
  - Subgoal 5: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual.  
**Current Goal**: Subgoal 1 – Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous step and ensures focus on the first actionable step.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail.  
**How to Achieve**: Cut the working yarn, ensuring a 6-inch (15 cm) tail remains, as specified in the script, to allow for weaving in the end later.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve Subgoal 1, take the working yarn (the yarn currently in use) and use scissors to cut it, leaving a tail measuring approximately 6 inches (15 cm). This tail length is sufficient for securing the yarn later by weaving it into the crochet work, ensuring the project remains neat and secure.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the yarn is cut correctly with a 6-inch tail.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the cut yarn meets the length requirement and the crochet work remains intact.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure the tail of the cut yarn to confirm it is approximately 6 inches (15 cm) long. Check that the crochet work has not unraveled and that the last stitch remains secure on the hook. If the tail is too short or too long, adjust by re-cutting carefully or proceeding if the length is close enough to function effectively.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn (Subgoal 2).  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the correct positioning of the crochet hook to start incorporating the new yarn, based on the script’s second step.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The script specifies: “Insert the hook into the next stitch.” This indicates that after cutting the old yarn, the hook should already be in the last stitch worked. The next step involves inserting the hook into the subsequent stitch in the pattern to prepare for the new yarn. No prior steps contradict this, and the crochet work should be stable after the validation in Step 4.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn.  
**How to Achieve**: Insert the crochet hook into the next stitch in the pattern, as per the script, to set up for the new yarn.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With the old yarn cut and a 6-inch tail secured, insert the crochet hook into the next stitch in the crochet pattern. Ensure the hook is positioned correctly according to the stitch type (e.g., single crochet, double crochet) being worked in the project.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The original subgoals are progressing well, but to ensure clarity, I will combine Subgoals 3 and 4 into a single subgoal for efficiency, as they both involve securing and continuing with the new yarn. Revised subgoals:  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail (completed).  
- Subgoal 2: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn (completed).  
- Subgoal 3: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch and continue crocheting seamlessly.  
- Subgoal 4: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
I will update and review the goal hierarchy based on the adjusted subgoals.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**  
- Main Goal: Successfully change yarn in crocheting while maintaining work integrity.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch and continue crocheting seamlessly.  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual.  
**Current Goal**: Subgoal 3 – Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch and continue crocheting seamlessly.  
This updated hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals and focuses on the next step.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch and continue crocheting seamlessly.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow the script’s steps 3 and 4 to yarn over with the new yarn, draw it through the stitch, and complete the stitch, then continue crocheting with the new yarn.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With the hook inserted in the next stitch, take the new yarn and yarn over (wrap the yarn over the hook). Draw the new yarn through the stitch, bringing it up to the level of other loops on the hook (resulting in two loops on the hook). Yarn over again and draw the yarn through both loops on the hook, leaving one loop remaining. Continue crocheting the next stitches in the pattern using the new yarn, ensuring the tension matches the previous work for a seamless transition.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the new yarn is secured and the crochet work continues seamlessly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the stitch with the new yarn is complete, the tension is consistent, and the work remains intact.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the completed stitch to confirm that the new yarn is securely integrated, with one loop remaining on the hook. Verify that the stitch’s tension matches the surrounding stitches and that the crochet work shows no gaps or loose loops. If the stitch is uneven, adjust the tension and rework the stitch if necessary. Continue crocheting a few more stitches to ensure the new yarn is incorporated smoothly.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To complete the final subgoal (complete the row and transition to the next), I will work backward to identify any necessary intermediate steps. The script indicates turning the work and crocheting the next row as usual. No additional steps are required beyond reaching the end of the current row and turning, as the new yarn is already integrated.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual.  
**How to Achieve**: Crochet to the end of the current row with the new yarn, then turn the work to begin the next row, following the script’s final step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Continue crocheting with the new yarn until the end of the current row is reached, following the pattern used in the project. Once at the end, turn the work (flip it to crochet back in the opposite direction). Begin crocheting the next row as usual, using the new yarn and maintaining consistent tension and stitch pattern.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
I will review the goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are complete.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**  
- Main Goal: Successfully change yarn in crocheting while maintaining work integrity.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare to switch by cutting the old yarn with an appropriate tail (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the hook correctly to begin using the new yarn (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the new yarn by completing a stitch and continue crocheting seamlessly (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete the row and transition to the next row as usual (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None – all subgoals and the main goal are complete.  
The plan for changing yarn in crocheting has been fully executed, with all steps from the script completed.
[/REVIEW]
