  - Subgoal 5: Repeat the process daily until puffiness is reduced.  

**Current Goal**: Assess puffiness and dark circles under eyes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assess puffiness and dark circles under eyes. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the under-eye area for signs of swelling or discoloration.  

[IMP]  
Observe the under-eye area in a mirror under good lighting. Note any visible puffiness (swelling) or dark circles (discoloration). This assessment confirms the need for the tea bag treatment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the assessment of puffiness and dark circles. This will be achieved by ensuring the observations are consistent and relevant to the treatment plan.  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the observed puffiness or dark circles align with symptoms treatable by tea bags (e.g., mild swelling or discoloration). If no puffiness or dark circles are present, reconsider the necessity of the treatment. For now, assume puffiness is observed, validating the need to proceed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare tea bags by steeping in boiling water. This will be achieved by boiling water and steeping two tea bags as per the script.  

[IMP]  
Boil water in a kettle or pot until it reaches a rolling boil. Place two tea bags (preferably green or black tea, known for anti-inflammatory properties) in a cup. Pour the boiling water over the tea bags and let them steep for 3-5 minutes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cool the tea bags to a safe temperature. This will be achieved by removing the tea bags from the water and allowing them to cool for a few minutes.  

[IMP]  
Remove the tea bags from the cup using a spoon or tongs to avoid burning hands. Place them on a clean plate or surface and let them cool for approximately 5-10 minutes until they are warm but not hot to the touch, ensuring safety for eye application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the tea bags are at a safe temperature for eye application. This will be achieved by checking their temperature to prevent discomfort or burns.  

[IMP]  
Gently touch the tea bags to ensure they are warm but not hot. If they are too hot, allow additional cooling time. Confirm that the tea bags are moist but not dripping to avoid irritation during application. The tea bags are now ready for use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the tea bags to eyes for 10-15 minutes. This will be achieved by placing the cooled tea bags on closed eyes and timing the application.  

[IMP]  
Lie down in a comfortable position or sit with your head tilted back. Place one tea bag over each closed eye, ensuring they cover the under-eye area. Set a timer for 10-15 minutes. Relax during this time to maximize the soothing effect. Remove the tea bags after the timer ends.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat the process daily until puffiness is reduced. Retrieve information related to the effectiveness and consistency of the tea bag application process.  

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps confirmed the process: assess puffiness (Step 3), prepare tea bags (Step 5), cool them (Step 6), validate their temperature (Step 7), and apply for 10-15 minutes (Step 8). The script indicates daily repetition is required until puffiness is reduced, suggesting consistent application is key to effectiveness. No prior information indicates a specific duration for results, so daily application and monitoring are necessary.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Adjust the subgoals to incorporate daily repetition and monitoring of puffiness reduction.  

Add a new subgoal to monitor progress and determine when puffiness is sufficiently reduced. Updated subgoals:  
1. Assess puffiness and dark circles under eyes.  
2. Prepare tea bags by steeping in boiling water.  
3. Cool the tea bags to a safe temperature.  
4. Apply the tea bags to eyes for 10-15 minutes.  
5. Monitor puffiness daily to assess reduction.  
6. Repeat the process daily until puffiness is reduced.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Organize and review the updated hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Reduce puffiness and dark circles using tea bags.  
  - Subgoal 1: Assess puffiness and dark circles under eyes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare tea bags by steeping in boiling water (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cool the tea bags to a safe temperature (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Apply the tea bags to eyes for 10-15 minutes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Monitor puffiness daily to assess reduction.  
  - Subgoal 6: Repeat the process daily until puffiness is reduced.  

**Current Goal**: Monitor puffiness daily to assess reduction.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor puffiness daily to assess reduction. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the under-eye area daily and noting changes in puffiness.  

[IMP]  
Each day, before applying tea bags, observe the under-eye area in a mirror under consistent lighting. Compare the level of puffiness to the initial assessment (Step 3). Note any reduction in swelling or improvement in appearance. Continue this monitoring daily to track progress.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat the process daily until puffiness is reduced. This will be achieved by repeating the tea bag application process (Steps 5-8) daily, incorporating monitoring (Step 12).  

[IMP]  
Daily, perform the following: Boil water and steep two tea bags (Step 5). Cool the tea bags to a safe temperature (Step 6). Validate their temperature (Step 7). Apply the tea bags to closed eyes for 10-15 minutes (Step 8). Monitor puffiness before each application (Step 12). Continue this cycle until the under-eye puffiness is no longer noticeable or significantly reduced based on daily observations.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the completion of the tea bag treatment process. This will be achieved by confirming that puffiness is reduced to a satisfactory level.  

[IMP]  
After several days of daily application and monitoring, assess the under-eye area. If puffiness and dark circles are no longer visible or are significantly reduced (based on comparison with the initial assessment in Step 3), the treatment is complete. If puffiness persists, continue the daily process and reassess after a few more days. For this simulation, assume puffiness is reduced after one week, validating successful completion.  
[/IMP]

---

**Summary**: The plan to place tea bags on eyes to reduce puffiness and dark circles has been completed through a series of meta-cognitive actions. The process involved assessing the under-eye area, preparing and cooling tea bags, applying them daily, monitoring progress, and validating the outcome. All steps followed the provided script and adhered to the meta-cognitive action set, ensuring a structured and systematic approach.
