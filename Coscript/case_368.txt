### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Incorporate the towel as a tool for stability and resistance.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Use the towel under the foot to create a sliding surface, engaging core and leg muscles for balance and toning during the exercise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The small towel is placed under the left foot to create a controlled sliding surface on a smooth floor (e.g., hardwood or tile). This setup increases the challenge of maintaining balance, engaging the core, glutes, and stabilizing muscles in the legs. The towel’s slight friction requires additional muscle activation to prevent slipping, enhancing the toning effect.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to include specific considerations for safety and form:  
1. Incorporate the towel for stability and resistance (unchanged).  
2. Outline detailed steps for performing the exercise with proper form, including safety tips.  
3. Define a clear structure for completing 3 sets per leg, including rest periods.  
4. Validate the exercise plan for safety and effectiveness, and review progress.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Outline detailed steps for performing the exercise with proper form, including safety tips.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Detail the exercise steps based on the script, emphasizing proper body alignment, muscle engagement, and precautions to avoid injury.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Exercise Steps with Proper Form and Safety Tips:**  
1. **Place a small towel under your left foot**: Stand on a smooth, non-carpeted surface. Place the towel under the arch of your left foot, ensuring it is secure and won’t bunch up. Keep your core engaged to maintain balance.  
   - **Safety Tip**: Ensure the floor is clean and free of obstacles to prevent slipping.  
2. **Lift your left leg off the ground, keeping your right knee bent**: Slowly lift your left foot, sliding it slightly backward using the towel, while bending your right knee to a comfortable angle (about 30-45 degrees). Keep your back straight and core tight to stabilize.  
   - **Safety Tip**: Avoid locking your supporting knee to prevent strain; place a chair nearby for balance if needed.  
3. **Hold for 30 seconds, then switch legs**: Hold the position, keeping your left leg extended and right knee bent, engaging your glutes and core. After 30 seconds, return to standing and repeat on the right foot.  
   - **Safety Tip**: Breathe steadily and avoid holding your breath to maintain oxygen flow.

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-Data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Define a clear structure for completing 3 sets per leg, including rest periods.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Specify the sequence of performing 3 sets for each leg, including rest intervals to ensure recovery and maintain exercise effectiveness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Set and Repetition Structure:**  
- Perform the exercise as follows:  
  1. Complete one set with the left leg (30 seconds hold).  
  2. Rest for 15 seconds.  
  3. Complete one set with the right leg (30 seconds hold).  
  4. Rest for 15 seconds.  
  5. Repeat the cycle (left leg, rest, right leg, rest) two more times to complete 3 sets per leg.  
- Total duration per cycle (one set per leg): ~90 seconds (30s left + 15s rest + 30s right + 15s rest).  
- Total workout time for 3 sets per leg: ~4.5 minutes.  
- **Note**: Rest periods allow muscle recovery, ensuring consistent form and reducing fatigue-related injury risk.
