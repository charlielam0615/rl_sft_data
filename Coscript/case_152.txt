### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the workspace and materials are properly prepared.  
**How to Achieve:** Check that the workspace is clean, ventilated, and equipped with all necessary materials listed in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the workspace to confirm it is clean, flat, and well-ventilated. Verify that all materials are present: ABS plastic pieces, saw or cutting tool, sandpaper, primer, ABS cement or adhesive, and a clean cloth. Ensure the adhesive and primer are compatible with ABS plastic by checking product labels or specifications. Confirm that the workspace is free of debris and that ventilation is adequate to handle fumes from the adhesive or primer. If any material is missing or the workspace is inadequate, address these issues before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Shape the ABS plastic by cutting or sawing.  
**How to Achieve:** Use a saw or cutting tool to cut the ABS plastic into the desired shape, ensuring precise measurements and safe handling.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure and mark the ABS plastic pieces to the desired dimensions using a ruler and marker. Secure the plastic on a stable surface, then use a fine-toothed saw or appropriate cutting tool to cut along the marked lines. Work slowly to ensure accuracy and avoid cracking the plastic. Wear safety gear, such as gloves and goggles, to protect against dust or sharp edges.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Smooth the cut edges of the ABS plastic.  
**How to Achieve:** Use sandpaper to smooth any rough or jagged edges on the cut ABS plastic pieces to ensure a better fit and stronger bond.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the cut ABS plastic pieces and use medium-grit sandpaper (120-220 grit) to gently sand the edges. Focus on removing rough spots, burrs, or jagged areas to create smooth, even surfaces. Sand in a consistent motion, checking frequently to ensure the edges are uniform. Clean the surfaces with a dry cloth to remove sanding dust, preparing them for the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Prepare surfaces with primer.  
**How to Achieve:** Apply a primer compatible with ABS plastic to the surfaces that will be glued to enhance adhesion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Ensure the ABS plastic surfaces are clean and free of dust or oils. Apply a thin, even layer of primer designed for ABS plastic to the areas that will be bonded, using a brush or applicator as recommended by the primer’s instructions. Allow the primer to dry for the specified time (typically a few minutes, as per product guidelines) to ensure proper surface preparation for gluing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Apply adhesive to one of the surfaces.  
**How to Achieve:** Apply ABS cement or a solvent-based adhesive to one of the primed surfaces to prepare for bonding.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a small brush or the applicator provided with the adhesive, apply a thin, even layer of ABS cement or solvent-based adhesive to one of the primed ABS plastic surfaces. Work quickly but carefully to avoid excess adhesive, as ABS cement typically softens the plastic to create a strong bond. Follow the adhesive’s instructions for application and timing to ensure optimal results.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Bond the surfaces together.  
**How to Achieve:** Press the two ABS plastic surfaces together and hold them firmly for a few seconds to ensure a strong bond.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Align the two ABS plastic pieces carefully, ensuring the primed and adhesive-coated surfaces are in contact. Press the surfaces together firmly, applying even pressure to ensure full contact. Hold the pieces in place for at least 10-30 seconds (or as specified by the adhesive’s instructions) to allow the bond to set. Avoid moving the pieces during this time to prevent weakening the bond.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Clean up excess adhesive.  
**How to Achieve:** Wipe away any excess adhesive that has squeezed out during bonding to ensure a clean finish.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the bonded ABS plastic pieces for any excess adhesive that may have oozed out during pressing. Use a clean, dry cloth to gently wipe away the excess adhesive before it fully cures. If the adhesive has begun to set, carefully use a solvent recommended for the adhesive (per product instructions) to clean the area without damaging the plastic or the bond. Allow the bond to cure fully as per the adhesive’s guidelines (typically 24 hours for full strength).  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the ABS plastic pieces are properly glued and the process is complete.  
**How to Achieve:** Inspect the bonded ABS plastic pieces to ensure the bond is strong, clean, and meets the desired outcome.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the bonded ABS plastic pieces to confirm the bond is secure and the pieces are aligned as intended. Test the bond gently (after the recommended curing time, typically 24 hours) to ensure it holds under light stress. Check that no excess adhesive remains and that the surfaces are clean and smooth. If any issues are found (e.g., weak bond or misalignment), consider repeating the adhesive application and bonding steps. If the bond is satisfactory, the gluing process is complete.  
[/IMP]
