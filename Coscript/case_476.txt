### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Position the paper correctly for left-handed children.  
**How to Achieve**: Place the paper on the left side of the child, tilted slightly to the right to align with their natural writing angle, ensuring comfort and visibility while preventing smudging.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal, place the paper on the child’s left side, approximately at a 30–45-degree angle to the right. This positioning accommodates the left-handed child’s natural arm movement, reduces smudging of ink or pencil marks, and improves visibility of the writing area. Ensure the desk is clear of obstructions on the left side to allow free arm movement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Demonstrate letter formation to the child.  
**How to Achieve**: Model the correct formation of letters, focusing on strokes and sequences suitable for left-handed writing, using clear visual and verbal instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use a whiteboard or large paper to demonstrate how to form each letter, emphasizing stroke direction (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right) that aligns with left-handed writing to avoid smudging. Write slowly, explaining each step (e.g., “Start at the top, pull down for the letter ‘l’”). Highlight proper letter proportions and alignment. Allow the child to observe and ask questions to clarify the process.  
[/IMP]
