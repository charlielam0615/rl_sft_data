### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for doing stage makeup for ballet, starting with a clean, dry face, following the provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response will be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks as per the guidelines. The goal is to create a complete plan for applying stage makeup for ballet, ensuring all steps in the script are addressed while respecting the constraint of beginning with a clean, dry face.

### Solution

#### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of "Do Stage Makeup for Ballet by Beginning with a Clean, Dry Face" into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Ensure the face is clean and dry.  
2. Apply foundation to create an even base.  
3. Enhance eyebrows for definition.  
4. Apply eye makeup for dramatic effect.  
5. Add false eyelashes if desired.  
6. Apply cheek makeup for contour and color.  
7. Complete the look with lip makeup.

#### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, integrating the subgoals from the previous [PLANNING] block, and highlighting the current goal.  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Do Stage Makeup for Ballet by Beginning with a Clean, Dry Face  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the face is clean and dry (Current Goal)  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply foundation to create an even base  
  - Subgoal 3: Enhance eyebrows for definition  
  - Subgoal 4: Apply eye makeup for dramatic effect  
  - Subgoal 5: Add false eyelashes if desired  
  - Subgoal 6: Apply cheek makeup for contour and color  
  - Subgoal 7: Complete the look with lip makeup  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the face is clean and dry.  
[/REVIEW]

#### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the face is clean and dry.  
- **How to Achieve:** Wash the face with a gentle cleanser, pat dry with a clean towel, and ensure no moisture or oil remains.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve a clean, dry face, start by washing the face with a gentle, non-irritating cleanser suitable for the skin type. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water to remove all traces of dirt, oil, and any previous makeup. Pat the face dry with a clean, soft towel, ensuring no moisture remains. Allow the skin to air-dry for a minute if needed to confirm it is completely dry before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

#### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the face is clean and dry.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the skin for cleanliness and dryness by visual inspection and touch.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the face in good lighting to ensure no residual makeup, dirt, or oil is present. Run a clean finger across the forehead, cheeks, and chin to confirm the skin feels dry and smooth, with no tackiness or moisture. If any areas feel oily or damp, cleanse and dry again as needed.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply eye makeup for dramatic effect.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to create a bold, stage-appropriate eye look.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply a neutral eyeshadow base, then layer darker shades (e.g., deep browns or blacks) on the eyelid and crease for depth, blending carefully. Use a black or dark brown eyeliner to define the upper and lower lash lines, extending slightly for a dramatic effect. Finish with multiple coats of volumizing mascara to enhance the lashes, ensuring the eyes stand out under stage lighting.

**Current Goal:** Add false eyelashes if desired.  
[/REVIEW]

#### Step 12: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The subgoal "Add false eyelashes if desired" is optional. Adjust this subgoal to decide whether to include false eyelashes based on the ballet performance's requirements. For a dramatic stage look, false eyelashes are typically used in ballet to enhance the eyes. Therefore, modify the subgoal to "Apply false eyelashes for enhanced stage presence."  
[/PLANNING]

#### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply false eyelashes for enhanced stage presence.  
- **How to Achieve:** Select and apply false eyelashes using adhesive, ensuring they are secure and aligned.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Choose dramatic false eyelashes suitable for stage performance. Apply a thin layer of eyelash adhesive to the lash band and wait a few seconds until tacky. Carefully place the lashes along the natural lash line, pressing gently to secure. Adjust as needed to ensure they are aligned and comfortable, enhancing the eyes for stage visibility.  
[/IMP]

#### Step 14: Track Goals

- **How to Achieve:** Use blush and contour products to define and highlight the cheeks.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply a contour shade below the cheekbones to define the face, blending upward for a natural look. Add a vibrant blush (e.g., pink or peach) to the apples of the cheeks, blending toward the temples for a healthy, stage-visible glow. Optionally, apply a highlighter above the cheekbones for added dimension under stage lighting.

Under bright lighting mimicking stage conditions, inspect the entire makeup look. Verify that the foundation is even, eyebrows are defined, eye makeup is bold, false eyelashes are secure, cheeks are contoured and colorful, and lips are vibrant. Make any necessary touch-ups to ensure the makeup is cohesive, durable, and visible for a ballet performance.  
[/IMP]

### Summary
The plan for "Do Stage Makeup for Ballet by Beginning with a Clean, Dry Face" has been completed using the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals from the provided script were addressed through a combination of planning (Forward Subgoaling, Adjust Subgoals), implementation (Reach Goal, Validation), and review (Track Goals) actions. The process ensured the constraint of starting with a clean, dry face was met, and each makeup step was executed to create a stage-ready ballet look.
