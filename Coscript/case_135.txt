**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to turn off Bixby on a Galaxy Note 10, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task involves creating a plan to disable Bixby, adhering to the given script and constraints, using one meta-cognitive action per step, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The constraint is that the task must be performed on a Galaxy Note 10, and the script provides four steps to achieve this: open the Settings app, tap "Advanced features," tap "Bixby key," and select "Don’t open anything" followed by pressing the back button.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of turning off Bixby on the Galaxy Note 10 into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Access the Settings app on the Galaxy Note 10.  
2. Navigate to the "Advanced features" menu.  
3. Select the "Bixby key" option.  
4. Configure the Bixby key to "Don’t open anything" and exit the menu.  
These subgoals will guide the subsequent steps to achieve the final goal of disabling Bixby.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the Settings app on the Galaxy Note 10. This will be achieved by locating and opening the Settings app from the home screen or app drawer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To open the Settings app on the Galaxy Note 10, locate the app icon on the home screen or in the app drawer. The icon typically resembles a gear. Tap the icon to open the Settings app. This step establishes the foundation for navigating to the Bixby settings.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the "Advanced features" menu. This will be achieved by scrolling through the Settings app and selecting the "Advanced features" option.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the Settings app, scroll through the list of options to find "Advanced features." Tap on "Advanced features" to enter the menu. This step allows access to the Bixby key configuration options.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the "Bixby key" option. This will be achieved by locating and tapping the "Bixby key" option within the "Advanced features" menu.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the "Advanced features" menu, find the "Bixby key" option, which controls the behavior of the Bixby button. Tap on "Bixby key" to access its settings. This step is necessary to modify Bixby’s functionality.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to configure the Bixby key to "Don’t open anything" and exit the menu. This will be achieved by selecting the appropriate option in the Bixby key settings and pressing the back button to save and exit.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the "Bixby key" settings, select the option labeled "Don’t open anything" to disable Bixby activation via the key. After selecting this option, press the back button to save the changes and exit the menu. This completes the process of turning off Bixby on the Galaxy Note 10.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Turn off Bixby on the Galaxy Note 10.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Settings app on the Galaxy Note 10 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Navigate to the "Advanced features" menu (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the "Bixby key" option (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Configure the Bixby key to "Don’t open anything" and exit the menu (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been completed. The goal hierarchy reflects the successful execution of all planned steps to disable Bixby.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that Bixby has been successfully disabled on the Galaxy Note 10. This will be achieved by testing the Bixby key to ensure it no longer activates Bixby.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Press the Bixby key on the Galaxy Note 10. If the key is correctly configured to "Don’t open anything," no Bixby-related function should activate. Confirm that no action occurs, indicating that Bixby has been successfully turned off.  
[/IMP]

---

**Summary**: The plan to turn off Bixby on the Galaxy Note 10 has been completed by following the provided script, using one meta-cognitive action per step. The process involved planning subgoals, implementing each step (opening Settings, navigating to "Advanced features," selecting "Bixby key," and configuring it to "Don’t open anything"), reviewing the goal hierarchy, and validating the outcome. All actions adhered to the specified format and constraints.
