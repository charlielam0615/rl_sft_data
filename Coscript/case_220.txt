### Problem Statement
The goal is to stop swearing by adopting a more formal speaking style. The task falls under the "Relationships" category, with the constraint that the solution must involve speaking more formally. The provided script outlines three steps: (1) Be aware of the situation and audience, (2) Choose words carefully, and (3) Practice speaking in a more formal way. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), adhering to the specified format and structure, until a comprehensive plan is completed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of "stop swearing by speaking more formally" into forward-looking intermediate subgoals. To achieve this, I will create a sequence of actionable subgoals that align with the provided script and the constraint of speaking formally:  
1. Develop situational awareness to identify when formal speech is appropriate.  
2. Build a vocabulary of formal words and phrases to replace swear words.  
3. Practice formal speech patterns in various settings to reinforce the habit.  
These subgoals map to the script’s steps and provide a clear path toward the main goal.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Develop situational awareness to identify when formal speech is appropriate.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Observe and analyze social contexts (e.g., professional, casual, or public settings) to determine when swearing is inappropriate and formal speech is expected. This involves reflecting on audience expectations and practicing mindfulness during conversations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To develop situational awareness, I will:  
1. Observe conversations in different settings (e.g., workplace, family gatherings, public events) to note when formal language is used versus informal or swearing.  
2. Practice self-monitoring by pausing before speaking to assess the audience and context. For example, in professional settings, prioritize polished language; in casual settings with friends, assess if formal speech is still beneficial to avoid swearing.  
3. Use mental cues (e.g., asking, “Is this a formal setting?”) to stay mindful during interactions.  
This step establishes the foundation for recognizing when to apply formal speech to avoid swearing.

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal-Management System:**  
- **Main Goal:** Stop swearing by speaking more formally.  
  - **Subgoal 1:** Develop situational awareness to identify when formal speech is appropriate (in progress).  
  - **Subgoal 2:** Build a vocabulary of formal words and phrases to replace swear words (pending).  
  - **Subgoal 3:** Practice formal speech patterns in various settings to reinforce the habit (pending).  
**Current Goal:** Develop situational awareness to identify when formal speech is appropriate.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in Step 1 and confirms that the first subgoal is being addressed, providing context for future steps.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Develop situational awareness to identify when formal speech is appropriate.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Verify that the approach to situational awareness (observing contexts, self-monitoring, and using mental cues) is effective by testing it in real-world scenarios and reflecting on outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the situational awareness approach:  
1. Test the strategy in at least three different settings (e.g., a workplace meeting, a casual dinner, and a public event). During each, consciously assess the audience and context before speaking, noting whether swearing was avoided.  
2. Reflect after each interaction: Did I correctly identify the need for formal speech? Did I avoid swearing? For example, in a workplace meeting, if I used professional language instead of casual or vulgar terms, the approach is working.  
3. Adjust based on feedback: If I slipped into swearing in a casual setting, note the trigger and refine my mental cues for better awareness.  
This validation confirms that situational awareness is a practical step toward formal speech.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Build a vocabulary of formal words and phrases to replace swear words.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Identify common swear words used in personal speech, research formal alternatives, and create a reference list for use in conversations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To build a formal vocabulary:  
1. List frequently used swear words (e.g., damn, crap) and their contexts (e.g., frustration, emphasis).  
2. Research formal alternatives using a thesaurus or online resources. For example:  
   - Instead of “damn,” use “darn” or “unfortunate.”  
   - Instead of “crap,” use “nonsense” or “rubbish.”  
3. Compile a reference list of 10–15 formal words/phrases and memorize them.  
4. Practice using these alternatives in low-stakes conversations (e.g., with friends or family) to build fluency.  
This step equips me with tools to replace swearing with formal language.  
[/IMP]

**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Build a vocabulary of formal words and phrases to replace swear words.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Test the use of the formal vocabulary in conversations to ensure it effectively replaces swear words and feels natural.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the formal vocabulary:  
1. Use the compiled list of formal words/phrases in at least five conversations across different settings (e.g., work, social, public).  
2. Track success by noting whether swear words were avoided and if the formal alternatives felt appropriate. For example, saying “This is unfortunate” instead of “This is damn annoying” in a meeting.  
3. Seek feedback from trusted individuals (e.g., colleagues or friends) on whether my speech sounds more formal and polished.  
4. Adjust the vocabulary list if certain words feel unnatural or don’t fit specific contexts.  
This validation ensures the vocabulary is practical and effective.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Practice formal speech patterns in various settings to reinforce the habit.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Engage in regular practice sessions in diverse social contexts, using situational awareness and the formal vocabulary to maintain a swearing-free, formal speaking style.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To practice formal speech patterns:  
1. Schedule daily practice in varied settings (e.g., workplace discussions, social gatherings, public speaking).  
2. Apply situational awareness to choose the appropriate level of formality and use the formal vocabulary list to avoid swearing.  
3. Record one conversation per week (with consent, if needed) to analyze speech patterns and identify any lapses into swearing.  
4. Gradually increase the complexity of settings (e.g., high-stakes presentations) to solidify the habit.  
This step reinforces formal speech as a consistent habit.

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Practice formal speech patterns in various settings to reinforce the habit.  
- **How to Achieve It:** Evaluate the consistency of formal speech across multiple settings to confirm that swearing has been eliminated and formal speech is habitual.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the practice of formal speech:  
1. Conduct a two-week trial where I monitor all conversations, ensuring formal speech is used consistently and no swearing occurs.  
2. Use a journal to log instances where formal speech was successful or where swearing slipped through, noting triggers (e.g., stress, casual settings).  
3. Seek feedback from at least three people (e.g., a colleague, friend, family member) on whether my speech consistently appears formal and free of swearing.  
4. If swearing occurs, revisit situational awareness techniques or adjust the vocabulary list.  
This validation confirms that formal speech is habitual and swearing is eliminated.
