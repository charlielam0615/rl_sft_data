### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making stuffed cabbage with chicken, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The constraint is that the stuffing must include chicken. The script provides an ordered list of steps to achieve the task, and the plan must be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make stuffed cabbage with chicken.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 2: Cook the cabbage to soften leaves.  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the chicken and stuffing mixture.  
  - Subgoal 4: Assemble the stuffed cabbage rolls.  
  - Subgoal 5: Bake the stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce.  

**Current Goal:** Prepare the oven and ingredients.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare the oven and ingredients. This will be achieved by preheating the oven to 375°F and ensuring all necessary ingredients (cabbage, chicken, rice, stuffing mix, tomato sauce) are ready.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Gather ingredients: one head of cabbage, ground or diced chicken, cooked rice, stuffing mix, and tomato sauce. Ensure all tools (large pot, skillet, baking dish) are accessible.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the oven is preheated to 375°F and all ingredients and tools are prepared. This will be achieved by checking the oven temperature and confirming the availability of all required items.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the oven has reached 375°F using an oven thermometer or the oven’s display. Verify that the cabbage, chicken, rice, stuffing mix, tomato sauce, large pot, skillet, and baking dish are ready for use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to cook the cabbage to soften the leaves. This will be achieved by boiling water in a large pot and cooking the cabbage for 3-5 minutes, then carefully peeling off the leaves.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Place the whole cabbage head in the boiling water and cook for 3-5 minutes until the outer leaves soften. Remove the cabbage from the pot and carefully peel off the leaves, ensuring they remain intact.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the cabbage leaves are softened and intact. This will be achieved by inspecting the leaves for flexibility and checking for tears.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the cabbage leaves to ensure they are soft and pliable enough to roll without breaking. Confirm that the leaves are not torn and are suitable for stuffing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare the chicken and stuffing mixture. This will be achieved by cooking the chicken until browned and mixing it with rice and stuffing mix.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a large skillet, cook the ground or diced chicken over medium heat until fully browned. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked chicken with cooked rice and stuffing mix, stirring until evenly blended.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make stuffed cabbage with chicken.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and ingredients (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Cook the cabbage to soften leaves (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the chicken and stuffing mixture (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Assemble the stuffed cabbage rolls.  
  - Subgoal 5: Bake the stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce.  

**Current Goal:** Assemble the stuffed cabbage rolls.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to assemble the stuffed cabbage rolls. This will be achieved by placing a spoonful of the chicken mixture into each cabbage leaf, rolling the leaves, and placing them in a baking dish.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place a heaping spoonful of the chicken, rice, and stuffing mixture into the center of each cabbage leaf. Roll the leaves up, tucking in the sides to secure the filling, and place the rolls seam-side down in a baking dish.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the cabbage rolls are properly assembled. This will be achieved by checking that the rolls are tightly wrapped, with no filling leaking, and are neatly arranged in the baking dish.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the cabbage rolls to ensure they are tightly rolled with the sides tucked in and the filling secure. Confirm that the rolls are arranged evenly in the baking dish without overcrowding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to bake the stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce. This will be achieved by pouring tomato sauce over the rolls and baking them at 375°F for 30 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour tomato sauce evenly over the stuffed cabbage rolls in the baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake at 375°F for 30 minutes until the rolls are heated through and the sauce is bubbly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the stuffed cabbage rolls are fully cooked. This will be achieved by checking that the rolls are heated through and the tomato sauce is bubbly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove the baking dish from the oven and check that the cabbage rolls are hot throughout and the tomato sauce is bubbling. Ensure the chicken filling reaches a safe internal temperature (at least 165°F).  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The core content is the process of making stuffed cabbage with chicken. Retrieve a summary of the key steps and outcomes to confirm the task’s completion.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The process involved preheating the oven to 375°F, boiling cabbage to soften leaves, cooking and mixing chicken with rice and stuffing, assembling rolls, and baking with tomato sauce for 30 minutes. All subgoals were validated: oven and ingredients were prepared, cabbage leaves were softened and intact, chicken mixture was properly cooked, rolls were securely assembled, and the final dish was fully cooked with bubbly sauce. The task of making stuffed cabbage with chicken is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
All subgoals for making stuffed cabbage with chicken have been completed, as confirmed by the final review. The plan adhered to the meta-cognitive action set, systematically addressing each step with planning, implementation, and review actions.
