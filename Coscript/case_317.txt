### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of performing first aid on a choking baby into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script, considering the constraint of being trained.  

1. **Subgoal 1**: Ensure professional assistance is sought or confirm training readiness.  
2. **Subgoal 2**: Prepare the baby for first aid intervention.  
3. **Subgoal 3**: Assess and attempt to remove the obstruction safely.  
4. **Subgoal 4**: Perform back blows if the obstruction persists.  
5. **Subgoal 5**: Perform chest thrusts if back blows fail.  
6. **Subgoal 6**: Repeat interventions until the obstruction is cleared or the baby shows signs of recovery.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Perform first aid on a choking baby while being trained.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure professional assistance is sought or confirm training readiness.  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the baby for first aid intervention.  
  - Subgoal 3: Assess and attempt to remove the obstruction safely.  
  - Subgoal 4: Perform back blows if the obstruction persists.  
  - Subgoal 5: Perform chest thrusts if back blows fail.  
  - Subgoal 6: Repeat interventions until the obstruction is cleared or the baby shows signs of recovery.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure professional assistance is sought or confirm training readiness.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure professional assistance is sought or confirm training readiness. This involves checking if a healthcare provider or trained individual is available, or verifying that the person performing the first aid (myself, in training) is prepared to proceed under supervision or guidance.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since I am being trained, I will first call for a healthcare provider or a trained individual nearby to assist. If no one is available, I will rely on my training instructions and proceed with confidence under the assumption that a trainer is supervising. I confirm that I have been instructed on the steps for choking first aid and have the necessary knowledge to follow the script safely.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the baby for first aid intervention. This involves laying the baby on their back on a firm, flat surface if they are unresponsive, ensuring a safe position for further assessment.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
If the baby is unresponsive, I gently lay them on their back on a firm, flat surface, such as a table or the floor, ensuring their head is supported and aligned with their body to facilitate the next steps safely.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assess and attempt to remove the obstruction safely. This involves opening the baby’s mouth to check for a visible obstruction and, if seen, carefully sweeping it out with a finger.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I carefully open the baby’s mouth using my thumb and fingers, ensuring not to push the obstruction further. I look for any visible object blocking the airway. If an obstruction is visible, I use my pinky finger to gently sweep it out, being cautious not to lodge it deeper.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the current path, ensuring that the attempt to remove the obstruction was successful or determining if further intervention is needed.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I observe the baby to see if they are breathing, coughing, or crying, indicating the obstruction has been cleared. If the obstruction remains or I cannot see it, I confirm that sweeping was ineffective and proceed to the next step of performing modified back blows as per the script.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform back blows if the obstruction persists. This involves positioning the baby correctly and delivering five firm back blows between the shoulder blades.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I position the baby face-down along my forearm, with their head tilted downward and chin pointing toward their chest, supported by my hand. Using the heel of my other hand, I deliver five firm back blows between the baby’s shoulder blades, ensuring each blow is controlled but forceful enough to dislodge the obstruction.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check if the back blows dislodged the obstruction, ensuring the baby is breathing or showing signs of recovery, or determining if chest thrusts are needed.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I check the baby for signs of breathing, coughing, or crying. If the obstruction is still present, I proceed to perform modified chest thrusts as outlined in the script.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to perform chest thrusts if back blows fail. This involves positioning the baby and delivering five quick chest thrusts below the nipple line.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I turn the baby face-up along my forearm, keeping their head tilted downward and chin toward their chest. I place two fingers in the middle of the baby’s chest, just below the nipple line, and deliver five quick chest thrusts, pressing firmly but gently to avoid injury.  

[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Perform first aid on a choking baby while being trained.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure professional assistance is sought or confirm training readiness (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the baby for first aid intervention (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Assess and attempt to remove the obstruction safely (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Perform back blows if the obstruction persists (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Perform chest thrusts if back blows fail (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Repeat interventions until the obstruction is cleared or the baby shows signs of recovery.  
**Current Goal**: Repeat interventions until the obstruction is cleared or the baby shows signs of recovery.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the obstruction is dislodged or the baby starts coughing, crying, or breathing. This involves alternating between the two techniques while monitoring the baby’s condition.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I alternate between delivering five back blows and five chest thrusts, maintaining proper positioning with the baby’s head tilted downward. After each cycle, I check for signs of recovery, such as coughing, crying, or breathing. I continue this process until the obstruction is cleared or the baby responds, or until a healthcare provider takes over.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat interventions until the obstruction is cleared. I will retrieve information from previous steps to ensure all actions align with the script and the constraint of being trained.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- **Step 3**: Confirmed training readiness and proceeded under supervision.  
- **Step 4**: Laid the baby on a firm, flat surface if unresponsive.  
- **Step 5**: Checked for and attempted to sweep out a visible obstruction.  
- **Step 6**: Validated the need for further intervention if sweeping failed.  
- **Step 7**: Performed five back blows with proper positioning.  
- **Step 8**: Validated the need for chest thrusts if back blows failed.  
- **Step 9**: Performed five chest thrusts with correct finger placement.  
- **Step 11**: Alternated back blows and chest thrusts, monitoring for recovery.  
All actions align with the script and training constraint, emphasizing careful positioning and monitoring.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the obstruction has been cleared or the baby is recovering, or to determine if further action is needed under training supervision.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I observe the baby for forceful coughing, crying, or breathing, indicating the obstruction is cleared. If the baby is recovering, I stop interventions and monitor their condition, ready to call for professional help if needed. If the obstruction persists, I continue alternating back blows and chest thrusts under training supervision until help arrives or the baby recovers.  

[/IMP]

---

This completes the plan, covering all steps in the script while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set and the constraint of being trained. Each step was executed with appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks, ensuring a structured and safe approach to performing first aid on a choking baby.
