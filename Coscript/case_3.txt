**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike, adhering to the provided script and constraint, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for the Plan
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of getting around Salt Lake City by bike into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals.  
2. Visit a public library to check out a bike.  
3. Visit a community center to check out a bike.  
4. Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Organize Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the previous planning step, and state the current goal.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals.  
  - Subgoal 2: Visit a public library to check out a bike.  
  - Subgoal 3: Visit a community center to check out a bike.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
**Current Goal**: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Check Hotel Bike Availability
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check if the hotel offers free bike rentals. This will be achieved by contacting the hotel or checking their website for bike rental information.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Contact the hotel front desk by phone or visit their website to inquire about bike rental services. Confirm if bikes are available for free or at a low cost, and note any conditions (e.g., availability, rental duration). If bikes are available, proceed to use them; if not, move to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Review Progress and Recall Hotel Information
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the availability of bikes at the hotel, serving as the foundation for retrieving information about the outcome of the hotel inquiry.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The current goal is to check if the hotel offers free bike rentals. Previous step involved contacting the hotel or checking their website. If bikes were available, the subgoal is complete, and the main goal of biking around Salt Lake City can proceed. If not, the next subgoal (visiting a public library) is relevant. No specific hotel response was detailed, so assume bikes were not available for planning purposes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Adjust Plan for Next Option
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the hotel did not provide bikes (assumed for planning), adjust the plan to prioritize the next subgoal: visiting a public library to check out a bike. The remaining subgoals (community center, GREENbike) are retained as fallback options.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Updated Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 2: Visit a public library to check out a bike.  
  - Subgoal 3: Visit a community center to check out a bike.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
**Current Goal**: Visit a public library to check out a bike.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Visit Public Library for Bike
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to visit a public library to check out a bike. This will be achieved by identifying a nearby public library in Salt Lake City and inquiring about their bike checkout program.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate a nearby public library (e.g., Salt Lake City Public Library) using a map or online search. Visit the library or check their website for information on bike checkout programs. Verify availability, any costs, and borrowing conditions (e.g., library card requirements). If bikes are available, check one out; if not, proceed to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validate Library Bike Option
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the library bike checkout process. This will be achieved by confirming whether a bike was successfully obtained or if further steps are needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If a bike was checked out from the library, confirm it meets the constraint of being inexpensive (e.g., free or low-cost with a library card). If no bikes were available or costs were prohibitive, proceed to the next subgoal (community center). For planning, assume the library had no bikes available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Adjust Plan for Community Center
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the library did not provide bikes (assumed), adjust the plan to focus on the next subgoal: visiting a community center to check out a bike. The GREENbike program remains as a final option.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10: Track Updated Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 2: Visit a public library to check out a bike (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 3: Visit a community center to check out a bike.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
**Current Goal**: Visit a community center to check out a bike.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Visit Community Center for Bike
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to visit a community center to check out a bike. This will be achieved by identifying a Salt Lake City community center and checking their bike availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Search for a nearby community center (e.g., Sorenson Community Center) using an online map or directory. Visit the center or check their website for bike checkout programs. Confirm availability, costs, and any requirements (e.g., membership). If bikes are available, check one out; if not, proceed to the GREENbike program.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validate Community Center Bike Option
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the community center bike checkout process. This will be achieved by confirming whether a bike was obtained or if the final option is needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If a bike was obtained from the community center, verify it is inexpensive (e.g., free or low-cost). If no bikes were available or costs were high, proceed to the GREENbike program. For planning, assume no bikes were available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13: Adjust Plan for GREENbike Program
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the community center did not provide bikes (assumed), adjust the plan to focus on the final subgoal: using the GREENbike share program.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 14: Track Final Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 2: Visit a public library to check out a bike (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 3: Visit a community center to check out a bike (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
**Current Goal**: Use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 15: Use GREENbike Program
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the GREENbike share program to rent a bike. This will be achieved by locating a GREENbike station and renting a bike.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Visit the GREENbike website or app to find a nearby bike station in Salt Lake City. Follow the rental process (e.g., pay via app, unlock bike). Confirm the cost is affordable (e.g., typically low-cost for short-term rentals). Rent a bike and use it to get around the city.  
[/IMP]

### Step 16: Validate Final Solution
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the GREENbike rental process. This will be achieved by ensuring the bike was rented successfully and meets the constraint of being inexpensive.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm the GREENbike was rented successfully and the cost aligns with the "on the cheap" constraint (e.g., affordable daily or hourly rates). If successful, the plan is complete, and the main goal of getting around Salt Lake City by bike is achieved. If not, backtrack to previous options or conclude the plan as infeasible. Assume success for completion.  
[/IMP]

### Step 17: Final Review of Plan
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Get around Salt Lake City inexpensively by riding a bike (achieved).  
  - Subgoal 1: Check if the hotel offers free bike rentals (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 2: Visit a public library to check out a bike (attempted, unsuccessful).  
  - Subgoal 3: Visit a community center to check out a bike (attempted, unsuccessful).
