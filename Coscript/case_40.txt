### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of warming up by turning on the heater into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals include:  
1. Preheat the oven to generate ambient heat.  
2. Place a pan of water on the stove to create a warm, humid environment.  
3. Set the thermostat to activate the heater.  
4. Wear warm clothing to retain body heat.  
5. Cover head and neck to minimize heat loss.  
6. Drink warm beverages to warm the body internally.  
7. Stay hydrated to support overall well-being.  
These subgoals align with the script and the constraint of using the heater (specifically via the thermostat).

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Warm yourself up by turning on the heater.  
  - Subgoal 1: Preheat the oven.  
  - Subgoal 2: Place a pan of water on the stove.  
  - Subgoal 3: Set the thermostat to the desired temperature.  
  - Subgoal 4: Wear warm clothing.  
  - Subgoal 5: Cover head and neck.  
  - Subgoal 6: Drink warm beverages.  
  - Subgoal 7: Stay hydrated.  
**Current Goal:** Preheat the oven (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, with the current focus on the first actionable step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Preheat the oven.  
**How to Achieve:** Locate the oven, set it to a suitable temperature (e.g., 350°F/175°C), and turn it on to generate ambient heat in the room.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To preheat the oven, go to the kitchen and locate the oven. Turn the oven knob or press the control panel to set the temperature to 350°F (175°C), a common preheating temperature that generates moderate heat. Confirm the oven is on by checking for indicator lights or heat emission. This step contributes to warming the environment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the oven is preheating correctly.  
**How to Achieve:** Verify that the oven is operational and heating up as intended by checking indicators or temperature.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the oven’s indicator light or digital display to confirm it is heating. If available, use an oven thermometer to verify the internal temperature is rising toward 350°F. Ensure the oven door is closed to maximize heat retention in the room. If the oven is not heating, check the power source or consult the manual for troubleshooting. The oven is confirmed to be preheating correctly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Place a pan of water on the stove.  
**How to Achieve:** Fill a pan with water, place it on the stove, and turn on the burner to heat the water, creating a warm, humid environment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Locate a saucepan in the kitchen and fill it with water (about 2-3 cups). Place the pan on a stove burner, turn the burner to medium heat, and allow the water to heat up. The evaporating water will add warmth and humidity to the room, aiding in the warming process. Monitor to ensure the water does not boil over.  
[/IMP]

- Main Goal: Warm yourself up by turning on the heater.  
  - Subgoal 1: Preheat the oven (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Place a pan of water on the stove (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set the thermostat to the desired temperature.  
  - Subgoal 4: Wear warm clothing.  
  - Subgoal 5: Cover head and neck.  
  - Subgoal 6: Drink warm beverages.  
  - Subgoal 7: Stay hydrated.  
**Current Goal:** Set the thermostat to the desired temperature (Subgoal 3).  
The hierarchy is updated to mark Subgoals 1 and 2 as completed, focusing now on activating the heater via the thermostat.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Set the thermostat to the desired temperature.  
**How to Achieve:** Locate the thermostat, set it to a comfortable temperature (e.g., 70°F/21°C), and activate the heater.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Find the thermostat in the living space (typically wall-mounted). Set the temperature to 70°F (21°C), a standard comfortable indoor temperature, using the thermostat’s controls. Ensure the system is switched to “heat” mode. Confirm the heater activates by listening for the system starting or feeling warm air from vents. This directly fulfills the constraint of warming up by turning on the heater.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Ensure the heater is working correctly.  
**How to Achieve:** Check for signs of heater operation, such as warm air output or system sounds, and verify the room temperature is rising.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the heater is operational by feeling for warm air coming from vents or radiators. Use a room thermometer, if available, to confirm the temperature is approaching 70°F. Listen for the heater’s operational sounds (e.g., fan or furnace running). If no heat is detected, check the thermostat settings or inspect the heater for issues (e.g., power supply or pilot light). The heater is confirmed to be working.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Wear warm clothing.  
**How to Achieve:** Select and put on warm clothing items, such as a sweater, pants, and socks, to retain body heat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Go to the wardrobe and select warm clothing, such as a thick sweater, long pants, and wool socks. Put on these items to insulate the body and retain heat, enhancing personal warmth in conjunction with the heater’s effect. Ensure the clothing is comfortable and allows mobility.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Cover head and neck.  
**How to Achieve:** Use a scarf or hat to cover the head and neck, minimizing heat loss from these areas.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Retrieve a scarf and a hat from the wardrobe. Wrap the scarf around the neck and place the hat on the head to cover these areas, which are prone to heat loss. Ensure the scarf is snug but not restrictive. This step complements the clothing and heater to maintain body warmth.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Drink warm beverages.  
**How to Achieve:** Prepare and consume a warm beverage, such as tea or coffee, to warm the body internally.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Boil water in a kettle (or use the heated water from the stove pan if still warm). Prepare a warm beverage, such as tea or coffee, by combining hot water with a tea bag or coffee grounds. Drink the beverage slowly to warm the body from within, enhancing the overall warming effect.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Stay hydrated.  
**How to Achieve:** Drink water regularly to maintain hydration, supporting overall health while warming up.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Fill a glass with room-temperature or lukewarm water (avoiding cold water to maintain warmth). Drink the water periodically, aiming for 8-10 ounces every hour, to stay hydrated. This supports bodily functions and complements the warming process, especially after consuming warm beverages.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the overall goal of warming up has been achieved.  
**How to Achieve:** Assess the room temperature, personal comfort level, and completion of all subgoals to ensure the warming process is successful.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Measure the room temperature using a thermometer to confirm it is around 70°F, indicating the heater’s effectiveness. Assess personal comfort by checking for feelings of warmth and absence of chills. Review that all script steps (oven, water, thermostat, clothing, head/neck coverage, warm beverages, hydration) have been completed. The body feels warm, the room is comfortably heated, and all subgoals are fulfilled, confirming the main goal is achieved.  
[/IMP]
