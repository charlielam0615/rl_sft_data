**Problem Statement**: Simulate a plan to cancel a paid Pandora subscription for a non-subscriber, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and adhering to the specified constraints and script. The process must account for the non-subscriber status, meaning the individual does not have an active Pandora account but is attempting to cancel a subscription (e.g., possibly linked to an account they can access or on behalf of someone else). The plan will be developed step-by-step using the meta-cognitive actions until the task is completed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
**Details**: Break down the goal of canceling a paid Pandora subscription for a non-subscriber into intermediate subgoals. Since the individual is a non-subscriber, the subgoals must consider accessing an existing account (e.g., using credentials provided by the subscriber or recovering access). The subgoals are:  
1. Access the Pandora website.  
2. Log in to the account with the paid subscription.  
3. Navigate to the account settings.  
4. Locate and execute the subscription cancellation option.  
5. Confirm the cancellation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Details**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step. The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Cancel a paid Pandora subscription for a non-subscriber.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Access the Pandora website.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Log in to the account with the paid subscription.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Navigate to the account settings.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Locate and execute the subscription cancellation option.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Confirm the cancellation.  
**Current Goal**: Access the Pandora website.  
This provides context for the next implementation step, ensuring focus on initiating the process via the website.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Access the Pandora website.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use a web browser to navigate to Pandora.com, as specified in the script’s first step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Details**: Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and enter the URL “https://www.pandora.com” in the address bar. Press Enter to load the Pandora homepage. This step is straightforward and does not require an account, aligning with the non-subscriber constraint, as anyone can visit the website.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Access the Pandora website.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the browser has successfully loaded the Pandora homepage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Details**: Check that the browser displays the Pandora homepage, identifiable by the Pandora logo and layout (e.g., login options, music streaming features). If the page fails to load (e.g., due to internet issues or incorrect URL), retry by re-entering “https://www.pandora.com” or troubleshooting the connection. The page loaded successfully, so the goal is validated.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
**Details**: Reflect on the non-subscriber constraint. The next subgoal, logging into the account, assumes access to valid credentials. For a non-subscriber, this may involve obtaining credentials from the subscriber or recovering access (e.g., via password reset). Adjust the second subgoal to: “Obtain valid credentials and log in to the account with the paid subscription.” This accounts for potential barriers a non-subscriber might face, such as lack of immediate access to login details. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Access the Pandora website (completed).  
2. Obtain valid credentials and log in to the account with the paid subscription.  
3. Navigate to the account settings.  
4. Locate and execute the subscription cancellation option.  
5. Confirm the cancellation.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of logging into a Pandora account, focusing on the steps provided in the script and the non-subscriber constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Details**: The script specifies:  
- Step 2: Click the ≡ icon.  
- Step 3: Click Login in the drop-down menu.  
- Step 4: Enter the email address and password associated with the Pandora account.  
- Step 5: Click Login.  
For a non-subscriber, relevant information includes the need for valid credentials (email and password). If credentials are unavailable, the non-subscriber may need to contact the account holder or use Pandora’s password recovery process. This information is critical for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Obtain valid credentials and log in to the account with the paid subscription.  
- **How to Achieve**: Follow the script’s steps 2–5 to locate the login option and enter credentials. If the non-subscriber lacks credentials, they must obtain them from the subscriber or initiate a password reset.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Details**:  
1. On the Pandora homepage, locate and click the ≡ icon (typically in the top-right corner).  
2. From the drop-down menu, select “Login.”  
3. In the login form, enter the email address and password associated with the Pandora account. If the non-subscriber does not have these, they must:  
   - Contact the subscriber to obtain the credentials, or  
   - Click “Forgot Password” (if available) and follow Pandora’s recovery process, which may involve answering security questions or receiving a reset link via email.  
4. Once credentials are entered, click “Login” to access the account.  
Assume credentials were obtained (e.g., provided by the subscriber), and the login is successful.  
[/IMP]
