**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for styling straight hair into a low bun, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions categorized into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R). The process must use one action per step, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks based on the action's category, as per the specified guidelines. The constraint is that the hair must be straight, and the provided script outlines six steps to achieve the low bun.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of creating a low bun on straight hair into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare dry, straight hair.  
2. Create a ponytail base with a front section.  
3. Twist the remaining hair into a rope.  
4. Wrap the rope around the ponytail base and tuck it.  
5. Secure the bun with bobby pins.  
6. Apply hairspray to set the bun.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Create a low bun on straight hair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare dry, straight hair.  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a ponytail base with a front section.  
  - Subgoal 3: Twist the remaining hair into a rope.  
  - Subgoal 4: Wrap the rope around the ponytail base and tuck it.  
  - Subgoal 5: Secure the bun with bobby pins.  
  - Subgoal 6: Apply hairspray to set the bun.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare dry, straight hair.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the implementation steps to follow.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to prepare dry, straight hair. This will be achieved by ensuring the hair is dry and straight, either naturally or through styling tools, as per the first step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with dry, straight hair. If the hair is not already dry, use a blow dryer to dry it completely. If the hair is not straight, use a flat iron to straighten it, working in small sections to ensure smoothness. Brush the hair to remove any tangles, ensuring it is ready for styling into a low bun.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to ensure the hair is properly prepared (dry and straight). This will be achieved by checking the hair’s condition to confirm it meets the requirements for the next styling steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the hair to verify it is completely dry and straight. Run fingers through the hair to check for any dampness or waves. If any sections are not dry or straight, reapply the blow dryer or flat iron as needed. Confirm the hair is smooth and tangle-free by brushing it again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to create a ponytail base with a front section. This will be achieved by taking a small section of hair from the front and wrapping it around the base of a low ponytail, as per the second step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather all the hair into a low ponytail at the nape of the neck and secure it with a hair tie. Take a small section of hair (about 1-2 inches wide) from the front, near the crown or side, and wrap it tightly around the base of the ponytail to cover the hair tie, creating a polished look.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to twist the remaining hair into a rope. This will be achieved by taking the rest of the hair in the ponytail and twisting it tightly, as per the third step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the remaining hair in the ponytail (excluding the front section already wrapped). Twist the hair tightly around itself in one direction until it forms a rope-like structure. Ensure the twist is even and tight to maintain the bun’s shape in the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to wrap the rope around the ponytail base and tuck it. This will be achieved by coiling the twisted hair around the base and tucking the end, as per the fourth step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wrap the twisted hair rope around the base of the ponytail in a circular motion, forming the bun shape. Continue wrapping until all the hair is coiled. Tuck the end of the rope under the bun to hide it, ensuring a neat appearance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to secure the bun with bobby pins. This will be achieved by using bobby pins to pin the bun in place, as per the fifth step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Insert bobby pins around the bun, sliding them through the coiled hair and into the base of the ponytail to secure the bun. Use 4-6 bobby pins, depending on hair thickness, placing them evenly around the bun to ensure it stays in place.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to apply hairspray to set the bun. This will be achieved by misting the bun with hairspray, as per the sixth step of the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lightly mist the bun with a medium- or strong-hold hairspray, holding the can about 10-12 inches away to evenly distribute the product. Ensure all areas of the bun are covered to maintain the style and prevent flyaways.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Create a low bun on straight hair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare dry, straight hair (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a ponytail base with a front section (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Twist the remaining hair into a rope (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Wrap the rope around the ponytail base and tuck it (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Secure the bun with bobby pins (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Apply hairspray to set the bun (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been achieved, indicating the low bun on straight hair is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Summary
The plan to create a low bun on straight hair has been fully executed by breaking down the task into subgoals, implementing each step according to the script, validating progress, and reviewing the goal hierarchy. All actions followed the meta-cognitive action set, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required. The process is now complete.
