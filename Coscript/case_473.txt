**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make quinoa blondies by adding chocolate chips, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint of including chocolate chips. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action from the set and formatting the response according to the specified structure: [PLANNING] for planning actions, [PLANNING] and [IMP] for implementation actions, and [PLANNING] and [REVIEW] for review actions. The process should continue until all steps in the provided script are completed.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making quinoa blondies with chocolate chips into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).  
2. Mix wet ingredients (coconut oil, almond butter, sugar).  
3. Add additional wet ingredients (flax eggs, vanilla, almond milk).  
4. Prepare dry ingredients.  
5. Combine wet and dry ingredients.  
6. Incorporate chocolate chips into the batter.  
7. Bake the batter for 25–30 minutes.  
8. Remove the blondies from the oven.  
9. Serve and enjoy the blondies.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). This will be achieved by setting the oven to the specified temperature and allowing it to heat up.  

[IMP]  
Turn on the oven and set the temperature to 350°F (180°C). Wait for the oven to reach the desired temperature, which typically takes about 10–15 minutes depending on the oven model. Ensure the oven rack is positioned in the middle for even baking.  

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the wet ingredients (coconut oil, almond butter, and sugar). This will be achieved by combining these ingredients in a bowl until smooth.  

[IMP]  
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1/3 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/2 cup of almond butter, and 3/4 cup of sugar (brown or coconut sugar works well). Stir thoroughly until the mixture is smooth and well-blended, ensuring no lumps remain.  

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add flax eggs, vanilla, and almond milk to the wet mixture. This will be achieved by preparing flax eggs and mixing them with vanilla extract and almond milk into the existing wet ingredients.  

[IMP]  
Prepare 2 flax eggs by mixing 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed with 5 tablespoons of water; let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Add the flax eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup of almond milk to the wet mixture from the previous step. Stir until fully incorporated.  

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to whisk together the dry ingredients. This will be achieved by combining quinoa flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl.  

[IMP]  
In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup of quinoa flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed to avoid clumps in the batter.  

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. This will be achieved by gradually mixing the dry ingredients into the wet mixture to form a batter.  

[IMP]  
Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture, stirring gently with a spatula or wooden spoon. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix to maintain a light texture for the blondies.  

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add chocolate chips into the batter, fulfilling the constraint. This will be achieved by folding chocolate chips into the combined batter.  

[IMP]  
Add 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to the batter. Gently fold them in using a spatula, ensuring even distribution throughout the batter without overmixing.  

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to bake the batter for 25–30 minutes. This will be achieved by transferring the batter to a baking pan and placing it in the preheated oven.  

[IMP]  
Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the edges are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.  

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the blondies from the oven. This will be achieved by safely taking the pan out and allowing the blondies to cool.  

[IMP]  
Carefully remove the baking pan from the oven using oven mitts. Place the pan on a wire rack or heat-safe surface to cool for at least 10–15 minutes before cutting to allow the blondies to set.  

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make quinoa blondies by adding chocolate chips.  
  - Subgoal 1: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Mix wet ingredients (coconut oil, almond butter, sugar). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Add additional wet ingredients (flax eggs, vanilla, almond milk). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 4: Prepare dry ingredients. [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 5: Combine wet and dry ingredients. [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 6: Incorporate chocolate chips into the batter. [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 7: Bake the batter for 25–30 minutes. [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 8: Remove the blondies from the oven. [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 9: Serve and enjoy the blondies. [Current]  

**Current Goal**: Serve and enjoy the chocolate chip quinoa blondies.

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to serve and enjoy the chocolate chip quinoa blondies. This will be achieved by cutting the cooled blondies into squares and serving them.  

[IMP]  
Once the blondies have cooled, cut them into even squares using a sharp knife. Serve on a plate and enjoy the chocolate chip quinoa blondies as a delicious treat. Optionally, pair with a beverage like coffee or tea.
