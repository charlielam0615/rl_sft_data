### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to cut hair in order to eliminate the effects of a bad perm, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The task falls under the category of Personal Care and Style, with the constraint that the hair must be cut to remove the perm. The script provided includes three steps: (1) Cut your hair short, (2) Layered cuts will help to remove the appearance of a perm, and (3) Check with your stylist to ensure the hair is cut correctly.

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the sets Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To address the goal of cutting hair to eliminate a bad perm, I will break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Cut the hair short to reduce the perm's effect.  
2. Apply layered cuts to further minimize the perm's appearance.  
3. Consult with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Action: Track Goals**  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Cut hair to eliminate the effects of a bad perm.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut the hair short to reduce the perm's effect.  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply layered cuts to minimize the perm's appearance.  
  - Subgoal 3: Consult with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly.  
**Current Goal:** Cut the hair short to reduce the perm's effect.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation action.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Cut the hair short to reduce the perm's effect.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use hair-cutting tools (scissors or clippers) to trim the hair to a shorter length, targeting areas where the perm is most pronounced. This step focuses on removing the bulk of the permed hair to diminish its appearance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Action: Reach Goal**  
To cut the hair short, gather necessary tools such as sharp hair-cutting scissors or clippers, a comb, and a mirror. Section the hair to ensure even cutting, focusing on areas with the most noticeable perm. Trim the hair to a shorter length, such as a pixie cut or bob, depending on preference and the extent of the perm. Work in small sections to maintain control and ensure the perm's texture is significantly reduced.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the hair has been cut short effectively to reduce the perm's effect.  
- **How to Achieve:** Inspect the haircut to confirm that the permed hair has been sufficiently removed and the length is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Action: Validation**  
Examine the hair in a well-lit mirror to check if the short cut has reduced the perm's appearance. Ensure the length is even across all sections and that the permed texture is no longer prominent. If uneven sections or remaining permed hair are noticed, make minor adjustments with scissors to correct them.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the progress made, the next subgoal is to apply layered cuts to further minimize the perm's appearance. However, I will adjust the subgoals to ensure clarity:  
1. Completed: Cut the hair short to reduce the perm's effect.  
2. Adjusted Subgoal: Create layered cuts to blend and soften any remaining perm texture for a natural look.  
3. Unchanged: Consult with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly.  
The adjusted subgoal emphasizes blending to enhance the outcome.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create layered cuts to blend and soften any remaining perm texture.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a layering technique with scissors to add texture and remove any lingering perm effects, focusing on creating a natural, blended appearance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Action: Reach Goal**  
Section the hair into manageable parts. Using sharp scissors, cut layers by holding the hair at an angle (e.g., 45 degrees) and trimming to create varying lengths. Focus on areas where the perm is still visible, blending the layers to soften the texture. Ensure the layers complement the short haircut from the previous step, creating a cohesive style. Work slowly to avoid over-cutting, checking the balance of layers in a mirror.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Retrieve information related to the current goal of consulting with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly, focusing on the script’s emphasis on professional guidance.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Action: Recall Info**  
The script specifies: “Check with your stylist to make sure you are cutting your hair the right way.” Previous steps involved cutting the hair short and adding layered cuts to reduce the perm’s appearance. Relevant information includes the need to ensure the haircut aligns with professional standards, particularly for layered cuts and perm removal, to avoid mistakes and achieve the desired style.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Consult with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly.  
- **How to Achieve:** Schedule a consultation with a professional stylist to review the haircut and make any necessary refinements to fully eliminate the perm’s appearance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Action: Reach Goal**  
Contact a professional stylist and book an appointment. Bring reference images of the desired style, if applicable, and explain the goal of removing the bad perm. Allow the stylist to assess the haircut (short length and layered cuts) and make any adjustments to ensure the perm is fully eliminated and the style is polished. Follow the stylist’s recommendations for maintenance or additional cuts to achieve the best result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Action: Track Goals**  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Cut hair to eliminate the effects of a bad perm (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut the hair short to reduce the perm’s effect (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create layered cuts to blend and soften any remaining perm texture (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Consult with a stylist to ensure the haircut is done correctly (Completed).  
**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals have been achieved.  
The goal hierarchy confirms that all subgoals have been completed, and the main goal of eliminating the bad perm through hair cutting has been accomplished.  
[/REVIEW]

### Summary
The plan to cut hair to eliminate a bad perm has been completed through a series of meta-cognitive actions:  
- **Planning Actions:** Forward Subgoaling (Step 1) and Adjust Subgoals (Step 5) to define and refine the subgoals.  
- **Implementation Actions:** Reach Goal (Steps 3, 6, 8) to execute the haircut steps and Validation (Step 4) to ensure quality.  
- **Review Actions:** Track Goals (Steps 2, 9) to maintain context and Recall Info (Step 7) to leverage prior information.  
All steps followed the provided script, adhered to the constraint, and were structured according to the meta-cognitive action set framework. The bad perm has been addressed through a short haircut, layered cuts, and professional consultation.
