### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to safely disconnect the old thermostat by turning off power. This will be achieved by locating the circuit breaker for the HVAC system and switching it off to ensure safety during removal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the circuit breaker panel in the home. Identify the breaker controlling the HVAC system or thermostat circuit, typically labeled. Switch the breaker to the “off” position. Use a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the thermostat’s wires are not live before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the old thermostat from the wall. This will be achieved by carefully detaching the thermostat from its wall mount and disconnecting its wires.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Remove the cover of the old thermostat to access the wiring and mounting screws. Unscrew the thermostat from the wall plate. Carefully disconnect the wires, labeling each wire (e.g., with tape and a marker) to note its terminal (e.g., R, W, Y, G) for reference during new thermostat installation. Remove the old wall plate if it is not compatible with the new thermostat.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to install the new thermostat by wiring it correctly. Retrieve information about the labeled wires from the previous step to ensure accurate wiring.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**: In the previous step, the old thermostat’s wires were disconnected and labeled to indicate their respective terminals (e.g., R for power, W for heating, Y for cooling, G for fan). This labeling ensures the new thermostat’s wiring matches the HVAC system’s configuration.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to install the new thermostat by wiring it correctly. This will be achieved by connecting the labeled wires to the corresponding terminals on the new thermostat according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Refer to the new thermostat’s manual for the wiring diagram. Connect each labeled wire to the corresponding terminal on the new thermostat’s base (e.g., R to R, W to W). Secure the connections tightly to avoid loose wiring. If the new thermostat requires a C-wire (common wire) and none is present, consult the manual for alternative solutions, such as a C-wire adapter.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mount the new thermostat on the wall. This will be achieved by attaching the new thermostat’s wall plate to the wall and securing the thermostat to the plate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Attach the new thermostat’s wall plate to the wall using the provided screws and a level to ensure it is straight. Route the connected wires through the wall plate’s opening. Snap or screw the thermostat unit onto the wall plate, ensuring it is firmly secured and aligned with the wall.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to restore power to the thermostat. This will be achieved by turning the circuit breaker back on and ensuring the thermostat powers up.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Return to the circuit breaker panel and switch the HVAC system’s breaker to the “on” position. Observe the new thermostat to confirm it powers on, indicated by the display lighting up or showing initial setup prompts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the new thermostat’s functionality. This will be achieved by testing the HVAC system’s heating, cooling, and fan functions through the thermostat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the thermostat to activate the heating mode and confirm the furnace or heater turns on. Switch to cooling mode and verify the air conditioner responds. Test the fan setting to ensure it operates independently. If any function fails, check the wiring connections and consult the thermostat’s troubleshooting guide.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the thermostat is fully functional and correctly installed on the wall. This will be achieved by rechecking the wiring, mounting, and HVAC system response.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the thermostat’s wiring to ensure all connections are secure and match the manufacturer’s diagram. Verify the thermostat is firmly mounted on the wall without wobbling. Run additional tests on heating, cooling, and fan modes to confirm consistent operation. Address any issues by revisiting wiring or mounting steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to program the new thermostat. This will be achieved by setting the time, date, and preferred temperature schedules according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow the thermostat’s manual to access the programming menu. Set the current time and date. Configure temperature schedules for different times of the day (e.g., morning, day, evening, night) based on household preferences. If the thermostat is smart-enabled, connect it to Wi-Fi and install any associated apps for remote control. Save the settings and confirm the thermostat operates according to the programmed schedule.
