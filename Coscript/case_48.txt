**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making curtain panels into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to create curtain panels using a solid fabric pattern. Subgoals include:  
1. Determine the required curtain size by measuring windows.  
2. Account for hems by adding extra fabric.  
3. Prepare the fabric by washing, drying, and ironing.  
4. Cut the fabric to the correct dimensions.  
5. Create side hems by folding and stitching.  
6. Create the top hem.  
7. Stitch the side and top hems.  
8. Create and stitch the bottom hem.  
9. Finalize by snipping loose threads and hanging the curtains.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the required curtain size. This will be achieved by measuring the window dimensions and calculating the fabric needed, considering the solid fabric pattern constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the windows where the curtains will be hung. Use a tape measure to record the width and length. For a standard curtain panel, multiply the window width by 1.5 to 2 for fullness (e.g., a 40-inch-wide window needs 60–80 inches of fabric width). Determine the desired length (e.g., floor-length or sill-length). Record these measurements to guide fabric calculations, ensuring the solid fabric pattern is consistent across panels.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make curtain panels using a solid fabric pattern.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the required curtain size (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Account for hems by adding extra fabric.  
  - Subgoal 3: Prepare the fabric by washing, drying, and ironing.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the fabric to the correct dimensions.  
  - Subgoal 5: Create side hems by folding and stitching.  
  - Subgoal 6: Create the top hem.  
  - Subgoal 7: Stitch the side and top hems.  
  - Subgoal 8: Create and stitch the bottom hem.  
  - Subgoal 9: Finalize by snipping loose threads and hanging the curtains.  
**Current Goal**: Account for hems by adding extra fabric.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to account for hems by adding extra fabric to the measurements. This will be achieved by calculating additional inches for side, top, and bottom hems to ensure proper finishing of the solid fabric panels.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the window measurements from Step 2, add extra fabric for hems:  
- **Side hems**: Add 2 inches per side (4 inches total) for double-folded hems (1 inch folded twice).  
- **Top hem**: Add 4–8 inches, depending on the curtain rod pocket or header style (e.g., 4 inches for a standard rod pocket).  
- **Bottom hem**: Add 4–8 inches for a double-folded hem (e.g., 2–4 inches folded twice).  
For example, for a 40-inch-wide by 60-inch-long window (with 1.5x fullness), the fabric size before hems is 60 inches wide by 60 inches long. After adding hems (4 inches for sides, 4 inches for top, 4 inches for bottom), the total fabric needed per panel is 64 inches wide by 68 inches long. Ensure the solid fabric pattern aligns during calculations.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Adjust the subgoals to account for the solid fabric pattern constraint, ensuring the fabric preparation step considers the pattern’s uniformity. Revised subgoals:  
1. Determine the required curtain size (completed).  
2. Account for hems by adding extra fabric (completed).  
3. Prepare the fabric by washing, drying, and ironing, ensuring the solid fabric pattern remains consistent.  
4. Cut the fabric to the correct dimensions, maintaining pattern uniformity.  
5. Create side hems by folding and stitching.  
6. Create the top hem for the rod pocket or header.  
7. Stitch the side and top hems.  
8. Create and stitch the bottom hem.  
9. Finalize by snipping loose threads and hanging the curtains.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the fabric by washing, drying, and ironing. This will be achieved by processing the solid fabric to prevent shrinkage and ensure a smooth, uniform appearance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wash the solid fabric in cold water with a mild detergent to pre-shrink it, as solid fabrics may still shrink slightly. Dry the fabric on a low-heat setting to avoid damage. Once dry, iron the fabric on the appropriate setting for the material (e.g., cotton or polyester) to remove wrinkles, ensuring the solid pattern looks even and professional. Lay the fabric flat to check for consistency in color and texture.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the fabric to the correct dimensions. Retrieve information related to the measurements and hem allowances calculated earlier to guide the cutting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 2: Window measurements were taken, and fabric width was calculated as 1.5–2 times the window width for fullness (e.g., 60–80 inches for a 40-inch-wide window). Length was determined based on desired curtain length.  
- From Step 4: Hem allowances were added: 4 inches total for side hems (2 inches per side), 4–8 inches for the top hem, and 4–8 inches for the bottom hem. Example total fabric size per panel: 64 inches wide by 68 inches long.  
This information ensures the fabric is cut accurately to include hem allowances while maintaining the solid fabric pattern’s uniformity.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the fabric to the correct dimensions. This will be achieved by using the measurements and hem allowances to cut the solid fabric accurately.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lay the prepared solid fabric on a flat surface. Using the measurements from Step 4 (e.g., 64 inches wide by 68 inches long per panel), mark the cutting lines with a fabric marker or chalk, ensuring straight edges. Use a ruler or straightedge to guide the marks. Cut the fabric with sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter, maintaining the solid pattern’s uniformity. Cut carefully to ensure clean edges for easier hemming.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the cut fabric. This will be achieved by verifying the dimensions and ensuring the solid fabric pattern remains consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the cut fabric panels to confirm they match the calculated dimensions (e.g., 64 inches wide by 68 inches long). Check that the solid fabric pattern appears uniform across all panels, with no visible inconsistencies in color or texture. Inspect the edges for straightness and ensure no fraying has occurred during cutting. If discrepancies are found, trim the fabric to correct them or recut if necessary.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create side hems by folding and stitching. This will be achieved by folding the side edges of the fabric twice and stitching them to create neat hems for the solid fabric panels.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each panel, fold the side edges (left and right) over by 1 inch and press with an iron. Fold again by 1 inch to encase the raw edge, creating a double-fold hem, and press again. Pin the folds in place to secure them. Using a sewing machine, topstitch the side hems about ⅛ inch (0.32 cm) from the inner folded edge, ensuring the solid fabric pattern remains aligned and the stitches are straight. Remove pins as you sew.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 11**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create the top hem for the rod pocket or header. This will be achieved by folding and stitching the top edge of the fabric to accommodate the curtain rod.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fold the top edge of each panel over by ½ inch and press. Fold again by 3–4 inches (depending on the rod size) to create a rod pocket or header, ensuring the solid fabric pattern remains consistent. Press and pin the fold in place. Topstitch the hem about ⅛ inch (0.32 cm) from the inner folded edge, leaving the ends of the pocket open for the curtain rod. Optionally, add a second row of stitching 1½–2 inches above the first for a decorative header, if desired.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 12**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to stitch the side and top hems. This will be achieved by ensuring all side and top hems are securely stitched, as some stitching was completed in previous steps, and verifying the quality of the stitches.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the side hems (Step 10) and top hem (Step 11) have already been stitched, inspect the stitching on all panels. Ensure the topstitching is even, approximately ⅛ inch from the inner folded edges, and that the solid fabric pattern aligns across the hems. Check for loose threads or skipped stitches. If necessary, restitch any areas where the stitching is uneven or incomplete to maintain a professional finish.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 13**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create and stitch the bottom hem. This will be achieved by folding the bottom edge of the fabric twice and stitching it to complete the hem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fold the bottom edge of each panel over by 1–2 inches and press. Fold again by 1–2 inches to create a double-fold hem, ensuring the solid fabric pattern remains consistent. Press and pin the fold in place. Topstitch or hemstitch the bottom hem about ⅛ inch (0.32 cm) from the inner folded edge, ensuring straight and even stitches. Remove pins as you sew.  
[/IMP]
