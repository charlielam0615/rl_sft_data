### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Draw a small circle for the face.  
**How to Achieve**: Using a pencil, lightly sketch a small, circular shape on paper to represent the head of Harry Styles, ensuring it’s proportionate to allow space for other facial features.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the pencil lightly and draw a small, even circle in the center of the paper. Use short, gentle strokes to create a smooth outline, keeping the size moderate to accommodate the jaw, eyes, nose, mouth, and hair in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the small circle for the face is correctly drawn.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the circle’s size, shape, and placement to confirm it’s proportionate and centered, suitable as the foundation for the face.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the drawn circle. Verify that it is small, roughly circular, and centered on the paper. Ensure the outline is light enough to erase if needed. If the circle is too large or off-center, lightly erase and redraw to achieve the desired proportion and placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Draw a curved line for the jaw.  
**How to Achieve**: On the lower half of the circle, sketch a smooth, curved line to form the jawline, ensuring it connects naturally to the circle to define the face’s shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Position the pencil on the lower half of the circle, starting from one side. Draw a gentle, curved line downward and inward, then up to the other side of the circle, forming a slightly pointed or rounded jawline, typical of a stylized portrait. Keep the strokes light for easy adjustments.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add a horizontal line across the face for the eyes and a dot on each end for the eyes.  
**How to Achieve**: Sketch a horizontal line across the middle of the circle to guide eye placement, then place a small dot at each end to represent the eyes, ensuring symmetry.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the pencil, draw a light horizontal line across the middle of the circle, ensuring it spans the width of the face evenly. At each end of the line, place a small dot to mark the position of the eyes, keeping them symmetrical and appropriately spaced to reflect a realistic facial proportion.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add a small curved line for the nose and a 'u' shape for the mouth.  
**How to Achieve**: Below the horizontal eye line, draw a small curved line for the nose, and just below it, add a 'u'-shaped line for the mouth, ensuring both are centered and proportionate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Position the pencil just below the horizontal eye line, in the center of the face, and draw a small, gentle curved line downward to form the nose. Directly below the nose, sketch a small 'u' shape for the mouth, ensuring it aligns with the nose and fits the face’s proportions. Keep the lines light for flexibility.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information about the facial features drawn so far (circle, jaw, eyes, nose, mouth) to ensure the next step (drawing the hair) aligns with the established structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- A small circle was drawn for the face, serving as the base structure.  
- A curved line was added on the lower half for the jaw, defining the face’s shape.  
- A horizontal line with dots at each end was drawn for the eyes, placed across the middle of the circle.  
- A small curved line for the nose and a 'u' shape for the mouth were added below the eye line, centered on the face.  
This information confirms the facial structure is in place, with the circle, jaw, and features (eyes, nose, mouth) correctly positioned. The next step, drawing the hair, should start at the top of the circle and extend to the ears, aligning with the established features.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Draw the basic shape of the hair, starting at the top of the head and extending to the ears with curved and wavy lines.  
**How to Achieve**: Sketch a curved line from the top of the circle down to the sides near the jaw to outline the hair, then add wavy lines within to represent Harry Styles’ distinctive hairstyle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at the top of the circle, use the pencil to draw a curved line outward and downward to the sides of the face, near the jaw, to form the hair’s outer shape. Within this outline, add several wavy lines to capture the texture and volume of Harry Styles’ hair, ensuring the style is loose and flowing. Keep strokes light for adjustments.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the hair’s basic shape is correctly drawn.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the hair’s outline and wavy lines for alignment with the face, proportionality, and resemblance to Harry Styles’ hairstyle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the hair’s curved outline to confirm it starts at the top of the circle and extends symmetrically to the sides near the jaw. Verify that the wavy lines within the outline create a textured, voluminous look consistent with Harry Styles’ hairstyle. If the hair appears uneven or disproportionate, lightly erase and adjust the curves or waves as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Erase any unwanted pencil lines.  
**How to Achieve**: Use an eraser to remove any overlapping or unnecessary pencil marks from the drawing, ensuring a clean outline of the face and hair.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Carefully use an eraser to remove any stray or overlapping pencil lines, such as guidelines from the initial circle or misplaced strokes around the jaw, eyes, nose, mouth, or hair. Ensure the remaining lines clearly define the face and hair without smudging the kept outlines.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add shading to the hair, face, and clothes with pencil strokes.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply light pencil strokes to add shading, starting with the hair, then around the face, and finally to the clothes, to create depth and dimension.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Begin with the hair, using short, light pencil strokes to add shading, following the direction of the wavy lines to enhance texture. Next, apply subtle shading around the face, particularly under the jaw and near the eyes, to create depth. Finally, sketch a basic outline for clothes (e.g., a shirt collar) and add shading with cross-hatching or light strokes to suggest fabric texture. Vary pressure to achieve a realistic effect.  
[/IMP]
