### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Prepare for the call by gathering necessary information.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify and collect relevant details such as the purpose of the contact (e.g., benefits inquiry, account issue), personal identification details (e.g., Social Security number), and any specific questions to ask during the call.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To prepare for the call, compile a list of necessary information:
- **Purpose**: Clarify the reason for contacting the SSA (e.g., inquire about benefits, report a change, or resolve an issue).
- **Personal Details**: Have your Social Security number, full name, and any relevant account or case numbers ready.
- **Questions**: Write down specific questions or issues to address (e.g., “What is the status of my benefits application?” or “How do I update my address?”).
- **Tools**: Ensure access to a phone and a quiet environment for the call.
This preparation ensures the call is efficient and focused.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attempt to use the automated services at 1-800-772-1213 to resolve the query.  
**How to Achieve**: Dial the toll-free number 1-800-772-1213, follow the automated menu prompts, and attempt to resolve the query using the provided options.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Dial 1-800-772-1213 to access the SSA’s automated services. Listen carefully to the menu options and select the appropriate prompts based on the query (e.g., benefits information, account status). Provide requested details, such as the Social Security number, using the phone keypad. If the automated system resolves the query, note the outcome (e.g., confirmation number or information provided). If the query cannot be resolved, proceed to the next subgoal.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check if the query was resolved using the automated services.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify whether the information or resolution provided by the automated system fully addresses the query or if further action is needed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the outcome of the automated service call:
- If the query was resolved (e.g., obtained the needed information or completed the required action), consider the goal achieved.
- If the query remains unresolved (e.g., the automated system did not have the required option or information), proceed to contact a representative as outlined in the next subgoal.
Based on the script, the next step is to call 1-800-772-1213 during business hours to speak to a representative.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Contact a representative at 1-800-772-1213 during business hours (Monday to Friday).  
**How to Achieve**: Call the toll-free number 1-800-772-1213 during the SSA’s business hours (Monday to Friday, typically 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM local time) and follow prompts to speak to a representative.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Call 1-800-772-1213 during business hours (Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM local time). Use the prepared information from Step 3 (e.g., Social Security number, specific questions). Navigate the automated menu to select the option to speak with a representative. Clearly explain the query or issue to the representative and follow their guidance to resolve it. Note any important details provided, such as confirmation numbers or next steps.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the query was resolved by speaking to the representative.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify whether the representative’s assistance fully addressed the query or if additional steps (e.g., checking the FAQ page) are necessary.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Assess the outcome of the call with the representative:
- If the query was resolved (e.g., received the required information, completed an action, or received clear instructions), consider the main goal achieved.
- If the query remains unresolved or additional information is needed, proceed to the next subgoal of checking the FAQ page.
Based on the script, the next step involves using the FAQ page to find additional answers if needed.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Modify the subgoals based on the validation outcome:
- If the query was resolved in previous steps, no further action is needed, and the plan can be concluded.
- If the query remains unresolved, prioritize checking the FAQ page as the next subgoal, adjusting its priority to be the immediate next step.
Since the script includes checking the FAQ page, proceed with this subgoal to ensure all options are explored.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check the FAQ page to quickly find an answer.  
**How to Achieve**: Access the SSA’s official FAQ page online and search for information relevant to the unresolved query.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Visit the Social Security Administration’s official website (ssa.gov) and navigate to the FAQ section. Use the search function or browse categories to find information related to the query (e.g., benefits, account updates, or specific procedures). Review the relevant FAQ entries to determine if they resolve the issue or provide additional guidance. If the FAQ provides a solution, note the details; if not, consider repeating the process of contacting a representative with new information.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update and maintain the goal-management system:
- **Main Goal**: Contact the Social Security Administration by phone.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Prepare for the call by gathering necessary information (Completed).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Attempt to use the automated services at 1-800-772-1213 to resolve the query (Completed).
  - **Subgoal 3**: If automated services are insufficient, contact a representative at 1-800-772-1213 during business hours (Completed).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Check the FAQ page for additional information if needed (Completed).
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal of contacting the SSA by phone has been pursued through the provided script steps. If the query is resolved, the plan is complete; otherwise, further action (e.g., repeating contact with a representative) may be needed based on FAQ findings.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the main goal of contacting the SSA by phone has been achieved.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify whether the query was resolved through the automated services, representative, or FAQ page, ensuring all script steps were followed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the outcomes of all steps:
- If the query was resolved through the automated services (Step 4), representative (Step 6), or FAQ page (Step 9), the main goal is achieved.
- If the query remains unresolved after exhausting all script steps, consider additional actions (e.g., scheduling an in-person appointment or contacting the SSA again with new information).
Given that all script steps (automated services, representative contact, and FAQ page) have been addressed, the plan is complete unless further issues arise.
[/IMP]

---

### Conclusion
The plan to contact the Social Security Administration by phone has been completed by following the provided script steps and using meta-cognitive actions from the Planning, Implementation, and Review categories. All subgoals were addressed:
1. Prepared necessary information.
2. Attempted automated services.
3. Contacted a representative during business hours.
4. Checked the FAQ page for additional information.
The final validation confirms that the process aligns with the constraint (contact by phone) and the script. If the query is resolved, no further action is needed; otherwise, additional steps (outside the provided script) may be required.
