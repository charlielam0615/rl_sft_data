**Problem Statement**: Simulate a plan to keep a conversation going with a guy by making small talk, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must incorporate the script steps ('1. Make eye contact.', '2. Smile.', '3. Ask him how his day is going.', '4. Ask him about his hobbies or interests.', '5. Talk about the current location.', '6. Compliment him.', '7. Be positive.', '8. Tell a story.', '9. Open up about yourself.') and use small talk as the constraint. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and the response will be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks as per the guidelines.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To initiate the conversation effectively, break down the goal of keeping a conversation going into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals will align with the script steps to ensure a natural flow of small talk:  
1. Establish initial connection (eye contact and smile).  
2. Initiate verbal engagement (ask about his day and hobbies).  
3. Build rapport (discuss location, give a compliment, maintain positivity).  
4. Deepen the conversation (tell a story, share about yourself).
