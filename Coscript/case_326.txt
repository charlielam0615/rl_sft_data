### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making a paper flower into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare paper strips by cutting.  
2. Shape the strips by folding.  
3. Assemble the flower by gluing the strips.  
4. Create leaves by cutting paper into leaf shapes.  
5. Attach leaves to the flower.  
6. Utilize the completed flower as desired.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the implementation process.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Make a flower with paper  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare paper strips by cutting (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the strips by folding  
  - Subgoal 3: Assemble the flower by gluing the strips  
  - Subgoal 4: Create leaves by cutting paper into leaf shapes  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach leaves to the flower  
  - Subgoal 6: Utilize the completed flower as desired  
The current goal is to prepare paper strips by cutting.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare paper strips by cutting. This will be achieved by selecting appropriate paper and using scissors to cut it into strips of suitable size for forming the flower petals.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To prepare paper strips, choose colored paper suitable for crafting (e.g., construction or origami paper). Using scissors, cut the paper into strips approximately 1 inch wide and 6 inches long, ensuring enough strips (e.g., 8–10) to form a full flower.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the paper strips are correctly prepared. This will be achieved by checking the size, quantity, and quality of the cut strips to confirm they meet the requirements for folding and assembling the flower.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify that the paper strips are uniformly cut to approximately 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Ensure there are at least 8–10 strips, and check that the paper is not torn or damaged, confirming suitability for folding into petal shapes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape the strips by folding. This will be achieved by folding each strip into a loop or petal shape to form the components of the flower.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take each paper strip and fold it into a loop, securing the ends with a small amount of glue or tape to form a petal shape. Repeat for all strips, ensuring consistent shapes to create a symmetrical flower.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:  
- Main Goal: Make a flower with paper  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare paper strips by cutting (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the strips by folding (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Assemble the flower by gluing the strips  
  - Subgoal 4: Create leaves by cutting paper into leaf shapes  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach leaves to the flower  
  - Subgoal 6: Utilize the completed flower as desired  
The current goal is to shape the strips by folding.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assemble the flower by gluing the strips. This will be achieved by arranging the folded strips into a flower shape and gluing them together at the base.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Arrange the folded paper strips in a circular pattern to form the flower, overlapping the bases slightly. Apply glue to the base of each strip and press them together to secure the flower shape. Hold until the glue sets.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assemble the flower by gluing the strips. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the preparation and folding of the strips to ensure proper assembly.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
From previous steps:  
- Step 3: Paper strips were cut to 1 inch wide and 6 inches long, with 8–10 strips prepared.  
- Step 4: Strips were verified for uniformity and quality.  
- Step 5: Strips were folded into loops to form petal shapes.  
This ensures the strips are ready for gluing into a flower shape, with sufficient quantity and consistent form for a balanced assembly.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create leaves by cutting paper into leaf shapes. This will be achieved by cutting green paper into leaf-like forms to complement the flower.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select green construction or origami paper. Draw and cut out 2–3 leaf shapes, approximately 2 inches long, with a pointed or oval design. Ensure clean edges for a polished look.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach leaves to the flower. This will be achieved by gluing the cut leaves to the base of the assembled flower.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply a small amount of glue to the base of each leaf and attach them to the bottom of the flower, positioning them evenly for balance. Press firmly and allow the glue to dry.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to utilize the completed flower as desired. This will be achieved by deciding how to use or display the finished paper flower.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The completed paper flower can be used as a decorative item, such as a gift topper, a centerpiece, or a craft project display. Place it in a desired location, such as on a card or in a vase, ensuring it is secure and visually appealing.
