**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan to train an older dog to walk calmly on a leash by practicing at home. The provided script outlines five steps: (1) acclimate the dog to wearing a leash indoors, (2) practice walking in the house or backyard, (3) reward calm walking with praise and treats, (4) stop walking if the dog pulls until it calms down, and (5) gradually increase walking time on the leash. The constraint is that all practice must occur at home. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), selecting one action per step, and formatting responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of training an older dog to walk calmly on a leash into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script and the constraint of practicing at home.  

1. **Subgoal 1**: Familiarize the dog with wearing a leash indoors to build comfort.  
2. **Subgoal 2**: Practice controlled walking in a familiar home environment to establish calm behavior.  
3. **Subgoal 3**: Reinforce calm leash-walking behavior with positive rewards.  
4. **Subgoal 4**: Correct pulling behavior by pausing movement until the dog is calm.  
5. **Subgoal 5**: Extend the duration of calm leash-walking sessions to build endurance.  

These subgoals align with the script and ensure all training occurs at home.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Familiarize the dog with wearing a leash indoors to build comfort.  
- **How to Achieve**: Attach the leash to the dog’s collar and allow the dog to wear it indoors without walking, rewarding calm behavior with treats and praise to create a positive association.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of familiarizing the dog with wearing a leash indoors:  
1. Select a lightweight leash and a comfortable collar or harness suitable for an older dog.  
2. In a quiet, familiar room, attach the leash to the dog’s collar or harness while offering a treat to create a positive association.  
3. Let the dog move freely with the leash dragging behind, supervising to ensure it doesn’t get caught.  
4. Reward the dog with treats and verbal praise whenever it remains calm while wearing the leash.  
5. Repeat this process for short sessions (5–10 minutes) daily for a few days, ensuring the dog is relaxed before proceeding to walking.  
This step aligns with the constraint of practicing at home and follows the script’s first step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Familiarize the dog with wearing a leash indoors to build comfort.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the dog shows signs of comfort (e.g., relaxed body language, no pulling or chewing on the leash) during leash-wearing sessions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the current path:  
1. Observe the dog’s behavior during leash-wearing sessions. Look for signs of comfort, such as a relaxed posture, wagging tail, or normal movement without attempting to remove the leash.  
2. Note any signs of stress or discomfort, such as whining, pawing at the leash, or freezing.  
3. If the dog is calm for at least 5–10 minutes across multiple sessions, the goal is on track.  
4. If stress signs persist, reduce session duration or increase rewards to improve comfort before proceeding.  
This validation ensures the dog is ready to move to the next subgoal of practicing walking.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the subgoals to ensure they align with progress and the constraint of practicing at home. The validation step suggests the dog may need more time or adjustments if not fully comfortable. Adjust Subgoal 1 to include a contingency for slower progress:  

- **Adjusted Subgoal 1**: Familiarize the dog with wearing a leash indoors to build comfort, extending sessions or adding more rewards if the dog shows stress.  
- **Subgoal 2**: Practice controlled walking in a familiar home environment (unchanged).  
- **Subgoal 3**: Reinforce calm leash-walking behavior with positive rewards (unchanged).  
- **Subgoal 4**: Correct pulling behavior by pausing movement until the dog is calm (unchanged).  
- **Subgoal 5**: Extend the duration of calm leash-walking sessions to build endurance (unchanged).  

This adjustment ensures flexibility for an older dog’s learning pace while maintaining the home-based constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Practice controlled walking in a familiar home environment to establish calm behavior (Subgoal 2).  
- **How to Achieve**: Walk the dog on the leash in a low-distraction area of the home, keeping sessions short and rewarding calm walking.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve controlled walking in a home environment:  
1. Choose a quiet area like a hallway or living room for practice.  
2. Hold the leash with a relaxed grip and start walking slowly, encouraging the dog to follow.  
3. Keep initial sessions short (5–10 minutes) to avoid overwhelming an older dog.  
4. Use treats and praise to reward the dog for staying close and walking calmly without pulling.  
5. Practice daily, gradually increasing the complexity of the path (e.g., turns or different rooms) while staying indoors or in the backyard.  
This aligns with the script’s second step and the home-based constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Practice controlled walking in a familiar home environment to establish calm behavior.  
- **Core Content**: Retrieve information from previous steps related to ensuring calm behavior and managing the dog’s comfort during leash training.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Recalled information relevant to the current goal:  
- From Step 3 [IMP]: Familiarizing the dog with the leash involved rewarding calm behavior with treats and praise, ensuring a positive association. This suggests continuing rewards during walking to maintain calm behavior.  
- From Step 4 [IMP]: Validation showed the importance of monitoring the dog’s body language for signs of comfort or stress, which applies to walking sessions to ensure the dog remains relaxed.  
- From Step 5 [PLANNING]: Adjusting Subgoal 1 to account for stress indicates the need to monitor the dog’s pace and adapt walking sessions if the dog shows discomfort.  
This information emphasizes maintaining a positive, low-stress environment to support calm walking behavior.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Reinforce calm leash-walking behavior with positive rewards (Subgoal 3).  
- **How to Achieve**: Consistently provide praise and treats when the dog walks calmly on the leash to strengthen the desired behavior.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To reinforce calm leash-walking behavior:  
1. During walking sessions in the home or backyard, carry high-value treats (e.g., small pieces of chicken or cheese) that motivate the dog.  
2. Immediately praise and reward the dog with a treat when it walks beside you without pulling or lunging.  
3. Use a consistent cue (e.g., “Good walk!”) to mark calm behavior, followed by a reward.  
4. Gradually reduce the frequency of treats as the dog consistently walks calmly, but continue verbal praise.  
5. Conduct multiple short sessions daily to reinforce the behavior, keeping the training positive and engaging.  
This follows the script’s third step and adheres to the home-based constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Correct pulling behavior by pausing movement until the dog is calm (Subgoal 4).  
- **How to Achieve**: Stop walking when the dog pulls on the leash, waiting for it to return to a calm state before continuing.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To correct pulling behavior:  
1. During a walking session in the home or backyard, monitor the leash for tension.  
2. If the dog pulls, immediately stop walking and stand still, holding the leash firmly but without pulling back.  
3. Wait for the dog to relax (e.g., slack leash, sitting, or looking at you) before resuming walking.  
4. Reward the dog with praise or a treat when it returns to a calm state.  
5. Repeat this process consistently during all walking sessions to teach the dog that pulling stops progress.  
This aligns with the script’s fourth step and is feasible within the home environment.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Extend the duration of calm leash-walking sessions to build endurance (Subgoal 5).  
- **How to Achieve**: Gradually increase the time spent walking on the leash while maintaining calm behavior, using rewards and corrections as needed.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To extend the duration of calm leash-walking sessions:  
1. Start with the current session length (e.g., 5–10 minutes) where the dog walks calmly.  
2. Increase session duration by 1–2 minutes every few days, ensuring the dog remains relaxed.  
3. Continue using praise and occasional treats to reinforce calm walking, as established in Subgoal 3.  
4. Apply the pulling correction technique from Subgoal 4 (stopping when the dog pulls) to maintain control.  
5. Practice in varied home environments (e.g., different rooms or backyard) to build endurance while keeping sessions engaging.  
This completes the script’s fifth step and adheres to the home-based constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Extend the duration of calm leash-walking sessions to build endurance.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the dog can maintain calm walking for longer sessions (e.g., 15–20 minutes) without pulling or showing stress.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the final subgoal:  
1. Conduct a walking session in the home or backyard for 15–20 minutes, observing the dog’s behavior.  
2. Confirm the dog walks calmly with minimal pulling and responds to corrections (stopping when pulling occurs).  
3. Monitor for signs of fatigue or stress, especially given the dog’s older age, and adjust session length if needed.  
4. If the dog consistently walks calmly for extended periods, the training goal is achieved.  
5. If issues persist, revisit Subgoals 3 or 4 to reinforce calm behavior or pulling corrections.  
This ensures the dog has successfully learned to walk calmly on a leash at home.  
[/IMP]
