**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan to address the situation where a newborn's stool changes color, which could indicate diarrhea, by following a structured meta-cognitive approach. The plan must incorporate the provided script, which outlines steps to monitor and respond to potential diarrhea in a newborn, considering specific signs and symptoms that warrant action.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of addressing a newborn’s stool color change as a potential sign of diarrhea into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  

- **Subgoal 1**: Confirm the presence of diarrhea by observing stool color change and frequency.  
- **Subgoal 2**: Monitor for severe symptoms (e.g., eight or more stools per day, blood in stool, fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration).  
- **Subgoal 3**: Decide when to contact a doctor based on the severity and duration of symptoms.  
- **Subgoal 4**: Take appropriate actions if diarrhea is confirmed and severe symptoms are present (e.g., calling the doctor, managing dehydration).  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals based on the recent planning step and highlighting the current goal.  

- **Goal Hierarchy**:  
  - **Main Goal**: Address newborn’s stool color change as a potential sign of diarrhea.  
    - Subgoal 1: Confirm the presence of diarrhea by observing stool color change and frequency.  
    - Subgoal 2: Monitor for severe symptoms (e.g., eight or more stools per day, blood in stool, fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration).  
    - Subgoal 3: Decide when to contact a doctor based on the severity and duration of symptoms.  
    - Subgoal 4: Take appropriate actions if diarrhea is confirmed and severe symptoms are present (e.g., calling the doctor, managing dehydration).  

- **Current Goal**: Confirm the presence of diarrhea by observing stool color change and frequency.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the presence of diarrhea by observing stool color change and frequency.  
- **How to Achieve**: Observe the newborn’s stool for changes in color (e.g., green, watery, or unusual consistency) and count the number of stools per day to determine if it meets the threshold for diarrhea (e.g., eight or more stools per day as per the script).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To confirm diarrhea, monitor the newborn’s diapers for stool color changes, such as green, watery, or unusually loose stools compared to normal (typically yellow, seedy, or mustard-like for breastfed newborns). Record the frequency of stools over a 24-hour period. If the newborn has eight or more stools in a day, as indicated in the script, this suggests severe diarrhea. Note any other changes, such as unusual odor or consistency, to build a complete picture.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the observation of diarrhea based on stool color change and frequency.  
- **How to Achieve**: Cross-check the observed stool characteristics and frequency against standard indicators of diarrhea in newborns, ensuring the observations align with the script’s criteria (e.g., eight or more stools per day).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the recorded observations from Step 3. Confirm that the stool color has changed (e.g., green or watery) and that the frequency meets or exceeds eight stools per day, as specified in the script. If the frequency is lower but the stool is consistently abnormal (e.g., watery with color change), consider it a potential case of diarrhea. Ensure no external factors (e.g., dietary changes in a breastfeeding mother) could explain the stool changes. If the criteria for diarrhea are met, proceed to monitor for additional symptoms.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal hierarchy to reflect progress and highlight the current goal.  

- **Goal Hierarchy**:  
  - **Main Goal**: Address newborn’s stool color change as a potential sign of diarrhea.  
    - Subgoal 1: Confirm the presence of diarrhea by observing stool color change and frequency (Completed).  
    - Subgoal 2: Monitor for severe symptoms (e.g., eight or more stools per day, blood in stool, fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration).  
    - Subgoal 3: Decide when to contact a doctor based on the severity and duration of symptoms.  
    - Subgoal 4: Take appropriate actions if diarrhea is confirmed and severe symptoms are present (e.g., calling the doctor, managing dehydration).  

- **Current Goal**: Monitor for severe symptoms (e.g., eight or more stools per day, blood in stool, fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration).  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Monitor for severe symptoms of diarrhea as outlined in the script.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check for symptoms such as eight or more stools per day, blood in the stool, fever over 101°F, diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours, or signs of dehydration (e.g., sunken eyes, dry mouth, fewer wet diapers, or decreased urine output).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Continue monitoring the newborn’s stools to confirm if the frequency remains at eight or more per day. Inspect stools for blood, which may appear as red streaks or dark, tarry spots. Measure the newborn’s temperature using a rectal thermometer to check for a fever over 101°F. Track the duration of diarrhea to determine if it exceeds 24 hours. Observe for dehydration signs, such as fewer than six wet diapers in 24 hours, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, or lethargy. Record these observations systematically to assess severity.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Decide when to contact a doctor based on the severity and duration of symptoms.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information from the script and previous steps about severe symptoms and criteria for contacting a doctor.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Summarize information relevant to deciding when to contact a doctor:  
- From the script: Contact a doctor if the newborn has diarrhea with any of the following: severe diarrhea (eight or more stools per day), diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours, blood in the stool, fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration (sunken eyes, dry mouth, fewer wet diapers, decreased urine output).  
- From Step 3 and 4: Confirmed diarrhea through stool color change and frequency (e.g., eight or more stools per day).  
- From Step 6: Monitored for severe symptoms, including blood in stool, fever, duration, and dehydration signs.  

If any of these symptoms are present, the script indicates contacting a doctor is necessary.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Decide when to contact a doctor based on the severity and duration of symptoms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Evaluate the observations from monitoring (Step 6) against the script’s criteria to determine if contacting a doctor is warranted.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the observations from Step 6:  
- If the newborn has eight or more stools per day, diarrhea lasting over 24 hours, blood in the stool, a fever over 101°F, or signs of dehydration (e.g., fewer wet diapers, sunken eyes), contact a pediatrician immediately, as per the script.  
- If diarrhea is present but none of these severe symptoms are observed, continue monitoring and consult a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.  
Prepare to provide the doctor with details: stool frequency, color, presence of blood, temperature readings, duration of diarrhea, and any dehydration signs.  

[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The original subgoals included taking action (e.g., managing dehydration), but the script focuses primarily on contacting a doctor. Adjust the final subgoal to align with the script’s emphasis on seeking medical advice rather than managing symptoms independently.  

- **Adjusted Subgoal 4**: Contact a doctor to seek professional guidance and follow their recommendations for managing diarrhea and any severe symptoms.  

[/PLANNING]
