**Problem Statement**: Plan a visit to the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) to see the sights, following the provided script of steps: (1) Visit the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis, (2) See the Minnesota State Fair in Minneapolis, (3) Visit Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis, (4) Go to the Como Zoo in St. Paul, (5) See Harriet Island Regional Park in St. Paul, and (6) Visit the Mall of America in St. Paul. The plan must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and the specified response format, ensuring all sights are visited while considering logistical details like timing, transportation, and location accuracy.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of visiting the Twin Cities' sights into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Plan the visit to the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis.  
2. Plan attendance at the Minnesota State Fair in Minneapolis.  
3. Plan the visit to Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis.  
4. Plan the visit to the Como Zoo in St. Paul.  
5. Plan the visit to Harriet Island Regional Park in St. Paul.  
6. Plan the visit to the Mall of America in St. Paul.  
Each subgoal involves determining the location, timing, transportation, and any constraints (e.g., seasonal availability for the State Fair).

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Visit the Twin Cities to see the sights.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Plan the visit to the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Plan attendance at the Minnesota State Fair in Minneapolis.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Plan the visit to Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Plan the visit to the Como Zoo in St. Paul.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Plan the visit to Harriet Island Regional Park in St. Paul.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Plan the visit to the Mall of America in St. Paul.  
**Current Goal**: Plan the visit to the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to plan the visit to the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis. This involves confirming the location, checking operating hours, and arranging transportation to the museum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The Mill City Museum is located at 704 S 2nd St, Minneapolis, MN 55401. It is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 AM to 5 PM, with extended hours on Thursdays until 8 PM (based on general museum schedules; verify closer to the visit). Admission is approximately $12 for adults. Public transportation options include the Metro Blue Line to the U.S. Bank Stadium Station, followed by a short walk. Alternatively, drive or use a rideshare service, with parking available onsite. Plan for a 2-hour visit to explore exhibits on Minneapolis’s flour milling history.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the plan for visiting the Mill City Museum by checking for potential issues, such as location accuracy, timing conflicts, or transportation feasibility.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The museum’s location at 704 S 2nd St, Minneapolis, is accurate. Operating hours (10 AM–5 PM, extended Thursdays) are feasible for a daytime visit. The Metro Blue Line is a reliable transportation option, with U.S. Bank Stadium Station within a 10-minute walk. No immediate conflicts are noted, but the Minnesota State Fair’s seasonal nature (late August to early September) may require scheduling adjustments for the next subgoal. The plan is valid, assuming the visit occurs on an open day.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Upon validation, a potential issue was identified: the Minnesota State Fair is a seasonal event (typically late August to early September). Adjust the second subgoal to account for this constraint. If the visit occurs outside this period, replace the State Fair with another year-round Minneapolis attraction, such as the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia). Additionally, correct the location of the Mall of America, which is in Bloomington, not St. Paul. Revised subgoals:  
1. Visit the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis (completed).  
2. Visit the Minneapolis Institute of Art in Minneapolis (if State Fair is unavailable).  
3. Visit Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis.  
4. Visit the Como Zoo in St. Paul.  
5. Visit Harriet Island Regional Park in St. Paul.  
6. Visit the Mall of America in Bloomington.
