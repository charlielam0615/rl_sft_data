**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to simulate drawing Link for a website, following the provided script of ordered steps to achieve the task, adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories, and ensuring all content is structured within [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of drawing Link for a website into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script outlines 30 steps to draw Link’s head, face, hair, ears, hat, and clothing. Subgoals can be grouped by major components:
1. Draw the head and face (steps 1–7).
2. Draw the hair (steps 8–11).
3. Draw the ears (steps 12–14).
4. Draw the hat (steps 15–19).
5. Draw the clothing (steps 20–30).

[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Execute steps 1–7 from the script:
1. Draw a small circle near the top of the canvas for Link’s head.
2. Draw a curved line beneath the circle for the chin.
3. Draw a sideways "V" shape beneath the chin for the jawline start.
4. Draw a curved line from the bottom of the "V" to the right side of the canvas for the right side of the face.
5. Draw a line from the left side of the "V" to the left side of the canvas for the left side of the face.
