**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a plan for cleaning red bricks using soap and water, adhering to the provided script and constraint. The script includes three steps: (1) Make a soap and water solution, (2) Use a brush to scrub the bricks, and (3) Rinse with clean water. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of cleaning red bricks with soap and water into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare a soap and water solution.  
2. Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush.  
3. Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean red bricks with soap and water.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a soap and water solution.  
  - Subgoal 2: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush.  
  - Subgoal 3: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  

**Current Goal**: Prepare a soap and water solution.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the next implementation action.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare a soap and water solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Mix an appropriate amount of mild liquid soap with water in a bucket to create a cleaning solution suitable for red bricks.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the soap and water solution, fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water and add 1-2 tablespoons of mild liquid dish soap. Stir gently to create a uniform solution, ensuring it is not overly sudsy to avoid residue on the bricks.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the soap and water solution is properly prepared.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the solution for appropriate consistency and soap concentration to confirm it is suitable for cleaning red bricks.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the solution is well-mixed, with a light soapy consistency and no excessive bubbles. Test a small amount on a single brick to ensure it cleans without leaving residue or damaging the brick surface. The solution should be effective for cleaning while adhering to the constraint of using soap and water.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean red bricks with soap and water.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a soap and water solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush.  
  - Subgoal 3: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  

**Current Goal**: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush.  
The hierarchy is updated to mark the first subgoal as completed, focusing on the next subgoal for implementation.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a stiff-bristled brush to apply the soap and water solution to the red bricks, scrubbing to remove dirt and stains.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Dip a stiff-bristled brush into the prepared soap and water solution. Scrub the red bricks in a circular motion, focusing on areas with visible dirt or stains. Work in small sections to ensure thorough cleaning, reapplying the solution as needed to keep the brush wet.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the bricks are effectively cleaned by scrubbing.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the scrubbed bricks to confirm dirt and stains are removed without damaging the brick surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the scrubbed areas to verify that dirt and stains are lifted. Check that the brick surface remains intact, with no signs of abrasion or color fading. If any areas remain dirty, reapply the solution and scrub again to ensure thorough cleaning.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean red bricks with soap and water.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a soap and water solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  

**Current Goal**: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  
The hierarchy is updated to reflect the completion of the second subgoal, with the final subgoal now in focus.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt.  
**How to Achieve**: Use clean water to rinse the bricks, ensuring all soap residue and loosened dirt are removed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a hose or bucket to pour clean water over the scrubbed bricks, ensuring all soap suds and loosened dirt are washed away. Rinse thoroughly, working from top to bottom to prevent streaking. Ensure no soap residue remains on the brick surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the bricks are clean and free of soap residue.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the rinsed bricks to ensure they are clean, free of soap, and undamaged.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the bricks visually and by touch to confirm all dirt, stains, and soap residue are removed. The bricks should appear clean, with their natural red color restored and no slippery soap residue remaining. If any soap or dirt remains, rinse again with clean water.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean red bricks with soap and water (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare a soap and water solution (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Scrub the bricks with the solution using a brush (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Rinse the bricks with clean water to remove soap and dirt (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals and main goal completed).  
The goal hierarchy is fully updated, with all subgoals and the main goal marked as completed. The plan for cleaning the red bricks with soap and water is now complete.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The plan for cleaning red bricks with soap and water has been fully developed and completed, following the provided script and constraint. Each step utilized a meta-cognitive action, with appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.
