**Problem Statement**: The task is to simulate a "Find Your WiFi Password by Checking Previous Passwords" planning case. This involves creating a plan to retrieve a WiFi password from a computer by accessing previously stored passwords in the Keychain Access application on a macOS system. The plan must adhere to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the given script while respecting the constraint of checking previous passwords. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and the response will use the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the WiFi password by checking previous passwords, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Access the Keychain Access application.  
2. Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials.  
3. Retrieve the password by authenticating and revealing it.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and will guide the process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the WiFi password by checking previous passwords.  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the Keychain Access application.  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials.  
  - Subgoal 3: Retrieve the password by authenticating and revealing it.  
**Current Goal**: Access the Keychain Access application.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in Step 1, providing context for subsequent implementation steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to access the Keychain Access application. This will be achieved by navigating through the Finder to the Utilities folder and opening Keychain Access, as outlined in the script’s first four steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Follow these steps to access Keychain Access:  
1. Open Finder.  
2. Click on Applications in the sidebar.  
3. Click on Utilities within the Applications folder.  
4. Double-click Keychain Access to open it.  
These steps align with the script and move toward accessing the Keychain Access application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to ensure the Keychain Access application is successfully opened. This will be achieved by verifying that the application launches after performing the steps in the previous implementation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check if the Keychain Access application has launched. If the application window is visible and displays the Keychain Access interface, the path is valid. If it does not open, ensure the correct steps were followed (Finder → Applications → Utilities → Keychain Access) and check for any system errors or prompts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Assuming Keychain Access is open, refine the subgoals to focus on the next phase. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Authenticate to access Keychain Access (if prompted).  
2. Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials.  
3. Retrieve the password by revealing it.  
This adjustment accounts for the potential need to enter an administrator password as per the script’s step 5.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to authenticate to access Keychain Access. This will be achieved by entering the administrator password when prompted, as indicated in the script’s step 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
When prompted by Keychain Access, enter the administrator password for the computer. Ensure the password is correct and submit it to gain access to the Keychain Access interface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the WiFi password by checking previous passwords.  
  - Subgoal 1: Authenticate to access Keychain Access (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials.  
  - Subgoal 3: Retrieve the password by revealing it.  
**Current Goal**: Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials.  
This hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals from Step 5 and confirms that authentication has been addressed, focusing now on locating the credentials.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials. This will be achieved by navigating to the “All Items” category in Keychain Access and finding the network’s name, as per the script’s steps 6 and 7.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. In Keychain Access, click the “All Items” category in the sidebar.  
2. Scroll or search for the WiFi network’s name in the list and double-click it to open its details.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to verify that the correct WiFi network’s credentials have been located. This will be achieved by ensuring the selected item in Keychain Access corresponds to the target WiFi network.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the double-clicked item in Keychain Access matches the name of the WiFi network. Check the details window to ensure it is a “WiFi password” or “network password” entry. If incorrect, search again in the “All Items” category or use the search bar to find the correct network name.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to retrieve the WiFi password by revealing it. This will be achieved by checking the “Show password” box and authenticating again if prompted, as per the script’s steps 8 and 9.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. In the network’s details window, check the “Show password” box.  
2. If prompted, enter the administrator password again to reveal the WiFi password.  
3. Note the displayed password for use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to confirm the retrieved WiFi password. Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure all actions align with the goal of finding the WiFi password.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 3 and 6: Successfully accessed and authenticated Keychain Access.  
- Step 8: Located the WiFi network’s credentials in the “All Items” category.  
- Step 9: Validated the correct network was selected.  
- Step 10: Revealed the password by checking “Show password” and authenticating.  
The password retrieved in Step 10 is the WiFi password, fulfilling the main goal. All steps followed the script and adhered to the constraint of checking previous passwords.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to validate that the retrieved password is correct. This will be achieved by testing the password on a device attempting to connect to the WiFi network.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use the retrieved password to connect a device to the WiFi network. Enter the password in the device’s WiFi settings and confirm a successful connection. If the connection fails, return to Keychain Access to verify the network name and password or check for typos.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the WiFi password by checking previous passwords (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Authenticate to access Keychain Access (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the WiFi network’s stored credentials (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Retrieve the password by revealing it (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all goals completed).  
The WiFi password has been retrieved and validated, completing the plan. All steps adhered to the script and the constraint of checking previous passwords.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Conclusion**: The plan to find the WiFi password by checking previous passwords has been completed. The process involved accessing Keychain Access, locating the network’s credentials, retrieving the password, and validating it, all while following the provided script and meta-cognitive action framework.
