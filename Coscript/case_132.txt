### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a "Make Homemade Cookies without a Recipe" planning case. The constraint is that no recipe is provided, so the process must rely on general knowledge of cookie-making. The provided script outlines a sequence of steps: preheat the oven, mix dry ingredients, cream butter and sugars, add eggs, add vanilla extract, mix in dry ingredients, add chocolate chips, scoop dough onto a baking sheet, bake the cookies, and let them cool. The task belongs to the category of Food and Entertaining. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the defined action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the structured format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

1. Prepare the oven for baking.  
2. Gather and combine dry ingredients.  
3. Combine wet ingredients.  
4. Mix wet and dry ingredients with add-ins.  
5. Shape the dough for baking.  
6. Bake and cool the cookies.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System:**  
- Main Goal: Make homemade cookies without a recipe.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven for baking.  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather and combine dry ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine wet ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 4: Mix wet and dry ingredients with add-ins.  
  - Subgoal 5: Shape the dough for baking.  
  - Subgoal 6: Bake and cool the cookies.  
**Current Goal:** Prepare the oven for baking.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Prepare the oven for baking.  
- **How to Achieve:** Set the oven to an appropriate temperature for cookies, typically around 350°F (175°C), and allow it to preheat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Turn the oven on and set it to 350°F (175°C). Wait for it to fully preheat, which usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the oven.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the oven is properly preheated.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the oven’s temperature indicator or use an oven thermometer to confirm it has reached 350°F.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the oven’s preheat indicator light is off or use an oven thermometer to confirm the temperature is at 350°F. If not, allow more time for preheating.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Core Content:** Information related to combining dry ingredients for cookies.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal:** Gather and combine dry ingredients.  
**Recalled Information:** From general knowledge, typical dry ingredients for cookies include flour, baking soda, and salt. A common starting point is about 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, and a pinch of salt, adjusted based on dough consistency. These are mixed separately before combining with wet ingredients.

- **How to Achieve:** Use softened butter and mix with granulated and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup (2 sticks) of softened butter, 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Use a hand mixer or whisk to cream them together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Mix wet and dry ingredients with add-ins.  
- **How to Achieve:** Gradually combine the dry ingredient mixture with the wet mixture, then fold in chocolate chips.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined to avoid overmixing. Fold in 1-2 cups of chocolate chips until evenly distributed.  
[/IMP]
