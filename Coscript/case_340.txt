### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for clapping really fast using two hands, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and adhering to the specified format and constraints. The script provided includes three steps: (1) separate your hands, (2) bring your hands close together, and (3) practice. The constraint is that the clapping must be performed using both hands, and the task falls under the category of Hobbies and Crafts.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, ensuring that all planning, implementation, and review actions are enclosed in their respective [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks, as per the guidelines. The goal is to create a complete plan for clapping really fast, addressing each step of the script while incorporating the meta-cognitive framework.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To create a plan for clapping really fast using two hands, I will break down the main goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to clap rapidly with both hands. The subgoals are:  
1. Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping.  
2. Bring hands close together to enable quick clapping motion.  
3. Practice the clapping motion to increase speed.  
These subgoals align with the script and ensure the constraint of using two hands is met.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Clap really fast using two hands.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping.  
  - Subgoal 2: Bring hands close together to enable quick clapping motion.  
  - Subgoal 3: Practice the clapping motion to increase speed.  
**Current Goal:** Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the first implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping.  
- **How to Achieve:** Extend both arms outward to create a comfortable distance between the hands, ensuring they are free to move and align with the constraint of using both hands.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of positioning hands correctly, stand or sit comfortably and extend both arms forward, palms facing each other. Separate the hands by approximately 12-18 inches, keeping them at chest level. Ensure both hands are relaxed and ready to move. This satisfies the constraint of using two hands and prepares for the next step of clapping.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure hands are correctly positioned for clapping.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check that both hands are separated, aligned, and relaxed, confirming readiness for the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that both hands are separated by 12-18 inches, palms facing each other, and positioned at chest level. Confirm that both arms are relaxed and there are no obstructions preventing free movement. This ensures the constraint of using two hands is met and validates the setup for clapping.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The original subgoals are clear, but to optimize for speed, I will refine Subgoal 2 (bring hands close together) to specify a precise distance for faster clapping. The adjusted subgoals are:  
1. Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping (unchanged).  
2. Bring hands to a 2-4 inch distance to enable rapid clapping motion.  
3. Practice the clapping motion to increase speed (unchanged).  
This adjustment ensures the hands are close enough for quick claps while maintaining the two-hand constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Track Goals**  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Clap really fast using two hands.  
  - Subgoal 1: Position hands correctly by separating them to prepare for clapping (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Bring hands to a 2-4 inch distance to enable rapid clapping motion.  
  - Subgoal 3: Practice the clapping motion to increase speed.  
**Current Goal:** Bring hands to a 2-4 inch distance to enable rapid clapping motion.  
This updated hierarchy incorporates the adjusted subgoal from the previous step, focusing on the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Bring hands to a 2-4 inch distance to enable rapid clapping motion.  
- **How to Achieve:** Move both hands closer together, maintaining alignment and ensuring they are 2-4 inches apart, ready for rapid clapping.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the separated position, slowly bring both hands closer until they are 2-4 inches apart, with palms facing each other at chest level. Ensure both hands remain relaxed and aligned, adhering to the two-hand constraint, to facilitate quick clapping motions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure hands are 2-4 inches apart and ready for rapid clapping.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the distance between hands and confirm they are aligned and relaxed for clapping.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the distance between the palms to confirm it is 2-4 inches. Verify that both hands are at chest level, palms facing each other, and free of tension or obstructions. This ensures the setup is optimal for rapid clapping using both hands.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Retrieve information related to the current goal of practicing the clapping motion to increase speed, focusing on techniques or tips for rapid clapping.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Action: Recall Info**  
**Current Goal:** Practice the clapping motion to increase speed.  
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Step 1 (Forward Subgoaling): The script includes a practice step to increase clapping speed, indicating repetition is key.  
- From Step 5 (Adjust Subgoals): Hands should be 2-4 inches apart to optimize for speed.  
- From Step 7 (Reach Goal): Hands are positioned 2-4 inches apart, relaxed, and aligned for rapid clapping.  
This information suggests that practicing involves repetitive clapping with hands close together, focusing on speed and maintaining the two-hand constraint.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Practice the clapping motion to increase speed.  
- **How to Achieve:** Repeatedly clap hands at a 2-4 inch distance, gradually increasing speed while maintaining rhythm and using both hands.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Begin clapping by bringing both hands together quickly to make contact, then separate them back to the 2-4 inch distance. Repeat this motion rhythmically, starting at a moderate pace and gradually increasing speed. Focus on keeping movements smooth and using both hands equally. Practice for 1-2 minutes, aiming for faster, consistent claps while ensuring the constraint of using two hands is met.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the clapping practice is effective for increasing speed.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check that claps are rapid, consistent, and performed with both hands at the correct distance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Observe the clapping motion to confirm that both hands are used, maintaining a 2-4 inch distance between claps. Verify that the claps are quick, rhythmic, and produce a clear sound without strain. If speed is inconsistent, slow down and rebuild pace gradually. This validates that the practice aligns with the goal of clapping really fast using two hands.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The plan for clapping really fast using two hands has been completed by following the meta-cognitive action set. The process involved planning subgoals, implementing steps to position and practice clapping, and reviewing progress to ensure alignment with the goal. The constraint of using two hands was maintained throughout, and the script's steps (separate hands, bring hands close, practice) were executed with adjustments for optimal speed.
