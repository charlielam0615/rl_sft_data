**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for adding track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks, following the provided script and adhering to the constraint of using Label Tracks. The solution must use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, until the plan is complete.

The script to follow is:
1. Click on the location inside the audio track to be marked.
2. Click the Project tab on the menu bar and select the option "Add label at selection" from the pull-down menu.
3. Type the desired text for the label marker and click enter.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of adding track markers in Audacity into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  

- **Subgoal 1**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed.  
- **Subgoal 2**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu.  
- **Subgoal 3**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block. State the current goal.  

- **Goal**: Add track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it.  

**Current Goal**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed (Subgoal 1).  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed. This will be achieved by clicking on the desired point in the audio track timeline in Audacity’s interface.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Click on the location inside the audio track where the marker is to be placed, ensuring the cursor is positioned accurately on the timeline.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the correct location in the audio track has been selected. This will be achieved by checking the cursor position in Audacity’s timeline to ensure it matches the intended marker placement.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the timeline in Audacity to confirm the cursor is at the desired location for the marker. If the cursor is not correctly positioned, adjust by clicking the correct spot.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format. State the current goal.  

- **Goal**: Add track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it.  

**Current Goal**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu (Subgoal 2).  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu. This will be achieved by navigating to the Project tab in Audacity’s menu bar and selecting “Add label at selection” from the pull-down menu.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Click the Project tab on the menu bar and select the option “Add label at selection” from the pull-down menu to create a new label track at the selected location.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the label track has been successfully added at the selected location. This will be achieved by checking Audacity’s interface to confirm the presence of a new label track at the cursor’s position.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect Audacity’s interface to ensure a new label track appears at the selected location. If no label track is visible, repeat the action of selecting “Add label at selection” from the Project tab.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format. State the current goal.  

- **Goal**: Add track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it.  

**Current Goal**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it (Subgoal 3).  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to input the desired text for the label and confirm it. This will be achieved by typing the label text in the label track field and pressing Enter to save it.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Type the desired text for the label marker in the label track field and press Enter to confirm and save the label.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the label text has been correctly added and saved. This will be achieved by checking the label track in Audacity to ensure the text appears as entered.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the label track in Audacity to confirm the entered text is displayed correctly at the selected location. If the text is incorrect, edit the label by clicking on it and retyping the desired text.  

[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format. State the current goal.  

- **Goal**: Add track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Select the specific location in the audio track where the marker will be placed (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add a label at the selected location using the Project tab menu (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Input the desired text for the label and confirm it (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: All subgoals are completed, achieving the main goal of adding track markers in Audacity by creating Label Tracks.  

[/REVIEW]
