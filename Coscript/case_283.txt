### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of owning an animal while managing an allergy to animal hair into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script and constraints.  

- **Subgoal 1**: Research and select a hypoallergenic or low-dander pet breed.  
- **Subgoal 2**: Test the home environment for pet allergens.  
- **Subgoal 3**: Modify the home to reduce allergen accumulation.  
- **Subgoal 4**: Implement regular cleaning routines to manage pet dander.  
- **Subgoal 5**: Restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to research and select a hypoallergenic or low-dander pet breed. This will be achieved by identifying breeds known to produce less dander and consulting reliable sources for recommendations.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Research hypoallergenic breeds such as poodle, bichon frise, or sphynx cats, which are known to produce less dander. Short-haired animals, like certain terrier breeds, may also be suitable as they typically shed less. Consult veterinary websites or allergist recommendations to confirm low-allergen breeds. Create a shortlist of suitable animals based on lifestyle compatibility and allergy considerations.  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Own an animal and live with an allergy to animal hair.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Research and select a hypoallergenic or low-dander pet breed (Completed in Step 2).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Test the home environment for pet allergens (Current goal).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Modify the home to reduce allergen accumulation.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Implement regular cleaning routines to manage pet dander.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure.  

**Current Goal**: Test the home environment for pet allergens.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test the home environment for pet allergens. This will be achieved by arranging for an allergy test or consultation with a professional to assess the homeâ€™s allergen levels before bringing a pet in.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Contact an allergist or environmental testing service to evaluate the home for pet allergens. Schedule a test to measure dander levels, focusing on areas where the pet will likely spend time. Alternatively, purchase a home allergen test kit designed for pet dander and follow the instructions to collect samples. Review results to establish a baseline for allergen management.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Based on the home allergen test results, refine the plan to modify the home environment. If high allergen levels are detected, prioritize specific modifications like removing soft surfaces or enhancing ventilation. If levels are low, focus on preventive measures to maintain a low-allergen environment.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Own an animal and live with an allergy to animal hair.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Research and select a hypoallergenic or low-dander pet breed (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Test the home environment for pet allergens (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Modify the home to reduce allergen accumulation (Current goal, adjusted in Step 5).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Implement regular cleaning routines to manage pet dander.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure.  

**Current Goal**: Modify the home to reduce allergen accumulation.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to modify the home to reduce allergen accumulation. This will be achieved by removing soft surfaces like rugs and carpeting that can harbor pet dander and improving air quality.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Replace rugs and carpets with hard flooring, such as tile or hardwood, to minimize dander buildup. Remove or wash fabric curtains and replace with blinds if possible. Install an air purifier with a HEPA filter in commonly used areas to capture airborne allergens. Ensure proper ventilation by opening windows or using exhaust fans when weather permits.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to implement regular cleaning routines to manage pet dander. This will be achieved by establishing a cleaning schedule using tools like a HEPA-filter vacuum and allergen-reducing cleaning products.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Create a weekly cleaning schedule that includes vacuuming with a HEPA-filter vacuum to remove pet dander from surfaces. Use allergen-neutralizing sprays or wipes on furniture and hard surfaces. Wash pet bedding and toys frequently in hot water. Consider hiring a professional cleaning service for deep cleaning every few months to maintain a low-dander environment.  

[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure. Retrieve information from previous steps related to managing allergen exposure in the home to inform this step.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Selected hypoallergenic or low-dander breeds to reduce allergen production.  
- Step 4: Tested the home for allergens to establish a baseline.  
- Step 7: Modified the home by removing soft surfaces and adding air purifiers to reduce allergen accumulation.  
- Step 8: Implemented regular cleaning routines with HEPA-filter vacuums and allergen-neutralizing products to manage dander.  

These steps provide a foundation for minimizing allergen exposure, which supports restricting pet access to high-traffic or personal areas like the bedroom to further reduce contact with dander.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to restrict pet access to key areas to limit allergen exposure. This will be achieved by setting boundaries for the pet, such as keeping them out of the bedroom and other frequently used rooms.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Designate pet-free zones, including the bedroom and other areas where significant time is spent, such as a home office or living room. Install pet gates or keep doors closed to enforce these boundaries. Provide the pet with a comfortable, dedicated space equipped with bedding and toys to encourage compliance. Regularly clean these pet areas to prevent dander buildup. Train the pet to respect these boundaries using positive reinforcement techniques.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Own an animal and live with an allergy to animal hair.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Research and select a hypoallergenic or low-dander pet breed (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Test the home environment for pet allergens (Completed).
