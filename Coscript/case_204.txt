### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus and context for the plan.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cheer up my boyfriend by being supportive.  
  - Subgoal 1: Listen actively to understand his concerns.  
  - Subgoal 2: Show patience to create a safe space.  
  - Subgoal 3: Maintain a positive attitude to uplift his mood.  
  - Subgoal 4: Encourage him to share his emotions openly.  
  - Subgoal 5: Assist in identifying solutions to his challenges.  
  - Subgoal 6: Offer practical help for his current issues.  
  - Subgoal 7: Pray for his well-being to show care.  
  - Subgoal 8: Express belief in his abilities to boost his confidence.  
**Current Goal**: Listen actively to understand his concerns (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to listen actively to understand his concerns. Achieve this by giving him full attention, avoiding interruptions, and showing empathy through verbal and non-verbal cues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To be a good listener, initiate a quiet, comfortable setting for conversation. Ask open-ended questions like, “How’s everything going for you?” and nod or maintain eye contact to show engagement. Paraphrase what he says to confirm understanding, e.g., “It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed because of work.” Avoid offering solutions unless asked, focusing solely on understanding his perspective.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to listen actively. Validate that the listening approach is effective by checking if he feels heard and understood.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Observe his body language and responses during the conversation. If he opens up more or seems relaxed, it indicates effective listening. Ask gently, “Do you feel I’m understanding what you’re going through?” to confirm he feels supported. Adjust by giving more space or asking clarifying questions if he seems hesitant.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and shift focus to the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Cheer up my boyfriend by being supportive.  
  - Subgoal 1: Listen actively to understand his concerns (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Show patience to create a safe space (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Maintain a positive attitude to uplift his mood.  
  - Subgoal 4: Encourage him to share his emotions openly.  
  - Subgoal 5: Assist in identifying solutions to his challenges.  
  - Subgoal 6: Offer practical help for his current issues.  
  - Subgoal 7: Pray for his well-being to show care.  
  - Subgoal 8: Express belief in his abilities to boost his confidence.  
**Current Goal**: Show patience to create a safe space (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to show patience to create a safe space. Achieve this by allowing him time to express himself without pressure and responding calmly to his emotions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
When he shares his thoughts, avoid rushing him or jumping to conclusions. If he pauses or seems frustrated, respond with phrases like, “Take your time, I’m here.” Stay calm even if he expresses strong emotions, ensuring he feels safe to be vulnerable. Avoid pushing for quick resolutions, focusing on being present.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maintain a positive attitude to uplift his mood. Retrieve past information related to his preferences or situations where positivity helped him feel better.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From previous steps, active listening (Step 3) revealed his concerns, and patience (Step 6) created a safe space. If prior conversations showed he responds well to humor or optimism (e.g., enjoying light-hearted comments), incorporate similar positivity. For example, recalling a time when a positive remark like “You always find a way through tough times” lifted his mood can guide the approach.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maintain a positive attitude to uplift his mood. Achieve this by using encouraging words, smiling, and highlighting positive aspects of his situation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Share optimistic perspectives, like, “I know things are tough, but you’re so strong, and I’m confident you’ll get through this.” Smile warmly during conversations to convey positivity. If he mentions a challenge, acknowledge it but highlight a strength, e.g., “That sounds hard, but you’ve handled similar things so well before.” Avoid dismissing his feelings, balancing positivity with empathy.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and shift focus to the next subgoal.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to encourage him to share his emotions openly. Achieve this by asking thoughtful questions and reassuring him that his feelings are valid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Ask questions like, “How are you really feeling about this?” in a gentle tone. Reassure him with statements like, “It’s okay to feel this way, and I’m here no matter what.” If he hesitates, share a small personal example to model openness, e.g., “Sometimes I feel overwhelmed too, and talking helps.” Create a non-judgmental atmosphere to encourage vulnerability.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assist in identifying solutions to his problems. Achieve this by brainstorming options together and guiding him toward actionable steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Discuss his challenges, e.g., “What do you think could help with this situation?” Suggest ideas gently, like, “Maybe breaking the task into smaller steps could work?” Write down ideas if he’s overwhelmed, and help prioritize one or two actionable solutions. Focus on collaboration rather than dictating answers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to offer practical help for his current issues. Achieve this by identifying specific ways to assist based on his needs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Ask, “Is there something specific I can do to help, like running an errand or helping you plan?” Offer concrete support, e.g., “I can help you organize your work schedule if that feels overwhelming.” Follow through on any offered help, ensuring actions align with his expressed needs.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pray for his well-being to show care. Achieve this by offering a heartfelt prayer or moment of reflection tailored to his situation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
If appropriate, say, “I’d like to pray for you, if that’s okay.” Offer a short prayer, e.g., “I pray for strength and peace for you during this tough time.” If he’s not religious, express care through a thoughtful wish, like, “I’m holding you in my thoughts for better days.” Ensure the gesture feels personal and sincere.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express belief in his abilities to boost his confidence. Achieve this by affirming his strengths and past successes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Tell him, “I really believe in you—you’ve overcome so much before, and I know you can do this.” Reference a specific example, like, “Remember how you handled that project last month? You’re so capable.” Be sincere and specific to make the encouragement meaningful.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
