**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to wear leg warmers under pants, adhering to the constraint that the leg warmers must be worn under the pants, following the provided script, and using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, structured according to the specified format.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of wearing leg warmers under pants into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Select appropriate pants (loose in the leg).  
2. Wear leg warmers.  
3. Wear pants over leg warmers.  
4. Confirm the task is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Select appropriate pants that are loose in the leg.  
How to Achieve: Identify and choose a pair of pants from the wardrobe that have a slightly loose fit around the legs to accommodate leg warmers comfortably.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, check the wardrobe for pants labeled as "loose fit" or "relaxed fit," such as chinos or wide-leg jeans. Ensure the pants are clean and suitable for the occasion. Select one pair that allows enough room for leg warmers without feeling tight.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Wear a pair of leg warmers.  
How to Achieve: Choose a pair of leg warmers and put them on over the feet and up the legs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a pair of leg warmers that are comfortable and fit snugly without slipping. Sit down, pull each leg warmer over the foot, and position it to cover the lower leg, ensuring it is smooth and not bunched up.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Wear leg warmers under pants.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate pants (loose in the leg) — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Wear leg warmers — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wear pants over leg warmers — Pending.  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm task completion — Pending.  
Current Goal: Wear pants over leg warmers.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Wear pants over leg warmers.  
How to Achieve: Put on the selected loose-fitting pants over the leg warmers, ensuring comfort and proper fit.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the selected loose-fitting pants and step into them, pulling them up over the leg warmers. Adjust the leg warmers if they shift during this process to ensure they remain smooth and properly positioned. Fasten the pants and check for comfort and mobility.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Wear leg warmers under pants.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate pants (loose in the leg) — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Wear leg warmers — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wear pants over leg warmers — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm task completion — Pending.  
Current Goal: Confirm task completion.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm the task is complete.  
How to Achieve: Verify that the leg warmers are comfortably worn under the pants and that the overall appearance and fit meet the desired outcome.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the leg warmers are fully covered by the pants and not visible unless intended. Ensure the pants feel comfortable and allow free movement without restricting the leg warmers. Confirm the look aligns with the personal care and style goal by checking in a mirror or assessing comfort. If everything is satisfactory, the task is complete.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Wear leg warmers under pants.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate pants (loose in the leg) — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Wear leg warmers — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wear pants over leg warmers — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm task completion — Completed.  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The plan to wear leg warmers under pants is now fully executed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The plan is complete, as all subgoals have been achieved, and the final validation confirms the task's successful execution.
