### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create a plan for furniture arrangement.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the recorded measurements to sketch a room layout, test possible furniture arrangements, and select the best one with your helper’s input.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
On paper or using a digital tool, draw a scaled layout of the room based on the measurements. Mark fixed elements like doors and windows. Sketch possible furniture arrangements, considering accessibility and aesthetics. Discuss options with your helper to ensure practicality (e.g., bed not blocking pathways). Select the most functional and appealing layout.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the planned furniture arrangement is practical and feasible.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the selected layout to confirm it meets space constraints, accessibility needs, and aesthetic preferences.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the planned layout against the room’s measurements to ensure all furniture fits without overcrowding. Verify that pathways (e.g., to doors or windows) remain clear and that the arrangement aligns with your preferences (e.g., bed near a window for light). Discuss with your helper to confirm feasibility. Make minor adjustments if needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move the furniture according to the plan.  
**How to Achieve**: With your helper, physically move the furniture to match the finalized layout, ensuring safety and care to avoid damage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Clear the room of small items to create space. With your helper, carefully move each piece of furniture (e.g., bed, desk) to its designated spot in the planned layout. Use proper lifting techniques to avoid injury and protect floors or walls from scratches. Place furniture precisely as planned.  
[/IMP]
