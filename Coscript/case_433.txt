### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for deleting cookies using the Safari web browser by selecting the 'Clear History' option, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The framework includes Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions, with each step selecting one action from the set and formatting the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The script provided is:

1. Launch the Safari web browser.
2. Click on the Safari drop-down menu.
3. Select the Clear History… option.
4. Select how far back you want to clear your history.
5. Click the Clear History button.
6. Block cookies in the future.

The constraint is that the process must involve selecting the 'Clear History' option to delete cookies.
