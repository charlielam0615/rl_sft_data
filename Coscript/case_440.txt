**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for baking haddock in the oven, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The task must be completed in the oven, and the script includes four steps: (1) Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a baking dish, (2) Place the haddock in the baking dish and season with salt and pepper, (3) Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, and (4) Remove from the oven and serve. The plan must be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the sets Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To bake haddock in the oven, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare the oven and baking dish.  
2. Prepare and season the haddock.  
3. Bake the haddock.  
4. Finalize and serve the dish.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and will guide the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the oven and baking dish.  
**How to Achieve**: Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a baking dish to ensure it’s ready for the haddock.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Following the script, set the oven to 350°F and allow it to preheat. While the oven is heating, take a baking dish and apply a light coating of oil or butter to grease it, preventing the haddock from sticking during baking.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the oven and baking dish are properly prepared.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the oven has reached 350°F and the baking dish is adequately greased.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the oven’s temperature gauge indicates 350°F, confirming it is fully preheated. Inspect the baking dish to ensure it has a thin, even layer of grease (e.g., oil or butter) covering the surface to prevent sticking. If the oven is not at the correct temperature or the dish is not greased, adjust by waiting for the oven to heat or applying additional grease as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Prepare and season the haddock.  
**How to Achieve**: Place the haddock in the greased baking dish and season it with salt and pepper as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the haddock fillets and place them in the greased baking dish, ensuring they are arranged evenly without overlapping. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the fillets to season them, applying an even coating to enhance flavor.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Bake haddock in the oven.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking dish (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and season the haddock (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Bake the haddock (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize and serve the dish.  
**Current Goal**: Bake the haddock.  
The first two subgoals have been addressed: the oven is preheated to 350°F, the baking dish is greased, and the haddock is placed in the dish with seasoning applied. The next step is to bake the haddock, as outlined in the script.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Bake the haddock.  
**How to Achieve**: Place the baking dish with the seasoned haddock in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Carefully place the baking dish containing the seasoned haddock into the preheated 350°F oven. Set a timer for 20 to 25 minutes to ensure the haddock cooks for the appropriate duration, allowing it to reach a flaky, fully cooked texture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the haddock is properly baked.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the haddock after 20 to 25 minutes to confirm it is fully cooked and flaky.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After 20 to 25 minutes, remove the baking dish from the oven using oven mitts for safety. Test the haddock by gently inserting a fork into the thickest part; it should flake easily and appear opaque, indicating it is fully cooked. If not, return it to the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes and recheck.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Finalize and serve the dish.  
**How to Achieve**: Remove the haddock from the oven and serve it as specified in the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Once the haddock is confirmed to be fully cooked, remove the baking dish from the oven and place it on a heat-safe surface. Serve the haddock directly from the dish or transfer it to plates, optionally garnishing with fresh herbs or lemon wedges for added flavor, as desired.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Bake haddock in the oven.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the oven and baking dish (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and season the haddock (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Bake the haddock (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Finalize and serve the dish (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been successfully completed: the oven was preheated and the dish greased, the haddock was seasoned and placed in the dish, it was baked for 20 to 25 minutes and validated for doneness, and the dish was removed and served. The main goal of baking haddock in the oven is now complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Summarize key information related to the process of baking haddock in the oven to confirm all steps were followed correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- The process began by preheating the oven to 350°F and greasing a baking dish (Step 2).  
- The haddock was placed in the dish and seasoned with salt and pepper (Step 4).  
- The oven and dish preparation were validated to ensure readiness (Step 3).  
- The haddock was baked for 20 to 25 minutes, with doneness confirmed by checking for a flaky texture (Steps 6 and 7).  
- The dish was removed from the oven and served (Step 8).  
This summary confirms adherence to the script’s steps, ensuring the haddock was baked in the oven as required.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Note**: The planning case for baking haddock in the oven is complete, with all subgoals addressed and validated through the meta-cognitive action framework. The process followed the script, and the constraint of using the oven was met.
