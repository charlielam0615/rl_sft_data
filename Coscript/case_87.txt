**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Gather sufficient snow to work with.  
- **How to Achieve**: Locate a snowy area, use hands or a shovel to collect a substantial amount of snow, and ensure it’s suitable for packing (not too powdery).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find an open area with fresh, packable snow. Use gloves to protect hands from cold, and scoop snow with hands or a shovel into a pile large enough to form a snowman’s base and snowballs (approximately 2-3 cubic feet). Check that the snow sticks together when compressed.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Gather sufficient snow to work with.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the collected snow is adequate in quantity and quality for building a snowman.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the snow by squeezing a handful; it should hold its shape without crumbling. Ensure the pile contains enough snow (visually estimate 2-3 cubic feet) to form a base and at least three snowballs for the snowman’s body and head. If the snow is too dry or insufficient, gather more from a nearby area.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a pile of snow as the base.  
- **How to Achieve**: Shape the collected snow into a stable, wide base to support the snowman’s structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use hands or a shovel to mound the collected snow into a circular base, about 2-3 feet in diameter and 1-2 feet high. Pack the snow firmly by pressing down to ensure stability. Smooth the top slightly to prepare for placing snowballs.
