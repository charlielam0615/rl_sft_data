**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to simulate a "Be Polite in Person" scenario, adhering to the provided script of steps to achieve politeness in person, following the meta-cognitive action set (M) principles. The plan must incorporate the constraint "in person" and belong to the "Relationships" category. The script includes the following ordered steps: 1. Make eye contact, 2. Smile, 3. Shake hands, 4. Speak clearly, 5. Listen attentively, 6. Be aware of your body language, 7. Do not interrupt, 8. Avoid 'trash talk,' 9. Respect personal space, 10. Be patient. Each step of the planning process must select one action from the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, or Review) and follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for being polite in person, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals will correspond to the 10 steps in the script, ensuring each contributes to the overall objective of maintaining politeness during an in-person interaction. The subgoals are:  
1. Establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling.  
2. Build rapport through a handshake and clear speech.  
3. Foster mutual respect by listening attentively and maintaining appropriate body language.  
4. Avoid negative behaviors such as interrupting or trash talk.  
5. Maintain respect by honoring personal space and demonstrating patience.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Be polite in person during an interaction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling.  
  - Subgoal 2: Build rapport through a handshake and clear speech.  
  - Subgoal 3: Foster mutual respect by listening attentively and maintaining appropriate body language.  
  - Subgoal 4: Avoid negative behaviors such as interrupting or trash talk.  
  - Subgoal 5: Maintain respect by honoring personal space and demonstrating patience.  
**Current Goal**: Establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling. This will be achieved by implementing the first two steps of the script: making eye contact and smiling during the initial moments of an in-person interaction to convey warmth and approachability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To achieve positive initial contact:  
- **Make eye contact**: When greeting the person, maintain steady but non-intimidating eye contact to show confidence and engagement.  
- **Smile**: Offer a genuine smile to create a welcoming atmosphere and signal friendliness.  
These actions align with the "in person" constraint by focusing on non-verbal cues that are effective in face-to-face interactions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling. Validate that these actions were performed correctly and assess their effectiveness in creating a polite and positive first impression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate the actions:  
- Check if eye contact was maintained without staring (e.g., brief, natural glances).  
- Confirm the smile was genuine and well-received (e.g., the other person smiled back or appeared relaxed).  
- Assess the interaction’s tone: Did the person respond positively, such as by engaging in conversation or mirroring body language?  
If the validation shows the actions were not effective (e.g., the person seemed uncomfortable), adjustments may be needed in the next steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Be polite in person during an interaction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Build rapport through a handshake and clear speech.  
  - Subgoal 3: Foster mutual respect by listening attentively and maintaining appropriate body language.  
  - Subgoal 4: Avoid negative behaviors such as interrupting or trash talk.  
  - Subgoal 5: Maintain respect by honoring personal space and demonstrating patience.  
**Current Goal**: Build rapport through a handshake and clear speech.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to build rapport through a handshake and clear speech. This will be achieved by implementing steps 3 and 4 of the script: offering a firm handshake and speaking clearly to convey respect and clarity in communication.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To build rapport:  
- **Shake hands**: Offer a firm, brief handshake while maintaining eye contact to establish trust and respect. Ensure the handshake is appropriate to the cultural context.  
- **Speak clearly**: Use a calm, audible tone, articulate words, and avoid mumbling to ensure the other person understands and feels respected.  
These actions reinforce politeness in person by fostering clear and respectful communication.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Be polite in person during an interaction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Establish positive initial contact through eye contact and smiling. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Build rapport through a handshake and clear speech. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Foster mutual respect by listening attentively and maintaining appropriate body language.  
  - Subgoal 4: Avoid negative behaviors such as interrupting or trash talk.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to foster mutual respect by listening attentively and maintaining appropriate body language. This will be achieved by implementing steps 5 and 6 of the script: actively listening to the other person and being mindful of body language to show engagement and respect.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To foster mutual respect:  
- **Listen attentively**: Focus on the speaker’s words, nod occasionally, and avoid distractions to demonstrate genuine interest.  
- **Be aware of body language**: Maintain an open posture (e.g., uncrossed arms, leaning slightly forward) and avoid negative signals like looking away or fidgeting.  
These actions ensure politeness by showing the other person they are valued during the in-person interaction.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To avoid negative behaviors:  
- **Do not interrupt**: Allow the other person to finish speaking before responding, even if eager to contribute.  
- **Avoid 'trash talk'**: Refrain from negative, critical, or inappropriate comments about others, focusing instead on positive or neutral topics.  
These actions uphold politeness by ensuring the conversation remains respectful and constructive in person.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To maintain respect:  
- **Respect personal space**: Keep an appropriate distance (e.g., about an arm’s length) and avoid touching unless invited, respecting cultural norms.  
- **Be patient**: Allow the other person time to express themselves, avoid rushing the conversation, and remain calm even if the interaction is slow.  
These actions ensure the interaction remains polite and comfortable in person.  
[/IMP]
