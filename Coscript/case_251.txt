### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of fixing painful shoes by heating them up into intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to make tight or stiff shoes comfortable using heat-based methods. Subgoals include:  
1. Identify the specific issues causing discomfort (e.g., tightness in the toe area or overall stiffness).  
2. Gather necessary tools (e.g., hairdryer, thick socks, shoehorn).  
3. Apply heat-based techniques to stretch or soften the shoes.  
4. Test the shoes for comfort after treatment.  
5. Adjust the approach if the shoes remain uncomfortable.  
These subgoals provide a structured path to address the problem systematically.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals and highlighting the current one. Based on the previous [PLANNING] block, the goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main Goal**: Fix painful shoes by heating them up.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the specific issues causing discomfort (e.g., tightness in the toe area or overall stiffness).  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather necessary tools (e.g., hairdryer, thick socks, shoehorn).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply heat-based techniques to stretch or soften the shoes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the shoes for comfort after treatment.  
  - Subgoal 5: Adjust the approach if the shoes remain uncomfortable.  
**Current Goal**: Identify the specific issues causing discomfort.  
This provides context for the next steps, ensuring focus on diagnosing the problem before proceeding to implementation.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the specific issues causing discomfort in the shoes. This will be achieved by examining the shoes and considering the user’s experience (e.g., where the shoes feel tight or stiff) to determine the appropriate heat-based technique from the provided script.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify the issues, consider the following:  
- Put on the shoes and note specific areas of discomfort (e.g., toes, heels, or overall fit).  
- Check if the shoes are stiff (common in new leather or synthetic materials) or too tight in specific areas (e.g., toe box or sides).  
- Reference the script: Issues like overall stiffness suggest using a hairdryer to soften the material (script step 5), while tightness in the toe area suggests using a sock and hairdryer (script step 4).  
For example, if the toes feel cramped, the issue is tightness in the toe area. If the shoes feel rigid, the issue is stiffness. Let’s assume the primary issue is tightness in the toe area, as it aligns with script step 4, which will be addressed in the next steps.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Based on the identified issue (tightness in the toe area), refine the subgoals to focus on stretching the toe area using heat:  
1. Gather tools: hairdryer, thick socks, and a sock for stuffing the toe area.  
2. Apply heat to the toe area while wearing thick socks or stuffing the shoe.  
3. Test the fit of the toe area after heating.  
4. Repeat or adjust the heating process if the toe area remains tight.  
These subgoals align with script steps 3 and 4, ensuring the plan addresses the specific issue.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather tools (hairdryer, thick socks, and a sock for stuffing) to prepare for stretching the toe area of the shoes. This will be achieved by collecting the necessary items as outlined in the subgoals.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Hairdryer**: Locate a functioning hairdryer with adjustable heat settings to ensure controlled application of heat.  
- **Thick socks**: Find a pair of thick socks (e.g., wool or padded athletic socks) to wear during the heating process to stretch the shoe material.  
- **Sock for stuffing**: Select a clean sock to stuff into the toe area of the shoe as an alternative method (per script step 4).  
Ensure all tools are ready before proceeding to the heating step. For example, confirm the hairdryer is plugged in and the socks are clean and accessible.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply heat to the toe area of the shoes to stretch them, using the hairdryer and thick socks or a stuffed sock. This will be achieved by following script steps 3 and 4, focusing on controlled heat application to soften and expand the toe area.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Follow these steps to stretch the toe area:  
1. Wear thick socks and put on the tight shoes.  
2. Set the hairdryer to a medium heat setting to avoid damaging the shoe material.  
3. Direct the hairdryer at the toe area of the shoe for 20–30 seconds, keeping the dryer 6–8 inches away to evenly distribute heat (per script step 3).  
4. Flex your toes while heating to help stretch the material.  
5. Alternatively, stuff a sock into the toe area of the shoe and apply heat for 20–30 seconds (per script step 4).  
6. Remove the shoes and let them cool for 5–10 minutes while maintaining the stretched shape (e.g., keep the stuffed sock in place).  
This process softens the material and stretches the toe area to alleviate tightness.
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the stretching process by testing the fit of the shoes. This will be achieved by trying on the shoes after the heating process to confirm if the toe area feels more comfortable.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Try on the shoes without thick socks to assess the fit in the toe area.  
- Walk around for a few minutes to check for discomfort or remaining tightness.  
- Compare the current fit to the initial discomfort noted in Step 3. For example, if the toes no longer feel cramped, the process was successful.  
- If the toe area still feels tight, the stretching may need to be repeated or adjusted (e.g., use thicker socks or apply heat for a longer duration).  
Assume the toe area now feels noticeably more comfortable, indicating the stretching was effective.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update and review the goal hierarchy based on the progress made:  
- **Main Goal**: Fix painful shoes by heating them up.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the specific issues causing discomfort (completed: tightness in the toe area identified).  
  - Subgoal 2: Gather necessary tools (completed: hairdryer, thick socks, and sock for stuffing gathered).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply heat-based techniques to stretch or soften the shoes (completed: toe area stretched using hairdryer and socks).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the shoes for comfort after treatment (completed: toe area confirmed more comfortable).  
  - Subgoal 5: Adjust the approach if the shoes remain uncomfortable (not needed, as the fit is improved).  
**Current Goal**: No further subgoals required, as the main goal has been achieved for the toe area. If other areas (e.g., heels) are still uncomfortable, revisit subgoals.  
This confirms the plan has successfully addressed the toe area tightness.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of fixing painful shoes by addressing tightness in the toe area using heat-based methods. Retrieve information from previous steps relevant to this process to summarize the approach and ensure completeness.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 3 identified tightness in the toe area as the primary issue (script steps 3 and 4).  
- Step 5 gathered tools: hairdryer, thick socks, and a sock for stuffing.  
- Step 6 applied heat to the toe area by wearing thick socks or stuffing a sock, using a hairdryer for 20–30 seconds, and allowing the shoes to cool.  
- Step 7 validated the process by confirming improved comfort in the toe area.  
Summary: The shoes were successfully stretched in the toe area using a hairdryer and socks, aligning with script steps 3 and 4. No further issues (e.g., stiffness or tightness elsewhere) were reported, so the plan is complete.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Note
The plan to fix painful shoes by heating them up has been completed, focusing on tightness in the toe area. All subgoals were addressed, and the process was validated as successful. If additional issues arise (e.g., stiffness in other areas), the process can be repeated using script steps like 1 or 5, with similar meta-cognitive actions.
