### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Obtain NTPasswd on an accessible computer.  
- **How to Achieve**: Download and install the NTPasswd software from a reliable source on a computer that is accessible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
On an accessible computer with internet access, navigate to a trusted source (e.g., the official NTPasswd website or a reputable repository). Download the NTPasswd software package. Follow the provided instructions to install it, ensuring compatibility with the operating system of the accessible computer. Verify that the software is ready for the next step of creating bootable media.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure NTPasswd is correctly obtained.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the NTPasswd software was downloaded and installed correctly on the accessible computer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the NTPasswd software is installed by locating its executable or associated files on the accessible computer. Test launching the program (if applicable) to confirm it runs without errors. Check the file integrity (e.g., compare the download’s hash with the official source, if available) to ensure it’s not corrupted. Confirm that the software includes tools for creating bootable media.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a bootable CD/DVD or USB with NTPasswd.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the NTPasswd software to burn its image to a CD/DVD or USB flash drive, making it bootable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Insert a blank CD/DVD or USB flash drive into the accessible computer. Open the NTPasswd software and select the option to create a bootable media. Choose the CD/DVD or USB as the target device. Follow the software’s prompts to burn the NTPasswd image to the selected media, ensuring the process completes without errors. Safely eject the media and label it for clarity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the bootable media is correctly created.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test the CD/DVD or USB to ensure it was properly formatted and contains the NTPasswd bootable image.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Insert the created CD/DVD or USB into the accessible computer. Restart the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing a key like F2 or Delete during boot). Set the CD/DVD or USB as the primary boot device. Save changes and reboot to verify that the computer boots into the NTPasswd environment. If successful, the NTPasswd interface should load. Restore the BIOS settings afterward.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Boot the locked computer using the created media.  
- **How to Achieve**: Configure the locked computer to boot from the CD/DVD or USB containing NTPasswd.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Insert the bootable CD/DVD or USB into the locked Windows 7 computer. Restart the computer and access the BIOS/UEFI settings by pressing the appropriate key (e.g., F2, Delete, or F12). Set the CD/DVD or USB as the first boot device in the boot order. Save the changes and reboot. The computer should load the NTPasswd environment from the media.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Reset the password using NTPasswd.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the NTPasswd interface to select and reset the password for the target Windows 7 user account.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In the NTPasswd interface, select the Windows installation on the locked computer (usually located on the C: drive). Choose the user account whose password needs to be reset. Select the option to reset or blank the password. Follow the prompts to confirm the action, ensuring the password is cleared or set to a new value. Save the changes to the Windows SAM file as prompted by NTPasswd.  
[/IMP]
