  - Subgoal 1: Open the email application and access the specific email (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Select and copy the desired text from the email.  
  - Subgoal 3: Navigate to the target location for pasting.  
  - Subgoal 4: Paste the copied text into the target location.  
**Current Goal**: Select and copy the desired text from the email.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select and copy the desired text from the email. This will be achieved by tapping and holding the text to bring up the copy option and selecting "Copy."  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the text has been copied correctly. This will be achieved by ensuring the "Copy" action was successful, typically indicated by the menu disappearing or a brief visual cue.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
1. Confirm that the pop-up menu disappears after tapping "Copy."  
2. If the menu does not disappear or an error occurs, repeat the tap-and-hold action and select "Copy" again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Copy and paste text from an email on an iPhone or iPad.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open the email application and access the specific email (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Select and copy the desired text from the email (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Navigate to the target location for pasting.  
  - Subgoal 4: Paste the copied text into the target location.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the target location for pasting. This will be achieved by opening the app or location (e.g., a text field in another app) where the text will be pasted.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
1. Exit the Mail app by pressing the Home button or swiping up (depending on the device).

  - Subgoal 2: Select and copy the desired text from the email (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Navigate to the target location for pasting (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Paste the copied text into the target location (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The main goal of copying and pasting text from an email has been achieved.

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of copying and pasting text from an email on an iPhone or iPad. Retrieve a summary of the key steps and outcomes to confirm the process.
