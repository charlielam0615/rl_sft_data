**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Create a plan by selecting one action per step, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and using the provided script and constraint to guide the process until all planning steps are completed.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of identifying woodworm by checking for holes in wood into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify small, perfectly round holes in the wood.  
2. Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood.  
3. Inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood.  
4. Look for wood shavings or dust near holes.  
5. Identify tiny holes in the wood.  
These subgoals will guide the inspection process to confirm woodworm presence.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify small, perfectly round holes in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 4: Look for wood shavings or dust near holes.  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify tiny holes in the wood.  
**Current Goal**: Identify small, perfectly round holes in the wood (Subgoal 1).  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, providing context for the inspection process.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify small, perfectly round holes in the wood. This will be achieved by visually inspecting wooden surfaces for small, circular holes typically associated with woodworm activity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the wooden surfaces closely using a flashlight or magnifying glass to spot small, perfectly round holes, typically 1-2 mm in diameter. These holes are exit points created by woodworm larvae. Note any findings for further analysis.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the findings from identifying small, perfectly round holes. This will be achieved by confirming the holes match woodworm characteristics and checking for consistency across the wood.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the identified holes are small, perfectly round, and approximately 1-2 mm in diameter, consistent with woodworm exit holes. Check multiple areas of the wood to ensure the holes are not isolated or caused by other factors, such as nails or mechanical damage.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Combine Subgoals 1 and 5 (identifying small, perfectly round holes and tiny holes) into a single subgoal, as both involve inspecting for small holes indicative of woodworm. The adjusted subgoals are:  
1. Identify small, round holes (including tiny holes) in the wood.  
2. Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood.  
3. Inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood.  
4. Look for wood shavings or dust near holes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify small, round holes (including tiny holes) in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood.  
  - Subgoal 4: Look for wood shavings or dust near holes.  
**Current Goal**: Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood (Subgoal 2).  
This updated hierarchy reflects the adjusted subgoals, focusing on the next step of the inspection process.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood. This will be achieved by inspecting wooden surfaces for holes that are not perfectly round and may indicate different types of wood-boring pests or advanced woodworm damage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the wood for larger holes with irregular shapes, which may be greater than 2 mm and non-circular. Use a flashlight to examine hidden areas, such as corners or joints, where such holes may be more prevalent. Document the size and shape of any holes found.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify larger, irregularly shaped holes. Retrieve past information related to the characteristics of holes caused by woodworm or other wood-boring pests to support the current inspection.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps identified small, perfectly round holes (1-2 mm) as typical woodworm exit holes. Larger, irregularly shaped holes may indicate other wood-boring pests, such as beetles, or advanced woodworm damage. This information supports the current inspection by providing context for distinguishing hole types.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood. This will be achieved by examining the wood for visible chew marks or surface damage that may indicate woodworm activity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Closely inspect the wood surface for irregular chew marks, gnawing patterns, or rough textures that suggest pest activity. Focus on areas near identified holes to confirm whether the damage is consistent with woodworm behavior.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to look for wood shavings or dust near holes. This will be achieved by checking the area around identified holes for frass (wood dust), a key indicator of active woodworm infestation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the area beneath and around holes for fine wood shavings or powdery dust (frass). Use a brush or cloth to collect samples for closer inspection, noting the color and texture to confirm it matches woodworm frass characteristics.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify small, round holes (including tiny holes) in the wood (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify larger, irregularly shaped holes in the wood (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect for signs of chewing or gnawing in the wood (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Look for wood shavings or dust near holes (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed, completing the plan to identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to identify woodworm by checking for holes in wood has been completed by systematically addressing all subgoals from the provided script. The process involved planning subgoals, implementing inspections, validating findings, and reviewing progress, confirming the presence of woodworm through small round holes, larger irregular holes, chew marks, and frass.
