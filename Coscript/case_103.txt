  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the keyboard for cleaning by disconnecting and removing loose debris.  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a cleaning solution with water and soap.  
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the keyboard surfaces using a damp cloth.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove soap residue from the keyboard.  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the keyboard is dry before reconnecting.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the keyboard for cleaning by disconnecting and removing loose debris.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare the keyboard for cleaning by disconnecting and removing loose debris.  
- **How to Achieve**: Unplug the keyboard from the computer to ensure safety and shake it upside down to dislodge any loose debris.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Unplug the Razer Blackwidow Keyboard from the computer to prevent electrical damage. Flip the keyboard upside down and gently shake it to remove loose debris such as dust or crumbs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the keyboard is properly prepared for cleaning.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the keyboard is unplugged and check that no significant debris remains after shaking.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Confirm the keyboard is disconnected from the computer by checking the cable. Inspect the keyboard surface and crevices to ensure most loose debris has been removed after shaking. If debris remains, repeat the shaking process or use a soft brush to dislodge it.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Create a cleaning solution with water and soap.  
- **How to Achieve**: Fill a bowl with lukewarm water and add a drop of dish soap to create a mild cleaning solution.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Fill a bowl with lukewarm water (not hot to avoid damaging the keyboard). Add one drop of mild dish soap and stir gently to create a soapy solution suitable for cleaning.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Clean the keyboard surfaces using a damp cloth.  
- **How to Achieve**: Submerge a clean cloth in the soapy water, wring it out, and wipe down the keys and body of the keyboard.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Submerge a clean, lint-free cloth in the soapy water prepared in the previous step. Wring out the cloth thoroughly to ensure it is only damp, not dripping. Wipe down each key and the body of the Razer Blackwidow Keyboard, focusing on areas with visible dirt or grime.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the keyboard surfaces are clean.  
- **How to Achieve**: Inspect the keyboard for remaining dirt or grime and confirm the cloth was appropriately damp to avoid water damage.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Examine the keyboardâ€™s keys and surfaces under good lighting to ensure no dirt or grime remains. Verify that the cloth used was damp but not overly wet, preventing water from seeping into the keyboard. If any areas are still dirty, repeat the wiping process with the damp cloth.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Remove soap residue from the keyboard.  
- **How to Achieve**: Rinse the cloth in clean water, wring it out, and wipe the keyboard to remove any soap residue.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rinse the cloth used previously in clean, lukewarm water to remove soap. Wring it out thoroughly to ensure it is damp. Wipe down the keys and body of the keyboard to remove any remaining soap residue.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the keyboard is dry before reconnecting.  
- **How to Achieve**: Allow the keyboard to air dry completely to prevent electrical damage when plugging it back in.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Place the Razer Blackwidow Keyboard in a well-ventilated area and let it air dry completely for at least 12-24 hours. Ensure no moisture remains by checking the keys and crevices before plugging it back into the computer.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the keyboard is fully dry and ready to use.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check for any moisture and test the keyboard by plugging it in to ensure it functions properly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the keyboard for any signs of moisture, especially in crevices or under keys. Plug the keyboard into the computer and test a few keys to confirm it functions correctly without any electrical issues. If moisture is detected or the keyboard malfunctions, allow more drying time or consult a professional.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Clean a Razer Blackwidow Keyboard with water.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the keyboard for cleaning by disconnecting and removing loose debris (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Create a cleaning solution with water and soap (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the keyboard surfaces using a damp cloth (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove soap residue from the keyboard (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the keyboard is dry before reconnecting (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The cleaning process is complete, with all subgoals successfully achieved. The keyboard should now be clean and functional.  
[/REVIEW]

**Summary**: The plan to clean a Razer Blackwidow Keyboard with water has been completed by breaking down the task into subgoals, implementing each step, validating progress, and reviewing the goal hierarchy. The keyboard is now clean, dry, and ready for use.
