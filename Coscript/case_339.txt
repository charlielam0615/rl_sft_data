### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for removing the VisualBee extension from the Safari browser, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The constraint is that the solution must apply specifically to Safari. The script provides three steps: open Safari and access the Safari menu, go to Preferences, and navigate to the Extensions tab to delete the VisualBee extension. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To remove VisualBee from Safari, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Access the Safari menu to begin the process.  
2. Open the Preferences window to locate extension settings.  
3. Navigate to the Extensions tab and remove VisualBee.  
These subgoals align with the script and provide a structured path to achieve the final goal.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals. The goals, based on the recent planning, are:  
- **Main Goal**: Remove VisualBee from Safari.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Access the Safari menu to begin the process.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Open the Preferences window to locate extension settings.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Navigate to the Extensions tab and remove VisualBee.  
**Current Goal**: Access the Safari menu to begin the process.  
This hierarchy ensures focus on the first actionable step while keeping the overall objective in context.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the Safari menu to begin the process of removing VisualBee. This will be achieved by opening the Safari browser and locating the Safari menu in the menu bar.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open the Safari browser on your Mac. In the top-left corner of the screen, locate the menu bar and click on the "Safari" menu to open its dropdown options.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the Safari menu has been accessed correctly. This will be achieved by verifying that the Safari menu dropdown is visible and contains options like Preferences.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check that the Safari menu dropdown is open and displays options such as "New Window," "Preferences," and "History." If the menu is visible and includes these options, the first subgoal has been successfully completed. If not, ensure Safari is active and try clicking the "Safari" menu again.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to open the Preferences window to locate extension settings. This will be achieved by selecting the Preferences option from the Safari menu.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Safari menu dropdown, click on "Preferences" to open the Preferences window. This will display various tabs, including General, Tabs, and Extensions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the Preferences window is open and displays the correct settings. This will be achieved by checking that the Preferences window is visible and includes the Extensions tab.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the Preferences window is open and that the Extensions tab is visible in the toolbar at the top of the window. If the window is open but the Extensions tab is not visible, ensure you are in the correct window and that Safari is updated. If the Preferences window did not open, return to the Safari menu and select "Preferences" again.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the Extensions tab and remove the VisualBee extension. This will be achieved by selecting the Extensions tab in the Preferences window and deleting the VisualBee extension.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Preferences window, click on the "Extensions" tab to view all installed extensions. Locate the VisualBee extension in the list. Select it and click the "Uninstall" or "Remove" button to delete the VisualBee extension from Safari. Confirm any prompts to complete the removal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the VisualBee extension has been successfully removed from Safari. This will be achieved by checking the Extensions tab to ensure VisualBee is no longer listed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the Extensions tab of the Preferences window, verify that the VisualBee extension is no longer listed. If it is still present, repeat the removal process by selecting VisualBee and clicking "Uninstall" or "Remove." If it is not listed, the extension has been successfully removed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update and review the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Remove VisualBee from Safari (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Access the Safari menu to begin the process (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Open the Preferences window to locate extension settings (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Navigate to the Extensions tab and remove VisualBee (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been completed.  
This confirms that the plan to remove VisualBee from Safari has been fully executed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to summarize the steps taken to remove VisualBee from Safari to ensure completeness. Retrieve relevant information from previous steps related to the removal process.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The process to remove VisualBee from Safari involved:  
- Accessing the Safari menu (Step 3).  
- Opening the Preferences window (Step 5).  
- Navigating to the Extensions tab and removing VisualBee (Step 7).  
- Validating each step to ensure correct execution (Steps 4, 6, 8).  
All subgoals were completed, and the VisualBee extension was successfully removed, as confirmed in Step 8.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Summary
The plan to remove VisualBee from Safari has been completed through a series of meta-cognitive actions, including forward subgoaling to define steps, implementing and validating each step, and reviewing the goal hierarchy and process. The final validation confirms that VisualBee is no longer present in Safariâ€™s Extensions tab, fulfilling the main goal.
