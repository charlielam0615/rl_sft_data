### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1, and highlight the current goal.  
- **Goal**: Make model horse jumps with obstacles  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and prepare the location for the jumps, including setting up stable jump bases.  
  - Subgoal 2: Construct jumps with appropriate height and width for the model horse.  
  - Subgoal 3: Incorporate obstacles (e.g., poles, barrels, cones, or gates) into the jump setup.  
  - Subgoal 4: Test the setup by placing the model horse at the starting point and evaluating performance.  
**Current Goal**: Identify and prepare the location for the jumps, including setting up stable jump bases.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and prepare the location for the jumps, including setting up stable jump bases.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a flat, stable surface (e.g., a table or floor) suitable for the model horse course, measure the area to ensure sufficient space, and set up jump bases using sturdy materials like wood or plastic to ensure stability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a flat surface, such as a table or a section of the floor, ensuring it is free of clutter and provides enough space for multiple jumps (e.g., at least 2–3 feet long for a small course). Measure the area to confirm it can accommodate the planned jumps and obstacles. For jump bases, use materials like small wooden blocks, plastic stands, or model horse jump kits, ensuring they are wide and heavy enough to prevent tipping. Secure the bases firmly to the surface, possibly using non-slip mats or adhesive putty for added stability. Arrange the bases in a layout that allows the model horse to navigate a clear path, such as a straight line or a simple circuit.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the stability and suitability of the jump bases and location.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the jump bases for stability by applying gentle pressure and ensure the location allows a clear path for the model horse to navigate without obstructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test each jump base by gently pushing it to confirm it does not tip or shift. Verify that the surface is level by placing a small object (e.g., a marble) on it to ensure it doesn’t roll. Walk through the planned path with a finger or a small object representing the model horse to confirm there are no unintended obstacles or tight spaces that could interfere with the course. Adjust base positions if needed to maintain a clear and safe path for the model horse.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals based on the setup from Step 3 and validation in Step 4.  
- Subgoal 1: Completed – Location identified, and stable jump bases set up.  
- Subgoal 2: Construct jumps with appropriate height and width, ensuring they attach securely to the stable bases.  
- Subgoal 3: Add obstacles (e.g., poles, barrels, cones, or gates) that integrate with the jumps and maintain course safety.  
- Subgoal 4: Test the entire setup with the model horse to ensure functionality.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Construct jumps with appropriate height and width, ensuring they attach securely to the stable bases.  
**How to Achieve**: Use lightweight materials like dowels or plastic rods for jump bars, measure the model horse to determine suitable jump dimensions, and attach bars securely to the bases.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Measure the model horse’s height and leg length (typically 3–6 inches for standard model horses) to determine jump height (e.g., 1–2 inches for beginners) and width (e.g., 4–6 inches to allow clearance). Use lightweight materials like wooden dowels, plastic rods, or craft sticks for jump bars. Attach bars to the bases using slots, clips, or glue, ensuring they are secure but adjustable. For example, if using wooden bases, carve small notches to hold dowels. Space jumps appropriately (e.g., 12–18 inches apart) to allow the model horse to approach and clear each jump comfortably. Test attachment by lightly tapping the bars to ensure they stay in place.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add obstacles such as poles, barrels, cones, or gates that integrate with the jumps and maintain course safety.  
**How to Achieve**: Select obstacles that complement the jumps, ensure they are appropriately sized, and place them to enhance challenge without compromising safety.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose obstacles like small plastic cones, miniature barrels, or lightweight poles (available in model horse kits or crafted from household items like straws or bottle caps). Ensure obstacles are proportional to the model horse (e.g., cones no taller than the horse’s shoulder). Place obstacles strategically, such as a pole on the ground before a jump or a cone to the side to guide the path, ensuring they don’t block the horse’s approach or landing. For example, place a barrel 2 inches to the side of a jump to create a visual challenge. Secure obstacles to prevent tipping, using adhesive putty if needed. Verify that the course remains navigable by simulating the horse’s path.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Test the entire setup with the model horse to ensure functionality.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information from previous steps related to the setup of the jump bases, jumps, and obstacles to ensure the test accounts for all components.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 3: The jump bases are set up on a flat, stable surface with sufficient space, using sturdy materials like wooden blocks or plastic stands, arranged in a clear path.  
- From Step 6: Jumps are constructed with lightweight bars (e.g., dowels or craft sticks), sized appropriately (1–2 inches high, 4–6 inches wide), and securely attached to bases.  
- From Step 7: Obstacles (e.g., cones, barrels, poles) are proportional, strategically placed to enhance challenge, and secured to maintain safety.  
This information ensures the test in the next step accounts for a stable, appropriately sized, and safe course layout.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Test the setup by placing the model horse at the starting point and evaluating performance.  
**How to Achieve**: Position the model horse at the course’s starting point, simulate its movement through the jumps and obstacles, and assess whether it can navigate the course effectively.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the model horse at the designated starting point of the course, ensuring it faces the first jump. Simulate the horse’s movement by gently guiding it (manually or with a tool like a string for realistic motion) through each jump and past obstacles. Observe whether the horse can clear the jumps (1–2 inches high, 4–6 inches wide) without knocking over bars or obstacles. Check that the path remains clear and that obstacles (e.g., cones or barrels) don’t interfere with movement. Note any issues, such as unstable jumps or misplaced obstacles, and adjust as needed (e.g., reposition a cone or lower a jump bar). If the horse completes the course successfully, the setup is functional.  
[/IMP]
