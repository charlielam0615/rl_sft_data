### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Prepare the cleaning solution by filling the vase with water and adding the juice of half a lemon.  
- **How to Achieve**: Fill the vase with water to an appropriate level, cut a lemon in half, squeeze the juice from one half into the water, and stir to mix.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve Subgoal 1, take a clean vase and fill it with water to about three-quarters full. Cut a fresh lemon in half, squeeze the juice from one half into the water, and stir gently to ensure the lemon juice is evenly distributed in the water. This prepares the cleaning solution as per the script.
[/IMP]

If stains or residue remain, repeat the entire process (fill with water and lemon juice, soak, rinse) as necessary.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the vase is clean after rinsing.  
- **How to Achieve**: Visually inspect the vase for any remaining stains or residue and ensure it is clean.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the vase under good lighting to ensure no stains, residue, or lemon scent remain. Run a clean cloth or finger along the interior to confirm smoothness and cleanliness. If any dirt or stains persist, note that the process needs to be repeated.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Evaluate the need to repeat the cleaning process based on the validation outcome. If the vase is clean, no further subgoals are needed. If stains persist, adjust Subgoal 3 to repeat the cleaning cycle:  
- Adjusted Subgoal 3: Repeat the cleaning process (prepare solution, soak, rinse) until the vase is clean.  
This adjustment ensures the constraint of using lemon is maintained while addressing persistent stains.
[/PLANNING]
