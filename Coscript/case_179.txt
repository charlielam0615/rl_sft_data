  - Subgoal 8: Emphasize evacuating and not re-entering during a fire.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure matches and lighters are inaccessible to children (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to ensure matches and lighters are inaccessible to children. This will be achieved by identifying storage locations in the home and securing these items out of children’s reach.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check all areas of the home (kitchen, living room, bedrooms, etc.) for matches and lighters. Store them in a locked cabinet or a high shelf that children cannot access. Consider using childproof containers for added security. Verify that no matches or lighters are left in accessible places like drawers or countertops.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: Validate that matches and lighters are securely stored out of children’s reach by checking storage locations and ensuring they are inaccessible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the locked cabinet or high shelf to confirm that matches and lighters are stored properly. Test accessibility by ensuring a child cannot reach or open the storage area. If any items are found in accessible locations, relocate them immediately to a secure spot.  
[/IMP]

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to educate children about the dangers of fire. This will be achieved by conducting an age-appropriate discussion at home, using examples and visuals to explain fire risks.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather the children in a comfortable setting at home, such as the living room. Explain that fire can burn, spread quickly, and cause harm. Use simple examples, like a candle or stove, to show how fires start. Show pictures or videos (if available) of fire hazards to reinforce the lesson. Answer any questions to ensure understanding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to educating children about fire dangers, focusing on key points discussed in the previous implementation step.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Educate children about fire dangers.  
**Recalled Information**: The discussion included explaining that fire can burn, spread quickly, and cause harm, using examples like candles and stoves, and showing visuals to reinforce the lesson. The focus was on age-appropriate communication to ensure children understand fire risks.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: The current goal is to install and maintain smoke detectors. This will be achieved by checking for existing detectors, installing new ones if needed, and testing their functionality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the home to identify locations with smoke detectors (e.g., hallways, bedrooms). Install new detectors in key areas if none are present, following manufacturer instructions. Test all detectors by pressing the test button to ensure they work. Replace batteries if needed and schedule regular maintenance checks.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Map out two escape routes from each room in the home, ensuring clear paths to exits. Discuss the plan with the children, explaining how to stay low and move quickly. Conduct a practice drill, simulating a fire scenario with a safe signal (e.g., a whistle). Guide children to follow the routes and gather at a designated meeting point outside.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-Data**: Validate that the home fire drill is effective by reviewing the practice and ensuring children understand the escape plan.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Observe the children during a second practice drill to confirm they follow the escape routes correctly and reach the meeting point. Ask them to explain the plan to verify understanding. Address any confusion or obstacles (e.g., blocked exits) and adjust the plan if needed.
