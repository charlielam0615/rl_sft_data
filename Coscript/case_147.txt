**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to cut a kiwi using a spoon, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with the specified format. The task involves cutting a kiwifruit in half, scooping out the flesh with a spoon, and preparing it for consumption, constrained by using only a spoon.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of "cutting a kiwi with a spoon" into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Cut the kiwifruit in half.  
2. Insert a spoon into one half.  
3. Scoop out the flesh in a circular motion.  
4. Remove all flesh from the kiwifruit.  
5. Eat or serve the kiwifruit.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Cut a kiwi with a spoon and prepare it for consumption.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut the kiwifruit in half.  
  - Subgoal 2: Insert a spoon into one half.  
  - Subgoal 3: Scoop out the flesh in a circular motion.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove all flesh from the kiwifruit.  
  - Subgoal 5: Eat or serve the kiwifruit.  
**Current Goal**: Cut the kiwifruit in half.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the kiwifruit in half. Since the constraint specifies using a spoon, achieve this by applying pressure with the spoon’s edge to split the kiwi.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Hold the kiwifruit firmly on a stable surface. Use the edge of the spoon to press into the middle of the kiwi, applying steady pressure to cut through the skin and flesh until it splits into two halves.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the kiwifruit is properly cut in half. Check that the kiwi is divided into two roughly equal halves, with the flesh exposed for scooping.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the kiwifruit to confirm it is split into two halves. Ensure the cut is clean and the flesh is accessible. If the halves are uneven or not fully separated, apply additional pressure with the spoon to complete the cut.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update and list all goals:  
- Main Goal: Cut a kiwi with a spoon and prepare it for consumption.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut the kiwifruit in half (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Insert a spoon into one half.  
  - Subgoal 3: Scoop out the flesh in a circular motion.  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove all flesh from the kiwifruit.  
  - Subgoal 5: Eat or serve the kiwifruit.  
**Current Goal**: Insert a spoon into one half.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to insert a spoon into one half of the kiwifruit. Achieve this by positioning the spoon near the edge of the flesh to prepare for scooping.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Take one half of the kiwifruit and hold it steady. Position the spoon’s tip near the edge where the flesh meets the skin, then gently insert the spoon into the flesh.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to scoop out the flesh in a circular motion. Use the spoon to carve out the kiwi flesh by following the contour of the skin.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Move the spoon in a circular motion around the inside of the kiwi half, staying close to the skin to separate the flesh. Collect the scooped flesh in the spoon or a bowl.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the scooping process is effective. Check that the flesh is being removed cleanly without leaving significant amounts behind.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Examine the kiwi half to confirm that most of the flesh is being scooped out. If flesh remains stuck to the skin, adjust the spoon’s angle and continue scooping in a circular motion.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update and list all goals:  
- Main Goal: Cut a kiwi with a spoon and prepare it for consumption.  
  - Subgoal 1: Cut the kiwifruit in half (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Insert a spoon into one half (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Scoop out the flesh in a circular motion (In Progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove all flesh from the kiwifruit.  
  - Subgoal 5: Eat or serve the kiwifruit.  
**Current Goal**: Remove all flesh from the kiwifruit.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove all flesh from the kiwifruit. Continue scooping both halves until no edible flesh remains.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Repeat the scooping process for both kiwi halves, using the spoon in a circular motion to remove all remaining flesh. Collect the flesh in a bowl or directly for consumption.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm all flesh has been removed. Check both kiwi halves to ensure only the skin remains.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect both kiwi halves to verify that all edible flesh has been scooped out, leaving only the skin. If any flesh remains, scoop it out with the spoon.  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Consume the scooped kiwifruit flesh directly from the spoon or bowl, or place it in a serving dish for others to enjoy.

[REVIEW]  
Summarized information related to the current goal:  
- Step 3 and 4 confirmed the kiwi was cut in half using the spoon.  
- Steps 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 detailed the process of inserting the spoon, scooping the flesh, and validating that all flesh was removed.  
- The kiwi flesh is now fully scooped and ready for eating or serving.
