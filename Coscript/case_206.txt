**Problem Statement**: The task is to simulate a planning case for filleting a salmon using a knife, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The process must use a knife as a constraint and follow the ordered steps: rinse the salmon, place it on a cutting board, insert a knife behind the gill, slice along the length, cut along the backbone, continue slicing to the end, and repeat on the other side. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, and responses will be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and/or [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To fillet a salmon with a knife, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals:  
1. Prepare the salmon by rinsing it.  
2. Position the salmon correctly on a cutting board.  
3. Make initial cuts behind the gill.  
4. Slice along the fish’s length.  
5. Cut along the backbone.  
6. Complete the fillet on one side.  
7. Repeat the process on the other side.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Fillet a salmon with a knife.  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the salmon by rinsing it.  
  - Subgoal 2: Position the salmon correctly on a cutting board.  
  - Subgoal 3: Make initial cuts behind the gill.  
  - Subgoal 4: Slice along the fish’s length.  
  - Subgoal 5: Cut along the backbone.  
  - Subgoal 6: Complete the fillet on one side.  
  - Subgoal 7: Repeat the process on the other side.  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the salmon by rinsing it.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the salmon by rinsing it. This will be achieved by holding the salmon under cold running water to clean it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Hold the salmon under cold running water, ensuring all surfaces are thoroughly rinsed to remove any debris or slime.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the salmon has been properly rinsed. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the salmon to ensure it is clean and free of debris.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the salmon to verify that all surfaces are clean, with no remaining slime or debris. The fish should appear fresh and ready for cutting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position the salmon correctly on a cutting board. This will be achieved by placing the salmon on its side on a stable, non-slip cutting board.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the salmon on its side on a clean, stable cutting board, ensuring it is secure and does not slide.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make initial cuts behind the gill. Retrieve information related to the positioning and preparation steps to ensure the salmon is ready for cutting.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The salmon has been rinsed under cold water to remove debris (Step 3) and placed on its side on a stable cutting board (Step 5). These steps ensure the salmon is clean and properly positioned for the next cut behind the gill.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make initial cuts behind the gill. This will be achieved by using a sharp knife to insert into the flesh just behind the gill.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Hold a sharp knife and insert it into the salmon’s flesh just behind the gill, ensuring a steady and controlled motion to start the filleting process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the initial cut behind the gill is correct. This will be achieved by checking that the cut is clean and positioned accurately behind the gill.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Examine the cut to ensure it is clean, precise, and located just behind the gill, with no jagged edges or damage to the surrounding flesh.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to slice along the length of the fish. This will be achieved by guiding the knife smoothly along the salmon’s body from the initial cut toward the tail.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Guide the sharp knife along the length of the salmon, starting from the cut behind the gill and moving toward the tail, keeping the blade close to the backbone for a clean fillet.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut along the fish’s backbone. This will be achieved by adjusting the knife’s angle to follow the backbone closely while separating the flesh.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Turn the knife slightly to align with the salmon’s backbone and make a careful cut along its length, separating the flesh from the spine while minimizing waste.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the fillet on one side. This will be achieved by continuing the slice until reaching the other end of the fish, fully separating the fillet.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Continue slicing with the knife, following the backbone until the fillet is fully separated from the salmon, reaching the tail end.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the fillet on the first side is complete. This will be achieved by inspecting the separated fillet to ensure it is intact and properly cut.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the separated fillet to verify it is intact, with a smooth cut along the backbone and no remaining bones or excess flesh attached.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The remaining subgoal is to repeat the filleting process on the other side of the salmon. Adjust this subgoal to clarify that the process mirrors the steps used for the first side (insert knife behind gill, slice along length, cut along backbone, complete fillet).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fillet the other side of the salmon. This will be achieved by flipping the salmon and repeating the cutting process: insert knife behind gill, slice along length, cut along backbone, and complete the fillet.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Flip the salmon to its other side on the cutting board. Insert the sharp knife behind the gill, slice along the length, cut along the backbone, and continue until the second fillet is fully separated.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
