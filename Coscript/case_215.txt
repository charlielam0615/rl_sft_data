**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to install a tin tile backsplash without using mortar, adhering to the provided script and constraints, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action, and content will be organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format. The constraint is that no mortar is used, and the script provides an ordered list of steps to follow.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of installing a tin tile backsplash without mortar into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:
- Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles.
- Subgoal 2: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles.
- Subgoal 3: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall.
- Subgoal 4: Secure the tiles with nails.
- Subgoal 5: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**:
- **Main Goal**: Install a tin tile backsplash without mortar.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles (Not started).
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles (Not started).
  - Subgoal 3: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall (Not started).
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the tiles with nails (Not started).
  - Subgoal 5: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours (Not started).
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles. Achieve this by researching adhesive options suitable for tin tiles, considering factors like strength, compatibility with metal, and ease of application without mortar.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Research adhesive options for tin tiles. Suitable adhesives include construction adhesive (e.g., Liquid Nails or PL Premium) or double-sided adhesive tape designed for heavy-duty applications. Construction adhesive is strong, bonds well to metal and wall surfaces, and is easy to apply. Double-sided tape offers a cleaner application but may have lower bonding strength. For this project, choose a heavy-duty construction adhesive to ensure durability, as it aligns with the constraint of avoiding mortar and supports the subsequent steps of pressing and nailing tiles.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**:
- **Main Goal**: Install a tin tile backsplash without mortar.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles (Completed: Heavy-duty construction adhesive chosen).
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles (Not started).
  - Subgoal 3: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall (Not started).
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the tiles with nails (Not started).
  - Subgoal 5: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours (Not started).
**Current Goal**: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles. Achieve this by ensuring tiles are cut to size and applying the chosen construction adhesive evenly to the back of each tile.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Ensure tin tiles are cut to fit the backsplash area using tin snips or a similar tool, following precise measurements of the wall space. Clean the back of each tile to remove dust or grease. Apply a thin, even layer of heavy-duty construction adhesive to the back of each tile using a caulk gun or trowel, following the adhesive manufacturer’s instructions for application thickness and coverage.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the adhesive application process. Verify that the adhesive is applied correctly and tiles are ready for installation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect each tile to ensure the adhesive is applied evenly without gaps or excessive clumps. Confirm that the adhesive is fresh and within its working time (as specified by the manufacturer, typically 10-30 minutes). Verify that the wall surface is clean, dry, and smooth to ensure proper adhesion when tiles are pressed in the next step.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**:
- **Main Goal**: Install a tin tile backsplash without mortar.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall (Not started).
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the tiles with nails (Not started).
  - Subgoal 5: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours (Not started).
**Current Goal**: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to position and press the tin tiles onto the wall. Achieve this by carefully aligning tiles on the wall and pressing them firmly to ensure adhesion.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start at one corner of the backsplash area, aligning the first tile precisely with a level to ensure straight placement. Press the tile firmly against the wall for 10-15 seconds to secure the adhesive bond. Continue placing adjacent tiles, ensuring tight seams and consistent alignment. Use spacers if needed to maintain even gaps for aesthetic purposes.
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the tiles with nails. Achieve this by driving nails into the tiles at designated points to reinforce the adhesive bond.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use small finishing nails or decorative nails compatible with tin tiles. Drive nails into the edges or overlapping sections of the tiles, following the tile manufacturer’s recommendations for nail placement (typically every 6-12 inches). Ensure nails are driven flush with the tile surface to avoid protrusion while maintaining a secure hold.
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**:
- **Main Goal**: Install a tin tile backsplash without mortar.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate adhesive for tin tiles (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare and apply adhesive to the cut-out tin tiles (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Position and press the tin tiles onto the wall (Completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the tiles with nails (Completed).
  - Subgoal 5: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours (Not started).
**Current Goal**: Allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to allow the adhesive to dry for 24 hours. Achieve this by ensuring the tiles remain undisturbed during the drying period.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Avoid touching or applying pressure to the tiles for at least 24 hours, as specified by the adhesive manufacturer. Ensure the area is well-ventilated and maintained at a stable temperature (typically 60-80°F) to facilitate proper curing. Check the adhesive packaging for any specific drying conditions or recommendations.
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the adhesive has dried and the tiles are securely installed. Check the stability and adhesion of the tiles after the drying period.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After 24 hours, gently test the tiles by pressing lightly to ensure they are firmly attached to the wall. Inspect for any loose tiles or gaps. Confirm that nails are secure and the backsplash is level and visually consistent. If any tiles are loose, apply additional adhesive and nails as needed and allow further drying time.
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
