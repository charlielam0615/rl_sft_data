### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for uploading videos to Yahoo (specifically via Flickr) using a computer, following a provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and using the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate. The constraint is that the task must be performed on a computer, and the provided script outlines the steps to achieve the task.
