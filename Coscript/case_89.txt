### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for contacting YouTube to advertise by following a provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The script includes the following ordered steps: (1) Open the "Advertise with us" page, (2) Scroll down to the "Still have questions?" section, (3) Click the "contact us" link, (4) Fill out the form, and (5) Submit the form. The constraint is that the plan must focus on advertising, and the task falls under the category of Computers and Electronics. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the provided guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of contacting YouTube to advertise into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Access the YouTube advertising page.  
2. Locate the "Still have questions?" section.  
3. Navigate to the contact form via the "contact us" link.  
4. Complete the contact form with necessary details.  
5. Submit the form to initiate contact with YouTube's advertising team.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals identified in Step 1. The hierarchy is:  
- Main Goal: Contact YouTube to advertise  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the YouTube advertising page  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the "Still have questions?" section  
  - Subgoal 3: Navigate to the contact form via the "contact us" link  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete the contact form with necessary details  
  - Subgoal 5: Submit the form to initiate contact  
**Current Goal**: Access the YouTube advertising page  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to access the YouTube advertising page. This will be achieved by navigating to the official YouTube advertising page using a web browser.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open a web browser and go to the YouTube advertising page, typically found at a URL like "https://www.youtube.com/ads/" or by searching for "YouTube advertise with us" on a search engine to locate the official page. Ensure the page is relevant to advertising services.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the correct YouTube advertising page has been accessed. This will be achieved by verifying the page content and URL.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check that the loaded page contains information about YouTube advertising, such as options for ad formats, pricing, or a call to action for advertisers. Confirm the URL matches the official YouTube domain (e.g., "*.youtube.com/*"). If the page is incorrect, search again or navigate to the correct section via YouTube’s official site.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the process of accessing the YouTube advertising page and verifying its correctness, as performed in the previous steps. Retrieve relevant information to support the next subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to locate the "Still have questions?" section. Previous steps confirmed that the YouTube advertising page was accessed and validated. The page likely contains sections with advertising information and a contact option, typically found at the bottom or in a dedicated help area. This information guides the next step of scrolling to the "Still have questions?" section.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to locate the "Still have questions?" section on the YouTube advertising page. This will be achieved by scrolling through the page to find the relevant section.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Scroll down the YouTube advertising page to identify the "Still have questions?" section, which is typically located near the footer or in a help/support area. Look for a heading or link that matches this description.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to navigate to the contact form via the "contact us" link. This will be achieved by clicking the "contact us" link within the "Still have questions?" section.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Locate the "contact us" link within the "Still have questions?" section and click it to access the contact form for YouTube advertising inquiries. Ensure the link directs to an official YouTube contact page.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the correct contact form page has been reached. This will be achieved by verifying the form’s content and relevance to advertising inquiries.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that the page reached after clicking the "contact us" link contains a form for advertising inquiries, with fields like name, email, company, and advertising goals. Verify the page is hosted on an official YouTube domain. If incorrect, return to the previous page and try another link or search for the correct form.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the contact form with necessary details. This will be achieved by filling out all required fields with accurate information relevant to the advertising inquiry.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fill out the contact form with details such as:  
- Name: [Your full name]  
- Email: [Your business email]  
- Company: [Your company name, if applicable]  
- Inquiry: Specify interest in YouTube advertising, including ad type (e.g., video ads, display ads) and goals (e.g., brand awareness, conversions).  
Ensure all required fields are completed accurately.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to submit the contact form to initiate contact with YouTube’s advertising team. This will be achieved by clicking the submit button on the form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the filled form for accuracy, then click the "Submit" button to send the advertising inquiry to YouTube’s team. Look for a confirmation message or email indicating successful submission.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Review the goal hierarchy to confirm completion:  
- Main Goal: Contact YouTube to advertise  
  - Subgoal 1: Access the YouTube advertising page (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the "Still have questions?" section (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Navigate to the contact form via the "contact us" link (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Complete the contact form with necessary details (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Submit the form to initiate contact (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The plan to contact YouTube for advertising has been fully executed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to contact YouTube to advertise has been completed by following the provided script and using the meta-cognitive action set. All subgoals were addressed, and the final submission of the contact form marks the successful completion of the task. If further actions are needed (e.g., responding to YouTube’s reply), a new plan can be developed.
