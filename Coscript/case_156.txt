### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of resolving the rat infestation into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify and contact the appropriate city department (animal control or health department).  
- Subgoal 2: Inquire about assistance for rat removal in the apartment building.  
- Subgoal 3: Follow the city’s advice to address the infestation.  
- Subgoal 4: Persist with the recommended actions until the rats are eliminated.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated from the forward subgoaling action.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Resolve rat infestation in the apartment building by contacting the city.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and contact the appropriate city department (animal control or health department). *(Current Goal)*  
  - Subgoal 2: Inquire about assistance for rat removal in the apartment building.  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the city’s advice to address the infestation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Persist with the recommended actions until the rats are eliminated.  
**Current Goal**: Identify and contact the appropriate city department.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify and contact the appropriate city department (animal control or health department).  
- **How to Achieve**: Search for the contact information of the city’s animal control or health department and make the call to initiate the process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the current goal, I will assume a generic U.S. city context since no specific location is provided. Typically, cities have a health department or animal control service accessible via a public hotline or website. For example, a common approach is to call 311 (a non-emergency city service line in many U.S. cities) or search online for “[City Name] health department” or “[City Name] animal control.”  

Action:  
1. Dial 311 or visit the city’s official website (e.g., www.[cityname].gov) to find the contact number for the health department or animal control.  
2. Confirm the correct department handles rat infestations in residential buildings.  
3. Make the call to report the issue and gather further instructions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the contact made with the city department is valid and appropriate for addressing the rat infestation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the contacted department is responsible for rat infestations and confirm they have received the report.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the action taken in Step 3:  
1. During the call, confirm with the representative that their department handles rat infestations in apartment buildings.  
2. Ensure the representative acknowledges the report and provides a case number, next steps, or a timeline for action (if applicable).  
3. If the wrong department was contacted, request redirection to the correct one (e.g., from 311 to the health department).  
Outcome: The contact is valid if the department confirms responsibility and provides guidance or a follow-up plan.  
[/IMP]
