### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making natural toilet bombs as an alternative to commercial toilet cleaners, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The process must be broken down into steps, with each step selecting one action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and the content must be organized within the appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as per the provided guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making natural toilet bombs into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Mix dry ingredients (baking soda and citric acid).  
2. Prepare a liquid solution (hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar in a spray bottle).  
3. Combine the dry and liquid mixtures by spritzing.  
4. Add essential oils for fragrance.  
5. Shape the mixture into toilet bombs.  
6. Finalize the bombs by spraying additional solution.  
7. Dry the toilet bombs.  
8. Store the toilet bombs in a container.  
9. Use the toilet bombs as a cleaning alternative.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1, and highlight the current goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Make natural toilet bombs as an alternative to toilet cleaners  
  - Subgoal 1: Mix dry ingredients (baking soda and citric acid)  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare a liquid solution (hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar)  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine dry and liquid mixtures by spritzing  
  - Subgoal 4: Add essential oils for fragrance  
  - Subgoal 5: Shape the mixture into toilet bombs  
  - Subgoal 6: Finalize the bombs by spraying additional solution  
  - Subgoal 7: Dry the toilet bombs  
  - Subgoal 8: Store the toilet bombs in a container  
  - Subgoal 9: Use the toilet bombs as needed  

**Current Goal:** Mix dry ingredients (baking soda and citric acid).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to mix the dry ingredients (baking soda and citric acid). This will be achieved by combining these ingredients in a bowl to form the base mixture for the toilet bombs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a bowl, combine baking soda and citric acid in appropriate proportions (e.g., 1 cup baking soda to 1/2 cup citric acid) and mix thoroughly to ensure an even distribution. This forms the dry base for the toilet bombs, which will react with the liquid components later to create the fizzing effect.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the dry ingredients (baking soda and citric acid) are properly mixed. This will be achieved by checking the consistency and uniformity of the mixture.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the mixture to ensure it is well-blended with no clumps or uneven patches. The mixture should appear uniform in texture and color, indicating that the baking soda and citric acid are evenly distributed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare the liquid solution. This will be achieved by combining hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar in a spray bottle for application to the dry mixture.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar (e.g., equal parts, such as 1/4 cup each) into a spray bottle. Secure the spray nozzle and gently shake to combine the liquids, creating a solution ready for spritzing onto the dry mixture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to combine the dry and liquid mixtures. This will be achieved by spritzing the hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution onto the baking soda and citric acid mixture to form a moldable consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lightly spritz the baking soda and citric acid mixture with the hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution from the spray bottle. Mix gently after each spritz to achieve a damp, moldable texture, similar to wet sand, without triggering the fizzing reaction excessively.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to add essential oils for fragrance. This will be achieved by incorporating 15 to 20 drops of essential oil into the mixture to enhance the scent of the toilet bombs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add 15 to 20 drops of essential oil (e.g., lavender, tea tree, or peppermint for a fresh scent) to the damp mixture. Stir thoroughly to distribute the oil evenly, ensuring the toilet bombs have a pleasant fragrance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to shape the mixture into toilet bombs. This will be achieved by spooning the mixture onto a baking sheet to form individual bombs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Spoon the mixture onto a baking sheet, forming small, rounded shapes (e.g., using a tablespoon or small mold) to create individual toilet bombs. Ensure the bombs are compact but not overly compressed to maintain their structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to finalize the toilet bombs. This will be achieved by spraying the shaped bombs with the remaining hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution to enhance their stability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Lightly spray the shaped toilet bombs on the baking sheet with the remaining hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution. Apply just enough to moisten the surface, aiding in forming a slight crust for stability without causing excessive fizzing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to dry the toilet bombs. This will be achieved by allowing the bombs to air-dry completely to ensure they harden and maintain their shape.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the toilet bombs sit on the baking sheet in a dry, well-ventilated area for 24â€“48 hours, or until they are completely dry and hard to the touch. Check periodically to ensure they are drying evenly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to store the toilet bombs. This will be achieved by placing the dried bombs in a suitable container for use as a toilet cleaner alternative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the dried toilet bombs in an airtight container, such as a glass jar or plastic tub, to protect them from moisture and ensure they remain effective for future use.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to use the toilet bombs as needed. Retrieve information related to the purpose and usage of the toilet bombs as an alternative to commercial cleaners.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The toilet bombs are designed as a natural alternative to commercial toilet cleaners, utilizing baking soda, citric acid, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and essential oils to create a fizzing, cleaning effect. Previous steps outlined mixing dry ingredients (Step 3), preparing a liquid solution (Step 5), combining them (Step 6), adding fragrance (Step 7), shaping (Step 8), finalizing (Step 9), drying (Step 10), and storing (Step 11). The bombs are now ready for use by dropping one into the toilet bowl, allowing it to fizz and clean, and scrubbing as needed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to use the toilet bombs as a cleaning alternative. This will be achieved by deploying the bombs in the toilet bowl to clean effectively.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Drop one toilet bomb into the toilet bowl. Allow it to fizz and dissolve, releasing cleaning agents. Scrub the bowl with a toilet brush if necessary, then flush to complete the cleaning process. Repeat as needed for regular toilet maintenance.  
[/IMP]
