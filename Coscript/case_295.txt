### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making a latte without using a machine, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review). The latte must be prepared using a stovetop espresso maker, heating milk on the stove, frothing it manually, and combining it with brewed coffee. The process must be broken down into actionable steps, with each step using one meta-cognitive action (Planning: Forward Subgoaling, Backward Subgoaling, Adjust Subgoals, Backtrack; Implementation: Reach Goal, Validation; Review: Track Goals, Recall Info). Each step will be formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as required, based on the action’s category.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the stovetop espresso maker is correctly prepared.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check that the water level, coffee grounds, and assembly are correct to avoid brewing issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the preparation:  
- Confirm the water level is at or below the safety valve to prevent overpressure.  
- Ensure the coffee grounds are evenly distributed and not overpacked.  
- Check that the top and bottom chambers are tightly screwed together to avoid leaks.  
If any issues are found, adjust by refilling water, leveling coffee, or reassembling. The setup is valid and ready for brewing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Heat milk on the stove.  
- **How to Achieve:** Warm milk in a saucepan over low heat to avoid scalding, preparing it for frothing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour ½ to ¾ cup of milk (depending on mug size) into a small saucepan. Place it on the stove over low to medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Heat until the milk is steaming but not boiling (about 150–160°F or when small bubbles form at the edges). Remove from heat.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Froth the milk manually.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a whisk or a handheld frother to aerate the heated milk, creating foam.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour the heated milk into a wide, shallow container for easier frothing. Use a handheld whisk or a manual frother to vigorously whisk the milk for 1–2 minutes until it develops a frothy texture with small bubbles. Alternatively, shake the milk in a sealed jar for 30–60 seconds to create foam. Set aside the frothed milk.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Reviewing the script, the original subgoal “Pour the milk into the espresso maker” (Step 5 in the script) is incorrect for a latte, as frothed milk is typically poured into the coffee, not the espresso maker. Adjust Subgoal 5 to: “Pour the brewed coffee into a mug and add the frothed milk.” The updated subgoals are:  
- Subgoal 1: Prepare the stovetop espresso maker for brewing (Completed).  
- Subgoal 2: Heat the espresso maker to brew coffee (Completed).  
- Subgoal 3: Heat milk on the stove (Completed).  
- Subgoal 4: Froth the milk manually (Completed).  
- Subgoal 5: Pour the brewed coffee into a mug and add the frothed milk.  
- Subgoal 6: Serve the final latte in a mug.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Pour the brewed coffee into a mug and add the frothed milk.  
- **How to Achieve:** Pour the coffee from the espresso maker into a mug, then gently add the frothed milk to create a latte.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour the brewed coffee from the stovetop espresso maker’s top chamber into a mug, filling it about one-third full. Slowly pour the frothed milk over the coffee, using a spoon to hold back the foam initially, then spoon the foam on top to finish the latte.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the latte is correctly prepared.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the coffee-to-milk ratio, foam quality, and overall presentation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the latte:  
- Confirm the mug contains a balanced ratio of about one part coffee to two parts milk.  
- Check that the milk foam forms a creamy layer on top.  
- Ensure the latte is visually appealing with no curdling or separation.  
If the ratio or foam is off, adjust by adding more milk or frothing additional milk. The latte meets the criteria for a proper latte.  
[/IMP]
