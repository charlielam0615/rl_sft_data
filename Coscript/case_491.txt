### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for holding a wine glass in the left hand, adhering to the provided script and constraint, and using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to create a complete plan. The constraint specifies that the wine glass must be held in the left hand, and the script provides a sequence of steps: (1) Place your left hand on the table, (2) Grasp the stem of the glass with your right hand, (3) Use your thumb and first two fingers to hold the stem, (4) Place your middle finger on the base of the glass for support. The plan must be developed systematically, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the provided guidelines.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the right hand to securely grasp the wine glass by the stem, as outlined in the script’s second step. This will be achieved by carefully gripping the stem with the right hand to lift the glass.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Grasp the stem of the wine glass with the right hand, ensuring a firm but gentle grip to avoid tipping or damaging the glass. Lift the glass slightly off the table to prepare for adjusting the grip.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to adjust the right hand’s grip for stability, as per the script’s third step. This will be achieved by positioning the thumb and first two fingers on the stem for a secure hold.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Position the thumb and first two fingers (index and middle) of the right hand around the stem of the wine glass, ensuring a balanced and stable grip while keeping the glass steady.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to further stabilize the right hand’s grip, as per the script’s fourth step. This will be achieved by placing the middle finger on the base of the glass for additional support.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Place the middle finger of the right hand on the base of the wine glass, providing extra support to the grip while maintaining the thumb and index finger on the stem. Ensure the glass remains steady and upright.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The original subgoals assumed the glass would be transferred to the left hand, but the script primarily describes the right hand’s actions. Adjust the subgoals to incorporate transferring the glass to the left hand to meet the constraint:  
- Updated Subgoal 1: Position the left hand appropriately (completed).  
- Updated Subgoal 2: Use the right hand to securely grasp the wine glass by the stem (completed).  
- Updated Subgoal 3: Adjust the right hand’s grip for stability (completed).  
- Updated Subgoal 4: Place the middle finger on the base for support (completed).  
- New Subgoal 5: Transfer the glass from the right hand to the left hand.  
- New Subgoal 6: Adjust the left hand’s grip to securely hold the glass by the stem.  
[/PLANNING]
