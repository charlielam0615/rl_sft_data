**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to knit an infinity scarf as a Christmas gift, adhering to the provided script and constraints. The script includes: 1. Choose a pattern, 2. Knit the pattern, 3. Stitch the ends together to create a loop, 4. Give the scarf to a friend or family member for Christmas. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action from the set and following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of knitting an infinity scarf for Christmas gifts into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf.  
2. Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern.  
3. Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop.  
4. Present the completed scarf as a Christmas gift to a friend or family member.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus and provide context for future steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Knit an infinity scarf for Christmas gifts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 2: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 3: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 4: Present the completed scarf as a Christmas gift to a friend or family member (not yet started).  
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Research beginner-friendly infinity scarf patterns online, considering factors like simplicity, aesthetic appeal for a Christmas gift, and material availability. Choose a pattern that uses basic stitches (e.g., knit and purl) and is suitable for a festive gift.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To select a pattern, I’ll look for beginner-friendly infinity scarf patterns suitable for a Christmas gift. A simple yet elegant option is a pattern using the stockinette stitch (alternating knit and purl rows) with a soft, festive yarn (e.g., red, green, or white). After researching, a popular choice is a “Simple Infinity Scarf” pattern that requires casting on 60 stitches, knitting in stockinette for 60 inches, and uses worsted weight yarn, which is widely available and festive. This pattern is straightforward and visually appealing for gifting.  
**Selected Pattern**: Simple Infinity Scarf (60 stitches, stockinette stitch, 60 inches long, worsted weight yarn).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the chosen pattern (Simple Infinity Scarf) meets the requirements of being beginner-friendly, suitable for a Christmas gift, and feasible with available materials.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The chosen Simple Infinity Scarf pattern is beginner-friendly, requiring only knit and purl stitches. Its clean, classic look in festive yarn (e.g., red or green worsted weight) makes it appropriate for a Christmas gift. Worsted weight yarn is commonly available, and the pattern’s 60-inch length ensures it’s suitable for an infinity scarf. The pattern aligns with the project’s constraints and goals.  
**Validation Result**: The pattern is valid and suitable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and maintain focus.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Knit an infinity scarf for Christmas gifts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 3: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 4: Present the completed scarf as a Christmas gift to a friend or family member (not yet started).  
**Current Goal**: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern.  
**How to Achieve**: Gather necessary materials (worsted weight yarn, knitting needles), follow the Simple Infinity Scarf pattern (cast on 60 stitches, knit in stockinette for 60 inches), and complete the knitting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Materials needed: worsted weight yarn (festive color, e.g., red, approximately 400 yards), size 8 (5mm) knitting needles, and a tapestry needle. Steps:  
1. Cast on 60 stitches using the long-tail cast-on method.  
2. Knit in stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl one row) until the scarf measures 60 inches.  
3. Bind off loosely to maintain elasticity.  
Assuming steady progress (e.g., a few hours daily), knitting should take about one week for a beginner. The scarf is now knitted and ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the knitted scarf for correct dimensions (60 inches long), consistent stitching, and overall quality suitable for a Christmas gift.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The knitted scarf measures 60 inches in length, as required by the pattern. The stockinette stitch is consistent with no visible dropped stitches or irregularities. The yarn’s festive color and soft texture make it visually appealing and appropriate for a Christmas gift. The scarf meets the pattern’s specifications and quality standards.  
**Validation Result**: The knitted scarf is complete and meets requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and focus on the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Knit an infinity scarf for Christmas gifts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate knitting pattern for the infinity scarf (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Knit the scarf according to the chosen pattern (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop (not yet started).  
  - Subgoal 4: Present the completed scarf as a Christmas gift to a friend or family member (not yet started).  
**Current Goal**: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a tapestry needle and the Kitchener stitch or a simple whip stitch to seam the scarf’s ends together, ensuring a smooth, invisible join suitable for an infinity scarf.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a tapestry needle and matching worsted weight yarn, I’ll seam the scarf’s ends with the whip stitch for simplicity, as it’s beginner-friendly and effective. Steps:  
1. Align the scarf’s ends with the right sides facing each other.  
2. Thread the tapestry needle with yarn and whip stitch the edges together, ensuring a secure and neat seam.  
3. Turn the scarf right-side out to form a loop.  
The join is complete, and the scarf now forms a continuous loop, ready for gifting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Join the ends of the knitted scarf to form a loop.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the seam to ensure it’s secure, nearly invisible, and maintains the scarf’s aesthetic for a Christmas gift.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The whip-stitched seam is secure with no loose stitches, and the join is nearly invisible when the scarf is turned right-side out. The loop maintains the scarf’s festive appearance and functionality as an infinity scarf. The seam meets the quality standards for a Christmas gift.  
**Validation Result**: The seam is valid and suitable.  
[/IMP]
