### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for making tuxedo cookies without frosting, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions categorized into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R). The plan must be developed step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified requirements. The constraint is that the cookies must be made without frosting, and the provided script outlines the steps to achieve this.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare the oven and baking sheet. This involves preheating the oven to 375°F (190°C) and ensuring the baking sheet is ready for use (e.g., lined with parchment paper or greased if necessary).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or lightly greasing it to prevent sticking.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Validate that the oven is preheating to 375°F (190°C) and the baking sheet is properly prepared to ensure the process aligns with the goal of making tuxedo cookies.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the oven temperature to confirm it is set to 375°F (190°C) and monitor as it preheats. Inspect the baking sheet to ensure it is lined with parchment paper or greased, verifying it is ready for cookie placement.  
[/IMP]
