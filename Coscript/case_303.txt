**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to remove malware from a computer using anti-malware software, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The process must adhere to the given script: (1) Obtain anti-malware software, (2) Install the software, (3) Run a scan with the software, (4) Remove the malware, using only anti-malware software as the constraint. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and responses must use [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, with content organized according to the action’s category.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of removing malware into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Obtain anti-malware software.  
2. Install the anti-malware software.  
3. Run a malware scan using the software.  
4. Remove identified malware using the software.  
These subgoals align with the script and will guide the process.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format and highlight the current goal. Based on the recent [PLANNING] block, the hierarchy of goals is:  
- Main Goal: Remove malware using anti-malware software  
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain anti-malware software (current goal)  
  - Subgoal 2: Install the anti-malware software  
  - Subgoal 3: Run a malware scan using the software  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove identified malware using the software  
**Current Goal**: Obtain anti-malware software.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Obtain anti-malware software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Research and select a reputable anti-malware software (e.g., Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, or Bitdefender) and download it from the official website or a trusted source.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To obtain anti-malware software, I recommend selecting Malwarebytes, a widely trusted anti-malware tool. Visit the official Malwarebytes website (malwarebytes.com) and download the free version, which is sufficient for malware removal. Ensure the download is from the official site to avoid malicious sources. The file should be compatible with the computer’s operating system (e.g., Windows or macOS).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Obtain anti-malware software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the downloaded anti-malware software is legitimate and compatible with the system.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the downloaded Malwarebytes file by confirming the source URL is “malwarebytes.com” and the file’s digital signature is valid (right-click the file, select Properties, and check the Digital Signatures tab on Windows). Ensure the software version is compatible with the operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or later). If the file passes these checks, it is ready for installation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Install the anti-malware software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation prompts to set up the software on the computer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the downloaded Malwarebytes installer (e.g., “mbsetup.exe”) and double-click to run it. Follow the on-screen prompts: accept the license agreement, choose the installation directory (default is usually fine), and select “Install.” Once complete, ensure the software launches correctly and is updated to the latest version by checking for updates within the program.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress. The hierarchy of goals is:  
- Main Goal: Remove malware using anti-malware software  
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain anti-malware software (completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Install the anti-malware software (completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Run a malware scan using the software (current goal)  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove identified malware using the software  
**Current Goal**: Run a malware scan using the software.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Run a malware scan using the software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Open the installed Malwarebytes software and initiate a full system scan to detect malware.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open Malwarebytes from the desktop shortcut or Start menu. Navigate to the “Scan” tab, select “Custom Scan,” and choose all drives for a full system scan to ensure comprehensive detection. Click “Start Scan” and allow the process to complete, which may take several minutes depending on system size.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Run a malware scan using the software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm that the scan completed successfully and review the scan results for detected threats.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After the Malwarebytes scan completes, check the scan summary in the software interface. Ensure it indicates “Scan Completed” and lists any detected threats or confirms no threats were found. If threats are detected, review the details (e.g., file names, locations) to understand the scope of the infection.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve past information relevant to the current goal of removing identified malware, focusing on the scan results and software capabilities.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to remove identified malware. From previous steps:  
- Step 7 ([IMP]): A full system scan was initiated using Malwarebytes, set to scan all drives.  
- Step 8 ([IMP]): The scan completed, and results were generated, listing any detected threats (e.g., file names, locations).  
Malwarebytes is capable of quarantining and removing detected malware, as confirmed in Step 3 ([IMP]) when selecting the software. This information supports proceeding with malware removal using the software’s tools.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Remove identified malware using the software.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use Malwarebytes to quarantine and delete the malware identified in the scan results.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In Malwarebytes, go to the “Quarantine” tab to view detected threats from the scan. Select all listed threats and choose “Remove” to quarantine and delete them. Confirm the removal when prompted. Restart the computer if prompted to complete the process. After restarting, verify the threats are no longer listed in the Quarantine tab.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect completion. The hierarchy of goals is:  
- Main Goal: Remove malware using anti-malware software  
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain anti-malware software (completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Install the anti-malware software (completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Run a malware scan using the software (completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Remove identified malware using the software (completed)  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The main goal of removing malware using anti-malware software has been achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the malware has been successfully removed.  
- **How to Achieve**: Run a follow-up scan with Malwarebytes to confirm no threats remain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Open Malwarebytes and initiate another full system scan (as described in Step 7). After the scan completes, check the results to confirm no threats are detected. If the scan reports “No threats found,” the malware removal is successful. If threats persist, repeat the removal process (Step 10).  
[/IMP]
