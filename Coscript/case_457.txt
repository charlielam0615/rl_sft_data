[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus and context.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Convert bicycle tires into studded snow tires using screws.  
  - Subgoal 1: Remove the bicycle wheels and tires.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and mark locations for screw placement on the tires.  
  - Subgoal 3: Pierce the marked points and install screws with nuts.  
  - Subgoal 4: Reassemble the tires onto the rims and the wheels onto the bike.  
**Current Goal:** Remove the bicycle wheels and tires (Subgoal 1).  
This structure reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, with the focus on the first actionable step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Remove the bicycle wheels and tires.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use appropriate tools (e.g., a wrench) to detach the wheels from the bicycle frame and remove the tires from the rims using tire levers or similar tools.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the first subgoal, follow these steps:  
1. Use a wrench to loosen and remove the nuts or quick-release skewers securing the wheels to the bicycle frame.  
2. Detach both the front and rear wheels from the bike.  
3. Use tire levers to pry the tires off the rims, working carefully to avoid damaging the inner tubes or rims.  
4. Set the wheels, tires, and inner tubes aside for modification in the next steps.  
This ensures the tires are accessible for adding screws.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Ensure the wheels and tires were removed correctly.  
- **How to Achieve:** Inspect the removed wheels, tires, and inner tubes to confirm they are undamaged and properly separated for the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the bicycle wheels, tires, and inner tubes:  
1. Check that both wheels are fully detached from the bike frame and no components (e.g., axles, skewers) are missing.  
2. Verify that the tires are completely removed from the rims and that the inner tubes are intact and separated.  
3. Ensure no damage (e.g., tears or bends) occurred during removal, as this could affect tire performance or screw installation.  
If any issues are found, replace damaged components before proceeding. The process is valid if all parts are intact and accessible.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the subgoals to determine if adjustments are needed based on the validated removal process. If the tires or rims were damaged during removal, adjust the plan to include repair or replacement. Assuming no damage, proceed with the existing subgoals, focusing on the next step: identifying screw placement.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify and mark locations for screw placement on the tires.  
- **How to Achieve:** Determine optimal screw placement for traction, mark the points on the tire, and prepare for piercing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To identify and mark screw placement:  
1. Inspect the tire tread to select areas that contact the ground for maximum traction (e.g., the center or thickest part of the tread).  
2. Plan for even spacing, such as placing screws every 2-3 inches around the tire’s circumference, ensuring symmetry for balance.  
3. Use a marker or chalk to mark precise points on the tire’s outer surface where screws will be inserted.  
4. Estimate the number of screws needed (e.g., 20-30 per tire, depending on size) to ensure adequate stud coverage.  
This prepares the tires for screw installation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Pierce the marked points and install screws with nuts.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to screw placement and installation from previous steps to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Step 6: Screw placement points were marked on the tire’s tread, spaced evenly (2-3 inches apart) for traction and balance.  
- From Step 3: Tires are removed and accessible, confirmed intact in Step 4, ensuring they are ready for piercing and screw installation.  
This information confirms the tires are prepared and the marked points guide the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Pierce the marked points and install screws with nuts.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use a screwdriver or drill to create holes at the marked points, insert screws outward, and secure them with nuts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To pierce and install screws:  
1. Use a drill with a small bit or a screwdriver to pierce holes at the marked points on the tire, ensuring the holes are just large enough for the screws.  
2. Insert short, wide-headed screws (e.g., sheet metal screws) through the holes from the inside of the tire, so the heads sit against the inner surface and the threaded ends point outward.  
3. Thread nuts onto the protruding screw ends on the tire’s outer surface to secure them tightly.  
4. Ensure the screws are evenly tightened and protrude slightly (e.g., 3-5 mm) for effective snow traction without risking tube punctures.  
5. Place a protective liner (e.g., rim tape or duct tape) inside the tire to prevent screw heads from damaging the inner tube.  
This creates the studded effect for snow traction.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the screws and nuts are securely installed and safe for use.  
- **How to Achieve:** Inspect the screws, nuts, and tire integrity to ensure proper installation and no risk to the inner tube or tire performance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the studded tires:  
1. Check that all screws are securely fastened with nuts and protrude evenly for consistent traction.  
2. Verify the protective liner is properly placed to prevent inner tube damage.  
3. Test the tire’s integrity by gently pressing or rolling it to ensure no screws are loose or misaligned.  
4. Confirm the number of screws matches the planned amount (e.g., 20-30 per tire) and that they are symmetrically placed.  
If any screws are loose or the liner is inadequate, tighten or adjust before proceeding. The tires are valid for reassembly if secure and safe.  
[/IMP]
