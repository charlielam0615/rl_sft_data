### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for storing raw honey at room temperature, adhering to the given constraint that the storage must be at room temperature. The provided script includes three steps: (1) Choose a new container if the original one is damaged, (2) Select a room with a stable temperature, and (3) Keep honey away from sunlight. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and ensuring all actions align with the goal of properly storing raw honey.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of storing raw honey at room temperature into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals:  
1. Ensure the honey is in a suitable container.  
2. Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature.  
3. Protect the honey from sunlight exposure.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the honey is in a suitable container.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the original container for damage (e.g., cracks, leaks, or improper sealing). If damaged, transfer the honey to a new, airtight, food-grade container suitable for long-term storage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the original honey container for any signs of damage, such as cracks, dents, or a loose lid. If the container is intact and airtight, it can be used. If damaged, select a new food-grade glass or plastic container with a tight-sealing lid. Transfer the honey carefully to the new container, ensuring no spillage and maintaining hygiene by using clean utensils. Seal the container securely to prevent air exposure, which could affect the honey’s quality.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the honey is in a suitable container.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the container (original or new) is airtight, food-grade, and free of damage to ensure proper storage conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the container’s seal by pressing the lid to ensure it is secure and does not pop open. Confirm the material is food-grade (e.g., glass or BPA-free plastic) and free of cracks or defects. If a new container was used, ensure no honey residue is on the exterior, indicating a clean transfer. If any issues are found, repeat the container selection and transfer process.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Store raw honey at room temperature.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the honey is in a suitable container (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature.  
The first subgoal has been addressed by ensuring the container is suitable and validated. The next steps will focus on selecting a storage location and protecting the honey from sunlight.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a room or area in the home where the temperature remains consistently between 20–25°C (68–77°F), typical for room temperature, and avoids fluctuations from heating or cooling sources.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Evaluate potential storage areas in the home, such as a pantry, cupboard, or kitchen cabinet. Use a thermometer to measure the temperature in these areas over a day to confirm stability within 20–25°C. Avoid locations near heat sources (e.g., ovens, radiators) or cooling sources (e.g., air conditioners, refrigerators). Select a location that maintains consistent temperature and is convenient for access. Place the honey container in the chosen spot.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the selected storage location maintains a stable temperature within the room temperature range and is free from environmental factors that could affect the honey.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Monitor the temperature of the selected storage location over 24–48 hours using a thermometer to ensure it remains within 20–25°C. Check that the area is not subject to drafts, direct heat, or humidity fluctuations (e.g., avoid areas near windows or sinks). If the location meets these criteria, confirm it is suitable. If not, select an alternative location and repeat the temperature check.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Store raw honey at room temperature.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the honey is in a suitable container (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure.  
The container has been validated, and a stable room-temperature location has been selected and verified. The final subgoal is to ensure the honey is protected from sunlight to complete the storage plan.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure.  
**How to Achieve**: Ensure the storage location is shielded from direct or indirect sunlight, using opaque coverings or dark storage areas if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Assess the selected storage location for sunlight exposure. If the area (e.g., a pantry or cupboard) is naturally dark and enclosed, it is suitable. If the location is near a window or receives indirect sunlight, cover the honey container with an opaque cloth or place it inside an opaque storage box. Alternatively, relocate the container to a darker area, such as a closed cabinet. Ensure the solution maintains the room temperature constraint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the storage location or covering effectively blocks sunlight while maintaining room temperature conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the storage area during different times of the day to confirm no direct or indirect sunlight reaches the honey container. If an opaque cover or box is used, ensure it fully shields the container. Re-measure the temperature in the storage area to confirm it remains within 20–25°C, as coverings could affect ventilation. If sunlight exposure is detected or temperature is affected, adjust the cover or relocate the container to a darker, temperature-stable area.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Store raw honey at room temperature.  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the honey is in a suitable container (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify an appropriate storage location with stable room temperature (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Protect the honey from sunlight exposure (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed and validated. The honey is now stored in a suitable container, in a location with stable room temperature, and protected from sunlight, fulfilling the requirements for storing raw honey at room temperature.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Confirmation
The plan for storing raw honey at room temperature has been completed. The honey is stored in an airtight, food-grade container, placed in a stable room-temperature location (20–25°C), and protected from sunlight exposure, adhering to the provided script and constraint. No further actions are required.
