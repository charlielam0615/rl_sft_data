**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make comic book high heels using craft glue, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must use craft glue as a constraint and follow the script: (1) Get comic books you don’t mind cutting up, (2) Choose plain high heels, (3) Cut a slit down the middle of the soles, (4) Apply craft glue to the top of one shoe, (5) Place a strip of comic book paper on the glue, (6) Apply another layer of glue over the comic book paper, (7) Place additional strips until the shoe is covered, (8) Let the glue dry completely before wearing.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make comic book high heels using craft glue.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather materials (comic books and plain high heels).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the shoes by cutting a slit in the soles.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply comic book strips to the shoes using craft glue.  
  - Subgoal 4: Allow the glue to dry completely.  
**Current Goal**: Gather materials (comic books and plain high heels).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather materials, specifically comic books that can be cut up and a pair of plain high heels. This will be achieved by identifying and collecting these items.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal:  
- Select comic books that are not valuable or sentimental, as they will be cut into strips. Old or duplicate issues are ideal.  
- Choose a pair of plain high heels with a smooth surface suitable for gluing, ensuring they are clean and free of damage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the gathered materials (comic books and high heels) are suitable for the project. This will be achieved by checking their condition and appropriateness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Verify that the comic books are in good condition for cutting (no brittle pages) and have vibrant colors for aesthetic appeal.  
- Confirm the high heels have a smooth, clean surface that craft glue can adhere to and are structurally sound.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals to account for material preparation:  
1. Gather and verify materials (comic books and plain high heels).  
2. Prepare materials by cutting comic books into strips and making a slit in the shoe soles.  
3. Apply comic book strips to the shoes using craft glue.  
4. Allow the glue to dry completely.

### adım 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare materials by cutting comic books into strips and making a slit in the shoe soles. This will be achieved by using scissors to cut comic book pages and a utility knife for the soles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Use scissors to cut comic book pages into strips (approximately 1-2 inches wide) suitable for wrapping around the shoes.  
- Carefully cut a slit down the middle of each shoe’s sole using a utility knife, ensuring the cut is precise and does not damage the shoe’s structure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the comic book strips and the slit in the shoe soles are correctly prepared. This will be achieved by checking the strips’ size and the slit’s accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Check that the comic book strips are uniformly cut and long enough to cover the shoe surfaces.  
- Ensure the slit in each sole is straight, centered, and does not compromise the shoe’s integrity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply comic book strips to the shoes using craft glue. This will be achieved by layering glue and comic book strips on the shoe surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Apply a thin, even layer of craft glue (e.g., Elmer’s glue) to the top of one shoe using a brush or applicator.  
- Place a comic book strip onto the glued area, smoothing it to avoid wrinkles or bubbles.  
- Apply another layer of craft glue over the comic book strip.  
- Add additional strips, overlapping slightly, until the entire shoe is covered, applying glue between and over each layer.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply comic book strips to the shoes using craft glue. Retrieve information from previous steps related to material preparation and application to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- From Step 3 and 4: Comic books and high heels were gathered and verified to be suitable (non-valuable comics, smooth-surfaced heels).  
- From Step 7: Comic book strips were cut to 1-2 inches wide, and a slit was made in each shoe’s sole.  
- From Step 8: Strips and slits were validated for uniformity and accuracy.  
This confirms materials are prepared and ready for the gluing process described in Step 9.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to allow the glue to dry completely. This will be achieved by setting the shoes aside in a well-ventilated area.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Place the covered shoes in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct heat or sunlight.  
- Allow the craft glue to dry completely, following the manufacturer’s instructions (typically 24 hours for Elmer’s glue).  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the glue has dried completely and the comic book strips are securely attached. This will be achieved by inspecting the shoes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Check that the glue is fully dry by touching the surface (it should feel hard and non-sticky).  
- Inspect the comic book strips to ensure they are firmly adhered with no loose edges or peeling.  
- Verify the shoes are wearable and the slits in the soles do not affect stability.  
[/IMP]
