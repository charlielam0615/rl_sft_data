**Problem Statement**: The task is to simulate a planning case for formatting APA citations for a paper. This involves creating a plan to find resources, note down important information for each source, organize citations by category, format each citation in APA style, and check the work for accuracy, following the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response will adhere to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To format APA citations for a paper, break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to produce accurate APA citations for all sources used in the paper. Subgoals include:  
1. Identify and collect all relevant sources for the paper.  
2. Record key bibliographic details for each source.  
3. Categorize citations based on source type or paper section.  
4. Format each citation according to APA guidelines.  
5. Verify the accuracy of all formatted citations.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and collect all relevant sources for the paper.  
**How to Achieve**: Search for and gather all books, articles, websites, and other materials referenced in the paper, ensuring they are credible and relevant to the paper’s topic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To identify and collect sources, review the paper’s content to list all referenced materials. Use academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar, JSTOR) and library catalogs to locate these sources. Create a document or spreadsheet to compile a list of sources, including titles, authors, and publication details. For example, if the paper discusses climate change, sources might include peer-reviewed articles, books, and reputable websites. Ensure all sources are accessible for further information extraction.

**Step 3: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Format APA citations for a paper.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and collect all relevant sources for the paper (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Record key bibliographic details for each source.  
  - Subgoal 3: Categorize citations based on source type or paper section.  
  - Subgoal 4: Format each citation according to APA guidelines.  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the accuracy of all formatted citations.  
**Current Goal**: Record key bibliographic details for each source.  
The first subgoal has been achieved by collecting relevant sources. The focus now shifts to recording essential information (e.g., author, title, publication date, publisher, DOI/URL) for each source to prepare for APA formatting.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Record key bibliographic details for each source.  
**How to Achieve**: Extract and document essential citation elements (author, title, publication year, publisher, DOI/URL, etc.) for each source in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or citation management tool.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each source identified in Step 2, extract the following APA-required details: author(s), publication year, title, journal/book title, volume/issue (for journals), publisher (for books), and DOI or URL (if applicable). Use a spreadsheet or a tool like Zotero to organize this information. For example, for a journal article: Author(s), (Year). Title. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page Range. DOI. Ensure completeness by cross-referencing each source’s title page or metadata.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After recording bibliographic details, refine the remaining subgoals to ensure clarity and efficiency. The categorization subgoal can be adjusted to specify sorting by source type (e.g., books, journals, websites) or by paper section (e.g., introduction, methodology). The updated subgoals are:  
1. Identify and collect all relevant sources for the paper (completed).  
2. Record key bibliographic details for each source (completed).  
3. Categorize citations by source type for easier formatting.  
4. Format each citation according to APA guidelines.  
5. Verify the accuracy of all formatted citations.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Categorize citations by source type for easier formatting.  
**How to Achieve**: Group the recorded sources into categories such as books, journal articles, and websites to streamline the APA formatting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the spreadsheet or citation tool from Step 4, sort the sources into categories: books, journal articles, websites, and others (e.g., reports). For example, place all journal articles in one group with their details (author, year, title, etc.), books in another, and websites in a third. This organization simplifies applying the correct APA format for each source type, as each has specific formatting rules (e.g., books require publisher information, while journal articles need volume/issue).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to APA citation formats for different source types to guide the formatting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Previous steps established a list of sources (Step 2), their bibliographic details (Step 4), and categorization by source type (Step 6).  
- APA format guidelines:  
  - **Books**: Author(s). (Year). Title. Publisher.  
  - **Journal Articles**: Author(s). (Year). Title. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page Range. DOI.  
  - **Websites**: Author(s). (Year). Title. Website Name. URL.  
This information is critical for the next subgoal of formatting citations, ensuring each source type adheres to APA 7th edition standards.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Format each citation according to APA guidelines.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply APA 7th edition formatting rules to each source based on its category, using the recorded bibliographic details.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the categorized sources and recalled APA guidelines, format each citation. For example:  
- **Book**: Smith, J. (2020). Climate Change Impacts. Green Press.  
- **Journal Article**: Doe, A., & Lee, B. (2021). Global warming trends. Environmental Science, 15(3), 123–130. https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123  
- **Website**: Brown, C. (2022). Sustainable practices. EcoWorld. https://ecoworld.org/sustainability  
Input these formatted citations into the paper’s reference list, ensuring proper alphabetical order and hanging indent as per APA style.  
[/IMP]

**Step 9: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the accuracy of all formatted citations.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check each citation against APA 7th edition guidelines and original source details for correctness in format, punctuation, and content.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review each citation in the reference list against the APA 7th edition manual or a reliable guide (e.g., Purdue OWL). Check for:  
- Correct author names and initials.  
- Accurate publication years and titles.  
- Proper formatting (e.g., italics for book/journal titles, correct DOI/URL format).  
- Consistent punctuation and capitalization.  
For example, ensure a journal article citation includes volume and issue numbers and a valid DOI. Correct any errors, such as missing periods or incorrect italics, and confirm the reference list is alphabetized.
