**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to perform calf raises with both legs at a time, adhering to the provided script and constraint, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action, and the response will follow the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of performing calf raises with both legs at a time into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script:  
1. Secure a stable support for balance.  
2. Execute the calf raise motion (raise heels, hold, lower).  
3. Repeat the motion 15–20 times.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure a stable support for balance. This will be achieved by identifying and positioning near a sturdy object, such as a wall or chair, to hold onto during the exercise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find a sturdy object, such as a wall, chair, or countertop, to grip for balance. Position yourself close enough to lightly hold it with your hands, ensuring stability without relying on it for full support.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Perform calf raises with both legs at a time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Secure a stable support for balance (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Execute the calf raise motion (raise heels, hold, lower).  
  - Subgoal 3: Repeat the motion 15–20 times.  
**Current Goal**: Execute the calf raise motion (raise heels, hold, lower).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to execute the calf raise motion. This will be achieved by raising both heels to stand on the toes, holding for a second, and lowering back to the starting position, as per the script steps 2–4.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, gripping the sturdy object for balance. Slowly raise both heels, shifting your weight onto your toes. Hold this position for one second, keeping your core engaged. Lower your heels back to the ground in a controlled manner.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calf raise motion. This will be achieved by checking that the heels are raised fully, the hold is maintained for one second, and the lowering is controlled, ensuring both legs are used simultaneously.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm that both heels are lifted fully off the ground during the raise, the body remains stable with minimal reliance on the support, and the motion is performed smoothly without jerking. Verify that both legs are working together and the hold lasts approximately one second.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to repeat the calf raise motion 15–20 times. This will be achieved by performing the validated motion repeatedly, tracking the number of repetitions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Perform the calf raise motion (raise heels, hold for one second, lower heels) 15–20 times. Count each repetition mentally or aloud to ensure the target is met. Maintain consistent form and use the sturdy object for balance as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Perform calf raises with both legs at a time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Secure a stable support for balance (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Execute the calf raise motion (raise heels, hold, lower) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Repeat the motion 15–20 times (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The plan to perform calf raises with both legs at a time has been fully executed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Summary**: The plan to perform calf raises with both legs at a time has been completed by breaking down the task into subgoals, securing a stable support, executing and validating the calf raise motion, and repeating it 15–20 times, all while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set and the specified format.
