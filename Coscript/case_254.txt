**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for shelling pine nuts using a nutcracker, following the provided script and constraints, and create a plan using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate. The script includes three steps: (1) Place the pine nuts in the rose of the nutcracker, (2) Apply pressure to the handles of the nutcracker until the pine nuts are cracked, and (3) Enjoy. The constraint is that a nutcracker must be used, and the task falls under the category of Food and Entertaining.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of shelling pine nuts using a nutcracker into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker.  
2. Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure.  
3. Consume or use the shelled pine nuts.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals identified in the previous step.  
- Main Goal: Shell pine nuts using a nutcracker  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker  
  - Subgoal 2: Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure  
  - Subgoal 3: Consume or use the shelled pine nuts  
**Current Goal**: Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker.  
**How to Achieve**: Take a single pine nut and place it securely in the rose (the gripping area) of the nutcracker, ensuring it is stable and aligned for effective cracking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pick up a pine nut and insert it into the rose of the nutcracker, ensuring it sits firmly in place without slipping.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the pine nut is correctly positioned in the nutcracker.  
**How to Achieve**: Visually and physically check that the pine nut is securely placed in the rose of the nutcracker and properly aligned for cracking.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the pine nut in the nutcrackerâ€™s rose to confirm it is stable and centered. Gently wiggle the nutcracker to ensure the nut does not move or fall out. If it is loose, reposition the pine nut to fit securely.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure.  
**Core Content for Retrieval**: Information related to the process of cracking pine nuts using a nutcracker, focusing on the mechanics of applying pressure.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Recalling information relevant to cracking pine nuts: The script specifies applying pressure to the handles of the nutcracker until the pine nuts are cracked. Previous steps confirm the pine nut must be securely positioned in the rose before pressure is applied.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure.  
**How to Achieve**: Squeeze the handles of the nutcracker firmly and steadily until the pine nut shell cracks open, releasing the edible nut inside.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Hold the nutcracker with the pine nut in place and apply steady pressure to the handles. Continue squeezing until a cracking sound is heard, indicating the shell has broken. Release the pressure and check the pine nut to ensure the shell is fully cracked.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the pine nut shell is cracked and the nut is accessible.  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the pine nut to confirm the shell is sufficiently cracked and the edible nut can be retrieved.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the pine nut to verify the shell has cracked open. If the shell is not fully broken or the nut is not accessible, reapply pressure to the nutcracker handles. If the shell is cracked, remove the edible nut and set it aside.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update and list the goal hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Shell pine nuts using a nutcracker  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Consume or use the shelled pine nuts  
**Current Goal**: Consume or use the shelled pine nuts  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Consume or use the shelled pine nuts.  
**How to Achieve**: Collect the shelled pine nuts and either eat them directly or incorporate them into a dish as desired.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gather the shelled pine nuts. Either eat them as a snack or use them in a recipe, such as adding them to a salad, pesto, or dessert, according to preference.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Final goal hierarchy review:  
- Main Goal: Shell pine nuts using a nutcracker  
  - Subgoal 1: Position the pine nuts correctly in the nutcracker (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Crack the pine nuts by applying pressure (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Consume or use the shelled pine nuts (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None (All subgoals completed)  
The plan to shell pine nuts using a nutcracker is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Note**: The plan has been fully executed, covering all steps in the provided script while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set and formatting requirements. The constraint of using a nutcracker was followed throughout, and the task aligns with the Food and Entertaining category.
