### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to prevent pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings, adhering to the provided script and constraint. The script includes two steps: (1) Visit a doctor to get fitted for compression stockings, and (2) Wear the compression stockings as prescribed. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To prevent pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The script outlines two key steps: visiting a doctor to get fitted for compression stockings and wearing them as prescribed. Subgoals will align with these steps while considering the constraint of using compression stockings.  
- Subgoal 1: Obtain properly fitted compression stockings through a doctor’s consultation.  
- Subgoal 2: Consistently wear the compression stockings according to the prescribed schedule and guidelines.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to obtain properly fitted compression stockings through a doctor’s consultation. This will be achieved by scheduling and attending a doctor’s appointment to assess the need for compression stockings and receive a prescription or fitting instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of obtaining properly fitted compression stockings:  
- Schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider, such as a primary care physician or a vascular specialist, to discuss the prevention of pulmonary embolism.  
- During the appointment, provide medical history and discuss risk factors for pulmonary embolism (e.g., recent surgery, prolonged immobility, or history of blood clots).  
- Request a professional fitting for compression stockings to ensure the correct size and compression level (e.g., 15-20 mmHg or as recommended).  
- Obtain a prescription or guidance on where to purchase medical-grade compression stockings.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the compression stockings obtained are appropriate for preventing pulmonary embolism. This will be achieved by verifying the fitting and prescription details provided by the doctor.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the path for obtaining compression stockings:  
- Confirm with the healthcare provider that the prescribed compression stockings are suitable for pulmonary embolism prevention (e.g., appropriate compression strength and length, such as knee-high or thigh-high).  
- Check that the stockings fit comfortably without excessive tightness or looseness, ensuring they promote blood flow without causing discomfort.  
- Verify the source of purchase (e.g., medical supply store or pharmacy) provides medical-grade stockings as recommended by the doctor.  
- If any issues arise (e.g., incorrect size or inadequate compression), consult the doctor for adjustments.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**:  
- Main Goal: Prevent pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings.  
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain properly fitted compression stockings through a doctor’s consultation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Consistently wear the compression stockings according to the prescribed schedule and guidelines (Not yet addressed).  
**Current Goal**: Consistently wear the compression stockings as prescribed to prevent pulmonary embolism.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the script’s steps. Subgoal 1 has been addressed through the doctor’s consultation and validation of the stockings. The focus now shifts to Subgoal 2, ensuring adherence to wearing the stockings as prescribed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to consistently wear the compression stockings as prescribed to prevent pulmonary embolism. This will be achieved by following the doctor’s instructions on when and how to wear the stockings and integrating their use into daily routines.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of wearing compression stockings as prescribed:  
- Follow the doctor’s instructions on the duration and timing of wear (e.g., daily during waking hours or specific situations like long flights).  
- Put on the compression stockings in the morning before swelling occurs, ensuring they are applied smoothly without folds or bunching.  
- Integrate wearing the stockings into a daily routine, such as putting them on after morning hygiene practices.  
- Care for the stockings by washing them according to manufacturer guidelines to maintain elasticity and effectiveness.  
- Monitor for any discomfort or skin issues and consult the doctor if problems arise.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the compression stockings are being worn correctly and effectively to prevent pulmonary embolism. This will be achieved by checking adherence to the prescribed schedule and assessing the stockings’ impact on health.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the use of compression stockings:  
- Confirm adherence to the prescribed wearing schedule (e.g., daily wear for the recommended hours).  
- Monitor for signs of improved circulation, such as reduced leg swelling or discomfort, indicating the stockings are effective.  
- Check the condition of the stockings regularly to ensure they maintain proper compression and are free from wear or damage.  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment with the doctor to assess the effectiveness of the stockings in preventing pulmonary embolism and address any concerns.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**:  
- Main Goal: Prevent pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings.  
  - Subgoal 1: Obtain properly fitted compression stockings through a doctor’s consultation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Consistently wear the compression stockings according to the prescribed schedule and guidelines (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal of preventing pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings has been addressed, as both subgoals are completed.  
The plan has been fully executed per the provided script. Subgoal 1 was achieved by obtaining fitted stockings, and Subgoal 2 was achieved by wearing them as prescribed, with validation ensuring correctness. No further subgoals are needed based on the script.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to prevent pulmonary embolism by wearing compression stockings has been completed. The process involved obtaining properly fitted stockings through a doctor’s consultation and consistently wearing them as prescribed, with validation at each step to ensure effectiveness. All actions adhered to the meta-cognitive action set and the provided script, fulfilling the constraint of using compression stockings.
