### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for connecting to the internet via an Ethernet cable, adhering to the provided script and the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The plan must follow the constraint of using an Ethernet connection and be executed step-by-step using one meta-cognitive action per step, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. Each step will select an action from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, ensuring the plan progresses logically until completion.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of connecting to the internet via Ethernet into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. Subgoals include:  
1. Connect the Ethernet cable to the computer and router.  
2. Ensure the router is powered on.  
3. Allow the computer to establish the connection.  
4. Verify the internet connection.  
5. Address any connection issues if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to connect the Ethernet cable to the computer and router. This will be achieved by physically plugging one end of the Ethernet cable into the computer and the other into the router, as outlined in the script steps 1 and 2.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow these steps:  
1. Locate an Ethernet cable and the Ethernet port on the back of your computer.  
2. Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the computer’s Ethernet port.  
3. Plug the other end into an available Ethernet port on your router.  
Ensure both connections are secure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Connect to the internet via Ethernet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Connect the Ethernet cable to the computer and router (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the router is powered on (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the computer to establish the connection (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the internet connection (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Address any connection issues if necessary (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the router is powered on.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure the router is powered on. This will be achieved by checking the router’s power status and turning it on if necessary, as per script step 4.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Locate the power button or switch on your router.  
2. Check if the router is powered on (look for indicator lights).  
3. If the router is off, press the power button or flip the switch to turn it on.  
4. Confirm that the router’s power indicator lights are active.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to allow the computer to establish the internet connection. This will be achieved by waiting for the computer to detect and connect to the network, as per script step 5.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Wait for 30-60 seconds to allow the computer to detect the Ethernet connection.  
2. Observe any network status indicators on your computer (e.g., network icon in the system tray).  
3. Ensure no error messages appear indicating a connection failure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify the internet connection. This will be achieved by testing the connection to confirm it is active, as per script step 6.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Open a web browser on your computer.  
2. Navigate to a reliable website (e.g., www.google.com) to test connectivity.  
3. Alternatively, run a network diagnostic tool if available on your operating system.  
4. Confirm that the website loads successfully or the diagnostic tool reports a working connection.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to address any connection issues if the internet connection fails. Retrieve information from previous steps related to establishing the Ethernet connection to inform troubleshooting.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2 (Reach Goal): Ensured the Ethernet cable was securely plugged into the computer and router.  
- Step 4 (Reach Goal): Verified the router was powered on and indicator lights were active.  
- Step 5 (Reach Goal): Allowed time for the computer to establish the connection.  
- Step 6 (Validation): Tested the connection by accessing a website or running diagnostics.  
This information indicates that the physical setup (cable connections, router power) and initial connection attempt were completed. If the connection failed, troubleshooting should focus on checking these components and additional factors like network settings or hardware issues.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to troubleshoot any connection issues if the internet is not working. This will be achieved by following script step 7, checking common issues like cable connections, router status, and network settings.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Recheck that the Ethernet cable is securely plugged into both the computer and router.  
2. Confirm the router is powered on and indicator lights show normal activity.  
3. Restart the router by unplugging it for 30 seconds and plugging it back in.  
4. Check the computer’s network settings to ensure it is set to obtain an IP address automatically.  
5. If the issue persists, contact your internet service provider or consult the router’s manual for advanced troubleshooting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Connect to the internet via Ethernet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Connect the Ethernet cable to the computer and router (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the router is powered on (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Allow the computer to establish the connection (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the internet connection (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Address any connection issues if necessary (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The plan to connect to the internet via Ethernet is complete, with all steps executed and potential issues addressed through troubleshooting.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to connect to the internet via Ethernet has been fully executed using the meta-cognitive action set framework. All script steps were addressed, ensuring the Ethernet cable was connected, the router was powered on, the connection was established and verified, and troubleshooting steps were provided for potential issues. The process is now complete.
