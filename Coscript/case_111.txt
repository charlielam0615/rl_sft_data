**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to use the iPhone Compass app to find a car in a parking lot, following the provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, and the response will be structured with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, based on the action's category.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of using the iPhone Compass to find the car into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app.  
2. Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car.  
3. Follow the Compass app’s directions to reach the car.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use the iPhone Compass to find the car in a parking lot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app.  
  - Subgoal 2: Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car.  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the Compass app’s directions to reach the car.  
**Current Goal**: Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app.  
- **How to Achieve**: Park the car safely, open the Compass app, swipe left, and mark the location to drop a pin on the map.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow these steps to achieve the current goal:  
1. Park the car in a safe location in the parking lot.  
2. Open the Compass app on the iPhone.  
3. Swipe left on the compass face to access the location marking feature.  
4. Press and hold the "Mark Location" button to drop a pin indicating the car’s location.  
A pin will now be saved on the map, marking the car’s position.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure the car’s location was correctly marked in the Compass app.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that a pin was dropped on the map in the Compass app, confirming the car’s location was saved.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the Compass app to confirm that a pin appears on the map at the car’s parked location. If the pin is visible, the location has been successfully marked. If not, repeat the steps to open the app, swipe left, and press the "Mark Location" button again.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use the iPhone Compass to find the car in a parking lot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car.  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the Compass app’s directions to reach the car.  
**Current Goal**: Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car.  
- **How to Achieve**: Open the Compass app, swipe left, and select the marked car location from the list.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow these steps to locate the car:  
1. Return to the parking lot.  
2. Open the Compass app on the iPhone.  
3. Swipe left on the compass face to access the location list.  
4. Tap the "List" button, then tap the saved location of the car.  
The Compass app will now display the car’s location.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of using the Compass app to locate the car, focusing on the steps taken to mark and access the car’s location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- In Step 3, the car was parked, and its location was marked by opening the Compass app, swiping left, and pressing the "Mark Location" button, which dropped a pin on the map.  
- In Step 4, the marked location was validated by confirming the pin’s presence in the Compass app.  
- The current goal builds on these steps by requiring the user to reopen the Compass app, swipe left, and select the car’s location from the list to view its position.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Follow the Compass app’s directions to reach the car.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the Compass app’s directional guidance to navigate to the car’s marked location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow these steps to reach the car:  
1. Ensure the Compass app is open and the car’s location is selected (from the "List" button).  
2. The Compass will point in the direction of the car’s marked location.  
3. Walk in the direction indicated by the Compass until the car is reached.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that the Compass app’s directions led to the car’s location.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that the user has arrived at the car by checking the surroundings and ensuring the car is physically present.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the surroundings to confirm the car is present at the location indicated by the Compass app. If the car is not found, recheck the Compass app by swiping left, selecting the car’s location, and following the directional guidance again. If the issue persists, consider if the pin was marked incorrectly and repeat the marking process from Step 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Use the iPhone Compass to find the car in a parking lot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Park the car and mark its location using the Compass app (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Return to the parking lot and use the Compass app to locate the car (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Follow the Compass app’s directions to reach the car (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
**Summary**: All subgoals have been achieved, and the main goal of finding the car using the iPhone Compass app is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
The plan to use the iPhone Compass to find a car in a parking lot has been fully executed through a series of meta-cognitive actions, including planning (forward subgoaling), implementation (reaching goals and validation), and review (tracking goals and recalling information). The process involved marking the car’s location, retrieving it in the Compass app, and following the app’s directions to locate the car, with validations to ensure accuracy. All subgoals and the main goal are now complete.
