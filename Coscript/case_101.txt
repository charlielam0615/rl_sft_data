**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case for adjusting bra straps in the back, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task must account for the constraint that adjustments occur at the back, follow the script steps ('1. Check that the straps are the right length.', '2. Try a racerback bra.', '3. Get your straps sewn in place.'), and belong to the category of Personal Care and Style. Develop a plan by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step until the task is complete.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To address the task of adjusting bra straps in the back, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Verify the strap length is appropriate.  
2. Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning.  
3. Secure the straps by having them sewn in place.  
These subgoals align with the script and constraint of adjusting straps at the back.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Adjust bra straps in the back.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify the strap length is appropriate.  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning.  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the straps by having them sewn in place.  
**Current Goal**: Verify the strap length is appropriate.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous planning step, with the current focus on checking strap length.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the strap length is appropriate. This will be achieved by checking the straps at the back to ensure they are neither too loose nor too tight, adjusting sliders if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To verify the strap length, put on the bra and stand in front of a mirror or ask someone for assistance to access the back. Check if the straps sit comfortably on the shoulders without slipping or digging in. If needed, locate the adjustment sliders at the back and slide them to shorten or lengthen the straps until the fit feels secure and comfortable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the strap length is correctly adjusted. This will be achieved by testing the straps’ fit and comfort after adjustments.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the adjusted straps by moving your arms and shoulders to ensure they stay in place without slipping or causing discomfort. If the straps still feel off, repeat the adjustment process by tweaking the sliders at the back. Confirm the fit supports the bra’s structure and aligns with the back constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Adjust bra straps in the back.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify the strap length is appropriate (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning.  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the straps by having them sewn in place.  
**Current Goal**: Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning.  
The first subgoal is complete, as the strap length has been verified and adjusted. The focus now shifts to the second subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning. This will be achieved by trying a racerback bra to see if it better aligns the straps at the back.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Obtain a racerback bra, which has straps that converge into a central point at the back, reducing slippage and improving fit. Try it on and assess whether the strap positioning at the back feels more secure and comfortable compared to a standard bra. Ensure the racerback design aligns with the constraint of adjusting straps at the back.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the racerback bra effectively adjusts strap positioning. This will be achieved by evaluating its comfort and stability at the back.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Wear the racerback bra during typical activities to test if the straps remain in place at the back without slipping or causing irritation. Check if the central strap design enhances comfort and meets the adjustment needs. If the fit is unsatisfactory, consider alternative racerback styles or revert to adjusting standard straps.  
[/IMP]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Adjust bra straps in the back.  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify the strap length is appropriate (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the straps by having them sewn in place.  
**Current Goal**: Secure the straps by having them sewn in place.  
The first two subgoals are complete, with strap length verified and racerback bra tested. The focus now is on the final subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the straps by having them sewn in place. This will be achieved by arranging for the straps to be permanently fixed at the back for a stable fit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the bra to a tailor or seamstress, or use a sewing kit if skilled. Specify that the straps should be sewn at the back to maintain their adjusted length and position, ensuring they align with the racerback or standard design tested earlier. Verify the stitching is secure and does not affect the bra’s comfort or appearance.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the straps are securely sewn and maintain proper positioning at the back. This will be achieved by testing the sewn straps for stability and comfort.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Wear the bra after the straps are sewn to ensure they remain fixed at the back during movement. Check for comfort, ensuring the stitching does not irritate the skin or compromise the bra’s fit. If any issues arise, consult the tailor for adjustments or consider alternative solutions like clip-on strap holders.  
[/IMP]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Adjust bra straps in the back (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Verify the strap length is appropriate (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Explore using a racerback bra to adjust strap positioning (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the straps by having them sewn in place (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (All goals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal of adjusting bra straps in the back is complete, with strap length verified, racerback bra tested, and straps sewn for stability.

**Conclusion**: The plan to adjust bra straps in the back has been completed by following the meta-cognitive action framework. The process involved verifying strap length, exploring a racerback bra, and securing the straps by sewing, all while adhering to the constraint of adjustments at the back and the provided script.
