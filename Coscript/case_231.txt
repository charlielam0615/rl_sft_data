### Problem Statement
The task is to prepare a broad working capital or cash flows budget for a large corporation, specifically XYZ Corporation, for the fiscal planning year. The budget will be created in a worksheet following a predefined script of steps, ensuring proper formatting and inclusion of key cash flow categories (operating, investing, and financing activities). The process must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of preparing a cash flows budget into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Set up the worksheet structure (title, headers, and formatting).  
2. Input line items and amounts for cash flow categories (operating, investing, financing).  
3. Calculate and present net cash flow and cash balances.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and will guide the implementation process.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the worksheet structure by creating a new worksheet tab, adding the title, fiscal year, and formatting headers as specified in steps 1–4 of the script. This will be achieved by executing the formatting and data entry tasks in a spreadsheet environment.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Create a new worksheet tab named "LargecorpBudget." In cell A1, enter "Large Corporation Budget, XYZ Corporation." In cell A2, enter "for the year ended December 31, 2015." In cell E1, enter "(000’s)" and format it with center alignment.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the worksheet setup (tab name, titles, and header formatting) from the previous step is correct and aligns with the script’s requirements. This will be achieved by checking the tab name, cell contents, and formatting.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm that the worksheet tab is named "LargecorpBudget." Verify that cell A1 contains "Large Corporation Budget, XYZ Corporation," cell A2 contains "for the year ended December 31, 2015," and cell E1 contains "(000’s)" with center alignment. All entries and formatting match the script’s instructions.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to format columns D and E for currency display as specified in step 5 of the script. This will be achieved by applying a custom number format to ensure amounts are displayed in thousands with dollar signs.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Select columns D and E, then apply the custom number format $#,###;$(#,###);$0 to display values in thousands with appropriate currency symbols and parentheses for negative values.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Prepare a cash flows budget for XYZ Corporation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the worksheet structure (completed: tab named, titles entered, columns formatted).  
  - Subgoal 2: Input line items and amounts for cash flow categories (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate and present net cash flow and cash balances (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Input line items and amounts for cash flow categories.  
The worksheet setup is complete, providing a foundation for entering cash flow data in the next steps.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enter the line items and amounts for the cash flow budget as per step 6 of the script. This will be achieved by adding typical cash flow line items for operating, investing, and financing activities, with placeholder amounts in thousands.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Enter the following line items and placeholder amounts in column A (descriptions) and column E (amounts, in thousands):  
- A4: Cash flows from operating activities  
  - A5: Net income, E5: $10,000  
  - A6: Depreciation, E6: $2,000  
  - A7: Changes in working capital, E7: ($1,500)  
  - A8: Net cash from operating activities, E8: $10,500 (sum of E5:E7)  
- A12: Cash flows to be used in (from) investing activities (bold)  
  - A13: Purchase of equipment, E13: ($5,000)  
  - A14: Sale of assets, E14: $1,000  
  - A15: Net cash from investing activities, E15: ($4,000) (sum of E13:E14)  
- A17: Cash flows to be used in (from) financing activities (bold)  
  - A18: Issuance of debt, E18: $3,000  
  - A19: Dividend payments, E19: ($2,000)  
  - A20: Net cash from financing activities, E20: $1,000 (sum of E18:E19)
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the line items and amounts entered in the previous step are correctly formatted and logically consistent, with bold formatting applied to specific headers as per steps 7 and 8 of the script. This will be achieved by checking cell contents, calculations, and formatting.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Confirm that line items in column A (A4:A20) match the specified descriptions and that amounts in column E (E5:E20) are correctly entered with the custom currency format. Verify that cells A12 and A17 are bolded as required. Check calculations: E8 ($10,500) is the sum of E5:E7, E15 (-$4,000) is the sum of E13:E14, and E20 ($1,000) is the sum of E18:E19. All entries and formatting are correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to enter the final cash flow calculations and balances as per steps 9–11 of the script. This will be achieved by adding the net increase in cash, beginning balance, and ending balance, with calculations based on previous entries.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Enter the following in column A and E:  
- A21: Net increase in cash and cash equivalents planned, E21: $7,500 (sum of E8, E15, E20: $10,500 - $4,000 + $1,000)  
- A22: Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of fiscal planning year, E22: $15,000 (assumed starting balance)  
- A23: Cash and cash equivalents, end of fiscal planning year, E23: $22,500 (sum of E21:E22)
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the cash flows budget. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the budget’s structure, line items, and calculations to ensure completeness and accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: Worksheet tab named "LargecorpBudget," with titles in A1 ("Large Corporation Budget, XYZ Corporation"), A2 ("for the year ended December 31, 2015"), and E1 ("(000’s)") formatted.  
- Step 4: Columns D and E formatted with custom currency format $#,###;$(#,###);$0.  
- Step 6: Line items for operating (A4:A8, E5:E8), investing (A12:A15, E13:E15, A12 bold), and financing (A17:A20, E18:E20, A17 bold) activities entered with placeholder amounts.  
- Step 8: Final calculations entered: net increase in cash (A21, E21: $7,500), beginning balance (A22, E22: $15,000), and ending balance (A23, E23: $22,500).  
All steps align with the script, and the budget is complete with consistent formatting and calculations.
