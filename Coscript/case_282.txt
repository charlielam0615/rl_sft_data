---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to choose a pattern or design for each shawl. This will be achieved by selecting crochet patterns that match the recipients’ preferences (Jane: pastel colors; Maria: bold patterns; Sarah: neutral tones) and are suitable for gifting.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Research crochet shawl patterns that align with each recipient’s style:  
- **Jane**: Select a lacy, open-stitch pattern like the “Willow Shawl” to complement her love for pastel colors.  
- **Maria**: Choose a bold, geometric pattern like the “Starburst Shawl” to match her preference for striking designs.  
- **Sarah**: Pick a simple, elegant pattern like the “Classic Triangle Shawl” in neutral tones for versatility.  
**Pattern Selections**:  
- Jane: Willow Shawl (lacy, pastel-friendly).  
- Maria: Starburst Shawl (bold, geometric).  
- Sarah: Classic Triangle Shawl (simple, neutral).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to buy the necessary yarn for each shawl. Retrieve information about the recipients’ preferences and chosen patterns to ensure the yarn matches their needs.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 3 [IMP]: Recipients are Jane (pastel colors), Maria (bold patterns), and Sarah (neutral tones).  
- From Step 5 [IMP]: Patterns selected are Willow Shawl (Jane, lacy), Starburst Shawl (Maria, geometric), and Classic Triangle Shawl (Sarah, simple).  
This information indicates the need for yarn in pastel colors (e.g., soft pink or lavender) for Jane, vibrant colors (e.g., red or blue) for Maria, and neutral colors (e.g., beige or gray) for Sarah. Yarn weight should suit each pattern (e.g., lightweight for lacy Willow, medium for Starburst and Classic Triangle).

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to buy the necessary yarn for each shawl. This will be achieved by selecting yarn based on the patterns (Willow, Starburst, Classic Triangle) and recipients’ color preferences (pastel, bold, neutral), ensuring quality suitable for gifts.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Purchase yarn based on the patterns and preferences:  
- **Jane (Willow Shawl)**: 400 yards of lightweight (fingering weight) yarn in soft lavender.  
- **Maria (Starburst Shawl)**: 450 yards of medium (worsted weight) yarn in vibrant red.  
- **Sarah (Classic Triangle Shawl)**: 400 yards of medium (worsted weight) yarn in beige.  
Source high-quality yarn from a reputable supplier (e.g., local craft store or online retailer like Lion Brand or KnitPicks) to ensure the shawls are gift-worthy.  
**Yarn Purchases**:  
- Jane: 400 yards, fingering weight, lavender.  
- Maria: 450 yards, worsted weight, red.  
- Sarah: 400 yards, worsted weight, beige.

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Reassess the subgoals to ensure the crocheting process is feasible, considering time and skill level for the chosen patterns.

[/PLANNING]
The patterns (Willow, Starburst, Classic Triangle) vary in complexity. The Willow Shawl (lacy) requires advanced skills, Starburst (geometric) is intermediate, and Classic Triangle is beginner-friendly. Adjust the crocheting subgoal to prioritize Sarah’s shawl first (easiest), then Maria’s, and finally Jane’s to build confidence and manage time effectively. Update the subgoal order: crochet Sarah’s shawl, then Maria’s, then Jane’s.

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to crochet each shawl following the chosen patterns. Start with Sarah’s Classic Triangle Shawl (beige, worsted weight) due to its simplicity, as adjusted in Step 8.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Follow the Classic Triangle Shawl pattern using 400 yards of beige worsted weight yarn. The pattern involves basic stitches (chain, double crochet) to create a triangular shape. Work consistently, checking gauge to ensure proper sizing (approximately 60” wide x 30” deep). Complete Sarah’s shawl, ensuring neat edges and secure weaving of ends for a polished, gift-ready finish.

[/IMP]
