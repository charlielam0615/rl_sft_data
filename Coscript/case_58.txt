### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for applying Command Strips on a rough surface to hang an object, following the provided script while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The framework requires selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, with content organized into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The constraint is that the surface is rough, and the script provides six steps to achieve the task.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of applying Command Strips on a rough surface into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project.  
2. Prepare the rough surface by cleaning it.  
3. Attach the strips to the surface.  
4. Secure the strips by pressing them.  
5. Allow time for the adhesive to set.  
6. Hang the object on the strips.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Apply Command Strips on a rough surface to hang an object.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project.  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the rough surface by cleaning it.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach the strips to the surface.  
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the strips by pressing them.  
  - Subgoal 5: Allow time for the adhesive to set.  
  - Subgoal 6: Hang the object on the strips.  
**Current Goal:** Select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project. This will be achieved by considering the weight of the object, the roughness of the surface, and the types of Command Strips available, ensuring compatibility with rough surfaces.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To select the right Command Strips, verify the weight of the object to be hung and check the product specifications for strips designed for rough surfaces, such as Command Outdoor Strips or Heavy-Duty Strips. Rough surfaces may reduce adhesive effectiveness, so choose strips with higher weight capacity than the object’s weight to ensure a secure hold. For example, if the object weighs 5 pounds, select strips rated for at least 7-8 pounds. Confirm the strip type matches the project (e.g., general-purpose or picture-hanging strips).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the selected Command Strips are appropriate for the rough surface and project. This will be achieved by cross-checking the strip specifications against the surface type and object weight.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that the chosen Command Strips are suitable for rough surfaces by checking the packaging or manufacturer’s guidelines, which should indicate compatibility with textured surfaces like brick, stucco, or unfinished wood. Confirm the weight capacity of the strips exceeds the object’s weight by at least 20-30% to account for reduced adhesion on rough surfaces. If the strips are not suitable, select an alternative type or consult the manufacturer’s website for recommendations.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the subgoals to ensure they account for the rough surface constraint. Adjust Subgoal 2 to emphasize thorough cleaning, as rough surfaces may harbor more debris, which could affect adhesion. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project.  
2. Thoroughly clean the rough surface to remove debris and ensure adhesion.  
3. Attach the strips to the surface.  
4. Secure the strips by pressing them firmly.  
5. Allow time for the adhesive to set.  
6. Hang the object on the strips.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Apply Command Strips on a rough surface to hang an object.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select appropriate Command Strips for the rough surface and project (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Thoroughly clean the rough surface to remove debris and ensure adhesion.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach the strips to the surface.  
  - Subgoal 4: Secure the strips by pressing them firmly.  
  - Subgoal 5: Allow time for the adhesive to set.  
  - Subgoal 6: Hang the object on the strips.  
**Current Goal:** Thoroughly clean the rough surface to remove debris and ensure adhesion.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to thoroughly clean the rough surface to remove debris and ensure adhesion. This will be achieved by using rubbing alcohol and a cloth or brush to clean the surface, ensuring it is dry before applying the strips.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol, at least 70%) and a clean cloth or a soft-bristled brush to scrub the rough surface, removing dirt, dust, and oils. For textured surfaces like stucco or brick, focus on the area where the strips will be applied, as debris in crevices can weaken adhesion. Allow the surface to air-dry completely (typically 5-10 minutes) to ensure no moisture remains, as this could affect the adhesive.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to attach the Command Strips to the rough surface. This will be achieved by following the manufacturer’s instructions for applying the strips, ensuring proper alignment and contact with the surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Peel off the backing from one side of the Command Strip and apply it firmly to the cleaned, dry rough surface, ensuring full contact with the textured area. If the surface is highly uneven, consider applying multiple strips or larger strips to increase contact points. Align the strips according to the object’s hanging requirements (e.g., level for picture frames).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to secure the strips by pressing them firmly. This will be achieved by applying consistent pressure to each strip for 30 seconds to maximize adhesion to the rough surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Press each Command Strip firmly against the rough surface for 30 seconds, using steady, even pressure. Ensure the entire strip is in contact with the surface, especially on textured areas where adhesion may be weaker. If multiple strips are used, press each one individually to avoid uneven application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to allow time for the adhesive to set. This will be achieved by waiting one hour without disturbing the strips to ensure a strong bond on the rough surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wait one hour after pressing the strips to allow the adhesive to fully set. Avoid touching or applying weight to the strips during this time, as premature loading could weaken the bond, especially on a rough surface where adhesion is already challenging.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to hang the object on the Command Strips. This will be achieved by attaching the object to the strips according to the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring proper alignment and secure attachment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Attach the object to the Command Strips by pressing it firmly onto the adhesive side of the strips. Ensure the object is aligned correctly (e.g., level for picture frames) and that all strips are engaged. If the object has a backing strip, remove it and press the object against the wall-mounted strip for a few seconds to secure it. Verify the object is stable and does not wobble or shift.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the object is securely hung on the rough surface. This will be achieved by checking the stability of the object and the adhesion of the strips.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Gently test the object’s stability by applying light pressure to ensure it remains firmly attached. Check for any signs of the strips peeling or the object shifting. If the object feels unstable, remove it, re-evaluate the strip placement or type, and repeat the application process if necessary. For rough surfaces, confirm that the strips are adhering well to the textured areas.  
[/IMP]
