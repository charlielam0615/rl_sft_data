### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for making a Zelo mask using supplies that are delivered, following a provided script of steps and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) with Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. The process must be broken down into steps, each using one action from the meta-cognitive action set, and presented in the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate. The constraint is that the supplies are delivered, and the task falls under the Arts and Entertainment category. The script provides 12 steps to complete the mask, which will guide the planning and implementation.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making a Zelo mask into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The main goal is to create a wearable Zelo mask using delivered supplies. Subgoals include:  
1. Ensure supplies are received.  
2. Prepare materials by unpacking and organizing.  
3. Shape the mask by cutting felt and forming its structure.  
4. Add decorative elements (Totomato's symbol).  
5. Attach elastic to make the mask wearable.  
6. Finalize and wear the mask.  
These subgoals align with the script’s steps and will guide subsequent actions.  
[/PLANNING]

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure supplies are received. This will be achieved by confirming the delivery of the supplies needed for the Zelo mask, such as light blue felt, a black marker, elastic, and a yarn or tapestry needle, as implied by the script.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the delivery status of the supplies (light blue felt, black marker, elastic, yarn/tapestry needle). If not yet delivered, monitor the delivery tracking or contact the supplier. Once confirmed delivered, verify all items are present as per the script’s requirements.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure supplies are received. Validate that all necessary supplies for the Zelo mask have been delivered and are ready for use.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the delivered package to confirm it contains light blue felt, a black marker, elastic, and a yarn or tapestry needle. Ensure all items are in good condition and sufficient for the mask-making process as outlined in the script. If any item is missing or damaged, reorder or replace it before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to prepare materials by unpacking and organizing. This will be achieved by unpacking the delivered supplies and setting them up for the mask-making process, as per the script’s second step: “Unpack supplies.”  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the delivered package and remove the light blue felt, black marker, elastic, and yarn/tapestry needle. Lay them out on a clean workspace, ensuring all items are accessible and organized for the subsequent steps of cutting and assembling the mask.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to account for the progress made and the script’s progression. Since supplies are unpacked, adjust the focus to shaping the mask. Update Subgoal 3 to include specific actions from the script: cutting the felt, finding center points, cutting corners, and notching edges. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Ensure supplies are received (completed).  
2. Prepare materials by unpacking and organizing (completed).  
3. Shape the mask by cutting felt, marking centers, cutting corners, and notching edges.  
4. Add decorative elements (Totomato’s symbol).  
5. Attach elastic to make the mask wearable.  
6. Finalize and wear the mask.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to shape the mask by cutting the felt. This will be achieved by following the script’s third step: “Cut a piece of light blue felt in half lengthwise.”  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the light blue felt and use scissors to cut it in half lengthwise, creating two equal pieces. Select one piece for the mask, as the script implies working with a single piece for the subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to shape the mask by marking center points. This will be achieved by following the script’s fourth step: “Find the center of the top edge and the two side edges.”  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the selected piece of cut felt. Measure and mark the center of the top edge and the centers of both side edges using a pencil or fabric marker to ensure accurate cuts in the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to shape the mask by cutting corners. This will be achieved by following the script’s fifth step: “Cut off the top corners.”  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using scissors, cut off the top corners of the felt piece at an angle, starting from the marked center of the top edge, to form the basic mask shape as implied by the script. Ensure the cuts are symmetrical for a balanced appearance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to shape the mask by notching edges. This will be achieved by following the script’s sixth step: “Cut notches into the side edges.”  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
At the marked centers of the two side edges of the felt, cut small notches to create attachment points for the elastic, as implied by the script’s later steps for threading elastic. Ensure the notches are large enough to hold the elastic securely but not so large as to weaken the felt.  
[/IMP]
