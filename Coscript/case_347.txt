[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to gather all necessary materials for creating the fake wound. This will be achieved by identifying and collecting the required items, such as the prosthetic, adhesive, makeup, fake blood, and cutting tools.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, compile a list of materials based on the script:  
- Prosthetic material (e.g., silicone or latex prosthetic piece).  
- Cutting tools (e.g., scissors or craft knife).  
- Prosthetic adhesive (e.g., spirit gum or medical-grade adhesive).  
- Makeup kit (e.g., foundation, concealer, or special effects makeup for blending).  
- Fake blood (e.g., stage blood or DIY blood mixture).  
- Additional tools: makeup brushes, sponges, and cleaning supplies (e.g., alcohol wipes).  
Ensure all items are accessible before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all materials are gathered. This will be achieved by checking the availability and suitability of each item listed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify that all materials are present:  
- Confirm the prosthetic is suitable for cutting and skin application.  
- Check that cutting tools are sharp and precise.  
- Ensure the adhesive is safe for skin use and has sufficient quantity.  
- Verify the makeup kit contains colors matching the skin tone.  
- Confirm the fake blood is realistic and non-toxic.  
- Ensure brushes, sponges, and cleaning supplies are ready.  
If any item is missing or unsuitable, acquire or replace it before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to shape the prosthetic to the desired size and form. This will be achieved by using cutting tools to trim and sculpt the prosthetic to resemble a wound.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Take the prosthetic and use scissors or a craft knife to carefully cut it into the desired shape (e.g., an irregular gash or laceration). Ensure the edges are uneven for realism. Test the size by placing it on the target skin area and adjust as needed to fit naturally.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the prosthetic is correctly shaped. This will be achieved by checking the prosthetic’s size, shape, and fit on the skin.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the cut prosthetic on the target skin area to verify it looks realistic and fits comfortably. Check for any sharp edges or unnatural shapes. If adjustments are needed, trim further or reshape to ensure the prosthetic aligns with the desired wound appearance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure the prosthetic with adhesive. This will be achieved by applying prosthetic adhesive to the back of the prosthetic piece.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Clean the prosthetic’s back surface with an alcohol wipe to remove any residue. Apply a thin, even layer of prosthetic adhesive (e.g., spirit gum) to the back of the prosthetic using a brush or applicator. Allow the adhesive to become tacky, following product instructions, to ensure strong adhesion.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the prosthetic to the skin. This will be achieved by carefully placing the prosthetic on the target skin area and pressing it to secure adhesion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Clean the target skin area with an alcohol wipe to ensure it is free of oils or dirt. Carefully position the prosthetic on the skin, aligning it with the desired wound location. Press gently but firmly to secure it, starting from the center and moving outward to avoid air bubbles or wrinkles. Hold for a few seconds to ensure it adheres properly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the prosthetic is securely attached. This will be achieved by checking the adhesion and appearance of the prosthetic on the skin.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the prosthetic to confirm it is firmly attached with no lifting edges. Gently tug at the edges to test adhesion. Check that the prosthetic looks natural on the skin and aligns with the wound design. If any areas are loose, apply additional adhesive and press again.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to blend the prosthetic edges using makeup for a realistic look. This will be achieved by applying makeup to seamlessly integrate the prosthetic with the surrounding skin.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a makeup sponge or brush, apply foundation or special effects makeup that matches the skin tone around the prosthetic edges. Blend carefully to smooth the transition between the prosthetic and skin. Add subtle shading or bruising effects with makeup to enhance realism, ensuring no visible seams remain.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add fake blood to enhance the wound effect. This will be achieved by applying fake blood to the prosthetic to simulate a fresh wound.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply fake blood to the center of the prosthetic using a brush or dropper, allowing it to pool naturally to mimic a fresh wound. Add small amounts to the edges or surrounding skin for a dripping effect, if desired. Ensure the blood application looks realistic and not excessive.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all steps have been completed and highlight the final state.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Create a fake wound using a prosthetic.  
  - Subgoal 1: Gather all necessary materials for creating the fake wound (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Shape the prosthetic to the desired size and form (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Secure the prosthetic with adhesive (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Attach the prosthetic to the skin (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Blend the prosthetic edges using makeup for a realistic look (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Add fake blood to enhance the wound effect (Completed).  
**Current State**: All subgoals have been completed, resulting in a realistic fake wound using a prosthetic.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the final fake wound’s realism and durability. This will be achieved by inspecting the overall appearance and testing the prosthetic’s stability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the fake wound under different lighting to ensure the makeup and blood look realistic. Check that the prosthetic remains securely attached during light movement. Make any final touch-ups with makeup or blood to perfect the appearance. If the prosthetic is loose or the makeup needs adjustment, reapply adhesive or blend further.  
[/IMP]

**Completion**: The plan to simulate a fake wound with a prosthetic is complete, with all steps from the script executed and validated for realism and quality.
