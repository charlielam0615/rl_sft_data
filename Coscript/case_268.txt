**Current Goal**: Incorporate regular exercise suitable for managing low blood pressure (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to incorporate regular exercise suitable for managing low blood pressure. This will be achieved by identifying and scheduling appropriate exercises, such as low-intensity aerobic activities (e.g., walking, cycling), which are known to improve circulation and stabilize blood pressure.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve Subgoal 1, select exercises like 30-minute brisk walking or light cycling 5 days a week. Schedule sessions at consistent times, preferably in the morning, to establish a routine. Consult a healthcare provider to ensure exercises are safe for the individual’s condition. Start with 15-minute sessions and gradually increase to 30 minutes as endurance improves.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the exercise plan for Subgoal 1. This will be achieved by checking if the selected exercises are safe, sustainable, and effective for managing low blood pressure.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that brisk walking and light cycling are low-impact and promote circulation without causing dizziness or fainting, common with low blood pressure. Confirm the plan includes a gradual increase in duration to avoid strain. Check with a medical professional to ensure compatibility with the individual’s health status. Monitor symptoms during initial sessions to ensure no adverse effects like lightheadedness occur.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Treat low blood pressure by exercising.  
  - Subgoal 1: Incorporate regular exercise suitable for managing low blood pressure (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure exercise is performed safely without overexertion.  
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize risks by avoiding sudden positional changes during exercise.  
  - Subgoal 4: Support exercise with adequate hydration to maintain blood pressure.  
**Current Goal**: Ensure exercise is performed safely without overexertion (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure exercise is performed safely without overexertion. This will be achieved by setting intensity guidelines and monitoring physical responses during exercise.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a heart rate monitor to keep exercise intensity within 50-70% of maximum heart rate (calculated as 220 minus age). Include warm-up and cool-down periods of 5-10 minutes to prevent strain. Stop immediately if symptoms like dizziness or fatigue occur. Perform exercises in a safe environment, such as a flat surface, to avoid injury.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the safety measures for Subgoal 2. This will be achieved by ensuring the exercise intensity and environment are appropriate and no adverse symptoms arise.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm that the heart rate stays within the target range during exercise sessions. Check that warm-up and cool-down periods are followed consistently. Monitor for symptoms of overexertion (e.g., excessive fatigue, shortness of breath) during and after exercise. Ensure the exercise environment is free of hazards and conducive to safe movement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Treat low blood pressure by exercising.  
  - Subgoal 1: Incorporate regular exercise suitable for managing low blood pressure (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure exercise is performed safely without overexertion (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize risks by avoiding sudden positional changes during exercise.  
  - Subgoal 4: Support exercise with adequate hydration to maintain blood pressure.  
**Current Goal**: Minimize risks by avoiding sudden positional changes during exercise (Subgoal 3).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to minimize risks by avoiding sudden positional changes during exercise. This will be achieved by incorporating techniques to maintain stable blood pressure during movement transitions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Incorporate slow transitions between sitting, standing, or lying positions during exercise. For example, pause briefly after standing from a seated stretch to allow blood pressure to stabilize. Avoid exercises requiring rapid posture changes, like burpees. Practice controlled breathing during transitions to support circulation. Perform exercises in a seated or supported position if dizziness occurs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the measures for avoiding sudden positional changes in Subgoal 3. This will be achieved by ensuring transitions are slow and symptoms of low blood pressure are absent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe that transitions between positions take at least 5-10 seconds to prevent blood pressure drops. Monitor for symptoms like dizziness or lightheadedness during transitions. Confirm that exercises avoid rapid posture changes and include controlled breathing. Adjust the routine if any discomfort or instability is reported.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
