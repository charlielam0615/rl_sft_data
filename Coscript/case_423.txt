**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to create and share a meme on Facebook, adhering to the provided constraints and script. The task involves finding a funny image, adding text to create a meme, posting it on Facebook, and waiting for engagement (likes, comments, shares). The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of creating and sharing a meme on Facebook into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme.  
2. Add appropriate text to the image to enhance its humor or message.  
3. Post the completed meme on Facebook.  
4. Monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Create and share a meme on Facebook.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add appropriate text to the image to enhance its humor or message.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Post the completed meme on Facebook.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares.  
**Current Goal**: Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme.  
**How to Achieve**: Search for royalty-free, humorous images online or use a personal image that aligns with Facebook‚Äôs community standards and has viral potential (e.g., relatable or trendy content). Select an image that is clear and visually appealing for meme creation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Search for royalty-free images on platforms like Unsplash, Pexels, or meme-specific sites like KnowYourMeme. Focus on images with high engagement potential, such as animals, pop culture references, or relatable scenarios. For example, select an image of a confused dog, which is universally relatable and likely to resonate with a wide audience. Verify the image complies with Facebook‚Äôs guidelines (no explicit content, hate speech, etc.). Download a high-resolution version of the chosen image for editing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the selected image is suitable for meme creation and posting on Facebook.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the image for quality, relevance, and compliance with Facebook‚Äôs community standards to confirm it‚Äôs appropriate for the next step of adding text.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Review the selected image (e.g., the confused dog). Confirm it is high-resolution (at least 1080x1080 pixels for optimal Facebook display), free of watermarks, and aligns with the humorous intent. Cross-check against Facebook‚Äôs Community Standards to ensure it contains no prohibited content (e.g., violence, nudity). The image is clear, relatable, and suitable for text overlay, making it valid for meme creation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the subgoals to ensure clarity and specificity for the next steps. Update Subgoal 2 to specify the type of text and tools for editing, and ensure Subgoal 4 includes a time frame for monitoring engagement. Updated subgoals:  
1. Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme (completed).  
2. Use an image editing tool to add witty, concise text to the image that enhances its humor or relatability.  
3. Post the completed meme on Facebook.  
4. Monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares over a 24-hour period.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals

Updated goal hierarchy:  
- **Main Goal**: Create and share a meme on Facebook.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify and select a humorous image suitable for a meme (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Use an image editing tool to add witty, concise text to the image that enhances its humor or relatability.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Post the completed meme on Facebook.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares over a 24-hour period.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use an image editing tool to add witty, concise text to the selected image.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a user-friendly editing tool like Canva or Photoshop to add bold, readable text to the image. Craft text that is humorous, relatable, and concise, ensuring it complements the image‚Äôs context.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Open the selected image (confused dog) in Canva. Choose a bold, sans-serif font (e.g., Impact) in white with a black outline for readability. Add text: ‚ÄúTop: WHEN YOUR BOSS CALLS YOU ON YOUR DAY OFF / Bottom: BUT YOU ALREADY PLANNED A NETFLIX MARATHON.‚Äù Ensure text is centered, sized appropriately (e.g., 50-70 pt), and positioned to avoid obscuring key image elements. Save the meme as a PNG for high quality.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the edited meme is ready for posting on Facebook.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the meme for text clarity, humor, and compliance with Facebook‚Äôs guidelines, ensuring it‚Äôs optimized for engagement.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the meme: the text is legible, the humor is relatable (work-life balance theme), and the image quality remains high. Verify compliance with Facebook‚Äôs Community Standards (no offensive content). Test visibility by viewing the meme on a mobile device to ensure text size and placement are effective. The meme is ready for posting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Post the completed meme on Facebook.  
**How to Achieve**: Log into a Facebook account, create a post with the meme, and add a caption to boost engagement. Share the post publicly or in relevant groups for maximum reach.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Log into Facebook. Create a new post, upload the meme PNG, and add a caption: ‚ÄúWho else feels this struggle? üòÖ #WorkLife #Meme.‚Äù Set the post to public to maximize visibility. Optionally, share the meme in relevant Facebook groups (e.g., meme or humor groups) while adhering to group rules. Click ‚ÄúPost‚Äù to publish.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Core Content**: Information related to monitoring engagement on the Facebook post.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares over a 24-hour period. Previous steps confirm the meme was posted publicly with a relatable caption to encourage engagement. No prior engagement data exists yet, as the post was just created.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Monitor the post for likes, comments, and shares over a 24-hour period.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the post periodically on Facebook for engagement metrics and respond to comments to boost visibility.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Monitor the post at intervals (e.g., 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours) via Facebook‚Äôs notifications or post analytics. Record likes, comments, and shares. Engage with comments by liking or replying (e.g., ‚ÄúGlad you relate!‚Äù) to increase algorithmic visibility. After 24 hours, note final engagement metrics (e.g., 50 likes, 10 comments, 5 shares) for future reference.
