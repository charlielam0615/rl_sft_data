### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for a self-employed person to obtain proof of earnings by creating and presenting profit and loss statements. The process involves knowing expenses, determining income, calculating net profit or loss, and showing the profit and loss statements to creditors, as outlined in the provided script. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and adhere to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 2: Organize Goal Hierarchy

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, integrating information from the recent planning step, and highlighting the current goal.  
- **Main Goal**: Obtain proof of earnings for a self-employed person by showing profit and loss statements.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and categorize all business and personal expenses. (Current Goal)  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate total income, including earned income and savings.  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute net profit or loss by subtracting expenses from income.  
  - Subgoal 4: Prepare and present profit and loss statements to creditors.  
The current goal is to identify and categorize all business and personal expenses.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Identify and Categorize Expenses

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify and categorize all business and personal expenses. This will be achieved by gathering financial records, listing all expenses, and organizing them into business (e.g., supplies, utilities, marketing) and personal (e.g., rent, groceries) categories.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of identifying and categorizing expenses:  
1. Collect financial records such as bank statements, receipts, and invoices for the relevant period.  
2. List all expenses, distinguishing between business expenses (e.g., office supplies, travel, advertising) and personal expenses (e.g., mortgage, utilities, food).  
3. Organize expenses into a table or spreadsheet with columns for date, description, category (business or personal), and amount.  
4. Verify completeness by cross-checking with bank statements to ensure no expenses are missed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Review Progress on Expense Identification

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the identification and categorization of business and personal expenses, focusing on the process and output of Step 3. Retrieve relevant information to ensure the current goal was addressed properly.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal was to identify and categorize all business and personal expenses. From Step 3:  
- Financial records (bank statements, receipts, invoices) were collected.  
- Expenses were listed and categorized into business (e.g., supplies, marketing) and personal (e.g., rent, groceries).  
- A table or spreadsheet was created to organize expenses by date, description, category, and amount.  
- Completeness was verified by cross-checking with bank statements.  
This information confirms that the expense identification process was systematic and comprehensive, providing a foundation for calculating total expenses in the next steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Income

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate total income, including earned income and money saved. This will be achieved by gathering income records, identifying all sources of earned income (e.g., sales, services) and savings (e.g., cost reductions), and summing them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal of calculating total income:  
1. Gather income records, such as invoices, payment receipts, or bank deposits, for the relevant period.  
2. Identify all sources of earned income, such as revenue from services, product sales, or freelance work.  
3. Include any money saved, such as discounts received or cost-saving measures (e.g., negotiating lower rates with suppliers).  
4. Sum all income sources to calculate total income, documenting the breakdown in a spreadsheet for clarity.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validate Income Calculation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the income calculation from Step 5. This will be achieved by cross-checking income records against bank statements and ensuring all sources are accounted for.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the income calculation:  
1. Compare the listed income sources (from Step 5) with bank deposits and payment records to confirm accuracy.  
2. Check for any missing income sources, such as unreported sales or unrecorded savings.  
3. Recalculate the total income to ensure no errors in summation.  
4. Document any discrepancies and resolve them by updating the income records if needed.  
The validated total income will be used for the profit and loss calculation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Compute Net Profit or Loss

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute net profit or loss by subtracting total expenses from total income. This will be achieved by using the categorized expenses from Step 3 and the validated income from Step 6 to perform the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute net profit or loss:  
1. Retrieve the total expenses from the categorized expense table (Step 3).  
2. Retrieve the validated total income from Step 6.  
3. Subtract total expenses from total income to calculate net profit (if positive) or net loss (if negative).  
4. Record the result in a profit and loss statement format, including total income, total expenses, and net profit/loss.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Prepare Profit and Loss Statement

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare a profit and loss statement. This will be achieved by organizing the income, expenses, and net profit/loss into a clear, professional format suitable for creditors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the profit and loss statement:  
1. Create a document or spreadsheet titled “Profit and Loss Statement” for the relevant period.  
2. List total income (from Step 6) at the top, broken down by source if required.  
3. List total expenses (from Step 3), categorized into business and personal expenses.  
4. Show the net profit or loss (from Step 7) at the bottom.  
5. Format the statement clearly, ensuring it includes the business name, period covered, and date.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Review Goal Hierarchy Before Final Step

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting progress and highlighting the current goal.  
- **Main Goal**: Obtain proof of earnings for a self-employed person by showing profit and loss statements.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and categorize all business and personal expenses. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate total income, including earned income and savings. (Completed)

### Step 10: Present Profit and Loss Statement to Creditors

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to present the profit and loss statement to creditors. This will be achieved by delivering the prepared statement (from Step 8) to creditors in the required format (e.g., PDF, printed copy) and ensuring it meets their expectations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To present the profit and loss statement:  
1. Confirm the creditors’ requirements for submission (e.g., digital copy via email, printed document).  
2. Export the profit and loss statement (from Step 8) into the required format, such as PDF or printed hardcopy.  
3. Submit the statement to creditors, ensuring it includes all necessary details (business name, period, net profit/loss).  
4. Follow up with creditors to confirm receipt and address any additional requests for information.  
[/IMP]
