### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Cast on stitches to start the scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Select an appropriate number of stitches based on the desired scarf width (e.g., 40 stitches for a medium-width scarf) and use a knitting needle to perform a long-tail cast-on technique, ensuring a firm but flexible edge.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a knitting needle (e.g., size US 8 for medium-weight yarn), perform the long-tail cast-on:  
1. Measure a yarn tail approximately 4 times the desired scarf width (e.g., 20 inches for a 5-inch-wide scarf).  
2. Make a slipknot and place it on the knitting needle.  
3. Hold the needle in your right hand, with the yarn tail over your thumb and the working yarn over your index finger.  
4. Cast on 40 stitches (adjust based on yarn weight and needle size for desired width).  
5. Ensure stitches are even and not too tight.  
This step establishes the foundation for the scarf, meeting the constraint of using a knitting needle.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the cast-on stitches are correct and suitable for the scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the number of stitches, their tension, and alignment on the knitting needle to confirm they meet the requirements for the scarf’s width and structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Count the stitches on the knitting needle to verify there are 40 (or the intended number).  
2. Inspect the tension: stitches should slide easily on the needle but not be loose or uneven.  
3. Check that the cast-on edge is straight and flexible, suitable for a scarf.  
4. If any issues are found (e.g., incorrect stitch count or uneven tension), undo and recast as needed.  
This validation ensures the scarf’s foundation is correct before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Knit the scarf to the desired length.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the knitting needle to knit every row in garter stitch (knit stitch for every row) until the scarf reaches the desired length (e.g., 60 inches for an adult scarf).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Hold the knitting needle with cast-on stitches in your left hand and an empty needle in your right.  
2. Knit each row using the garter stitch: insert the right needle into the first stitch, wrap the yarn, pull through, and slide the stitch off the left needle.  
3. Continue knitting every row, checking periodically to ensure the scarf width remains consistent (approximately 5 inches).  
4. Measure the scarf length periodically; stop when it reaches 60 inches (or desired length).  
5. Maintain even tension to ensure a uniform texture.  
This step builds the main body of the scarf using the knitting needle as required.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the scarf has reached the desired length and maintains consistent quality.  
**How to Achieve**: Measure the scarf’s length, check stitch consistency, and ensure no errors (e.g., dropped stitches) before proceeding to bind off.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Measure the scarf’s length using a tape measure; confirm it is approximately 60 inches (or desired length).  
2. Inspect the fabric for consistent stitch size and width (approximately 5 inches).  
3. Check for errors such as dropped stitches or uneven edges; fix any issues by unraveling and re-knitting affected rows.  
4. Ensure the knitting needle is still appropriate for the yarn and stitch tension.  
This validation ensures the scarf body is complete and ready for the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Bind off stitches to complete the scarf body.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the knitting needle to perform a standard bind-off technique, creating a secure edge for the scarf.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Knit the first two stitches on the left needle.  
2. Lift the first stitch over the second stitch and off the right needle.  
3. Knit the next stitch and repeat the process until one stitch remains.  
4. Cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch tail, and pull it through the final stitch to secure.  
5. Weave in the yarn tail using a tapestry needle.  
This completes the scarf body, maintaining the use of the knitting needle.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the remaining subgoals to account for the constraint of using a knitting needle, particularly for the hood creation. Adjust Subgoal 5 (“Make the hood”) to specify that the hood will be knitted (not crocheted) to align with the knitting needle constraint. Updated subgoals:  
1. Cast on stitches to start the scarf (Completed).  
2. Knit the scarf to the desired length (Completed).  
3. Bind off stitches to complete the scarf body (Completed).  
4. Sew the side seams to shape the scarf.  
5. Knit the hood separately using the knitting needle.  
6. Attach the hood to the scarf.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sew the side seams to shape the scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a tapestry needle and yarn to sew the side seams, creating a structured scarf shape, while ensuring the knitting needle constraint is respected (no knitting needle used for sewing).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Fold the scarf if necessary to create the desired shape (e.g., a wider scarf may not need folding).  
2. Thread a tapestry needle with matching yarn.  
3. Use a whip stitch or mattress stitch to sew the side seams along the edges, if shaping is required (e.g., for a tapered or structured scarf).  
4. Secure the yarn and weave in ends.  
This step shapes the scarf, adhering to the script while using tools appropriate for sewing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Knit the hood separately using the knitting needle.  
**How to Achieve**: Cast on stitches for the hood, knit a rectangular piece large enough to form a hood (e.g., 20 inches wide by 15 inches tall), and bind off using the knitting needle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Using the same knitting needle (e.g., US 8), cast on 80 stitches (adjust for yarn and desired hood width, approximately 20 inches).  
2. Knit in garter stitch (knit every row) for 15 inches to create a rectangular hood piece.  
3. Bind off stitches using the same method as the scarf (knit two, pass first over second, etc.).  
4. Cut the yarn, leaving a tail, and secure the final stitch.  
This creates the hood, adhering to the knitting needle constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the hood creation and attachment to ensure proper integration with the scarf, focusing on the knitting needle constraint and seam techniques.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Attach the hood to the scarf.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- From Step 11: The hood is a knitted rectangle (20 inches wide by 15 inches tall) made with the knitting needle in garter stitch.  
- From Step 10: Sewing techniques (whip stitch or mattress stitch) were used for the scarf’s side seams, which can be applied to attach the hood.  
- From Step 3: The scarf’s cast-on edge (approximately 5 inches wide) will serve as the attachment point for the hood.  
This information ensures the hood’s size and attachment method align with the scarf’s structure and the knitting needle constraint.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 13: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Attach the hood to the scarf.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a tapestry needle to sew the hood’s base to the center of the scarf’s length, ensuring a secure and aesthetically pleasing attachment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Fold the hood rectangle in half widthwise and sew the top seam using a tapestry needle and whip stitch to form the hood shape.  
2. Position the hood’s base (the cast-on edge) at the midpoint of the scarf (approximately 30 inches from one end for a 60-inch scarf).  
3. Sew the hood’s base to the scarf using a mattress stitch for a seamless look, ensuring even stitching.  
4. Weave in all remaining yarn ends.  
This completes the hooded scarf, integrating the hood with the scarf body.
