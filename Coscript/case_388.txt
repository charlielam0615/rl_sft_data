[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the smartphone’s wattage.  
**How to Achieve**: Research typical smartphone wattage, as specific wattage depends on the model. Use an average value for a standard smartphone if no specific model is provided.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Smartphone wattage varies by model, but a typical smartphone consumes about 5–10 watts during active use (e.g., screen on, apps running). For this simulation, assume an average wattage of 7 watts, as no specific model is provided.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the duration of phone usage in hours.  
**How to Achieve**: Define a reasonable usage time for the simulation, as no specific duration is provided.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assume the smartphone is used for 2 hours, a typical daily active usage time for a user.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert wattage to kilowatts.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the wattage (7 watts) by 1000 to convert to kilowatts.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Wattage = 7 watts.  
Kilowatts = 7 / 1000 = 0.007 kilowatts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert usage time from hours to seconds.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the usage time (2 hours) by 3600 (number of seconds in an hour).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Usage time = 2 hours.  
Seconds = 2 × 3600 = 7200 seconds.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of conversions (wattage to kilowatts and hours to seconds).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculations for accuracy and ensure units are consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Wattage conversion: 7 watts / 1000 = 0.007 kilowatts. Correct, as 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.  
- Time conversion: 2 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 7200 seconds. Correct, as 1 hour = 3600 seconds.  
Both conversions are accurate and consistent with standard units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the energy consumption of a smartphone in joules.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the smartphone’s wattage (completed: 7 watts).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the duration of phone usage in hours (completed: 2 hours).  
  - Subgoal 3: Convert wattage to kilowatts (completed: 0.007 kilowatts).  
  - Subgoal 4: Convert usage time from hours to seconds (completed: 7200 seconds).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate power by multiplying kilowatts by hours (current focus).  
  - Subgoal 6: Calculate energy by multiplying power by seconds.  
  - Subgoal 7: Convert the resulting energy to joules.  
**Current Goal**: Calculate power by multiplying kilowatts by hours.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate power by multiplying kilowatts by hours.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the converted kilowatts (0.007) by the usage time in hours (2).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Power = 0.007 kilowatts × 2 hours = 0.014 kilowatt-hours.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate energy by multiplying power by seconds.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the power (0.014 kilowatt-hours) by the usage time in seconds (7200), noting that this step may require unit clarification.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The script suggests multiplying power (kilowatt-hours) by seconds, but this is dimensionally inconsistent, as kilowatt-hours is already an energy unit (1 kilowatt-hour = 3.6 × 10^6 joules). Multiplying by seconds (time) would yield incorrect units. Instead, interpret this step as a check that power is in kilowatts and time is in seconds for energy calculation in joules later. Since power is already calculated as 0.014 kilowatt-hours, proceed to the next step for joules conversion.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The script’s step 6 (“Calculate energy by multiplying power by seconds”) is dimensionally incorrect. Adjust Subgoal 6 to: “Use the power in kilowatt-hours for the final conversion to joules.” Revised subgoals:  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the smartphone’s wattage (completed: 7 watts).  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the duration of phone usage in hours (completed: 2 hours).  
- Subgoal 3: Convert wattage to kilowatts (completed: 0.007 kilowatts).  
- Subgoal 4: Convert usage time from hours to seconds (completed: 7200 seconds).  
- Subgoal 5: Calculate power by multiplying kilowatts by hours (completed: 0.014 kilowatt-hours).  
- Subgoal 6: Use the power in kilowatt-hours for the final conversion to joules (current focus).  
- Subgoal 7: Convert the resulting energy to joules.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert the energy (0.014 kilowatt-hours) to joules.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the energy in kilowatt-hours by 3.6 × 10^6 (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 3.6 × 10^6 joules).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Energy = 0.014 kilowatt-hours × 3.6 × 10^6 joules/kilowatt-hour = 0.014 × 3,600,000 = 50,400 joules.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the final energy calculation in joules.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the energy using an alternative method (e.g., watts and seconds) to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Alternative calculation: Power in watts = 7 watts, time = 7200 seconds.  
Energy = 7 watts × 7200 seconds = 50,400 joules (since 1 watt × 1 second = 1 joule).  
This matches the previous result (0.014 kilowatt-hours × 3.6 × 10^6 = 50,400 joules), confirming accuracy.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]

[/REVIEW]
