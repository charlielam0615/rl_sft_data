**Problem Statement**: Simulate a planning case to stop a cat from clawing furniture by using bitter spray, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task must adhere to the constraint of using bitter spray, follow the script steps (1. Choose a bitter spray made specifically for deterring cats; 2. Spray the solution onto areas of furniture the cat should not scratch; 3. Re-apply the spray as needed), and apply the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) with the specified block structure.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of stopping a cat from clawing furniture into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate bitter spray designed for cats.  
- Subgoal 2: Apply the bitter spray to targeted furniture areas.  
- Subgoal 3: Monitor and re-apply the spray as necessary to maintain effectiveness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select an appropriate bitter spray designed for cats. This will be achieved by researching and choosing a pet-safe, non-toxic bitter spray specifically formulated to deter cats from scratching.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, I will identify a bitter spray that is safe for cats and effective for deterring scratching. Based on common knowledge, products like "Bitter Apple Spray" or similar pet-safe sprays are designed for this purpose. I will choose a non-toxic, cat-specific bitter spray that is widely recommended, ensuring it is safe for both the cat and the furniture. The selected product should be available at pet stores or online retailers.  
**Result**: A cat-specific bitter spray, such as a non-toxic bitter apple or citrus-based spray, is chosen.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Stop the cat from clawing furniture using bitter spray.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate bitter spray designed for cats (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the bitter spray to targeted furniture areas (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Monitor and re-apply the spray as necessary (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Apply the bitter spray to targeted furniture areas.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the bitter spray to targeted furniture areas. This will be achieved by identifying furniture the cat frequently scratches and spraying those areas with the chosen bitter spray, following the product’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
First, observe the cat’s behavior to identify which furniture pieces (e.g., couch, chair arms, table legs) are being scratched. Test the spray on a small, inconspicuous area of the furniture to ensure it does not damage or discolor the material. Following the product instructions, apply the bitter spray evenly to the targeted areas, ensuring all frequently scratched surfaces are covered. Avoid overuse to prevent strong odors that might affect the household.  
**Result**: The bitter spray is applied to the identified furniture areas.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the bitter spray application is effective in deterring the cat from clawing the furniture. This will be achieved by observing the cat’s behavior over a few days to confirm it avoids the sprayed areas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Monitor the cat’s behavior for 3–5 days after applying the bitter spray. Check if the cat avoids scratching the treated furniture or shows signs of deterrence (e.g., sniffing and walking away). If the cat continues to scratch the sprayed areas, consider whether the spray was applied correctly or if a different brand may be needed. Ensure the cat has alternative scratching surfaces, like a scratching post, to redirect its behavior.  
**Result**: The cat avoids scratching the treated furniture, indicating the spray is effective.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Stop the cat from clawing furniture using bitter spray.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select an appropriate bitter spray designed for cats (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the bitter spray to targeted furniture areas (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Monitor and re-apply the spray as necessary (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Monitor and re-apply the spray as necessary to maintain effectiveness.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to monitor the cat’s behavior and re-apply the bitter spray as needed to maintain its effectiveness. This will be achieved by regularly checking the furniture for new scratch marks and reapplying the spray according to the product’s recommended frequency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Continue observing the cat weekly to ensure it does not resume scratching the furniture. Check the product label for reapplication frequency (e.g., every few days or after cleaning the furniture). Re-apply the bitter spray to the targeted areas as needed, ensuring consistent coverage. Provide positive reinforcement, such as treats, when the cat uses a scratching post instead of furniture to encourage long-term behavior change.  
**Result**: The spray is re-applied as needed, and the cat consistently avoids scratching the furniture.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the cat no longer scratches the furniture. Retrieve information from previous steps to confirm all actions have been completed and the solution is effective.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Step 2: A cat-specific, non-toxic bitter spray was chosen to deter scratching.  
- Step 4: The spray was applied to furniture areas the cat frequently scratched, following product instructions.  
- Step 5: The cat’s behavior was monitored, confirming the spray’s effectiveness as the cat avoided treated areas.  
- Step 7: The spray was re-applied as needed, and alternative scratching surfaces were provided.  
**Summary**: All script steps (choose spray, apply spray, re-apply as needed) have been completed. The cat no longer scratches the furniture, and the bitter spray solution is effective.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Outcome**: The plan to stop the cat from clawing furniture using bitter spray has been successfully completed. All subgoals from the script were addressed: a cat-safe bitter spray was chosen, applied to targeted furniture, and re-applied as needed, with validation confirming the cat’s behavior change. The cat now avoids scratching the furniture, and alternative scratching surfaces are in place to maintain this behavior.
