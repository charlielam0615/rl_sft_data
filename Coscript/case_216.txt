### Problem Restatement
The task is to simulate a planning case for drawing a shark on paper and create a detailed plan following the meta-cognitive action set principles. The task is constrained to drawing on paper, and a provided script outlines 16 specific steps to draw various parts of the shark, such as the head, back, belly, fins, eyes, and other features. The plan must be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of drawing a shark on paper into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals will follow the sequence of steps to ensure a structured approach:  
1. Draw the shark’s body outline (steps 1–6: head, back, belly, tail, tail fin, bottom fin).  
2. Add the fins (steps 7–8: dorsal and tail fins).  
3. Draw the eyes and facial features (steps 9–13: eye sockets, eyes, pupils, eyebrows, bottom lip).  
4. Complete the mouth and gills (steps 14–16: top lip, tongue, gill opening).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Draw a shark on paper.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Draw the shark’s body outline (steps 1–6).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add the fins (steps 7–8).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Draw the eyes and facial features (steps 9–13).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Complete the mouth and gills (steps 14–16).  
**Current Goal**: Draw the shark’s body outline (steps 1–6).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Draw the shark’s body outline.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow steps 1–6 of the script to draw the curved lines for the head, back, belly, tail, tail fin, and bottom fin, ensuring each line is parallel and appropriately spaced to form the shark’s body shape on paper.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using a pencil on paper, execute the following steps:  
1. Draw a curved line for the top of the shark’s head, starting from the left and curving slightly upward.  
2. Draw a second curved line parallel to the first, slightly lower, to form the shark’s back, extending toward the right.  
3. Draw a third curved line parallel to the second, lower down, to form the shark’s belly, maintaining consistent spacing.  
4. Draw a fourth curved line parallel to the third, lower still, to form the shark’s tail, tapering toward the end.  
5. Draw a fifth curved line parallel to the fourth, lower down, to form the shark’s tail fin, keeping it proportional.  
6. Draw a sixth curved line parallel to the fifth, lower still, to form the shark’s bottom fin, ensuring alignment with the body’s curve.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the shark’s body outline is correctly drawn.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the six curved lines are parallel, appropriately spaced, and form a cohesive shark body shape, adjusting any inconsistencies.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the drawn lines:  
- Confirm that the lines for the head, back, belly, tail, tail fin, and bottom fin are parallel and follow the natural curve of a shark’s body.  
- Verify that the spacing between lines is consistent and the body tapers appropriately toward the tail.  
- If any lines are misaligned or disproportionate, erase and redraw the affected areas to maintain a smooth, shark-like outline.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Draw a shark on paper.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Draw the shark’s body outline (steps 1–6) – **Completed**.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Add the fins (steps 7–8).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Draw the eyes and facial features (steps 9–13).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Complete the mouth and gills (steps 14–16).  
**Current Goal**: Add the fins (steps 7–8).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Add the fins to the shark drawing.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow steps 7–8 to draw the dorsal and tail fins, ensuring they are proportionate and positioned correctly on the shark’s body.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the pencil on paper:  
1. Draw two curved lines that meet at a point in the middle of the head (from the first line) to form the dorsal fin, ensuring it stands upright.  
2. Draw two curved lines that meet at a point in the middle of the tail (from the fourth line) to form the tail fin, ensuring it is symmetrical and proportional.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the fins are correctly drawn.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the dorsal and tail fins are proportionate, symmetrical, and properly positioned on the shark’s body, making adjustments as needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the fins:  
- Confirm the dorsal fin is centered on the head and has a pointed, upright shape.  
- Verify the tail fin is symmetrical and attached to the tail, complementing the body’s taper.  
- If either fin is misaligned or disproportionate, erase and redraw to achieve the correct shape and placement.
