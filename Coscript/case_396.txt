### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of cooling and cutting the beef, focusing on prior steps involving beef preparation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Cool and cut the beef.  
**Recalled Information**:  
- In Step 3, the beef was seasoned with salt and pepper and browned to enhance flavor.  
- In Step 7, the beef was simmered for 2 hours to tenderize it, making it ready for cooling and cutting in the next steps.  
[/REVIEW]
