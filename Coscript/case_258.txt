### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of fixing a squeaky floor by tightening the floorboards into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify loose floorboards causing the squeak.  
2. Secure loose nails by hammering them down.  
3. Countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface.  
4. Fill nail holes with wood putty for a smooth finish.  
5. Sand the repaired area to blend with the surrounding floor.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals identified in Step 1. The goal hierarchy is:  
- Main Goal: Fix a squeaky floor by tightening the floorboards.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify loose floorboards causing the squeak.  
  - Subgoal 2: Secure loose nails by hammering them down.  
  - Subgoal 3: Countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill nail holes with wood putty for a smooth finish.  
  - Subgoal 5: Sand the repaired area to blend with the surrounding floor.  
**Current Goal**: Identify loose floorboards causing the squeak.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify loose floorboards causing the squeak. This will be achieved by walking across the floor to locate squeaky areas and inspecting the floorboards for looseness or movement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Walk slowly across the floor, listening for squeaks. Apply pressure to different areas to pinpoint the exact floorboards that move or make noise. Mark these loose floorboards with chalk or tape for easy identification in the next steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the marked floorboards are indeed the source of the squeak. This will be achieved by re-testing the marked areas to confirm they squeak and checking for loose nails or gaps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-walk the marked areas, applying pressure to confirm squeaking. Inspect each marked floorboard for loose nails protruding above the surface or gaps between boards. If a marked board does not squeak or is secure, remove the mark and continue checking other areas as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure loose nails by hammering them down. Retrieve information from previous steps related to identifying and validating loose floorboards to ensure the correct boards are targeted.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The loose floorboards causing the squeak were identified in Step 3 by walking and marking areas with chalk or tape. Step 4 validated these boards by confirming squeaks and checking for loose nails or gaps. This information ensures that only the correctly identified loose floorboards with protruding nails will be addressed in the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to secure loose nails by hammering them down. This will be achieved by using a hammer to drive protruding nails back into the marked loose floorboards.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using a hammer, gently tap the protruding nails in the marked loose floorboards until they are flush with the surface. Ensure even pressure to avoid damaging the wood. Check that the floorboard no longer moves or squeaks when pressure is applied.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress:  
- Main Goal: Fix a squeaky floor by tightening the floorboards.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify loose floorboards causing the squeak (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Secure loose nails by hammering them down (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill nail holes with wood putty for a smooth finish.  
  - Subgoal 5: Sand the repaired area to blend with the surrounding floor.  
**Current Goal**: Countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface. This will be achieved by using a nail set and hammer to drive nail heads slightly below the floorboard surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place a nail set on each nail head in the repaired floorboards. Gently tap the nail set with a hammer to drive the nail head slightly below the surface, creating a small recess. Ensure the nail is not driven too deep to avoid weakening the wood.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill nail holes with wood putty for a smooth finish. This will be achieved by applying wood putty to the recessed nail holes and smoothing it with a putty knife.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply a small amount of wood putty to each recessed nail hole using a putty knife. Spread the putty evenly, filling the hole completely. Wipe away excess putty with a clean cloth and let it dry according to the product instructions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the final subgoal to ensure the sanded area matches the floor’s finish. The original subgoal is to sand the area smooth, but to achieve a seamless result, consider the floor’s existing finish (e.g., stained, sealed, or polished) and adjust to include matching the finish after sanding.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoal:  
- Main Goal: Fix a squeaky floor by tightening the floorboards.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify loose floorboards causing the squeak (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Secure loose nails by hammering them down (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Countersink nail heads to ensure a flush surface (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill nail holes with wood putty for a smooth finish (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Sand the repaired area and match the floor’s existing finish.  
**Current Goal**: Sand the repaired area and match the floor’s existing finish.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sand the repaired area and match the floor’s existing finish. This will be achieved by sanding the putty-filled areas with fine-grit sandpaper and applying a matching stain or sealant if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use fine-grit sandpaper (e.g., 220-grit) to sand the dried wood putty until smooth and flush with the surrounding floor. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth. If the floor has a stain or sealant, apply a matching product to the sanded area, following the original finish’s color and type. Allow it to dry completely.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the floor no longer squeaks and the repaired area blends seamlessly with the surrounding floor. This will be achieved by testing the repaired areas for squeaks and visually inspecting the finish.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Walk over the repaired floorboards, applying pressure to ensure no squeaks remain. Visually inspect the sanded and finished areas to confirm they blend seamlessly with the surrounding floor in color and texture. If squeaks persist or the finish does not match, revisit earlier steps (e.g., re-hammer nails or reapply finish).  
[/IMP]
