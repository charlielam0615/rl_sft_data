### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a planning case for reading a newspaper in print, adhering to the provided script and constraint. The script outlines seven steps: get a cup of coffee or tea, sit at the kitchen table, spread the newspaper out, read the front page, scan headlines and read interesting articles, move to the next page, and repeat until the entire paper is read. The constraint specifies that the newspaper must be in print. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), with each step selecting one action and following the structured format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of reading a newspaper in print into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script. The subgoals are:  
1. Prepare a beverage (coffee or tea).  
2. Find a suitable location (kitchen table) and sit down.  
3. Arrange the newspaper for reading.  
4. Read the front page.  
5. Identify and read articles of interest on each page.  
6. Progress through all pages.  
7. Complete reading the entire newspaper.  
These subgoals align with the script and ensure the constraint of using a print newspaper is met.
