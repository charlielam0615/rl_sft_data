**Problem Statement**: The task is to simulate a planning case for deciding whether to forgive someone based on the opinions of friends, following a provided script and adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The script includes three steps: (1) Discuss the situation with a close friend, (2) Seek professional help if still undecided, and (3) Consider gut feelings. The constraint is that the decision must be based on what friends think, and the task falls under the Relationships category. The solution will use one meta-cognitive action per step, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To address the task of deciding whether to forgive someone based on friends' opinions, break down the provided script into actionable subgoals. The script suggests three steps: discussing with a friend, seeking professional help if undecided, and considering gut feelings. These can be structured as sequential subgoals to guide the decision-making process while adhering to the constraint of basing the decision on friends' opinions.

- **Subgoal 1**: Gather opinions by discussing the situation with a close friend to understand their perspective on whether forgiveness is warranted.
- **Subgoal 2**: If the friend's input does not lead to a clear decision, consult a professional (e.g., a counselor) to gain further clarity while still considering friends' opinions.
- **Subgoal 3**: Reflect on personal gut feelings, integrating friends' opinions to finalize the decision on forgiveness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Gather opinions by discussing the situation with a close friend.  
**How to Achieve**: Select a trusted friend who knows you well and is familiar with the context of the situation. Share the details of the incident and the reasons for considering forgiveness, then ask for their honest opinion on whether forgiving the person is appropriate.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a close friend, such as someone you’ve confided in before about personal matters. Arrange a private conversation, either in person or via a call, to ensure open communication. Explain the situation clearly: describe what the person did, why it hurt you, and your current thoughts on forgiveness. Ask questions like, “Do you think this person deserves forgiveness based on what I’ve told you?” or “Would you forgive them in my position?” Listen carefully to their perspective, noting any advice or insights they provide about the person’s actions, your relationship, and the potential impact of forgiving or not forgiving.

### Step 3: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**:  
- **Main Goal**: Decide whether to forgive someone based on friends' opinions.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Gather opinions by discussing the situation with a close friend (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: If still undecided, consult a professional to gain further clarity while considering friends' opinions (Not started).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reflect on personal gut feelings, integrating friends' opinions to finalize the decision (Not started).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to move to Subgoal 2—consult a professional if still undecided—since the first subgoal of discussing with a friend has been addressed. The friend's opinion provides initial input, but further steps depend on whether clarity has been achieved.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify if the discussion with the friend provided sufficient clarity to decide on forgiveness.  
**How to Achieve**: Reflect on the friend’s advice and assess whether it aligns with the constraint of basing the decision on friends' opinions and provides a clear direction for forgiveness.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the friend’s opinion from the discussion. For example, if the friend advised forgiveness because the person’s actions were a one-time mistake and they showed remorse, evaluate if this perspective feels conclusive. Consider questions like: Does the friend’s reasoning align with your values? Is their opinion based on a full understanding of the situation? If the friend’s advice is clear and convincing (e.g., they strongly recommend forgiving or not forgiving with solid reasoning), you may have enough to proceed to the final decision. If the advice is vague, conflicting, or leaves you uncertain, the path is invalid, and you need to move to the next subgoal (seeking professional help). For now, assume the friend’s opinion was supportive of forgiveness but not definitive, indicating the need to continue to Subgoal 2.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Consult a professional to gain clarity on whether to forgive, while still considering friends' opinions.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify a qualified professional, such as a counselor or therapist, and schedule a session to discuss the situation, incorporating the friend’s perspective and seeking guidance on the decision.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find a licensed counselor or therapist, preferably one experienced in relationship issues, through a trusted source like a recommendation or an online directory. Book a session and prepare to share the details of the incident, the friend’s opinion (e.g., they leaned toward forgiveness but you’re unsure), and your current indecision. During the session, ask the professional to help you weigh the friend’s perspective against other factors, such as the severity of the offense and the person’s behavior since. For example, ask, “Given my friend thinks I should forgive, how can I decide if that’s the right choice?” Take notes on their insights, such as whether forgiveness aligns with your emotional well-being or relationship goals.

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal**:  
- **Main Goal**: Decide whether to forgive someone based on friends' opinions.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Gather opinions by discussing the situation with a close friend (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: If still undecided, consult a professional to gain further clarity while considering friends' opinions (Completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Reflect on personal gut feelings, integrating friends' opinions to finalize the decision (Not started).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to move to Subgoal 3—reflect on personal gut feelings while integrating the friend’s and professional’s input to make the final decision on forgiveness.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Reflect on personal gut feelings, integrating friends' opinions and professional advice to finalize the decision on forgiveness.  
**How to Achieve**: Take time to privately reflect on the collected input, weigh your emotions and instincts, and decide whether forgiving aligns with your values and the constraint of basing the decision on friends' opinions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set aside a quiet moment to reflect. Review the friend’s opinion (e.g., they supported forgiveness due to the person’s remorse) and the professional’s advice (e.g., they suggested forgiveness could aid emotional healing if the person is trustworthy). Ask yourself: Do I feel at peace with forgiving this person? Does their behavior suggest they deserve it? Does forgiveness align with my values and the friend’s perspective? For example, if your gut feels uneasy despite the friend’s support for forgiveness, consider why—perhaps the offense was too severe. Alternatively, if your instincts align with the friend’s view and the professional’s guidance, you may decide to forgive. After reflection, conclude based on the combined input. For instance, decide to forgive if the friend’s opinion, professional advice, and your gut all suggest it’s a constructive step.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve past information related to the decision-making process, focusing on the friend’s opinion, professional advice, and personal reflections to ensure the final decision is well-informed and aligns with the constraint of basing it on friends' opinions.  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- **Friend’s Opinion (Step 2)**: The friend suggested forgiving the person, citing their remorse and the potential for rebuilding trust.  
- **Professional Advice (Step 5)**: The counselor advised that forgiveness could promote emotional healing if the person’s actions align with genuine change, emphasizing the importance of considering the friend’s perspective.  
- **Personal Reflection (Step 7)**: Your gut feelings, combined with the friend’s and professional’s input, leaned toward forgiveness, provided the person demonstrates accountability.  

This information confirms that the decision to forgive is supported by the friend’s opinion (meeting the constraint), reinforced by professional guidance, and aligned with your instincts.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the decision to forgive (or not) is valid based on the constraint of relying on friends' opinions and incorporates all collected input.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the final decision aligns with the friend’s opinion, professional advice, and personal gut feelings, ensuring it meets the task’s constraint.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Evaluate the decision (e.g., to forgive) by cross-referencing it with the inputs:  
- The friend’s opinion supported forgiveness, fulfilling the constraint.  
- The professional’s advice indicated forgiveness could be beneficial if the person is accountable, aligning with the friend’s view.  
- Your gut feelings, after reflection, leaned toward forgiveness, assuming the person shows genuine change.  
If all inputs align (e.g., forgiveness is supported by the friend, professional, and your instincts), the decision is valid. If there’s a mismatch (e.g., your gut strongly opposes forgiveness despite the friend’s support), revisit earlier steps or gather more input. Assuming alignment, the decision to forgive is valid and meets the constraint.  

[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The plan is complete. The decision to forgive was reached by following the script: discussing with a friend, seeking professional help, and considering gut feelings, with the constraint of basing the decision on friends' opinions upheld. The meta-cognitive actions (Forward Subgoaling, Reach Goal, Track Goals, Validation, and Recall Info) ensured a structured process, culminating in a validated decision.
