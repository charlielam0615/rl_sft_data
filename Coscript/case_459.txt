**Problem Statement**: Create a plan for dressing up appropriately for a class, adhering to the provided script and constraints, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with one action per step, structured into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified, until the plan is complete.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of dressing up for a class into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
Subgoals:  
1. Determine the class dress code.  
2. Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists.  
3. Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes.  
4. Choose conservative options if uncertain.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the class dress code. Achieve this by reviewing class-related materials (e.g., syllabus, school website, or instructor guidelines) to identify any specific dress code requirements.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the class syllabus, school website, or email the instructor to confirm if there is a specific dress code for the class, such as business casual, uniforms, or casual attire. If no explicit dress code is found, note any general guidelines (e.g., no athletic wear or revealing clothing).  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dress appropriately for a class.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the class dress code (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists (next).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Choose conservative options if uncertain.  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists. Achieve this by considering the class setting (e.g., academic environment, subject matter) and general norms for professional or casual attire suitable for a classroom.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Consider the class setting: Is it a formal lecture, a lab, or a casual seminar? For a typical academic environment, appropriate attire might include clean, neat clothing like jeans or slacks paired with a collared shirt, sweater, or blouse. Avoid overly casual items (e.g., pajamas, flip-flops) or overly formal attire unless specified. Factor in the subject (e.g., professional attire for business classes, practical clothing for labs).  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dress appropriately for a class.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the class dress code (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes (next).  
  - Subgoal 4: Choose conservative options if uncertain.  
**Current Goal**: Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes. Achieve this by choosing clothing from your wardrobe that aligns with the dress code or appropriateness evaluation, prioritizing comfort and personal confidence.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From your wardrobe, select clothes that fit well and feel comfortable for sitting through a class, such as stretchy jeans or chinos paired with a soft cotton shirt or a comfortable sweater. Choose items you feel good in, like a favorite top or outfit that matches your style while adhering to the classâ€™s dress expectations (e.g., a clean, polished look). Ensure the outfit is practical for the class duration and environment (e.g., breathable fabrics for long sessions).  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dress appropriately for a class.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the class dress code (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Choose conservative options if uncertain (next).  
**Current Goal**: Choose conservative options if uncertain.  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to choose conservative options if uncertain about the attire. Achieve this by reviewing the selected outfit and ensuring it leans toward modest, professional, or neutral choices to avoid inappropriate attire.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the chosen outfit (e.g., jeans and a sweater). If uncertain about its appropriateness, opt for more conservative choices, such as replacing a graphic tee with a plain collared shirt or choosing neutral colors (e.g., navy, black, or white) over bold patterns. Ensure the outfit avoids revealing or overly casual elements (e.g., no low-cut tops or ripped jeans) to align with a safe, professional classroom look.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the final outfit choice. Achieve this by cross-checking the selected outfit against the dress code (if any), appropriateness for the class setting, comfort, and conservatism to ensure it meets all criteria.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the chosen outfit (e.g., chinos, collared shirt, sweater) complies with any identified dress code or general classroom norms. Confirm it is comfortable for the class duration, boosts confidence, and leans conservative if there was uncertainty. For example, ensure the outfit is clean, fits well, and is free of distracting or inappropriate elements (e.g., slogans or excessive accessories). If all criteria are met, the outfit is ready; otherwise, adjust (e.g., swap for a more formal top).  

[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Dress appropriately for a class (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the class dress code (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate appropriate attire if no dress code exists (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select comfortable and confidence-boosting clothes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Choose conservative options if uncertain (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The plan for dressing up for the class is complete, with a validated outfit that meets the dress code, is appropriate, comfortable, and conservative if needed.  

[/REVIEW]

---

**Conclusion**: The plan for dressing up for a class has been completed by systematically addressing each subgoal from the provided script, using the meta-cognitive action set. The final outcome is a validated outfit choice suitable for the class.
