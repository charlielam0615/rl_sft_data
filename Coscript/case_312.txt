### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for a "Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects With Dye" by simulating a planning case. The plan must adhere to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and follow the specified script: estimate grout amount, set up workspace, colour grout with dye, apply grout, and clean excess grout. The constraint is that the grout must be coloured with dye, and the task falls under the Home and Garden category. Each step will select one meta-cognitive action, using the [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, until the plan is complete.

- Subgoal 1: Calculate the required grout quantity for the mosaic project.  
- Subgoal 2: Prepare a suitable workspace for the mosaic project.  
- Subgoal 3: Mix dye into the grout to achieve the desired colour.  
- Subgoal 4: Apply the coloured grout to the mosaic tiles.  
- Subgoal 5: Remove excess grout and clean the mosaic surface.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Complete a colour grout mosaic project with dye.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the required grout quantity for the mosaic project. (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare a suitable workspace for the mosaic project.  
  - Subgoal 3: Mix dye into the grout to achieve the desired colour.  
  - Subgoal 4: Apply the coloured grout to the mosaic tiles.  
  - Subgoal 5: Remove excess grout and clean the mosaic surface.  

**Current Goal:** Calculate the required grout quantity for the mosaic project.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the required grout quantity for the mosaic project.  
- **How to Achieve:** Measure the mosaic project’s surface area, estimate grout depth, and use a grout calculator or manufacturer’s guidelines to determine the quantity needed, considering dye compatibility.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To calculate the grout quantity:  
1. Measure the mosaic project’s surface area (e.g., in square meters or feet). For example, a 1-square-meter mosaic with 3 mm grout lines.  
2. Estimate grout depth (typically 3-5 mm for mosaics).  
3. Use a grout calculator (available online) or manufacturer’s coverage rate (e.g., 0.5-1 kg per square meter for standard mosaic grout).  
4. Account for dye compatibility, ensuring the grout type (e.g., cement-based) is suitable for dye mixing without affecting curing.  
5. Add 10-15% extra grout to account for waste or errors.  
**Example Calculation:** For a 1-square-meter mosaic with 3 mm grout lines, approximately 0.7-1 kg of grout may be needed, plus 0.1 kg extra.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate the grout quantity calculation.  
- **How to Achieve:** Cross-check the calculated grout quantity against project requirements and confirm dye compatibility with the grout type.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the grout quantity:  
1. Recheck measurements of the mosaic surface area and grout line width.  
2. Compare the calculated quantity (e.g., 0.8 kg for 1 square meter) with manufacturer guidelines or a second grout calculator.  
3. Verify that the chosen grout (e.g., cement-based) is compatible with the dye, checking product specifications or consulting supplier documentation.  
4. Ensure the quantity includes a 10-15% buffer for waste.  
**Result:** If calculations align and dye is compatible, proceed; otherwise, adjust measurements or grout type.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Prepare a suitable workspace for the mosaic project.  
- **How to Achieve:** Set up a clean, stable, and well-ventilated area with necessary tools and materials for grouting and dyeing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To prepare the workspace:  
1. Choose a flat, stable surface (e.g., a table) covered with a drop cloth or plastic sheet to protect against spills.  
2. Ensure good ventilation to handle dye and grout fumes.  
3. Gather tools: grout, dye, mixing buckets, trowels, sponges, gloves, and safety glasses.  
4. Organize materials to keep the mosaic tiles and grout accessible.  
5. Set up a cleaning station with water and rags for immediate spill cleanup.  
**Result:** A workspace ready for safe and efficient grouting and dyeing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Mix dye into the grout to achieve the desired colour.  
- **How to Achieve:** Follow manufacturer instructions to mix the dye with the grout, ensuring uniform colour and proper consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To colour the grout with dye:  
1. Wear gloves and safety glasses to handle dye safely.  
2. Measure the grout powder as calculated (e.g., 0.8 kg).  
3. Add dye according to manufacturer instructions (e.g., 1-2% of grout weight for vibrant colour).  
4. Mix dry grout and dye thoroughly in a bucket before adding water.  
5. Gradually add water, stirring to achieve a smooth, peanut-butter-like consistency.  
6. Test a small batch on a spare tile to confirm colour.  
**Result:** Coloured grout ready for application.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Step 3: Grout quantity calculated as approximately 0.8 kg for a 1-square-meter mosaic, including a 10-15% buffer.  
- From Step 4: Grout type (cement-based) confirmed compatible with dye.  
- From Step 6: Workspace set up with a stable surface, ventilation, and tools (trowels, buckets, etc.).  
- From Step 7: Grout mixed with dye to a smooth consistency, colour tested.  
**Summary:** The grout quantity, dye compatibility, and workspace are prepared, supporting confident application of the coloured grout.

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Apply the coloured grout to the mosaic tiles.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use tools to spread the coloured grout evenly over the mosaic, ensuring full coverage of grout lines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To apply the coloured grout:  
1. Use a rubber float to spread the coloured grout over the mosaic tiles at a 45-degree angle.  
2. Work in small sections to ensure even application and prevent drying.  
3. Press grout into the spaces between tiles, ensuring no gaps.  
4. Remove excess grout from the tile surfaces with the float’s edge.  
5. Allow the grout to set for 15-20 minutes (per manufacturer instructions).  
**Result:** Grout evenly applied to the mosaic.
