**Problem Restatement**: The task is to simulate a planning case for a youth who feels overwhelmed and is about to cry in front of their teacher, with the specific action of asking for a break to manage their emotions. The plan must follow the provided script: (1) ask to go to the restroom if feeling like crying, (2) take deep breaths, (3) wash face with cold water, and (4) return to class acting normal. The solution must use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and constraints.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of managing emotions by asking for a break into intermediate subgoals based on the provided script.  
- Subgoal 1: Recognize the emotional trigger and ask to leave for the restroom.  
- Subgoal 2: Calm down by taking deep breaths.  
- Subgoal 3: Further stabilize emotions by washing face with cold water.  
- Subgoal 4: Return to class and resume normal behavior.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Manage emotions when about to cry in front of the teacher by asking for a break.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the emotional trigger and ask to go to the restroom.  
  - Subgoal 2: Calm down by taking deep breaths.  
  - Subgoal 3: Further stabilize emotions by washing face with cold water.  
  - Subgoal 4: Return to class and resume normal behavior.  
**Current Goal**: Recognize the emotional trigger and ask to go to the restroom (Subgoal 1).  

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to recognize the emotional trigger and ask to go to the restroom. This will be achieved by identifying physical or emotional signs of distress (e.g., tightness in chest, teary eyes) and politely requesting permission from the teacher to leave for the restroom.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, monitor internal cues such as a lump in the throat, watery eyes, or a racing heart. When these signs appear, raise your hand and calmly say, “Excuse me, may I go to the restroom?” This allows a discreet exit from the classroom to manage emotions privately.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the request to go to the restroom was successful and appropriate. This will be achieved by confirming the teacher’s approval and ensuring the exit was discreet without drawing attention.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that the teacher nodded or verbally approved the request to leave. Ensure you left the classroom calmly without displaying overt emotional distress, maintaining privacy and adhering to the constraint of asking for a break. If the teacher denied the request, consider an alternative like asking to step outside briefly.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Refine the remaining subgoals to ensure they align with the context of having left the classroom. The adjusted subgoals are:  
- Subgoal 2: Take deep breaths in the restroom to calm emotions.  
- Subgoal 3: Wash face with cold water to further stabilize emotions.  
- Subgoal 4: Return to class and act composed, as if nothing happened.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Updated goal-management system:  
- Main Goal: Manage emotions when about to cry in front of the teacher by asking for a break.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the emotional trigger and ask to go to the restroom (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Take deep breaths in the restroom to calm emotions.  
  - Subgoal 3: Wash face with cold water to further stabilize emotions.  
  - Subgoal 4: Return to class and act composed, as if nothing happened.  
**Current Goal**: Take deep breaths in the restroom to calm emotions (Subgoal 2).  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take deep breaths in the restroom to calm emotions. This will be achieved by finding a quiet space in the restroom and performing slow, controlled breathing exercises.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the restroom, find a private spot (e.g., near a sink or in a stall). Inhale deeply through the nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale through the mouth for 6 seconds. Repeat this cycle 5–10 times until the heart rate slows and emotions feel more manageable.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the deep breathing exercise effectively calmed emotions. This will be achieved by assessing physical and emotional states after breathing.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check for signs of reduced distress, such as a slower heart rate, relaxed muscles, or decreased urge to cry. If still feeling overwhelmed, continue deep breathing for another 5 cycles or proceed to the next step (washing face) to further stabilize emotions.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wash the face with cold water to further stabilize emotions. This will be achieved by using cold water from the restroom sink to refresh and reduce physical signs of distress.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
At the sink, splash cold water on your face for 10–15 seconds, focusing on the cheeks and forehead. Pat dry with a paper towel. This helps reduce puffiness or redness and provides a calming sensation to reinforce emotional stability.  

[/IMP]

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to return to class and act composed, as if nothing happened. This will be achieved by re-entering the classroom calmly and resuming normal activities without drawing attention.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Walk back to the classroom at a steady pace. Enter quietly, avoid eye contact that might prompt questions, and sit down at your desk. Resume class activities (e.g., taking notes or listening) with a neutral expression to blend in seamlessly.  

[/IMP]

### Step 12: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the return to class was discreet and normal behavior was maintained. This will be achieved by checking for any signs of attention from the teacher or classmates and ensuring engagement in class activities.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Observe whether the teacher or classmates react unusually (e.g., staring or asking questions). Confirm that you are participating in class activities normally, such as following the lesson or completing tasks. If attention is drawn, respond briefly and politely (e.g., “I’m fine, thanks”) to maintain composure.  

[/IMP]

### Step 13: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all steps were followed correctly to manage emotions. Retrieve information from previous steps to confirm adherence to the script and constraint of asking for a break.  

[/PLANNING]
