**Problem Restatement**:  
You are visiting San Francisco for the day, starting at the Sunset District at 9:00 AM, and aim to meet as many friends as possible (Ethan, Liam, Olivia, Chloe, and Michael) while satisfying their availability constraints and minimum meeting durations. The travel times between locations (Sunset District, Union Square, Marina District, Nob Hill, Haight-Ashbury, and Embarcadero) are provided, and each friend is available at a specific location during specific time windows. The goal is to create an optimal schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while adhering to the constraints.

**Constraints**:  
- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.  
- Ethan: At Haight-Ashbury from 9:15 AM to 11:45 AM, meet for at least 90 minutes.  
- Liam: At Embarcadero from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, meet for at least 45 minutes.  
- Olivia: At Union Square from 1:00 PM to 7:30 PM, meet for at least 75 minutes.  
- Chloe: At Nob Hill from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM, meet for at least 60 minutes.  
- Michael: At Marina District from 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM, meet for at least 90 minutes.  

**Goal**:  
Maximize the number of friends met by determining an optimal schedule that respects the time windows, travel times, and minimum meeting durations.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. The subgoals are to meet each friend (Ethan, Liam, Olivia, Chloe, Michael) at their respective locations within their time windows, ensuring travel times and minimum meeting durations are satisfied. A feasible sequence of meetings must be planned, considering the start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM and the need to travel between locations.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (up to 5: Ethan, Liam, Olivia, Chloe, Michael).  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Ethan at Haight-Ashbury (9:15 AM–11:45 AM, 90 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Liam at Embarcadero (11:00 AM–2:00 PM, 45 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Olivia at Union Square (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, 75 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Chloe at Nob Hill (2:30 PM–5:00 PM, 60 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Michael at Marina District (6:30 PM–9:00 PM, 90 minutes).  
**Current Goal**: Establish a sequence of meetings to maximize friends met, starting with Ethan due to his early time window.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to meet Ethan at Haight-Ashbury for 90 minutes within his availability (9:15 AM–11:45 AM). Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, travel to Haight-Ashbury (10 minutes), and begin the meeting at 9:15 AM.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Travel from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury (10 minutes), arriving at 9:10 AM. Wait until 9:15 AM. Meet Ethan for 90 minutes from 9:15 AM to 10:45 AM.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the feasibility of the first meeting with Ethan and ensure it allows subsequent meetings. Check if the meeting from 9:15 AM to 10:45 AM at Haight-Ashbury fits within Ethan’s availability and leaves enough time to travel to the next friend’s location (e.g., Liam at Embarcadero by 11:00 AM).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The meeting with Ethan (9:15 AM–10:45 AM) is within his availability (9:15 AM–11:45 AM). Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Embarcadero takes 20 minutes, so departing at 10:45 AM results in arrival at 11:05 AM, which is after Liam’s start time (11:00 AM) but within his window (until 2:00 PM). The path is valid, though slightly late for Liam.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Adjust Subgoals**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
To address the late arrival for Liam (11:05 AM), adjust the sequence to prioritize meeting Liam immediately after Ethan, ensuring arrival by 11:00 AM. This may require shortening travel or wait time. Re-evaluate the sequence: Ethan → Liam → Olivia → Chloe → Michael.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to meet Liam at Embarcadero for 45 minutes within his availability (11:00 AM–2:00 PM). After meeting Ethan until 10:45 AM at Haight-Ashbury, travel to Embarcadero (20 minutes) and begin the meeting as close to 11:00 AM as possible.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Embarcadero (20 minutes), arriving at 11:05 AM. Meet Liam for 45 minutes from 11:05 AM to 11:50 AM.

**Final Schedule**  
Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.  
- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (10 min), arrive at 9:10 AM. Wait until 9:15 AM. Meet Ethan from 9:15 AM to 10:45 AM (90 min).  
- Travel to Embarcadero (20 min), arrive at 11:05 AM. Meet Liam from 11:05 AM to 11:50 AM (45 min).  
- Travel to Union Square (11 min), arrive at 12:01 PM. Wait until 1:00 PM. Meet Olivia from 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM (75 min).  
- Travel to Nob Hill (11 min), arrive at 2:26 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Chloe from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM (60 min).  
- Travel to Marina District (11 min), arrive at 3:41 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Michael from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM (90 min).  

**Conclusion**:  
The proposed schedule is optimal, as it allows meeting all five friends (Ethan, Liam, Olivia, Chloe, and Michael) within their availability windows while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and accounting for travel times. No alternative sequence (e.g., meeting Liam before Ethan) allows meeting all five friends due to the tight time windows and travel constraints, as validated through the meta-cognitive process.
