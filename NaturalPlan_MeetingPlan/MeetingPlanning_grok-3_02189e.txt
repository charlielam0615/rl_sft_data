### Problem Restatement
I need to plan a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, given the following constraints:
- **Arrival**: I arrive at Mission District at 9:00 AM.
- **Friends and Constraints**:
  - **Emma**: Available in Chinatown from 3:30 PM to 7:45 PM, requires a minimum meeting of 45 minutes.
  - **Lucas**: Available in Pacific Heights from 10:00 AM to 8:30 PM, requires a minimum meeting of 90 minutes.
  - **Sophia**: Available in Sunset District from 7:00 AM to 3:15 PM, requires a minimum meeting of 120 minutes.
- **Travel Times** (in minutes):
  - Mission District ↔ Chinatown: 15/16
  - Mission District ↔ Pacific Heights: 18/17
  - Mission District ↔ Sunset District: 12/11
  - Chinatown ↔ Pacific Heights: 10/9
  - Chinatown ↔ Sunset District: 20/22
  - Pacific Heights ↔ Sunset District: 15/14
- **Goal**: Maximize the number of friends met, ensuring all meeting time requirements are satisfied within the given availability windows and accounting for travel times.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, following the provided format and constraints, to create an optimal schedule.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To maximize the number of friends met, I need to create a schedule that includes meetings with Emma, Lucas, and Sophia, respecting their availability windows and minimum meeting durations while accounting for travel times. I will break this goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the time windows for each friend’s availability.
2. Determine feasible meeting locations and durations that satisfy the minimum meeting time constraints.
3. Calculate travel times between locations to ensure the schedule is realistic.
4. Construct possible schedules and select the one that allows meeting all three friends, if possible.
5. If meeting all three is not feasible, evaluate schedules that maximize the number of friends met.

### Step 2: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Maximize the number of friends met (Emma, Lucas, Sophia) in San Francisco on the given day.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify time windows for each friend’s availability.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine feasible meeting locations and durations.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate travel times between locations.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Construct possible schedules.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Select the optimal schedule or evaluate alternatives if meeting all three is not possible.  
**Current Goal**: Identify time windows for each friend’s availability (Subgoal 1).  

I will now list the availability windows:  
- **Sophia**: Sunset District, 7:00 AM–3:15 PM (8 hours 15 minutes).  
- **Lucas**: Pacific Heights, 10:00 AM–8:30 PM (10 hours 30 minutes).  
- **Emma**: Chinatown, 3:30 PM–7:45 PM (4 hours 15 minutes).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify feasible meeting locations and durations that satisfy the minimum meeting time constraints (Subgoal 2).  
**How to Achieve**: I will assign meeting times for each friend within their availability windows, ensuring the minimum meeting durations (Sophia: 120 minutes, Lucas: 90 minutes, Emma: 45 minutes) are met. I will initially assume I can meet all three friends and test a schedule starting with Sophia (earliest availability), then Lucas, then Emma (latest availability), and account for travel times later.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To meet all three friends, I will propose an initial schedule:  
- **Sophia**: Meet at Sunset District for 120 minutes. Since I arrive at Mission District at 9:00 AM, and it takes 12 minutes to travel to Sunset District, I can start the meeting at 9:12 AM (9:00 AM + 12 minutes). A 120-minute meeting ends at 11:12 AM (9:12 AM + 120 minutes).  
- **Lucas**: Meet at Pacific Heights for 90 minutes. Travel from Sunset District to Pacific Heights takes 14 minutes, so I arrive at 11:26 AM (11:12 AM + 14 minutes). A 90-minute meeting starts at 11:26 AM and ends at 12:56 PM (11:26 AM + 90 minutes).  
- **Emma**: Meet in Chinatown for 45 minutes. Travel from Pacific Heights to Chinatown takes 9 minutes, so I arrive at 1:05 PM (12:56 PM + 9 minutes). A 45-minute meeting starts at 1:05 PM and ends at 1:50 PM.  

This initial schedule suggests meetings are possible, but I need to validate if it aligns with availability windows.  
- **Sophia**: 9:12 AM–11:12 AM is within 7:00 AM–3:15 PM. Valid.  
- **Lucas**: 11:26 AM–12:56 PM is within 10:00 AM–8:30 PM. Valid.  
- **Emma**: 1:05 PM–1:50 PM is *not* within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM (starts too early).  

The schedule fails because Emma’s meeting is before her availability. I need to adjust the schedule.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The initial schedule failed because Emma’s meeting time is outside her availability. I will adjust the subgoals to prioritize meeting Emma within her availability (3:30 PM–7:45 PM) and reschedule meetings with Sophia and Lucas accordingly. New subgoals:  
1. Schedule Emma’s meeting within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM for at least 45 minutes.  
2. Schedule Lucas’s meeting within 10:00 AM–8:30 PM for at least 90 minutes, ensuring compatibility with Emma’s schedule.  
3. Schedule Sophia’s meeting within 7:00 AM–3:15 PM for at least 120 minutes, ensuring compatibility with both Lucas and Emma.  
4. Incorporate travel times to ensure the schedule is feasible.  
5. Validate the new schedule and optimize to meet all three friends, or identify the maximum number possible.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Schedule Emma’s meeting within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM for at least 45 minutes, then schedule Lucas and Sophia around it (Subgoals 1–3).  
**How to Achieve**: Since Emma’s availability is the most restrictive (3:30 PM–7:45 PM), I will start by scheduling her meeting late in her window to allow time for earlier meetings with Sophia and Lucas. I will try a schedule starting with Sophia, then Lucas, then Emma, and adjust based on travel times and availability.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let’s try a new schedule:  
- **Emma**: Schedule a 45-minute meeting in Chinatown starting at 7:00 PM (within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM), ending at 7:45 PM.  
- **Lucas**: Schedule a 90-minute meeting in Pacific Heights. Since Emma’s meeting ends at 7:45 PM, I need to work backward. Travel from Pacific Heights to Chinatown takes 9 minutes, so I must leave Pacific Heights by 6:51 PM (7:00 PM – 9 minutes) to start Emma’s meeting. A 90-minute meeting with Lucas starts at 5:21 PM (6:51 PM – 90 minutes) and ends at 6:51 PM. This is within Lucas’s availability (10:00 AM–8:30 PM).  
- **Sophia**: Schedule a 120-minute meeting in Sunset District. Travel from Sunset District to Pacific Heights takes 14 minutes, so I must leave Sunset District by 5:07 PM (5:21 PM – 14 minutes). A 120-minute meeting starts at 3:07 PM (5:07 PM – 120 minutes) and ends at 5:07 PM. However, Sophia is only available until 3:15 PM, so this meeting starts too late (3:07 PM > 3:15 PM end time).  

This schedule fails because Sophia’s meeting violates her availability. Let’s try scheduling Sophia earlier:  
- **Sophia**: Start at 9:12 AM (9:00 AM arrival at Mission District + 12 minutes travel to Sunset District) for 120 minutes, ending at 11:12 AM.  
- **Lucas**: Travel from Sunset District to Pacific Heights takes 14 minutes, arriving at 11:26 AM (11:12 AM + 14 minutes). A 90-minute meeting starts at 11:26 AM and ends at 12:56 PM, which is within 10:00 AM–8:30 PM.  
- **Emma**: Travel from Pacific Heights to Chinatown takes 9 minutes, arriving at 1:05 PM (12:56 PM + 9 minutes). A 45-minute meeting starts at 1:05 PM, ending at 1:50 PM, but this is outside Emma’s availability (3:30 PM–7:45 PM).  

To fit Emma, I need to delay Lucas’s meeting to reach Chinatown after 3:30 PM. Let’s try scheduling Lucas later:  
- **Sophia**: 9:12 AM–11:12 AM (120 minutes, Sunset District).  
- **Lucas**: Travel from Sunset District to Pacific Heights (14 minutes). To reach Chinatown by 3:30 PM, I must leave Pacific Heights by 3:21 PM (3:30 PM – 9 minutes). A 90-minute meeting with Lucas starts at 1:51 PM (3:21 PM – 90 minutes) and ends at 3:21 PM. Travel from Sunset District to Pacific Heights means arriving at 11:26 AM (11:12 AM + 14 minutes). I have a gap from 11:26 AM to 1:51 PM (145 minutes) to fill.  
- **Emma**: Arrive in Chinatown at 3:30 PM, meet for 45 minutes until 4:15 PM, which is within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM.  

This schedule works:  
- **Sophia**: 9:12 AM–11:12 AM (Sunset District, 120 minutes).  
- **Lucas**: 1:51 PM–3:21 PM (Pacific Heights, 90 minutes).  
- **Emma**: 3:30 PM–4:15 PM (Chinatown, 45 minutes).

### Step 6: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the proposed schedule to ensure it meets all constraints (Subgoal 5).  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the schedule satisfies each friend’s availability window, minimum meeting durations, and travel times.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Proposed schedule:  
- **Sophia**: 9:12 AM–11:12 AM, Sunset District (120 minutes).  
- **Lucas**: 1:51 PM–3:21 PM, Pacific Heights (90 minutes).  
- **Emma**: 3:30 PM–4:15 PM, Chinatown (45 minutes).  

**Validation**:  
- **Sophia**:  
  - Availability: 7:00 AM–3:15 PM.  
  - Meeting: 9:12 AM–11:12 AM (120 minutes). Within availability, meets duration requirement.  
  - Travel: Arrive at Mission District at 9:00 AM, travel to Sunset District (12 minutes), arrive at 9:12 AM. Valid.  
- **Lucas**:  
  - Availability: 10:00 AM–8:30 PM.  
  - Meeting: 1:51 PM–3:21 PM (90 minutes). Within availability, meets duration requirement.  
  - Travel: From Sunset District (end at 11:12 AM) to Pacific Heights (14 minutes), arrive at 11:26 AM. Meeting starts at 1:51 PM, so there’s a gap of 145 minutes (11:26 AM–1:51 PM). Valid, though I could spend this time waiting or doing another activity in Pacific Heights.  
- **Emma**:  
  - Availability: 3:30 PM–7:45 PM.  
  - Meeting: 3:30 PM–4:15 PM (45 minutes). Within availability, meets duration requirement.  
  - Travel: From Pacific Heights (end at 3:21 PM) to Chinatown (9 minutes), arrive at 3:30 PM. Valid.  

The schedule satisfies all constraints and allows meeting all three friends.

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all three friends in San Francisco, satisfying all constraints, is:  
- **9:12 AM–11:12 AM**: Meet Sophia in Sunset District (120 minutes).  
- **11:26 AM–1:51 PM**: Travel to Pacific Heights (14 minutes) and wait or engage in an activity (145 minutes).  
- **1:51 PM–3:21 PM**: Meet Lucas in Pacific Heights (90 minutes).  
- **3:30 PM–4:15 PM**: Meet Emma in Chinatown (45 minutes).  

This schedule accounts for travel times and ensures each meeting occurs within the friends’ availability windows while meeting the minimum duration requirements.
