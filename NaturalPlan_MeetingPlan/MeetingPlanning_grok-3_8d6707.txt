**Problem Restatement**:  
You are visiting San Francisco for one day, starting at the Mission District at 9:00 AM. Your goal is to meet as many friends as possible, specifically James, Rachel, Emma, Daniel, and Sophia, while adhering to their availability constraints and minimum meeting times. You must optimize the schedule to meet all five friends, considering travel times between locations (provided in minutes) and ensuring the schedule is feasible. If no solution exists, provide a detailed explanation.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of meeting all five friends into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and location constraints. Create a sequence of visits that respects time windows, travel times, and minimum meeting durations. Subgoals include:  
1. Meet Daniel at Noe Valley (9:30 AM–11:30 AM, 60 minutes minimum).  
2. Meet James at Chinatown (11:30 AM–7:45 PM, 60 minutes minimum).  
3. Meet Emma at Fisherman’s Wharf (1:00 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes minimum).  
4. Meet Sophia at Russian Hill (3:00 PM–5:30 PM, 75 minutes minimum).  
5. Meet Rachel at Pacific Heights (6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 90 minutes minimum).
