### Problem Restatement
The goal is to meet as many friends as possible during a one-day visit to San Francisco, starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. The friends to meet are:
- **Jacob** at Marina District (available 7:00 AM to 2:30 PM, requires 120 minutes).
- **Emma** at Union Square (available 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM, requires 90 minutes).
- **Michael** at North Beach (available 3:30 PM to 7:45 PM, requires 60 minutes).

Travel times between locations are provided (e.g., Sunset District to Marina District takes 18 minutes). The task is to create an optimal schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while satisfying the time constraints and minimum meeting durations. If no feasible schedule exists, a detailed explanation of why must be provided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals. The primary goal is to meet Jacob, Emma, and Michael within their availability windows while accounting for travel times and minimum meeting durations. Subgoals:
1. Determine a sequence of locations to visit (Sunset District, Marina District, Union Square, North Beach).
2. Allocate meeting times for Jacob (120 minutes), Emma (90 minutes), and Michael (60 minutes) within their availability windows.
3. Incorporate travel times between locations.
4. Evaluate if all constraints can be satisfied or identify conflicts.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether it’s possible to meet all three friends (Jacob, Emma, Michael) given their availability and the minimum meeting durations, considering travel times. This will be achieved by constructing a tentative schedule and checking if it fits within the time constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the feasibility, let’s test a schedule starting from Sunset District at 9:00 AM:
- **Meet Jacob at Marina District**: Travel from Sunset District to Marina District (18 minutes). Arrive at 9:18 AM. Jacob is available from 7:00 AM to 2:30 PM. Meet for 120 minutes (9:18 AM to 11:18 AM).
- **Travel to Union Square**: From Marina District to Union Square takes 15 minutes. Arrive at 11:33 AM. Emma is available from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. Meet for 90 minutes (11:33 AM to 1:03 PM).
- **Travel to North Beach**: From Union Square to North Beach takes 12 minutes. Arrive at 1:15 PM. Michael is available from 3:30 PM to 7:45 PM, requiring a wait until 3:30 PM (wait time: 2 hours 15 minutes). Meet Michael for 60 minutes (3:30 PM to 4:30 PM).

**Validation Check**:
- Jacob: 9:18 AM to 11:18 AM (120 minutes, within 7:00 AM–2:30 PM). Valid.
- Emma: 11:33 AM to 1:03 PM (90 minutes, within 9:30 AM–5:00 PM). Valid.
- Michael: 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM (60 minutes, within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM). Valid.
- All travel times and meeting durations are satisfied.

This schedule is feasible, meeting all three friends.

### Step 3: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Primary Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (Jacob, Emma, Michael).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Jacob at Marina District for 120 minutes (7:00 AM–2:30 PM).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Emma at Union Square for 90 minutes (9:30 AM–5:00 PM).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Michael at North Beach for 60 minutes (3:30 PM–7:45 PM).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Incorporate travel times between locations.
  - **Subgoal 5**: Validate the schedule for feasibility.

**Current Goal**: Confirm the schedule meets all constraints and optimizes the number of friends met.

**Summary**: The schedule from Step 2 (meet Jacob at 9:18 AM, Emma at 11:33 AM, Michael at 3:30 PM) satisfies all constraints and meets all three friends, achieving the maximum possible.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Evaluate if alternative schedules could reduce wait time (e.g., 2 hours 15 minutes waiting for Michael) or optimize the day. Consider reordering visits or adjusting meeting durations within constraints to minimize idle time. Possible adjustment: Explore if meeting Emma before Jacob reduces wait time or allows earlier completion.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate an alternative schedule (e.g., meeting Emma before Jacob) to check if it reduces wait time or completes earlier while meeting all constraints. Construct and test the alternative schedule.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test an alternative schedule starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM:
- **Travel to Union Square**: Takes 25 minutes. Arrive at 9:25 AM. Emma is available from 9:30 AM. Meet Emma for 90 minutes (9:30 AM to 11:00 AM).
- **Travel to Marina District**: Takes 14 minutes. Arrive at 11:14 AM. Jacob is available until 2:30 PM. Meet Jacob for 120 minutes (11:14 AM to 1:14 PM).
- **Travel to North Beach**: Takes 10 minutes. Arrive at 1:24 PM. Michael is available from 3:30 PM, requiring a wait until 3:30 PM (wait time: 2 hours 6 minutes). Meet Michael for 60 minutes (3:30 PM to 4:30 PM).

**Validation Check**:
- Emma: 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (90 minutes, within 9:30 AM–5:00 PM). Valid.
- Jacob: 11:14 AM to 1:14 PM (120 minutes, within 7:00 AM–2:30 PM). Valid.
- Michael: 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM (60 minutes, within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM). Valid.
- Total travel time: 25 + 14 + 10 = 49 minutes. Wait time: 2 hours 6 minutes.

**Comparison**:
- Original schedule (Step 2): Total travel time = 18 + 15 + 12 = 45 minutes, wait time = 2 hours 15 minutes, ends at 4:30 PM.
- Alternative schedule: Total travel time = 49 minutes, wait time = 2 hours 6 minutes, ends at 4:30 PM.

The alternative reduces wait time by 9 minutes but increases travel time by 4 minutes. The original schedule is slightly more efficient due to lower total travel time.

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the optimal schedule to meet all three friends, minimizing travel and wait time. Based on Step 5, adopt the original schedule (Sunset → Marina → Union Square → North Beach) as it has less travel time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Final Schedule**:
- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.
- Travel to Marina District (18 minutes). Arrive at 9:18 AM. Meet Jacob for 120 minutes (9:18 AM to 11:18 AM).
- Travel to Union Square (15 minutes). Arrive at 11:33 AM. Meet Emma for 90 minutes (11:33 AM to 1:03 PM).
- Travel to North Beach (12 minutes). Arrive at 1:15 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM. Meet Michael for 60 minutes (3:30 PM to 4:30 PM).

**Verification**:
- Jacob: 120 minutes within 7:00 AM–2:30 PM. Satisfied.
- Emma: 90 minutes within 9:30 AM–5:00 PM. Satisfied.
- Michael: 60 minutes within 3:30 PM–7:45 PM. Satisfied.
- Total travel time: 45 minutes. Wait time: 2 hours 15 minutes.
- Meets all three friends, maximizing the goal.

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all three friends is:
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Sunset District.
- **9:18 AM**: Arrive at Marina District (18-minute travel). Meet Jacob for 120 minutes (until 11:18 AM).
- **11:33 AM**: Arrive at Union Square (15-minute travel). Meet Emma for 90 minutes (until 1:03 PM).
- **1:15 PM**: Arrive at North Beach (12-minute travel). Wait until 3:30 PM.
- **3:30 PM**: Meet Michael for 60 minutes (until 4:30 PM).

This schedule satisfies all constraints, meets all three friends, and minimizes travel time (45 minutes total). The wait time of 2 hours 15 minutes is necessary due to Michael’s late availability.
