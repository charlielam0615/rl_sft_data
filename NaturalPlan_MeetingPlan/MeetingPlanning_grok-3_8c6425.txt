### Problem Statement
I need to arrange a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, starting at the Mission District at 9:00 AM. The friends and their availability, locations, and minimum meeting durations are:
- Ethan: The Castro, 9:30 AM–11:30 AM, minimum 60 minutes.
- Sophia: Nob Hill, 11:00 AM–3:30 PM, minimum 75 minutes.
- Daniel: Chinatown, 1:00 PM–7:30 PM, minimum 60 minutes.
- Rachel: Fisherman’s Wharf, 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, minimum 45 minutes.
- Olivia: Pacific Heights, 6:30 PM–9:00 PM, minimum 90 minutes.
Travel times between locations are provided (e.g., Mission District to Chinatown: 15 minutes). The goal is to optimize the schedule to meet as many friends as possible while respecting their availability and the minimum meeting durations.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations:
- Subgoal 1: Meet Ethan at The Castro between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM for at least 60 minutes.
- Subgoal 2: Meet Sophia at Nob Hill between 11:00 AM and 3:30 PM for at least 75 minutes.
- Subgoal 3: Meet Rachel at Fisherman’s Wharf between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM for at least 45 minutes.
- Subgoal 4: Meet Daniel at Chinatown between 1:00 PM and 7:30 PM for at least 60 minutes.
- Subgoal 5: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights between 6:30 PM and 9:00 PM for at least 90 minutes.
Each subgoal includes traveling to the friend’s location, meeting for the required duration, and ensuring the schedule aligns with time constraints.

  - Subgoal 1: Meet Ethan at The Castro (9:30 AM–11:30 AM, ≥60 min).
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Sophia at Nob Hill (11:00 AM–3:30 PM, ≥75 min).
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Rachel at Fisherman’s Wharf (2:00 PM–5:00 PM, ≥45 min).
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥60 min).
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (6:30 PM–9:00 PM, ≥90 min).
**Current Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible by scheduling meetings within their availability windows, accounting for travel times.
