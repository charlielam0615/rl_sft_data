**Problem Statement**:  
The goal is to create an optimal schedule for a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, starting at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. The friends are Liam (Nob Hill, 12:00 PM–6:30 PM, 75 minutes minimum), Emma (Fisherman’s Wharf, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 120 minutes minimum), Noah (Marina District, 1:30 PM–3:30 PM, 45 minutes minimum), Ava (Sunset District, 10:00 AM–12:00 PM, 90 minutes minimum), and Isabella (Embarcadero, 3:00 PM–5:30 PM, 60 minutes minimum). Travel times between locations are provided, and the schedule must maximize the number of friends met while satisfying the minimum meeting time constraints and respecting their availability windows.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and location. The subgoals are to:  
1. Meet Ava at Sunset District between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM for at least 90 minutes.  
2. Meet Noah at Marina District between 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM for at least 45 minutes.  
3. Meet Isabella at Embarcadero between 3:00 PM and 5:30 PM for at least 60 minutes.  
4. Meet Liam at Nob Hill between 12:00 PM and 6:30 PM for at least 75 minutes.  
5. Meet Emma at Fisherman’s Wharf between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM for at least 120 minutes.  
Each subgoal involves arriving at the friend’s location within their availability window, spending the required minimum time, and accounting for travel times between locations.

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Construct a feasible schedule to meet all five friends, maximizing the number of friends met.  
**How to Achieve**: Start at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM and create a sequence of visits based on the chronological order of availability windows, ensuring each meeting satisfies the minimum time requirement and accounting for travel times between locations. Test a potential schedule: Ava (Sunset District) → Noah (Marina District) → Isabella (Embarcadero) → Liam (Nob Hill) → Emma (Fisherman’s Wharf).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let’s test the schedule:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Alamo Square.  
- **Travel to Sunset District**: 20 minutes (arrive 9:20 AM).  
- **Meet Ava**: Available 10:00 AM–12:00 PM. Wait 40 minutes (9:20 AM–10:00 AM). Meet from 10:00 AM–11:30 AM (90 minutes).  
- **Travel to Marina District**: Depart 11:30 AM, 21 minutes (arrive 11:51 AM).  
- **Meet Noah**: Available 1:30 PM–3:30 PM. Wait 99 minutes (11:51 AM–1:30 PM). Meet from 1:30 PM–2:15 PM (45 minutes).  
- **Travel to Embarcadero**: Depart 2:15 PM, 13 minutes (arrive 2:28 PM).  
- **Meet Isabella**: Available 3:00 PM–5:30 PM. Wait 32 minutes (2:28 PM–3:00 PM). Meet from 3:00 PM–4:00 PM (60 minutes).  
- **Travel to Nob Hill**: Depart 4:00 PM, 8 minutes (arrive 4:08 PM).  
- **Meet Liam**: Available 12:00 PM–6:30 PM. Meet from 4:08 PM–5:23 PM (75 minutes).  
- **Travel to Fisherman’s Wharf**: Depart 5:23 PM, 10 minutes (arrive 5:33 PM).  
- **Meet Emma**: Available 6:00 PM–9:00 PM. Wait 27 minutes (5:33 PM–6:00 PM). Meet from 6:00 PM–8:00 PM (120 minutes).  
- **End**: 8:00 PM, within Emma’s availability (ends 9:00 PM).  
This schedule meets all five friends, satisfying minimum meeting times and availability constraints. Total wait time: 40 + 99 + 32 + 27 = 198 minutes.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The initial schedule works but has significant wait time (198 minutes). Adjust the subgoals to minimize wait time by exploring alternative sequences, such as meeting Liam before Isabella, since Liam’s availability (12:00 PM–6:30 PM) is more flexible than Isabella’s (3:00 PM–5:30 PM). New sequence to test: Ava (Sunset District) → Noah (Marina District) → Liam (Nob Hill) → Isabella (Embarcadero) → Emma (Fisherman’s Wharf).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Test the adjusted schedule to meet all five friends with reduced wait time.  
**How to Achieve**: Follow the new sequence (Ava → Noah → Liam → Isabella → Emma), calculate arrival and meeting times, and ensure all constraints are met while minimizing wait time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test the adjusted schedule:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Alamo Square.  
- **Travel to Sunset District**: 20 minutes (arrive 9:20 AM).  
- **Meet Ava**: Available 10:00 AM–12:00 PM. Wait 40 minutes (9:20 AM–10:00 AM). Meet 10:00 AM–11:30 AM (90 minutes).  
- **Travel to Marina District**: Depart 11:30 AM, 21 minutes (arrive 11:51 AM).  
- **Meet Noah**: Available 1:30 PM–3:30 PM. Wait 99 minutes (11:51 AM–1:30 PM). Meet 1:30 PM–2:15 PM (45 minutes).  
- **Travel to Nob Hill**: Depart 2:15 PM, 9 minutes (arrive 2:24 PM).  
- **Meet Liam**: Available 12:00 PM–6:30 PM. Meet 2:24 PM–3:39 PM (75 minutes).  
- **Travel to Embarcadero**: Depart 3:39 PM, 9 minutes (arrive 3:48 PM).  
- **Meet Isabella**: Available 3:00 PM–5:30 PM. Meet 3:48 PM–4:48 PM (60 minutes).  
- **Travel to Fisherman’s Wharf**: Depart 4:48 PM, 7 minutes (arrive 4:55 PM).  
- **Meet Emma**: Available 6:00 PM–9:00 PM. Wait 65 minutes (4:55 PM–6:00 PM). Meet 6:00 PM–8:00 PM (120 minutes).  
- **End**: 8:00 PM, within Emma’s availability.  
Total wait time: 40 + 99 + 65 = 204 minutes. This schedule is feasible but has more wait time than the previous one (198 minutes).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate which schedule (Step 3 or Step 5) is optimal for meeting all five friends.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the two schedules based on total wait time and feasibility within constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Step 3 Schedule** (Ava → Noah → Isabella → Liam → Emma): Total wait time = 198 minutes, meets all constraints, ends at 8:00 PM.  
- **Step 5 Schedule** (Ava → Noah → Liam → Isabella → Emma): Total wait time = 204 minutes, meets all constraints, ends at 8:00 PM.  
The Step 3 schedule is better due to lower wait time (198 vs. 204 minutes). Both schedules meet all five friends within their availability windows and satisfy minimum meeting times.
