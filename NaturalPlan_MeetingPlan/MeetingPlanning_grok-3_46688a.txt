### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible on May 28, 2025, starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Each friend is available at a specific location and time window, with minimum meeting durations. Travel times between locations are provided, and the schedule must optimize the number of friends met while satisfying all constraints. If no schedule meets all constraints, a detailed explanation will be provided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify friends' availability and locations.  
2. Determine feasible meeting sequences based on time windows and travel times.  
3. Optimize the schedule to maximize the number of friends met while respecting minimum meeting durations and travel constraints.  
4. Validate the schedule to ensure all constraints are met or identify conflicts if no solution exists.

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the scheduling process into:  
1. Create a timeline starting at 9:00 AM at Fisherman's Wharf.  
2. Test possible meeting sequences, accounting for travel times and minimum meeting durations.
