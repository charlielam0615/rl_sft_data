**Problem Statement**: The goal is to create an optimal schedule to meet as many friends as possible during a one-day visit to San Francisco, starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM. The friends to meet are Michael (Bayview, 11:30 AM–4:30 PM, 60 minutes minimum), Susan (Marina District, 7:45 AM–9:45 AM, 15 minutes minimum), Robert (Fisherman’s Wharf, 8:00 AM–10:00 AM, 30 minutes minimum), Nancy (Presidio, 4:00 PM–8:30 PM, 45 minutes minimum), Karen (Haight-Ashbury, 9:00 PM–10:30 PM, 60 minutes minimum), and Paul (Nob Hill, 10:00 AM–2:00 PM, 120 minutes minimum). Travel times between locations are provided, and the schedule must account for these times while maximizing the number of friends met within their availability windows.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and location constraints. Create a sequence of potential meetings by considering the time windows and travel times, aiming to maximize the number of friends met.  

1. **Identify time windows and constraints**: List each friend’s availability and required meeting duration:
   - Susan: Marina District, 7:45 AM–9:45 AM, ≥15 min
   - Robert: Fisherman’s Wharf, 8:00 AM–10:00 AM, ≥30 min
   - Paul: Nob Hill, 10:00 AM–2:00 PM, ≥120 min
   - Michael: Bayview, 11:30 AM–4:30 PM, ≥60 min
   - Nancy: Presidio, 4:00 PM–8:30 PM, ≥45 min
   - Karen: Haight-Ashbury, 9:00 PM–10:30 PM, ≥60 min
2. **Initial location**: Start at North Beach at 9:00 AM.
3. **Subgoals**:
   - Meet Susan before 9:45 AM (Marina District, 9 min from North Beach).
   - Meet Robert before 10:00 AM (Fisherman’s Wharf, 5 min from North Beach).
   - Meet Paul between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM (Nob Hill, 7 min from North Beach).
   - Meet Michael between 11:30 AM and 4:30 PM (Bayview, 22 min from North Beach).
   - Meet Nancy between 4:00 PM and 8:30 PM (Presidio, 17 min from North Beach).
   - Meet Karen between 9:00 PM and 10:30 PM (Haight-Ashbury, 18 min from North Beach).
4. **Prioritize early meetings**: Susan and Robert have early, short windows, so prioritize them. Paul’s long duration (120 min) and Michael’s midday window suggest they follow. Nancy and Karen have later windows, so they can be scheduled last.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Meet Susan at Marina District within her availability (7:45 AM–9:45 AM) for at least 15 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: Travel from North Beach to Marina District (9 min), arriving early enough to meet Susan before her window closes at 9:45 AM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start at North Beach at 9:00 AM. Travel to Marina District takes 9 minutes, so depart at 9:00 AM and arrive at 9:09 AM. Susan is available until 9:45 AM, providing 36 minutes (9:09 AM–9:45 AM), which satisfies the minimum of 15 minutes. Meet Susan from 9:09 AM to 9:24 AM (15 minutes).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible.
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Susan at Marina District (7:45 AM–9:45 AM, ≥15 min) — **Completed** (9:09 AM–9:24 AM).
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Robert at Fisherman’s Wharf (8:00 AM–10:00 AM, ≥30 min).
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Paul at Nob Hill (10:00 AM–2:00 PM, ≥120 min).
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Michael at Bayview (11:30 AM–4:30 PM, ≥60 min).
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Nancy at Presidio (4:00 PM–8:30 PM, ≥45 min).
  - Subgoal 6: Meet Karen at Haight-Ashbury (9:00 PM–10:30 PM, ≥60 min).  
**Current Goal**: Meet Robert at Fisherman’s Wharf for at least 30 minutes before 10:00 AM.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Meet Robert at Fisherman’s Wharf within his availability (8:00 AM–10:00 AM) for at least 30 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: Travel from Marina District to Fisherman’s Wharf (10 min), arriving in time to meet Robert before 10:00 AM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After meeting Susan at Marina District until 9:24 AM, travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (10 min). Depart at 9:24 AM, arrive at 9:34 AM. Robert is available until 10:00 AM, providing 26 minutes (9:34 AM–10:00 AM), which is less than the required 30 minutes. Adjust departure to meet Susan for the minimum 15 minutes (9:09 AM–9:24 AM), then travel immediately. This still yields 26 minutes, indicating Robert’s meeting may not be feasible.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Meeting Robert for 30 minutes is not feasible after meeting Susan, as only 26 minutes remain in his window. Reassess subgoals to prioritize meeting the maximum number of friends. Skip Robert and adjust the schedule to target Paul next, whose window (10:00 AM–2:00 PM) is compatible with the current time and location. New subgoal order:  
1. Meet Susan (completed).  
2. Meet Paul at Nob Hill (10:00 AM–2:00 PM, ≥120 min).  
3. Meet Michael at Bayview (11:30 AM–4:30 PM, ≥60 min).  
4. Meet Nancy at Presidio (4:00 PM–8:30 PM, ≥45 min).  
5. Meet Karen at Haight-Ashbury (9:00 PM–10:30 PM, ≥60 min).

### Step 11: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the schedule meets all constraints and maximizes the number of friends met.  
**How to Achieve**: Check each meeting against time windows, travel times, and duration requirements, and confirm no additional friends can be met (e.g., Robert).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Schedule Summary**:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at North Beach.  
- **9:09 AM–9:24 AM**: Meet Susan at Marina District (15 min, satisfies ≥15 min).  
- **9:36 AM–12:00 PM**: Travel to Nob Hill (12 min), meet Paul (10:00 AM–12:00 PM, 120 min, satisfies ≥120 min).  
- **12:19 PM–1:19 PM**: Travel to Bayview (19 min), meet Michael (60 min, satisfies ≥60 min).  
- **1:50 PM–4:45 PM**: Travel to Presidio (31 min), wait, meet Nancy (4:00 PM–4:45 PM, 45 min, satisfies ≥45 min).  
- **5:00 PM–10:00 PM**: Travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 min), wait, meet Karen (9:00 PM–10:00 PM, 60 min, satisfies ≥60 min).  

**Verification**:  
- **Susan**: Met from 9:09 AM to 9:24 AM (within 7:45 AM–9:45 AM, 15 min ≥ 15 min).  
- **Paul**: Met from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (within 10:00 AM–2:00 PM, 120 min ≥ 120 min).  
- **Michael**: Met from 12:19 PM to 1:19 PM (within 11:30 AM–4:30 PM, 60 min ≥ 60 min).  
- **Nancy**: Met from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM (within 4:00 PM–8:30 PM, 45 min ≥ 45 min).  
- **Karen**: Met from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM (within 9:00 PM–10:30 PM, 60 min ≥ 60 min).  
- **Robert**: Not met. Attempting to meet Robert after Susan (9:24 AM, travel 10 min to Fisherman’s Wharf, arrive 9:34 AM) provides only 26 minutes (until 10:00 AM), which is less than the required 30 minutes. No earlier departure from North Beach is possible (start at 9:00 AM), and adjusting Susan’s meeting to end earlier does not resolve the conflict due to travel time.  

**Conclusion**: The schedule meets five friends (Susan, Paul, Michael, Nancy, Karen), satisfying all constraints for these meetings. Robert cannot be met due to the time conflict with Susan and the minimum duration requirement. This schedule maximizes the number of friends met (5 out of 6).

### Final Answer
**Optimal Schedule**:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at North Beach.  
- **9:09 AM–9:24 AM**: Meet Susan at Marina District (15 min).  
- **9:36 AM–12:00 PM**: Travel to Nob Hill (12 min), meet Paul (10:00 AM–12:00 PM, 120 min).  
- **12:19 PM–1:19 PM**: Travel to Bayview (19 min), meet Michael (60 min).  
- **1:50 PM–4:45 PM**: Travel to Presidio (31 min), wait, meet Nancy (4:00 PM–4:45 PM, 45 min).  
- **5:00 PM–10:00 PM**: Travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 min), wait, meet Karen (9:00 PM–10:00 PM, 60 min).  

**Outcome**: You meet five friends (Susan, Paul, Michael, Nancy, Karen). Robert cannot be met due to insufficient time (only 26 minutes available after meeting Susan, less than the required 30 minutes). This schedule is optimal as it meets the maximum number of friends possible within the given constraints.
