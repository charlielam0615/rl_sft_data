### Problem Statement
I need to arrange a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. The friends are Michael (available at Nob Hill from 2:30 PM to 6:15 PM, minimum 60 minutes), Olivia (available at Marina District from 10:15 AM to 3:45 PM, minimum 75 minutes), and James (available at Union Square from 9:15 AM to 5:30 PM, minimum 90 minutes). Travel times between locations are provided, and the goal is to optimize the schedule to meet all three friends while satisfying the time constraints.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting all three friends into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. The subgoals are:  
1. Meet James at Union Square (90 minutes, between 9:15 AM and 5:30 PM).  
2. Meet Olivia at Marina District (75 minutes, between 10:15 AM and 3:45 PM).  
3. Meet Michael at Nob Hill (60 minutes, between 2:30 PM and 6:15 PM).  
4. Account for travel times between locations to ensure feasibility.  
The schedule must start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM and maximize the number of friends met.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (Michael, Olivia, James).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet James at Union Square (90 minutes, 9:15 AM–5:30 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Olivia at Marina District (75 minutes, 10:15 AM–3:45 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Michael at Nob Hill (60 minutes, 2:30 PM–6:15 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Account for travel times to ensure a feasible schedule.  
**Current Goal**: Meet James at Union Square, as it’s the earliest available meeting (starting at 9:15 AM) and aligns with the starting location of Sunset District.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Meet James at Union Square.  
**How to Achieve**: Travel from Sunset District to Union Square (25 minutes) to arrive after 9:15 AM and meet James for 90 minutes within his availability (9:15 AM–5:30 PM).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, travel to Union Square takes 25 minutes, arriving at 9:25 AM. James is available from 9:15 AM, so meet him from 9:25 AM to 10:55 AM (90 minutes).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
With the first subgoal (meet James) achieved from 9:25 AM to 10:55 AM at Union Square, adjust the remaining subgoals to meet Olivia and Michael. Possible next steps:  
1. Travel to Marina District to meet Olivia (75 minutes, 10:15 AM–3:45 PM).  
2. Travel to Nob Hill to meet Michael (60 minutes, 2:30 PM–6:15 PM).  
Since Olivia’s availability starts at 10:15 AM and ends earlier (3:45 PM) than Michael’s, prioritize meeting Olivia next to maximize the chance of meeting all three friends.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Meet Olivia at Marina District.  
**How to Achieve**: From Union Square, travel to Marina District (15 minutes) and meet Olivia for 75 minutes within her availability (10:15 AM–3:45 PM).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After meeting James at Union Square until 10:55 AM, travel to Marina District takes 15 minutes, arriving at 11:10 AM. Olivia is available from 10:15 AM, so meet her from 11:10 AM to 12:25 PM (75 minutes).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Meet Michael at Nob Hill.  
**How to Achieve**: From Marina District, travel to Nob Hill (11 minutes) and meet Michael for 60 minutes within his availability (2:30 PM–6:15 PM).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After meeting Olivia at Marina District until 12:25 PM, travel to Nob Hill takes 11 minutes, arriving at 12:36 PM. Michael is available from 2:30 PM, so wait until 2:30 PM and meet him from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM (60 minutes).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the proposed schedule to ensure it meets all constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the schedule satisfies the minimum meeting times, respects availability windows, and accounts for travel times correctly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the schedule:  
- **James**: Met at Union Square from 9:25 AM to 10:55 AM (90 minutes, within 9:15 AM–5:30 PM). Valid.  
- **Olivia**: Met at Marina District from 11:10 AM to 12:25 PM (75 minutes, within 10:15 AM–3:45 PM). Valid.  
- **Michael**: Met at Nob Hill from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM (60 minutes, within 2:30 PM–6:15 PM). Valid.  
- **Travel Times**:  
  - Sunset District to Union Square: 25 minutes (9:00 AM to 9:25 AM).  
  - Union Square to Marina District: 15 minutes (10:55 AM to 11:10 AM).  
  - Marina District to Nob Hill: 11 minutes (12:25 PM to 12:36 PM).  
- **Waiting Time**: At Nob Hill, wait from 12:36 PM to 2:30 PM (114 minutes), which is feasible.  
The schedule meets all constraints and maximizes the number of friends met (all three).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (Michael, Olivia, James).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet James at Union Square (90 minutes, 9:15 AM–5:30 PM) – Completed (9:25 AM–10:55 AM).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Olivia at Marina District (75 minutes, 10:15 AM–3:45 PM) – Completed (11:10 AM–12:25 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Michael at Nob Hill (60 minutes, 2:30 PM–6:15 PM) – Completed (2:30 PM–3:30 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Account for travel times – Completed (all travel times validated).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Solution
The optimal schedule to meet all three friends is:  
- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.  
- Travel to Union Square (25 minutes), arrive at 9:25 AM, and meet James from 9:25 AM to 10:55 AM (90 minutes).  
- Travel to Marina District (15 minutes), arrive at 11:10 AM, and meet Olivia from 11:10 AM to 12:25 PM (75 minutes).  
- Travel to Nob Hill (11 minutes), arrive at 12:36 PM, wait until 2:30 PM, and meet Michael from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM (60 minutes).  

This schedule satisfies all constraints, meets the minimum meeting times, and respects the availability windows of all three friends, achieving the goal of meeting as many friends as possible (all three). No alternative schedules were found to improve this outcome, as meeting all three friends is the maximum possible.
