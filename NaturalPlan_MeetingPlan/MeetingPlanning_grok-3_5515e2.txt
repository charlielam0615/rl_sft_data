**Problem Restatement:**
The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco on a single day, starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, while satisfying the time and duration constraints for each friend’s availability and the travel times between locations. The friends and their constraints are:
- **Noah**: Available at Sunset District from 9:15 AM to 11:45 AM, requires at least 90 minutes.
- **Lucas**: Available at Haight-Ashbury from 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM, requires at least 75 minutes.
- **Liam**: Available at Marina District from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, requires at least 45 minutes.
- **Emma**: Available at Russian Hill from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM, requires at least 60 minutes.
- **Isabella**: Available at Alamo Square from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, requires at least 60 minutes.
Travel times between locations are provided (e.g., Embarcadero to Sunset District: 30 minutes). The objective is to create a schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while adhering to all constraints. If no schedule meets all constraints, a detailed explanation of the infeasibility will be provided.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals. To maximize the number of friends met, create a schedule that includes meeting each friend within their availability window, accounting for travel times and minimum meeting durations. Subgoals:
1. Determine a feasible sequence of meeting locations based on friends’ availability windows.
2. Calculate total time required for each potential schedule, including travel and meeting times.
3. Evaluate which sequence allows meeting the most friends while satisfying minimum duration constraints.
4. Check if all five friends can be met; if not, identify the maximum subset and explain infeasibility.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Identify a feasible sequence of meetings that maximizes the number of friends met.
**How to Achieve**: List all friends’ availability and minimum meeting durations. Attempt to construct a schedule starting from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, prioritizing early availability (Noah) and checking transitions to other friends based on travel times and time windows. Test a sequence that covers all five friends if possible, adjusting for overlaps and travel constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Noah is available at Sunset District from 9:15 AM to 11:45 AM, requiring 90 minutes. Travel time from Embarcadero to Sunset District is 30 minutes, so arrival at Sunset District is 9:30 AM. Meet Noah from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (90 minutes), ending at 11:00 AM.

Next, consider Lucas at Haight-Ashbury (12:00 PM–8:00 PM, 75 minutes). Travel from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury takes 11 minutes, arriving at 11:11 AM. Since Lucas is available from 12:00 PM, wait until 12:00 PM and meet Lucas from 12:00 PM to 1:15 PM (75 minutes).

Next, target Liam at Marina District (1:30 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes). Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Marina District takes 16 minutes, arriving at 1:31 PM. Meet Liam from 1:31 PM to 2:16 PM (45 minutes).

Next, target Emma at Russian Hill (3:30 PM–6:30 PM, 60 minutes). Travel from Marina District to Russian Hill takes 7 minutes, arriving at 2:23 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM and meet Emma from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM (60 minutes).

Finally, target Isabella at Alamo Square (7:00 PM–9:30 PM, 60 minutes). Travel from Russian Hill to Alamo Square takes 12 minutes, arriving at 4:42 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM and meet Isabella from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM (60 minutes).

**Tentative Schedule**:
- 9:00 AM: Start at Embarcadero.
- 9:30 AM–11:00 AM: Meet Noah at Sunset District (90 minutes).
- 11:11 AM: Arrive at Haight-Ashbury.
- 12:00 PM–1:15 PM: Meet Lucas at Haight-Ashbury (75 minutes).
- 1:31 PM–2:16 PM: Meet Liam at Marina District (45 minutes).
- 2:23 PM–4:30 PM: Meet Emma at Russian Hill (60 minutes, starting at 3:30 PM).
- 4:42 PM–8:00 PM: Meet Isabella at Alamo Square (60 minutes, starting at 7:00 PM).

This schedule meets all five friends within their availability windows and satisfies minimum meeting durations. Total time ends at 8:00 PM, within Isabella’s window (ends at 9:30 PM).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Verify that the proposed schedule satisfies all constraints, including travel times, availability windows, and minimum meeting durations.
**How to Achieve**: Check each meeting’s start and end times against availability windows, ensure travel times are correctly applied, and confirm that minimum durations are met. Identify any conflicts or infeasibilities.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the schedule:
- **Noah**: Available 9:15 AM–11:45 AM, requires 90 minutes. Meet 9:30 AM–11:00 AM (90 minutes). Travel: 30 minutes (Embarcadero to Sunset District). Valid, as 9:30 AM is after 9:15 AM, and 11:00 AM is before 11:45 AM.
- **Lucas**: Available 12:00 PM–8:00 PM, requires 75 minutes. Meet 12:00 PM–1:15 PM (75 minutes). Travel: 11 minutes (Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury, arrive 11:11 AM, wait until 12:00 PM). Valid.
- **Liam**: Available 1:30 PM–4:00 PM, requires 45 minutes. Meet 1:31 PM–2:16 PM (45 minutes). Travel: 16 minutes (Haight-Ashbury to Marina District). Valid, as 1:31 PM is after 1:30 PM, and 2:16 PM is before 4:00 PM.
- **Emma**: Available 3:30 PM–6:30 PM, requires 60 minutes. Meet 3:30 PM–4:30 PM (60 minutes). Travel: 7 minutes (Marina District to Russian Hill, arrive 2:23 PM, wait until 3:30 PM). Valid.
- **Isabella**: Available 7:00 PM–9:30 PM, requires 60 minutes. Meet 7:00 PM–8:00 PM (60 minutes). Travel: 12 minutes (Russian Hill to Alamo Square, arrive 4:42 PM, wait until 7:00 PM). Valid.

The schedule is feasible, with no overlaps or violations of availability windows. All minimum durations are met, and travel times are correctly accounted for.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco on a single day, starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Noah at Sunset District (90 minutes, 9:15 AM–11:45 AM).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Lucas at Haight-Ashbury (75 minutes, 12:00 PM–8:00 PM).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Liam at Marina District (45 minutes, 1:30 PM–4:00 PM).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Meet Emma at Russian Hill (60 minutes, 3:30 PM–6:30 PM).
  - **Subgoal 5**: Meet Isabella at Alamo Square (60 minutes, 7:00 PM–9:30 PM).

**Current Goal**: Confirm that the schedule meets all five friends, as validated in the previous step. The schedule achieves the main goal of maximizing friends met (all five: Noah, Lucas, Liam, Emma, Isabella) while satisfying all constraints.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Consider alternative schedules to ensure the proposed schedule is optimal for meeting all five friends. Evaluate if a different sequence reduces waiting times or allows earlier completion, while still meeting all constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Try an alternative sequence: Noah → Liam → Lucas → Emma → Isabella.
- Start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.
- Noah (Sunset District, 9:15 AM–11:45 AM, 90 minutes): Travel 30 minutes, arrive 9:30 AM, meet 9:30 AM–11:00 AM.
- Liam (Marina District, 1:30 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes): Travel from Sunset District to Marina District (22 minutes), arrive 11:22 AM, wait until 1:30 PM, meet 1:30 PM–2:15 PM.
- Lucas (Haight-Ashbury, 12:00 PM–8:00 PM, 75 minutes): Travel from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury (17 minutes), arrive 2:32 PM, meet 2:32 PM–3:47 PM.
- Emma (Russian Hill, 3:30 PM–6:30 PM, 60 minutes): Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill (19 minutes), arrive 4:06 PM, meet 4:06 PM–5:06 PM.
- Isabella (Alamo Square, 7:00 PM–9:30 PM, 60 minutes): Travel from Russian Hill to Alamo Square (12 minutes), arrive 5:18 PM, wait until 7:00 PM, meet 7:00 PM–8:00 PM.

This sequence is feasible but has similar waiting times (e.g., 11:22 AM–1:30 PM for Liam, 5:18 PM–7:00 PM for Isabella) and ends at the same time (8:00 PM). The original sequence (Noah → Lucas → Liam → Emma → Isabella) is equally efficient and simpler to follow due to chronological alignment of availability windows. No adjustment is needed, as the original schedule is optimal for meeting all five friends.
[/PLANNING]

**Final Answer**

The optimal schedule to meet all five friends is:

- **9:00 AM**: Start at Embarcadero.
- **9:30 AM–11:00 AM**: Meet Noah at Sunset District (90 minutes).
- **11:11 AM**: Arrive at Haight-Ashbury (travel: 11 minutes).
- **12:00 PM–1:15 PM**: Meet Lucas at Haight-Ashbury (75 minutes).
- **1:31 PM–2:16 PM**: Meet Liam at Marina District (45 minutes, travel: 16 minutes).
- **2:23 PM–4:30 PM**: Meet Emma at Russian Hill (60 minutes, travel: 7 minutes, start at 3:30 PM).
- **4:42 PM–8:00 PM**: Meet Isabella at Alamo Square (60 minutes, travel: 12 minutes, start at 7:00 PM).

This schedule satisfies all constraints, including availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times, and maximizes the number of friends met (all five: Noah, Lucas, Liam, Emma, Isabella). The day ends at 8:00 PM, well within Isabella’s availability window (until 9:30 PM). No infeasibility was found, as the schedule accommodates all requirements.
