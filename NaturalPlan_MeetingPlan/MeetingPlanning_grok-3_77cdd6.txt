**Problem Statement:**
The goal is to arrange a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible (Daniel, Rachel, Thomas, Karen, Linda, and James) on the same day, starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM. Each friend is available at a specific location and time window, with minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations are provided. The objective is to maximize the number of friends met while satisfying all time and duration constraints. If no schedule meets all constraints, a detailed explanation will be provided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. Identify the sequence of meetings and travel times to create a feasible schedule.

- **Subgoal 1**: Meet friends available in the morning (Rachel at Marina District, 8:00 AM–10:00 AM; Thomas at Fisherman’s Wharf, 7:30 AM–10:30 AM).
- **Subgoal 2**: Meet James at Nob Hill (11:00 AM–3:00 PM) in the late morning to early afternoon.
- **Subgoal 3**: Meet Daniel at Bayview (1:00 PM–6:00 PM) in the afternoon.
- **Subgoal 4**: Meet Karen at Presidio (2:30 PM–9:00 PM) in the late afternoon to evening.
- **Subgoal 5**: Meet Linda at Haight-Ashbury (8:30 PM–10:00 PM) in the evening.
- **Constraint Check**: Ensure each meeting meets the minimum duration (Rachel: 30 min, Thomas: 45 min, James: 90 min, Daniel: 45 min, Karen: 60 min, Linda: 30 min) and account for travel times between locations.
- **Approach**: Construct a schedule starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, prioritizing early meetings due to tight morning windows, and evaluate feasibility by calculating total time, including travel and meeting durations.

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the proposed schedule satisfies all constraints, including time windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times.  
**How to Achieve**: Check each meeting’s start and end times against the friends’ availability windows, confirm minimum durations are met, and ensure travel times are correctly applied.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Validation Check**:
- **Rachel**: Meet 9:09 AM–9:39 AM (30 min) within 8:00 AM–10:00 AM. Travel from North Beach (9 min). Valid.
- **Thomas**: Meet 9:48 AM–10:33 AM (45 min) within 7:30 AM–10:30 AM. Travel from Marina District (9 min). Valid.
- **James**: Meet 10:44 AM–12:14 PM (90 min) within 11:00 AM–3:00 PM. Travel from Fisherman’s Wharf (11 min). Valid (starts slightly before 11:00 AM, but within window).
- **Daniel**: Meet 1:19 PM–2:04 PM (45 min) within 1:00 PM–6:00 PM. Travel from Nob Hill (20 min) + wait. Valid.
- **Karen**: Meet 2:35 PM–3:35 PM (60 min) within 2:30 PM–9:00 PM. Travel from Bayview (31 min). Valid.
- **Linda**: Meet 8:30 PM–9:00 PM (30 min) within 8:30 PM–10:00 PM. Travel from Presidio (15 min) + wait. Valid.

**Issues**:
- James’s meeting starts at 10:44 AM, slightly before his availability at 11:00 AM. Adjust the schedule to delay this meeting.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The schedule needs adjustment because James’s meeting starts before his availability. Modify the schedule to ensure James’s meeting starts at or after 11:00 AM while maintaining other meetings within constraints.

- **Adjusted Subgoal**: Delay the meeting with James to start at 11:00 AM or later, which may require reordering morning meetings or adjusting durations.
- **New Approach**: Try meeting Thomas first (available earlier at Fisherman’s Wharf), then Rachel, then James, and proceed with the remaining meetings, ensuring all time windows and durations are met.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create a revised schedule starting with Thomas, then Rachel, followed by James, Daniel, Karen, and Linda, ensuring all meetings start within availability windows and meet minimum durations.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the schedule starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, visiting Fisherman’s Wharf for Thomas, Marina District for Rachel, Nob Hill for James, Bayview for Daniel, Presidio for Karen, and Haight-Ashbury for Linda, incorporating travel times and checking constraints.
[/PLANNING]
