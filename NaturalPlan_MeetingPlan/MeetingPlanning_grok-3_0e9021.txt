**Problem Statement:**
The goal is to arrange a schedule to meet as many friends as possible (Emma, Jacob, Olivia, Lucas, and Sophia) in San Francisco on a single day, starting at the Mission District at 9:00 AM. Each friend is available at a specific location and time window, with minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations are provided. The schedule must optimize the number of friends met while satisfying all constraints. If no feasible schedule exists, a detailed explanation will be provided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time windows and locations for each friend.  
2. Determine possible sequences of meetings based on time and travel constraints.  
3. Check if all friends can be met within the day.  
4. Select the sequence that maximizes the number of friends met while satisfying minimum meeting durations.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system based on the subgoals from Step 1:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (up to 5: Emma, Jacob, Olivia, Lucas, Sophia).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify time windows and locations (from constraints):  
    - Lucas: Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, ≥45 min.  
    - Jacob: Union Square, 11:30 AM–5:45 PM, ≥60 min.  
    - Emma: The Castro, 1:00 PM–7:00 PM, ≥90 min.  
    - Sophia: Embarcadero, 2:15 PM–8:30 PM, ≥120 min.  
    - Olivia: Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥75 min.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine possible meeting sequences.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Check feasibility of meeting all friends.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Optimize the schedule.  
**Current Goal**: Review time windows and locations to plan feasible sequences.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Construct a feasible schedule to meet all friends.  
**How to Achieve**: List all friends’ availability, calculate meeting windows accounting for travel times, and test a sequence that covers all friends, ensuring minimum meeting durations are met.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To meet all five friends, construct a schedule starting at Mission District at 9:00 AM:  
- **Lucas (Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, ≥45 min)**: Travel from Mission District to Alamo Square (12 min). Arrive by 9:12 AM. Meet Lucas from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM (60 min, satisfies ≥45 min).  
- **Jacob (Union Square, 11:30 AM–5:45 PM, ≥60 min)**: Travel from Alamo Square to Union Square (14 min). Depart Alamo Square at 11:00 AM, arrive Union Square by 11:14 AM. Meet Jacob from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM (60 min, satisfies ≥60 min).  
- **Emma (The Castro, 1:00 PM–7:00 PM, ≥90 min)**: Travel from Union Square to The Castro (17 min). Depart Union Square at 12:30 PM, arrive The Castro by 12:47 PM. Meet Emma from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM (90 min, satisfies ≥90 min).  
- **Sophia (Embarcadero, 2:15 PM–8:30 PM, ≥120 min)**: Travel from The Castro to Embarcadero (22 min). Depart The Castro at 2:30 PM, arrive Embarcadero by 2:52 PM. Meet Sophia from 2:52 PM to 4:52 PM (120 min, satisfies ≥120 min).  
- **Olivia (Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥75 min)**: Travel from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights (11 min). Depart Embarcadero at 4:52 PM, arrive Pacific Heights by 5:03 PM. Meet Olivia from 6:00 PM to 7:15 PM (75 min, satisfies ≥75 min).  

**Total Meetings**: 5 friends. All time windows and minimum durations satisfied.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the schedule’s feasibility.  
**How to Achieve**: Check each meeting’s start time, duration, and travel time against constraints to ensure no overlaps or violations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the schedule from Step 3:  
- **Lucas**: Meet 10:00 AM–11:00 AM (60 min ≥ 45 min). Arrive Alamo Square by 9:12 AM, within 10:00 AM–12:30 PM. Valid.  
- **Jacob**: Meet 11:30 AM–12:30 PM (60 min ≥ 60 min). Arrive Union Square by 11:14 AM, within 11:30 AM–5:45 PM. Valid.  
- **Emma**: Meet 1:00 PM–2:30 PM (90 min ≥ 90 min). Arrive The Castro by 12:47 PM, within 1:00 PM–7:00 PM. Valid.  
- **Sophia**: Meet 2:52 PM–4:52 PM (120 min ≥ 120 min). Arrive Embarcadero by 2:52 PM, within 2:15 PM–8:30 PM. Valid.  
- **Olivia**: Meet 6:00 PM–7:15 PM (75 min ≥ 75 min). Arrive Pacific Heights by 5:03 PM, within 6:00 PM–9:00 PM. Valid.  
No overlaps in meetings, and all travel times align with constraints. The schedule is feasible.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (achieved: 5 friends).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify time windows and locations (completed in Step 2).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine possible meeting sequences (completed in Step 3).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Check feasibility of meeting all friends (validated in Step 4).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Optimize the schedule (current schedule meets all 5 friends).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm if the schedule is optimal or if another sequence could improve efficiency (e.g., reduce travel time).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Test an alternative schedule to check if it reduces total travel time while meeting all friends.  
**How to Achieve**: Try a different sequence (e.g., Lucas → Jacob → Sophia → Emma → Olivia) and compare total travel time with the original schedule.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test an alternative sequence:  
- **Lucas (Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, ≥45 min)**: Travel from Mission District to Alamo Square (12 min). Arrive by 9:12 AM. Meet Lucas from 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM (45 min, satisfies ≥45 min).  
- **Jacob (Union Square, 11:30 AM–5:45 PM, ≥60 min)**: Travel from Alamo Square to Union Square (14 min). Depart at 10:45 AM, arrive by 10:59 AM. Meet Jacob from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM (60 min, satisfies ≥60 min).  
- **Sophia (Embarcadero, 2:15 PM–8:30 PM, ≥120 min)**: Travel from Union Square to Embarcadero (11 min). Depart at 12:30 PM, arrive by 12:41 PM. Meet Sophia from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM (120 min, satisfies ≥120 min).  
- **Emma (The Castro, 1:00 PM–7:00 PM, ≥90 min)**: Travel from Embarcadero to The Castro (25 min). Depart at 4:15 PM, arrive by 4:40 PM. Meet Emma from 4:40 PM to 6:10 PM (90 min, satisfies ≥90 min).  
- **Olivia (Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥75 min)**: Travel from The Castro to Pacific Heights (21 min). Depart at 6:10 PM, arrive by 6:31 PM. Meet Olivia from 6:31 PM to 7:46 PM (75 min, satisfies ≥75 min).  

**Total Travel Time**: 12 + 14 + 11 + 25 + 21 = 83 min.  
**Original Schedule Travel Time (Step 3)**: 12 + 14 + 17 + 22 + 11 = 76 min.  
The original schedule (Step 3) has less travel time (76 min vs. 83 min) and is more efficient.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the original schedule is optimal.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that no other sequence meets all friends with less travel time or better efficiency, and ensure no constraints are violated.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The original schedule (Step 3) meets all 5 friends with 76 min total travel time. The alternative (Step 6) has 83 min travel time. Key constraints:  
- All meetings satisfy minimum durations.  
- All meetings occur within time windows.  
- Travel times align with provided data.  
Testing other sequences (e.g., starting with Jacob or Sophia) is unnecessary, as the original sequence minimizes travel while meeting all friends early in their windows, leaving flexibility. No constraints are violated.  
**Final Schedule**:  
- 9:00 AM: Start at Mission District.  
- 9:12 AM: Arrive Alamo Square (12 min travel).  
- 10:00 AM–11:00 AM: Meet Lucas (60 min).  
- 11:14 AM: Arrive Union Square (14 min travel).  
- 11:30 AM–12:30 PM: Meet Jacob (60 min).  
- 12:47 PM: Arrive The Castro (17 min travel).  
- 1:00 PM–2:30 PM: Meet Emma (90 min).  
- 2:52 PM: Arrive Embarcadero (22 min travel).  
- 2:52 PM–4:52 PM: Meet Sophia (120 min).  
- 5:03 PM: Arrive Pacific Heights (11 min travel).  
- 6:00 PM–7:15 PM: Meet Olivia (75 min).  
**Outcome**: All 5 friends met, total travel time 76 min.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all five friends is:  
- **10:00 AM–11:00 AM**: Meet Lucas at Alamo Square (60 min).  
- **11:30 AM–12:30 PM**: Meet Jacob at Union Square (60 min).  
- **1:00 PM–2:30 PM**: Meet Emma at The Castro (90 min).  
- **2:52 PM–4:52 PM**: Meet Sophia at Embarcadero (120 min).  
- **6:00 PM–7:15 PM**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (75 min).  
Total travel time: 76 minutes. All constraints (time windows, minimum durations) are satisfied.
