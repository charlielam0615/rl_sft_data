### Problem Statement
The goal is to arrange a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible (James, Olivia, Emma, Liam, and Sophia) on the same day, maximizing the number of friends met while satisfying the minimum meeting time constraints and travel times between locations. I arrive at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM, and each friend is available at a specific location during a defined time window. The constraints include minimum meeting durations and travel times between locations (provided in minutes). If no schedule meets all constraints, I will explain why.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create a feasible schedule to meet all five friends (Sophia, James, Emma, Olivia, Liam).  
- **How to Achieve:** Construct a timeline starting at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM, scheduling meetings within each friend’s availability window, accounting for travel times and minimum meeting durations. Test a schedule that prioritizes early meetings (Sophia) and sequences others based on time and location proximity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
I start at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. Let’s try a schedule to meet all five friends:  
1. **Meet Sophia at Presidio:**  
   - Travel from Alamo Square to Presidio: 18 minutes. Arrive at 9:18 AM.  
   - Sophia is available 9:30 AM–11:00 AM. Meet from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM (60 minutes, satisfies ≥60 min).  
   - Depart Presidio at 10:30 AM.  
2. **Meet James at Union Square:**  
   - Travel from Presidio to Union Square: 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:52 AM.  
   - James is available 11:00 AM–7:30 PM. Meet from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM (90 minutes, satisfies ≥90 min).  
   - Depart Union Square at 12:30 PM.  
3. **Meet Emma at Russian Hill:**  
   - Travel from Union Square to Russian Hill: 11 minutes. Arrive at 12:41 PM.  
   - Emma is available 1:00 PM–3:30 PM. Meet from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM (60 minutes, satisfies ≥60 min).  
   - Depart Russian Hill at 2:00 PM.  
4. **Meet Olivia at Embarcadero:**  
   - Travel from Russian Hill to Embarcadero: 8 minutes. Arrive at 2:08 PM.  
   - Olivia is available 5:00 PM–8:00 PM. Wait until 5:00 PM. Meet from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM (120 minutes, satisfies ≥120 min).  
   - Depart Embarcadero at 7:00 PM.  
5. **Meet Liam at Pacific Heights:**  
   - Travel from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes. Arrive at 7:11 PM.  
   - Liam is available 6:30 PM–9:00 PM. Meet from 7:11 PM to 8:26 PM (75 minutes, satisfies ≥75 min).  
   - End at Pacific Heights at 8:26 PM.  

This schedule meets all five friends within their availability windows and satisfies minimum meeting times.

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the proposed schedule satisfies all constraints (time windows, minimum meeting durations, travel times).  
- **How to Achieve:** Check each meeting’s start time against the friend’s availability, ensure meeting durations meet or exceed minimums, and confirm travel times align with the provided data.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the schedule:  
1. **Sophia (Presidio):**  
   - Arrival: 9:18 AM. Meet 9:30 AM–10:30 AM (60 min ≥ 60 min). Within 9:30 AM–11:00 AM. Valid.  
2. **James (Union Square):**  
   - Arrival: 10:52 AM. Meet 11:00 AM–12:30 PM (90 min ≥ 90 min). Within 11:00 AM–7:30 PM. Valid.  
3. **Emma (Russian Hill):**  
   - Arrival: 12:41 PM. Meet 1:00 PM–2:00 PM (60 min ≥ 60 min). Within 1:00 PM–3:30 PM. Valid.  
4. **Olivia (Embarcadero):**  
   - Arrival: 2:08 PM. Meet 5:00 PM–7:00 PM (120 min ≥ 120 min). Within 5:00 PM–8:00 PM. Valid.  
5. **Liam (Pacific Heights):**  
   - Arrival: 7:11 PM. Meet 7:11 PM–8:26 PM (75 min ≥ 75 min). Within 6:30 PM–9:00 PM. Valid.  
Travel times match the provided data. The schedule is feasible with waiting time (2:08 PM–5:00 PM) before Olivia’s meeting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The initial schedule meets all five friends but includes significant waiting time (2:08 PM–5:00 PM). Adjust the schedule to minimize waiting time by exploring an alternative sequence, such as meeting Emma later in her window to reduce the gap before Olivia’s availability.  
- Revised Subgoal Order: Meet Sophia, James, Emma (later in her window), Olivia, Liam.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Create an adjusted schedule to meet all five friends with minimized waiting time.  
- **How to Achieve:** Start at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM, meet Sophia first, then James, delay Emma’s meeting to later in her window (closer to 3:30 PM), followed by Olivia and Liam, ensuring all constraints are met.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Adjusted schedule:  
1. **Meet Sophia at Presidio:**  
   - Travel from Alamo Square to Presidio: 18 minutes. Arrive at 9:18 AM.  
   - Meet from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM (60 minutes). Depart at 10:30 AM.  
2. **Meet James at Union Square:**  
   - Travel from Presidio to Union Square: 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:52 AM.  
   - Meet from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM (90 minutes). Depart at 12:30 PM.  
3. **Meet Emma at Russian Hill:**  
   - Travel from Union Square to Russian Hill: 11 minutes. Arrive at 12:41 PM.  
   - Emma available 1:00 PM–3:30 PM. Meet from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM (60 minutes, closer to end of her window). Depart at 3:30 PM.  
4. **Meet Olivia at Embarcadero:**  
   - Travel from Russian Hill to Embarcadero: 8 minutes. Arrive at 3:38 PM.  
   - Olivia available 5:00 PM–8:00 PM. Meet from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM (120 minutes). Depart at 7:00 PM.  
5. **Meet Liam at Pacific Heights:**  
   - Travel from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes. Arrive at 7:11 PM.  
   - Meet from 7:11 PM to 8:26 PM (75 minutes). End at 8:26 PM.  

This schedule reduces waiting time before Olivia’s meeting (3:38 PM–5:00 PM, 82 minutes vs. 172 minutes).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the adjusted schedule satisfies all constraints and minimizes waiting time.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check meeting times, durations, and travel times against constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the adjusted schedule:  
1. **Sophia (Presidio):** 9:30 AM–10:30 AM (60 min ≥ 60 min). Within 9:30 AM–11:00 AM. Valid.  
2. **James (Union Square):** 11:00 AM–12:30 PM (90 min ≥ 90 min). Within 11:00 AM–7:30 PM. Valid.  
3. **Emma (Russian Hill):** 2:30 PM–3:30 PM (60 min ≥ 60 min). Within 1:00 PM–3:30 PM. Valid.  
4. **Olivia (Embarcadero):** 5:00 PM–7:00 PM (120 min ≥ 120 min). Within 5:00 PM–8:00 PM. Valid.  
5. **Liam (Pacific Heights):** 7:11 PM–8:26 PM (75 min ≥ 75 min). Within 6:30 PM–9:00 PM. Valid.  
Travel times are correct. Waiting time is 82 minutes (3:38 PM–5:00 PM). The schedule is feasible and improved.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible.  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Sophia at Presidio (9:30 AM–10:30 AM, 60 min).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet James at Union Square (11:00 AM–12:30 PM, 90 min).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Emma at Russian Hill (2:30 PM–3:30 PM, 60 min).  
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Olivia at Embarcadero (5:00 PM–7:00 PM, 120 min).  
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Liam at Pacific Heights (7:11 PM–8:26 PM, 75 min).  
**Current Goal:** Confirm this is the optimal schedule by considering alternative sequences.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Test an alternative schedule to confirm optimality (e.g., meet Emma before James).  
- **How to Achieve:** Try a schedule starting with Sophia, then Emma, James, Olivia, Liam, and check if it reduces waiting time further or remains feasible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alternative schedule:  
1. **Sophia (Presidio):**  
   - Travel from Alamo Square to Presidio: 18 min. Arrive 9:18 AM. Meet 9:30 AM–10:30 AM (60 min). Depart 10:30 AM.  
2. **Emma (Russian Hill):**  
   - Travel from Presidio to Russian Hill: 14 min. Arrive 10:44 AM.  
   - Emma available 1:00 PM–3:30 PM. Cannot meet (too early).  

This schedule fails because Emma is unavailable at 10:44 AM. Other sequences (e.g., Sophia, Emma, James) face similar issues due to Emma’s late start (1:00 PM). The previous schedule (Sophia, James, Emma, Olivia, Liam) is likely optimal, as further reordering increases waiting time or violates constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all five friends, minimizing waiting time, is:  
- **9:30 AM–10:30 AM:** Meet Sophia at Presidio (60 min).  
- **11:00 AM–12:30 PM:** Meet James at Union Square (90 min).  
- **2:30 PM–3:30 PM:** Meet Emma at Russian Hill (60 min).  
- **5:00 PM–7:00 PM:** Meet Olivia at Embarcadero (120 min).  
- **7:11 PM–8:26 PM:** Meet Liam at Pacific Heights (75 min).  
**Waiting time:** 82 minutes (3:38 PM–5:00 PM).  
All constraints (availability, minimum durations, travel times) are satisfied, and alternative schedules either fail or increase waiting time.
