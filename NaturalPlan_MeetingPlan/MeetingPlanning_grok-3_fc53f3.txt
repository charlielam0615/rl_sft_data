**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of meeting all five friends into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. Each subgoal involves traveling to a friend’s location, meeting them for the required duration, and ensuring the schedule aligns with their availability windows while accounting for travel times.  
- Subgoal 1: Meet Brian in Noe Valley between 9:30 AM and 11:00 AM for at least 60 minutes.  
- Subgoal 2: Meet Kevin in Chinatown between 1:00 PM and 7:30 PM for at least 90 minutes.  
- Subgoal 3: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM for at least 45 minutes.  
- Subgoal 4: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM for at least 60 minutes.  
- Subgoal 5: Meet Emma in Presidio between 7:00 PM and 9:30 PM for at least 75 minutes.  
The schedule must sequence these subgoals to minimize waiting times and ensure feasibility within the day.

**Step 2: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet all five friends (Brian, Kevin, Nicole, Rachel, Emma) in San Francisco on May 28, 2025.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Brian in Noe Valley (9:30 AM–11:00 AM, ≥60 minutes).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Kevin in Chinatown (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥90 minutes).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf (2:00 PM–4:00 PM, ≥45 minutes).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–8:00 PM, ≥60 minutes).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Meet Emma in Presidio (7:00 PM–9:30 PM, ≥75 minutes).  
**Current Goal**: Meet Brian in Noe Valley, as it is the earliest constrained time window (9:30 AM–11:00 AM).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Brian in Noe Valley between 9:30 AM and 11:00 AM for at least 60 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: Start at Mission District at 9:00 AM, travel to Noe Valley (9 minutes), arrive by 9:09 AM, wait until 9:30 AM, and meet Brian for 60 minutes from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at Mission District at 9:00 AM, travel to Noe Valley takes 9 minutes, so arrival is at 9:09 AM. Wait until Brian is available at 9:30 AM (21 minutes waiting). Meet Brian from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, satisfying the 60-minute minimum requirement. The meeting ends at 10:30 AM, and Brian’s availability window closes at 11:00 AM, so this subgoal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the current path (meeting Brian in Noe Valley) is valid and supports subsequent subgoals.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the meeting with Brian from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM in Noe Valley aligns with his availability and allows sufficient time to travel to the next friend’s location (likely Kevin in Chinatown, given the next earliest availability at 1:00 PM).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The meeting with Brian from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM is within his availability (9:30 AM–11:00 AM) and meets the 60-minute minimum. After the meeting, at 10:30 AM, travel to Chinatown (for Kevin, available 1:00 PM–7:30 PM) takes 20 minutes, leading to an arrival at 10:50 AM. This requires waiting until 1:00 PM (70 minutes), but it is feasible. The schedule so far is valid, as it satisfies Brian’s constraints and allows progression to the next subgoal.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Kevin in Chinatown between 1:00 PM and 7:30 PM for at least 90 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: From Noe Valley at 10:30 AM, travel to Chinatown (20 minutes), arrive by 10:50 AM, wait until 1:00 PM, and meet Kevin for 90 minutes from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Noe Valley at 10:30 AM, travel to Chinatown takes 20 minutes, so arrival is at 10:50 AM. Wait until Kevin is available at 1:00 PM (70 minutes waiting). Meet Kevin from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, satisfying the 90-minute minimum. The meeting ends at 2:30 PM, within Kevin’s availability window (1:00 PM–7:30 PM). This subgoal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM for at least 45 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: From Chinatown at 2:30 PM, travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (8 minutes), arrive by 2:38 PM, and meet Nicole for 45 minutes from 2:38 PM to 3:23 PM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Chinatown at 2:30 PM, travel to Fisherman’s Wharf takes 8 minutes, so arrival is at 2:38 PM. Nicole is available from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, so meet her from 2:38 PM to 3:23 PM (45 minutes), satisfying the minimum requirement. The meeting ends at 3:23 PM, within Nicole’s availability window. This subgoal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the current path (meetings with Brian, Kevin, and Nicole) is valid and supports meeting Rachel in Pacific Heights.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the schedule allows travel from Fisherman’s Wharf to Pacific Heights to meet Rachel between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM for at least 60 minutes, considering travel times and her availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After meeting Nicole, the schedule is at 3:23 PM in Fisherman’s Wharf. Travel to Pacific Heights takes 11 minutes, so arrival is at 3:34 PM. Rachel is available from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, requiring a wait of 86 minutes (3:34 PM to 5:00 PM). Meeting Rachel from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM satisfies the 60-minute minimum. This path is valid, as all meetings so far (Brian, Kevin, Nicole) are within their availability windows, and the schedule allows reaching Rachel on time.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM for at least 60 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: From Fisherman’s Wharf at 3:23 PM, travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes), arrive by 3:34 PM, wait until 5:00 PM, and meet Rachel for 60 minutes from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Fisherman’s Wharf at 3:23 PM, travel to Pacific Heights takes 11 minutes, so arrival is at 3:34 PM. Wait until Rachel is available at 5:00 PM (86 minutes waiting). Meet Rachel from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, satisfying the 60-minute minimum. The meeting ends at 6:00 PM, within Rachel’s availability window. This subgoal is achieved.  
[/IMP]

**Step 9: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Emma in Presidio between 7:00 PM and 9:30 PM for at least 75 minutes.  
**How to Achieve**: From Pacific Heights at 6:00 PM, travel to Presidio (10 minutes), arrive by 6:10 PM, wait until 7:00 PM, and meet Emma for 75 minutes from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Pacific Heights at 6:00 PM, travel to Presidio takes 10 minutes, so arrival is at 6:10 PM. Wait until Emma is available at 7:00 PM (50 minutes waiting). Meet Emma from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM, satisfying the 75-minute minimum. The meeting ends at 8:15 PM, within Emma’s availability window (7:00 PM–9:30 PM). This subgoal is achieved.

**Step 10: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Meet all five friends (Brian, Kevin, Nicole, Rachel, Emma) in San Francisco.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Brian in Noe Valley (9:30 AM–11:00 AM, ≥60 minutes) – Completed (9:30 AM–10:30 AM).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Kevin in Chinatown (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥90 minutes) – Completed (1:00 PM–2:30 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf (2:00 PM–4:00 PM, ≥45 minutes) – Completed (2:38 PM–3:23 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–8:00 PM, ≥60 minutes) – Completed (5:00 PM–6:00 PM).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Meet Emma in Presidio (7:00 PM–9:30 PM, ≥75 minutes) – Completed (7:00 PM–8:15 PM).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; evaluate the schedule for optimality.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 11: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Evaluate alternative schedules to optimize the goal of meeting all five friends while minimizing total waiting time. The current schedule has significant waiting periods (e.g., 70 minutes in Chinatown, 86 minutes in Pacific Heights, 50 minutes in Presidio). Test an alternative sequence, such as meeting Brian, then Nicole, Kevin, Rachel, and Emma, to check if waiting time can be reduced.  
- **Alternative Subgoals**:  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Brian in Noe Valley (9:30 AM–11:00 AM, ≥60 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf (2:00 PM–4:00 PM, ≥45 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Kevin in Chinatown (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥90 minutes, but adjust timing).  
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–8:00 PM, ≥60 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Emma in Presidio (7:00 PM–9:30 PM, ≥75 minutes).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 12: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the alternative schedule (Brian → Nicole → Kevin → Rachel → Emma) for feasibility.  
**How to Achieve**: Simulate the alternative schedule, starting with Brian in Noe Valley, then traveling to Fisherman’s Wharf for Nicole, Chinatown for Kevin, Pacific Heights for Rachel, and Presidio for Emma, checking all time constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Brian**: Start at Mission District at 9:00 AM, travel to Noe Valley (9 minutes), arrive 9:09 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM (21 minutes). Meet Brian 9:30 AM–10:30 AM (60 minutes).  
- **Nicole**: From Noe Valley at 10:30 AM, travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (24 minutes), arrive 10:54 AM. Wait until Nicole is available at 2:00 PM (186 minutes). Meet Nicole 2:00 PM–2:45 PM (45 minutes).  
- **Kevin**: From Fisherman’s Wharf at 2:45 PM, travel to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrive 2:52 PM. Meet Kevin 2:52 PM–4:22 PM (90 minutes, within 1:00 PM–7:30 PM).  
- **Rachel**: From Chinatown at 4:22 PM, travel to Pacific Heights (12 minutes), arrive 4:34 PM. Wait until 5:00 PM (26 minutes). Meet Rachel 5:00 PM–6:00 PM (60 minutes, within 5:00 PM–8:00 PM).  
- **Emma**: From Pacific Heights at 6:00 PM, travel to Presidio (10 minutes), arrive 6:10 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM (50 minutes). Meet Emma 7:00 PM–8:15 PM (75 minutes, within 7:00 PM–9:30 PM).  
This schedule is feasible but has a large waiting time (186 minutes) at Fisherman’s Wharf, compared to the original’s total waiting time (21 + 70 + 86 + 50 = 227 minutes). The alternative has 21 + 186 + 26 + 50 = 283 minutes of waiting, making it less efficient.  
[/IMP]

**Step 13: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate the optimality of the original schedule versus alternatives.  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information on total waiting times and feasibility of schedules tested so far to determine the best option.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- **Original Schedule** (Brian → Kevin → Nicole → Rachel → Emma): Total waiting time is 227 minutes (21 minutes in Noe Valley, 70 minutes in Chinatown, 86 minutes in Pacific Heights, 50 minutes in Presidio). All meetings satisfy minimum durations and availability constraints.  
- **Alternative Schedule** (Brian → Nicole → Kevin → Rachel → Emma): Total waiting time is 283 minutes (21 minutes in Noe Valley, 186 minutes in Fisherman’s Wharf, 26 minutes in Pacific Heights, 50 minutes in Presidio). Feasible but less efficient due to increased waiting.  
The original schedule is more efficient based on lower total waiting time.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**

The optimal schedule to meet all five friends (Brian, Kevin, Nicole, Rachel, Emma) in San Francisco, minimizing waiting time while satisfying all constraints, is as follows:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Mission District.  
- **9:09 AM**: Arrive at Noe Valley (9 minutes travel). Wait 21 minutes.  
- **9:30 AM–10:30 AM**: Meet Brian in Noe Valley (60 minutes).  
- **10:50 AM**: Arrive at Chinatown (20 minutes travel from Noe Valley). Wait 70 minutes.  
- **1:00 PM–2:30 PM**: Meet Kevin in Chinatown (90 minutes).  
- **2:38 PM**: Arrive at Fisherman’s Wharf (8 minutes travel from Chinatown).  
- **2:38 PM–3:23 PM**: Meet Nicole in Fisherman’s Wharf (45 minutes).  
- **3:34 PM**: Arrive at Pacific Heights (11 minutes travel from Fisherman’s Wharf). Wait 86 minutes.  
- **5:00 PM–6:00 PM**: Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (60 minutes).  
- **6:10 PM**: Arrive at Presidio (10 minutes travel from Pacific Heights). Wait 50 minutes.  
- **7:00 PM–8:15 PM**: Meet Emma in Presidio (75 minutes).  

This schedule meets all five friends within their availability windows and required meeting durations, with a total waiting time of 227 minutes. An alternative schedule (Brian → Nicole → Kevin → Rachel → Emma) was evaluated but resulted in a higher waiting time (283 minutes), confirming the original schedule as optimal.
