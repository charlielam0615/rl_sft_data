### Problem Statement
I need to plan a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. The friends are Ethan (available at Marina District from 10:15 AM to 5:00 PM, minimum 60 minutes), Olivia (available at Russian Hill from 3:30 PM to 8:00 PM, minimum 45 minutes), and Lucas (available at Sunset District from 9:30 AM to 2:45 PM, minimum 90 minutes). Travel times between locations are provided, and I must optimize the schedule to meet all three friends while adhering to their availability and the minimum meeting durations.

I will solve this using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting all three friends into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Travel from Nob Hill to meet Lucas at Sunset District, ensuring a 90-minute meeting within his availability (9:30 AM–2:45 PM).  
2. Travel to Marina District to meet Ethan for at least 60 minutes within his availability (10:15 AM–5:00 PM).  
3. Travel to Russian Hill to meet Olivia for at least 45 minutes within her availability (3:30 PM–8:00 PM).  
4. Optimize the schedule to minimize waiting time and ensure all meetings fit within the day.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to meet Lucas at Sunset District for 90 minutes within his availability (9:30 AM–2:45 PM). I will calculate the travel time from Nob Hill to Sunset District and determine the earliest possible meeting time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, travel to Sunset District takes 22 minutes, so I arrive at 9:22 AM. Lucas is available starting at 9:30 AM, so I wait 8 minutes and begin the meeting at 9:30 AM. The meeting lasts 90 minutes, ending at 11:00 AM (9:30 AM + 90 minutes). This satisfies Lucas’s meeting requirement within his availability window.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to meet Ethan at Marina District for 60 minutes within his availability (10:15 AM–5:00 PM). I will travel from Sunset District to Marina District after meeting Lucas and schedule the meeting with Ethan.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After meeting Lucas at Sunset District until 11:00 AM, travel to Marina District takes 22 minutes, so I arrive at 11:22 AM. Ethan is available from 10:15 AM, so I can start the meeting immediately upon arrival at 11:22 AM. The meeting lasts 60 minutes, ending at 12:22 PM (11:22 AM + 60 minutes). This satisfies Ethan’s meeting requirement within his availability window.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to meet Olivia at Russian Hill for 45 minutes within her availability (3:30 PM–8:00 PM). I will travel from Marina District to Russian Hill after meeting Ethan and schedule the meeting with Olivia.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After meeting Ethan at Marina District until 12:22 PM, travel to Russian Hill takes 7 minutes, so I arrive at 12:29 PM. Olivia is available from 3:30 PM, so I must wait until 3:30 PM (a wait of 3 hours and 1 minute, from 12:29 PM to 3:30 PM). I begin the meeting at 3:30 PM, which lasts 45 minutes, ending at 4:15 PM (3:30 PM + 45 minutes). This satisfies Olivia’s meeting requirement within her availability window.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (Ethan, Olivia, Lucas).  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Lucas at Sunset District for 90 minutes (9:30 AM–2:45 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Ethan at Marina District for 60 minutes (10:15 AM–5:00 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 11:22 AM to 12:22 PM).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Olivia at Russian Hill for 45 minutes (3:30 PM–8:00 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM).  
  - Subgoal 4: Optimize the schedule to minimize waiting time.  
    - Status: Current schedule has a wait of 8 minutes at Sunset District and 3 hours 1 minute at Russian Hill.  

**Current Goal**: Optimize the schedule to minimize waiting time and confirm all constraints are met.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Work backward from the goal of meeting Olivia at Russian Hill to determine if the schedule can be adjusted to reduce waiting time. Since Olivia’s availability starts at 3:30 PM, explore alternative meeting orders to minimize the wait before her meeting while ensuring Lucas and Ethan are met within their windows.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate if an alternative schedule (e.g., meeting Ethan before Lucas) reduces waiting time while meeting all constraints. I will test an alternative by traveling to Marina District first to meet Ethan, then to Sunset District for Lucas, and finally to Russian Hill for Olivia.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Alternative Schedule**:  
- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. Travel to Marina District (11 minutes), arriving at 9:11 AM. Ethan is available from 10:15 AM, so wait 64 minutes (9:11 AM to 10:15 AM). Meet Ethan from 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM (60 minutes).  
- Travel to Sunset District (23 minutes), arriving at 11:38 AM. Lucas is available from 9:30 AM to 2:45 PM. Meet Lucas from 11:38 AM to 1:08 PM (90 minutes), which is within his window (ends before 2:45 PM).  
- Travel to Russian Hill (25 minutes), arriving at 1:33 PM. Olivia is available from 3:30 PM, so wait 117 minutes (1:33 PM to 3:30 PM). Meet Olivia from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes).  
- **Total wait time**: 64 minutes + 117 minutes = 181 minutes (3 hours 1 minute).  

**Comparison**: The original schedule (Lucas → Ethan → Olivia) has a total wait time of 8 minutes + 181 minutes = 189 minutes. The alternative has the same total wait time (181 minutes), as the long wait for Olivia is unavoidable due to her 3:30 PM start. Other permutations (e.g., starting with Olivia) are infeasible since Olivia’s availability starts too late to meet Lucas before 2:45 PM. Thus, the original schedule is valid and optimal given the constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (Ethan, Olivia, Lucas).  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Lucas at Sunset District for 90 minutes (9:30 AM–2:45 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM in original schedule).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Ethan at Marina District for 60 minutes (10:15 AM–5:00 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 11:22 AM to 12:22 PM in original schedule).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Olivia at Russian Hill for 45 minutes (3:30 PM–8:00 PM).  
    - Status: Completed (met from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM in original schedule).  
  - Subgoal 4: Optimize the schedule to minimize waiting time.  
    - Status: Validated. Original schedule (total wait: 189 minutes) is optimal, as alternatives yield similar or worse wait times due to Olivia’s late availability.  

**Current Goal**: Finalize the schedule.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all three friends (Ethan, Olivia, Lucas) in San Francisco, starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, is:  
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Nob Hill.  
- **9:00 AM–9:22 AM**: Travel to Sunset District (22 minutes).  
- **9:22 AM–9:30 AM**: Wait 8 minutes.  
- **9:30 AM–11:00 AM**: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (90 minutes).  
- **11:00 AM–11:22 AM**: Travel to Marina District (22 minutes).  
- **11:22 AM–12:22 PM**: Meet Ethan at Marina District (60 minutes).  
- **12:22 PM–12:29 PM**: Travel to Russian Hill (7 minutes).  
- **12:29 PM–3:30 PM**: Wait 181 minutes.  
- **3:30 PM–4:15 PM**: Meet Olivia at Russian Hill (45 minutes).  

This schedule meets all constraints: Lucas for 90 minutes within 9:30 AM–2:45 PM, Ethan for 60 minutes within 10:15 AM–5:00 PM, and Olivia for 45 minutes within 3:30 PM–8:00 PM. The total wait time (189 minutes) is minimized, as validated by exploring alternatives, which are constrained by Olivia’s late availability.
