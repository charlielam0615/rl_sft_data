**Problem Restatement:**
The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco on a single day, starting at the Mission District at 9:00 AM, while satisfying the given constraints. The constraints include specific time windows and minimum meeting durations for each friend: Sophia (Golden Gate Park, 9:30 AM–11:30 AM, 60 minutes), Ethan (Chinatown, 11:30 AM–7:45 PM, 60 minutes), Lucas (North Beach, 1:00 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes), Noah (Russian Hill, 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, 75 minutes), and Olivia (Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 90 minutes). Travel times between locations are provided. The solution must optimize the schedule to meet all friends within their availability windows, accounting for travel and waiting times.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting all five friends into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. Create a sequence of meetings that respects time windows, travel times, and minimum meeting durations, aiming to visit each friend at their specified location during their available time.

- **Subgoal 1**: Meet Sophia at Golden Gate Park (available 9:30 AM–11:30 AM, 60 minutes).
- **Subgoal 2**: Meet Ethan at Chinatown (available 11:30 AM–7:45 PM, 60 minutes).
- **Subgoal 3**: Meet Lucas at North Beach (available 1:00 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes).
- **Subgoal 4**: Meet Noah at Russian Hill (available 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, 75 minutes).
- **Subgoal 5**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (available 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 90 minutes).

The subgoals are ordered roughly by earliest availability to ensure feasibility, with adjustments for travel times and potential waiting periods.

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Status**:
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (Sophia, Ethan, Lucas, Noah, Olivia).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Sophia at Golden Gate Park for 60 minutes (9:30 AM–11:30 AM). **Completed** (Step 2: 9:30 AM–10:30 AM).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Ethan at Chinatown for 60 minutes (11:30 AM–7:45 PM). **Completed** (Step 3: 11:30 AM–12:30 PM).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Lucas at North Beach for 45 minutes (1:00 PM–4:00 PM). **Completed** (Step 4: 1:00 PM–1:45 PM).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Meet Noah at Russian Hill for 75 minutes (2:00 PM–5:00 PM). **Completed** (Step 5: 2:00 PM–3:15 PM).
  - **Subgoal 5**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights for 90 minutes (6:00 PM–9:00 PM). **Completed** (Step 6: 6:00 PM–7:30 PM).

**Current Goal**: All subgoals have been achieved, satisfying the main goal of meeting all five friends within their availability windows and minimum meeting durations.

The schedule meets all constraints, with no overlapping meetings and all travel and waiting times accounted for. This appears to be an optimal schedule as it maximizes the number of friends met (all five) without violating any constraints.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the proposed schedule meets all constraints, including time windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the schedule step-by-step, checking that each meeting occurs within the friend’s availability window, meets the minimum duration, and accounts for travel and waiting times correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Sophia**: Available 9:30 AM–11:30 AM, requires 60 minutes. Scheduled 9:30 AM–10:30 AM (60 minutes). Arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:17 AM (17 minutes from Mission District). Valid.
- **Ethan**: Available 11:30 AM–7:45 PM, requires 60 minutes. Scheduled 11:30 AM–12:30 PM (60 minutes). Arrive at Chinatown at 10:51 AM (21 minutes from Golden Gate Park). Valid.
- **Lucas**: Available 1:00 PM–4:00 PM, requires 45 minutes. Scheduled 1:00 PM–1:45 PM (45 minutes). Arrive at North Beach at 12:36 PM (6 minutes from Chinatown). Valid.
- **Noah**: Available 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, requires 75 minutes. Scheduled 2:00 PM–3:15 PM (75 minutes). Arrive at Russian Hill at 1:51 PM (6 minutes from North Beach). Valid.
- **Olivia**: Available 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, requires 90 minutes. Scheduled 6:00 PM–7:30 PM (90 minutes). Arrive at Pacific Heights at 3:22 PM (7 minutes from Russian Hill). Valid.
- **Additional Check**: No overlapping meetings, and all travel times are based on provided data. Waiting times (e.g., 3:22 PM to 6:00 PM for Olivia) are feasible as no other friends are available during that period.

The schedule is valid and satisfies all constraints.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all five friends is as follows:
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Mission District.
- **9:17 AM**: Arrive at Golden Gate Park (17-minute travel).
- **9:30 AM–10:30 AM**: Meet Sophia (60 minutes).
- **10:51 AM**: Arrive at Chinatown (21-minute travel).
- **11:30 AM–12:30 PM**: Meet Ethan (60 minutes).
- **12:36 PM**: Arrive at North Beach (6-minute travel).
- **1:00 PM–1:45 PM**: Meet Lucas (45 minutes).
- **1:51 PM**: Arrive at Russian Hill (6-minute travel).
- **2:00 PM–3:15 PM**: Meet Noah (75 minutes).
- **3:22 PM**: Arrive at Pacific Heights (7-minute travel).
- **6:00 PM–7:30 PM**: Meet Olivia (90 minutes).

This schedule meets all constraints, maximizes the number of friends met (all five), and accounts for travel and waiting times. No alternative schedule was found to meet additional friends or reduce waiting time significantly without violating constraints.
