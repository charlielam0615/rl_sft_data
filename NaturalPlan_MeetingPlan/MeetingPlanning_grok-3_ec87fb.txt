### Problem Statement
I need to plan a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, given their availability at specific locations and times, and the travel times between locations. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and time constraints. I arrive at the Marina District at 9:00 AM. The friends and their constraints are:

- **Ethan**: At Richmond District from 9:15 AM to 11:30 AM, minimum 90 minutes.
- **Sophia**: At Union Square from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM, minimum 75 minutes.
- **Isabella**: At Embarcadero from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM, minimum 60 minutes.
- **Ava**: At North Beach from 5:30 PM to 7:45 PM, minimum 45 minutes.
- **Lucas**: At Haight-Ashbury from 6:00 PM to 9:15 PM, minimum 120 minutes.

Travel times between locations are provided (e.g., Marina District to Richmond District: 11 minutes). I need to create a schedule that meets these constraints, or explain why no such schedule exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations:

1. **Meet Ethan**: Available 9:15 AM–11:30 AM at Richmond District (90 minutes required). Since I start at Marina District at 9:00 AM, this is the earliest meeting possible.
2. **Meet Isabella**: Available 2:00 PM–4:30 PM at Embarcadero (60 minutes required). This is the next earliest constrained window.
3. **Meet Sophia**: Available 1:00 PM–8:00 PM at Union Square (75 minutes required). Her wide availability allows flexibility.
4. **Meet Ava**: Available 5:30 PM–7:45 PM at North Beach (45 minutes required). This is a tight window in the evening.
5. **Meet Lucas**: Available 6:00 PM–9:15 PM at Haight-Ashbury (120 minutes required). This overlaps with Ava’s window, requiring careful scheduling.

Subgoal sequence: Start with Ethan (morning), then Isabella and Sophia (afternoon), and finally Ava and Lucas (evening). I will explore schedules to fit all five friends, prioritizing non-overlapping time windows and accounting for travel times.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system based on the subgoals from Step 1:

- **Goal Hierarchy**:
  - Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (Ethan, Sophia, Isabella, Ava, Lucas).
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Ethan at Richmond District (9:15 AM–11:30 AM, 90 minutes).
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Isabella at Embarcadero (2:00 PM–4:30 PM, 60 minutes).
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Sophia at Union Square (1:00 PM–8:00 PM, 75 minutes).
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Ava at North Beach (5:30 PM–7:45 PM, 45 minutes).
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Lucas at Haight-Ashbury (6:00 PM–9:15 PM, 120 minutes).

- **Current Goal**: Meet Ethan at Richmond District, as it’s the earliest constrained time window.

The hierarchy reflects the chronological order of availability, with Sophia’s flexible window allowing adjustments. I will proceed to construct a schedule starting with Ethan.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Goal**: Meet Ethan at Richmond District for at least 90 minutes between 9:15 AM and 11:30 AM.
**How to Achieve**: Travel from Marina District to Richmond District (11 minutes) to arrive by 9:15 AM and spend at least 90 minutes with Ethan.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Start**: At Marina District at 9:00 AM.
- **Travel**: Marina District to Richmond District takes 11 minutes. Depart at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:11 AM.
- **Meeting**: Meet Ethan from 9:15 AM (when he’s available) to 10:45 AM (90 minutes). This ends within his availability (11:30 AM).
- **Outcome**: Ethan met for 90 minutes. At 10:45 AM, I am in Richmond District.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

With Ethan met, plan the next meetings. Remaining friends:

- **Isabella**: Embarcadero, 2:00 PM–4:30 PM, 60 minutes.
- **Ava**: North Beach, 5:30 PM–7:45 PM, 45 minutes.
- **Lucas**: Haight-Ashbury, 6:00 PM–9:15 PM, 120 minutes.

**Subgoals**:
1. **Next Meeting**: Isabella’s window (2:00 PM–4:30 PM) is the next constrained time slot. Travel from Richmond District to Embarcadero (20 minutes) and meet her for 60 minutes.
2. **Sophia’s Flexibility**: Sophia’s wide window (1:00 PM–8:00 PM) allows scheduling before or after Isabella.
3. **Evening Meetings**: Ava and Lucas have overlapping windows (5:30 PM–7:45 PM and 6:00 PM–9:15 PM). Plan to meet Ava for 45 minutes and Lucas for 120 minutes, accounting for travel.

Tentative sequence: After Ethan, meet Isabella, then Sophia, then Ava, and finally Lucas, adjusting for travel times.
