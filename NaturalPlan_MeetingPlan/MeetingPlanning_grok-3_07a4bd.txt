**Problem Statement:**  
I am visiting San Francisco for one day, arriving at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. My goal is to meet as many friends as possible, given their availability at specific locations and time windows, while adhering to minimum meeting durations and accounting for travel times between locations. The friends, their locations, availability, and required meeting times are:  
- Emma: Bayview, 8:30 AM–10:15 AM, 60 minutes  
- James: Mission District, 8:45 AM–2:00 PM, 90 minutes  
- Daniel: Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, 60 minutes  
- Sophia: Nob Hill, 1:00 PM–5:30 PM, 90 minutes  
- Thomas: Sunset District, 2:45 PM–6:15 PM, 75 minutes  
- Olivia: The Castro, 3:30 PM–8:30 PM, 60 minutes  
- Rachel: Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 45 minutes  
- Michael: Russian Hill, 7:30 PM–10:00 PM, 45 minutes  
Travel times between locations are provided (e.g., Embarcadero to Mission District: 20 minutes). I need to create an optimal schedule to maximize the number of friends met, considering travel times and the constraints of each friend’s availability and minimum meeting duration.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals. The main goal is to create a schedule that maximizes the number of friends met within the day, starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Subgoals include:  
1. Identify feasible meeting windows for each friend based on their availability and minimum meeting durations.  
2. Account for travel times between locations to ensure meetings fit within time constraints.  
3. Sequence the meetings to maximize the number of friends met, prioritizing overlapping or tight schedules.  
4. Check for conflicts or infeasible schedules and adjust as needed.  
5. Select the schedule that meets the most friends while satisfying all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify feasible meeting windows for each friend, considering their availability, minimum meeting durations, and travel times from Embarcadero (starting point) or between locations. This will be achieved by calculating the earliest and latest possible meeting times for each friend, factoring in travel to their location.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For each friend, calculate the feasible meeting window by subtracting travel time to their location and ensuring the minimum meeting duration fits within their availability:  
- **Emma (Bayview, 8:30 AM–10:15 AM, 60 min):** Travel from Embarcadero to Bayview: 21 min. Arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, so earliest arrival at Bayview is 9:21 AM. Latest meeting start is 10:15 AM – 60 min = 9:15 AM. Since 9:21 AM > 9:15 AM, it’s impossible to meet Emma for 60 minutes.  
- **James (Mission District, 8:45 AM–2:00 PM, 90 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 20 min. Earliest arrival: 9:20 AM. Latest start: 2:00 PM – 90 min = 12:30 PM. Feasible window: 9:20 AM–12:30 PM.  
- **Daniel (Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, 60 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 19 min. Earliest arrival: 9:19 AM. Latest start: 12:30 PM – 60 min = 11:30 AM. Feasible window: 10:00 AM (availability start) – 11:30 AM.  
- **Sophia (Nob Hill, 1:00 PM–5:30 PM, 90 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 10 min. Earliest arrival: 9:10 AM, but availability starts at 1:00 PM. Latest start: 5:30 PM – 90 min = 4:00 PM. Feasible window: 1:00 PM–4:00 PM.  
- **Thomas (Sunset District, 2:45 PM–6:15 PM, 75 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 30 min. Earliest arrival: 9:30 AM, but availability starts at 2:45 PM. Latest start: 6:15 PM – 75 min = 5:00 PM. Feasible window: 2:45 PM–5:00 PM.  
- **Olivia (The Castro, 3:30 PM–8:30 PM, 60 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 25 min. Earliest arrival: 9:25 AM, but availability starts at 3:30 PM. Latest start: 8:30 PM – 60 min = 7:30 PM. Feasible window: 3:30 PM–7:30 PM.  
- **Rachel (Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 45 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 11 min. Earliest arrival: 9:11 AM, but availability starts at 6:00 PM. Latest start: 9:00 PM – 45 min = 8:15 PM. Feasible window: 6:00 PM–8:15 PM.  
- **Michael (Russian Hill, 7:30 PM–10:00 PM, 45 min):** Travel from Embarcadero: 8 min. Earliest arrival: 9:08 AM, but availability starts at 7:30 PM. Latest start: 10:00 PM – 45 min = 9:15 PM. Feasible window: 7:30 PM–9:15 PM.  
**Conclusion:** Emma cannot be met due to the time conflict (arriving too late). The remaining seven friends (James, Daniel, Sophia, Thomas, Olivia, Rachel, Michael) have feasible meeting windows.

**Step 3: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate whether a schedule can be created to meet all seven feasible friends (James, Daniel, Sophia, Thomas, Olivia, Rachel, Michael) by checking if their meeting windows and travel times allow a conflict-free sequence. This will be achieved by testing possible meeting orders and ensuring each meeting fits within availability and minimum duration constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Attempt to create a schedule for the seven friends, starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Test a sequence based on chronological availability and proximity to minimize travel time:  
1. **James (Mission District, 9:20 AM–12:30 PM, 90 min):** Start at 9:20 AM (after 20 min travel from Embarcadero). Meet from 9:20 AM–10:50 AM (90 min).  
2. **Daniel (Alamo Square, 10:00 AM–11:30 AM, 60 min):** Travel from Mission District to Alamo Square: 12 min. Arrive at 10:50 AM + 12 min = 11:02 AM. Meet from 11:02 AM–12:02 PM (60 min). Ends within 12:30 PM.  
3. **Sophia (Nob Hill, 1:00 PM–4:00 PM, 90 min):** Travel from Alamo Square to Nob Hill: 15 min. Arrive at 12:02 PM + 15 min = 12:17 PM. Wait until 1:00 PM. Meet from 1:00 PM–2:30 PM (90 min).  
4. **Thomas (Sunset District, 2:45 PM–5:00 PM, 75 min):** Travel from Nob Hill to Sunset District: 23 min. Arrive at 2:30 PM + 23 min = 2:53 PM. Meet from 2:53 PM–4:08 PM (75 min).  
5. **Olivia (The Castro, 3:30 PM–7:30 PM, 60 min):** Travel from Sunset District to The Castro: 11 min. Arrive at 4:08 PM + 11 min = 4:19 PM. Meet from 4:19 PM–5:19 PM (60 min).  
6. **Rachel (Pacific Heights, 6:00 PM–8:15 PM, 45 min):** Travel from The Castro to Pacific Heights: 17 min. Arrive at 5:19 PM + 17 min = 5:36 PM. Wait until 6:00 PM. Meet from 6:00 PM–6:45 PM (45 min).  
7. **Michael (Russian Hill, 7:30 PM–9:15 PM, 45 min):** Travel from Pacific Heights to Russian Hill: 7 min. Arrive at 6:45 PM + 7 min = 6:52 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM. Meet from 7:30 PM–8:15 PM (45 min).  
**Validation:** The schedule is feasible: all meetings satisfy minimum durations, occur within availability windows, and account for travel times. Total friends met: 7.

**Step 4: Track Goals**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco on the day of the visit.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify feasible meeting windows for each friend. (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Account for travel times between locations. (Completed in Step 2 and 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Sequence meetings to maximize friends met. (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the schedule for conflicts. (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 5: Select the optimal schedule. (Current goal)  
**Current Goal:** Select the optimal schedule that maximizes the number of friends met. The schedule from Step 3 meets 7 friends (James, Daniel, Sophia, Thomas, Olivia, Rachel, Michael) and is feasible. Since Emma cannot be met (Step 2), 7 is the maximum possible.

**Step 5: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to finalize the optimal schedule that maximizes the number of friends met (7 friends: James, Daniel, Sophia, Thomas, Olivia, Rachel, Michael). This will be achieved by presenting the validated schedule from Step 3 and confirming it meets all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Optimal Schedule:**  
- **9:00 AM:** Arrive at Embarcadero.  
- **9:20 AM–10:50 AM:** Meet James in Mission District (90 min, travel: 20 min from Embarcadero).  
- **11:02 AM–12:02 PM:** Meet Daniel in Alamo Square (60 min, travel: 12 min from Mission District).  
- **1:00 PM–2:30 PM:** Meet Sophia in Nob Hill (90 min, travel: 15 min from Alamo Square, wait from 12:17 PM).  
- **2:53 PM–4:08 PM:** Meet Thomas in Sunset District (75 min, travel: 23 min from Nob Hill).  
- **4:19 PM–5:19 PM:** Meet Olivia in The Castro (60 min, travel: 11 min from Sunset District).  
- **6:00 PM–6:45 PM:** Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (45 min, travel: 17 min from The Castro, wait from 5:36 PM).  
- **7:30 PM–8:15 PM:** Meet Michael in Russian Hill (45 min, travel: 7 min from Pacific Heights, wait from 6:52 PM).  
**Result:** This schedule meets 7 friends, the maximum possible since Emma’s meeting is infeasible. All constraints (availability, minimum durations, travel times) are satisfied.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
The optimal schedule to meet the maximum number of friends (7) in San Francisco, starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, is:  
- **9:20 AM–10:50 AM:** Meet James in Mission District (90 min).  
- **11:02 AM–12:02 PM:** Meet Daniel in Alamo Square (60 min).  
- **1:00 PM–2:30 PM:** Meet Sophia in Nob Hill (90 min).  
- **2:53 PM–4:08 PM:** Meet Thomas in Sunset District (75 min).  
- **4:19 PM–5:19 PM:** Meet Olivia in The Castro (60 min).  
- **6:00 PM–6:45 PM:** Meet Rachel in Pacific Heights (45 min).  
- **7:30 PM–8:15 PM:** Meet Michael in Russian Hill (45 min).  
**Note:** It is impossible to meet Emma in Bayview (8:30 AM–10:15 AM) for 60 minutes, as the earliest arrival at Bayview is 9:21 AM, leaving insufficient time before her availability ends at 10:15 AM.
