**Problem Statement**:  
You are visiting San Francisco for the day, arriving at the Mission District at 9:00 AM, and aim to meet as many friends as possible (Daniel, Olivia, Ethan, Sophia, and Lucas) while satisfying the given time and location constraints and minimum meeting durations. The travel times between locations are provided, and the goal is to find a schedule that maximizes the number of friends met, prioritizing meeting all five if possible.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of meeting as many friends as possible into intermediate subgoals based on their availability, locations, and minimum meeting times. Create a sequence of visits to each friend’s location, ensuring travel times and meeting durations fit within the day.  
- Subgoal 1: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (available 8:30 AM–10:45 AM, 75 minutes minimum).  
- Subgoal 2: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf (available 10:00 AM–12:30 PM, 60 minutes minimum).  
- Subgoal 3: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (available 1:00 PM–7:30 PM, 60 minutes minimum).  
- Subgoal 4: Meet Ethan at Presidio (available 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, 45 minutes minimum).  
- Subgoal 5: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (available 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, 90 minutes minimum).  
The sequence will account for travel times and ensure each meeting fits within the friends’ availability windows.

### Step 3: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Lucas at Sunset District for at least 75 minutes between 8:30 AM and 10:45 AM.  
**How to Achieve**: Travel from Mission District (starting point at 9:00 AM) to Sunset District (15 minutes travel time), arrive by 9:15 AM, and spend 75 minutes with Lucas, ending at 10:30 AM.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Depart Mission District at 9:00 AM.  
- Travel to Sunset District (15 min), arrive at 9:15 AM.  
- Meet Lucas from 9:15 AM to 10:30 AM (75 min, within 8:30 AM–10:45 AM window).  
- This satisfies the minimum meeting time and fits Lucas’s availability.  
[/IMP]  

### Step 4: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf for at least 60 minutes between 10:00 AM and 12:30 PM.  
**How to Achieve**: After meeting Lucas, travel from Sunset District to Fisherman’s Wharf (25 minutes travel time), arrive by 10:55 AM, and spend 60 minutes with Sophia, ending at 11:55 AM.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Depart Sunset District at 10:30 AM.  
- Travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (25 min), arrive at 10:55 AM.  
- Meet Sophia from 10:55 AM to 11:55 AM (60 min, within 10:00 AM–12:30 PM window).  
- This satisfies the minimum meeting time and fits Sophia’s availability.  
[/IMP]  

### Step 5: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify if the current schedule allows meeting Daniel, Ethan, and Olivia after meeting Lucas and Sophia.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the schedule (ending at Fisherman’s Wharf at 11:55 AM) allows travel to Chinatown for Daniel (1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥60 min), Presidio for Ethan (2:00 PM–5:00 PM, ≥45 min), and Pacific Heights for Olivia (6:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥90 min), considering travel times and availability windows.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- From Fisherman’s Wharf at 11:55 AM, travel to Chinatown (8 min) to meet Daniel: arrive at 12:03 PM.  
- Meet Daniel from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM (60 min, within 1:00 PM–7:30 PM).  
- Travel from Chinatown to Presidio (19 min) to meet Ethan: depart 2:00 PM, arrive 2:19 PM.  
- Meet Ethan from 2:19 PM to 3:04 PM (45 min, within 2:00 PM–5:00 PM).  
- Travel from Presidio to Pacific Heights (11 min) to meet Olivia: depart 3:04 PM, arrive 3:15 PM.  
- Olivia is available only from 6:00 PM, so wait until 6:00 PM and meet Olivia from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM (90 min, within 6:00 PM–9:00 PM).  
- **Validation Result**: This schedule is feasible but involves a significant wait (3:15 PM to 6:00 PM) at Pacific Heights. Explore alternative schedules to optimize time.  
[/IMP]  

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The current schedule has a long wait (3:15 PM–6:00 PM) before meeting Olivia. Adjust the sequence to minimize waiting time. Try meeting Ethan before Daniel, as Ethan’s window (2:00 PM–5:00 PM) is more constrained than Daniel’s (1:00 PM–7:30 PM). Revised sequence:  
- Subgoal 1: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (9:15 AM–10:30 AM).  
- Subgoal 2: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf (10:55 AM–11:55 AM).  
- Subgoal 3: Meet Ethan at Presidio (arrive after 11:55 AM, within 2:00 PM–5:00 PM, ≥45 min).  
- Subgoal 4: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (after Ethan, within 1:00 PM–7:30 PM, ≥60 min).  
- Subgoal 5: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (after Daniel, within 6:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥90 min).  
[/PLANNING]  

### Step 7: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Ethan at Presidio for at least 45 minutes between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM.  
**How to Achieve**: After meeting Sophia, travel from Fisherman’s Wharf to Presidio (17 minutes travel time), arrive by 12:12 PM, wait until 2:00 PM, and meet Ethan for 45 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Depart Fisherman’s Wharf at 11:55 AM.  
- Travel to Presidio (17 min), arrive at 12:12 PM.  
- Wait until 2:00 PM (108 min wait).  
- Meet Ethan from 2:00 PM to 2:45 PM (45 min, within 2:00 PM–5:00 PM).  
[/IMP]  

### Step 8: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Daniel at Chinatown for at least 60 minutes between 1:00 PM and 7:30 PM.  
**How to Achieve**: After meeting Ethan, travel from Presidio to Chinatown (18 minutes travel time), arrive by 3:03 PM, and meet Daniel for 60 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Depart Presidio at 2:45 PM.  
- Travel to Chinatown (18 min), arrive at 3:03 PM.  
- Meet Daniel from 3:03 PM to 4:03 PM (60 min, within 1:00 PM–7:30 PM).  
[/IMP]  

### Step 9: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights for at least 90 minutes between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM.  
**How to Achieve**: After meeting Daniel, travel from Chinatown to Pacific Heights (12 minutes travel time), arrive by 4:15 PM, wait until 6:00 PM, and meet Olivia for 90 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Depart Chinatown at 4:03 PM.  
- Travel to Pacific Heights (12 min), arrive at 4:15 PM.  
- Wait until 6:00 PM (105 min wait).  
- Meet Olivia from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM (90 min, within 6:00 PM–9:00 PM).  
[/IMP]  

### Step 10: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the feasibility of the adjusted schedule and check for optimization.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the schedule (Lucas → Sophia → Ethan → Daniel → Olivia) for compliance with all constraints and evaluate if waiting times can be reduced further.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Schedule Recap**:  
  - 9:00 AM: Depart Mission District.  
  - 9:15 AM–10:30 AM: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (75 min).  
  - 10:30 AM–10:55 AM: Travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (25 min).  
  - 10:55 AM–11:55 AM: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf (60 min).  
  - 11:55 AM–12:12 PM: Travel to Presidio (17 min).  
  - 12:12 PM–2:00 PM: Wait at Presidio (108 min).  
  - 2:00 PM–2:45 PM: Meet Ethan at Presidio (45 min).  
  - 2:45 PM–3:03 PM: Travel to Chinatown (18 min).  
  - 3:03 PM–4:03 PM: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (60 min).  
  - 4:03 PM–4:15 PM: Travel to Pacific Heights (12 min).  
  - 4:15 PM–6:00 PM: Wait at Pacific Heights (105 min).  
  - 6:00 PM–7:30 PM: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (90 min).  
- **Total Wait Time**: 108 min + 105 min = 213 min (3 hr 33 min).  
- **Validation Result**: The schedule meets all five friends, satisfying minimum meeting times and availability windows. However, the total wait time is significant. Test an alternative sequence (e.g., Daniel before Ethan) to reduce waiting.  
- **Alternative Schedule Test (Lucas → Sophia → Daniel → Ethan → Olivia)**:  
  - After Sophia (11:55 AM at Fisherman’s Wharf), travel to Chinatown (8 min), arrive 12:03 PM.  
  - Meet Daniel 1:00 PM–2:00 PM (60 min).  
  - Travel to Presidio (19 min), arrive 2:19 PM.  
  - Meet Ethan 2:19 PM–3:04 PM (45 min).  
  - Travel to Pacific Heights (11 min), arrive 3:15 PM.  
  - Wait until 6:00 PM (165 min), meet Olivia 6:00 PM–7:30 PM (90 min).  
- **Alternative Wait Time**: 57 min (12:03 PM–1:00 PM) + 165 min (3:15 PM–6:00 PM) = 222 min (3 hr 42 min).  
- The original adjusted schedule (213 min wait) is more efficient than the alternative (222 min wait).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (all five achieved).  
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (9:15 AM–10:30 AM, 75 min, completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf (10:55 AM–11:55 AM, 60 min, completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Ethan at Presidio (2:00 PM–2:45 PM, 45 min, completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (3:03 PM–4:03 PM, 60 min, completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (6:00 PM–7:30 PM, 90 min, completed).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the schedule, as all subgoals are met.  
[/REVIEW]  

### Final Answer  
**Optimal Schedule**:  
- **9:00 AM**: Depart Mission District.  
- **9:15 AM–10:30 AM**: Meet Lucas at Sunset District (75 min).  
- **10:30 AM–10:55 AM**: Travel to Fisherman’s Wharf (25 min).  
- **10:55 AM–11:55 AM**: Meet Sophia at Fisherman’s Wharf (60 min).  
- **11:55 AM–12:12 PM**: Travel to Presidio (17 min).  
- **12:12 PM–2:00 PM**: Wait at Presidio (108 min).  
- **2:00 PM–2:45 PM**: Meet Ethan at Presidio (45 min).  
- **2:45 PM–3:03 PM**: Travel to Chinatown (18 min).  
- **3:03 PM–4:03 PM**: Meet Daniel at Chinatown (60 min).  
- **4:03 PM–4:15 PM**: Travel to Pacific Heights (12 min).  
- **4:15 PM–6:00 PM**: Wait at Pacific Heights (105 min).  
- **6:00 PM–7:30 PM**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (90 min).  

This schedule allows you to meet all five friends, satisfying all constraints with a total wait time of 3 hours 33 minutes. No schedule was found that eliminates waiting entirely due to the gaps between availability windows (e.g., Ethan’s window ends at 5:00 PM, but Olivia’s starts at 6:00 PM). The sequence was optimized to minimize waiting time compared to alternatives.
