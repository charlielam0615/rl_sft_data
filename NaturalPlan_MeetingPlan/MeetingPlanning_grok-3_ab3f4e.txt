**Problem Restatement:**
The goal is to meet as many friends as possible (Liam, Sophia, and Noah) in San Francisco on a single day, starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, while adhering to the given time and location constraints and minimizing travel and waiting time. The constraints are:
- Travel times: Nob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf (11 min), Nob Hill to Pacific Heights (11 min), Nob Hill to Embarcadero (9 min), Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill (11 min), Fisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights (10 min), Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero (8 min), Pacific Heights to Nob Hill (11 min), Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf (10 min), Pacific Heights to Embarcadero (10 min), Embarcadero to Nob Hill (9 min), Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf (8 min), Embarcadero to Pacific Heights (11 min).
- Liam is at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM; meeting requires at least 75 minutes.
- Sophia is at Pacific Heights from 1:15 PM to 6:30 PM; meeting requires at least 60 minutes.
- Noah is at Embarcadero from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM; meeting requires at least 90 minutes.
The provided solution suggests meeting Noah at Embarcadero from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM, Liam at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:38 AM to 12:53 PM, and Sophia at Pacific Heights from 1:15 PM to 2:15 PM. The task is to evaluate this schedule and optimize it to meet all friends while adhering to constraints.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting all three friends (Liam, Sophia, Noah) into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations:
- Subgoal 1: Meet Noah at Embarcadero between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM for at least 90 minutes.
- Subgoal 2: Meet Liam at Fisherman's Wharf between 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM for at least 75 minutes.
- Subgoal 3: Meet Sophia at Pacific Heights between 1:15 PM and 6:30 PM for at least 60 minutes.
- Subgoal 4: Minimize travel and waiting time to optimize the schedule while ensuring all meetings occur within the specified time windows.

**Step 2: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to organize and review the hierarchy of goals:
- **Main Goal**: Meet as many friends as possible (Liam, Sophia, Noah) while adhering to time and location constraints.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Meet Noah at Embarcadero (10:00 AM–4:00 PM, 90 minutes).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Meet Liam at Fisherman's Wharf (9:30 AM–2:00 PM, 75 minutes).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Meet Sophia at Pacific Heights (1:15 PM–6:30 PM, 60 minutes).
  - **Subgoal 4**: Minimize travel and waiting time.
**Current Goal**: Evaluate the feasibility of meeting all three friends within their availability windows while optimizing the schedule.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the provided schedule to ensure it meets all constraints (time windows, meeting durations, and travel times). This involves checking each step of the schedule for timing accuracy and feasibility.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The provided schedule is:
- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.
- Travel to Embarcadero (9 min), arrive at 9:09 AM, wait until 10:00 AM.
- Meet Noah from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (90 min).
- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (8 min), arrive at 11:38 AM.
- Meet Liam from 11:38 AM to 12:53 PM (75 min).
- Travel to Pacific Heights (10 min), arrive at 1:03 PM, wait until 1:15 PM.
- Meet Sophia from 1:15 PM to 2:15 PM (60 min).

**Validation Steps**:
1. **Nob Hill to Embarcadero**: Depart 9:00 AM, travel 9 min, arrive 9:09 AM. Wait until 10:00 AM (51 min). Noah is available from 10:00 AM, so this is valid.
2. **Meet Noah**: 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (90 min). This meets the minimum duration and is within Noah’s window (10:00 AM–4:00 PM). Valid.
3. **Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf**: Depart 11:30 AM, travel 8 min, arrive 11:38 AM. Liam is available from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM, so this is valid.
4. **Meet Liam**: 11:38 AM to 12:53 PM (75 min). This meets the minimum duration. Check if 12:53 PM is before 2:00 PM: 12:53 PM is within Liam’s window. Valid.
5. **Fisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights**: Depart 12:53 PM, travel 10 min, arrive 1:03 PM. Sophia is available from 1:15 PM, so wait 12 min. This is valid.
6. **Meet Sophia**: 1:15 PM to 2:15 PM (60 min). This meets the minimum duration and is within Sophia’s window (1:15 PM–6:30 PM). Valid.

The schedule is feasible and meets all constraints.

**Step 4: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The provided schedule is valid but includes waiting times (51 min at Embarcadero, 12 min at Pacific Heights). Adjust subgoals to explore alternative schedules that minimize waiting time while still meeting all friends within their availability windows.
- Adjusted Subgoal 1: Meet Liam first at Fisherman's Wharf to reduce waiting time, as Liam is available earlier (9:30 AM).
- Adjusted Subgoal 2: Meet Noah at Embarcadero after Liam, within 10:00 AM–4:00 PM.
- Adjusted Subgoal 3: Meet Sophia at Pacific Heights after Noah, within 1:15 PM–6:30 PM.
- Adjusted Subgoal 4: Optimize the schedule to minimize total waiting time while ensuring all meetings occur.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create an optimized schedule starting with Liam at Fisherman's Wharf, followed by Noah at Embarcadero, and then Sophia at Pacific Heights, ensuring all meeting durations and time windows are met with minimal waiting time. Use the travel times and constraints to compute the schedule.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Proposed Optimized Schedule**:
- **Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM**.
- **Travel to Fisherman's Wharf** (11 min): Depart 9:00 AM, arrive 9:11 AM. Liam is available from 9:30 AM, so wait 19 min.
- **Meet Liam**: 9:30 AM to 10:45 AM (75 min). Liam’s window is 9:30 AM–2:00 PM, so this is valid.
- **Travel to Embarcadero** (8 min): Depart 10:45 AM, arrive 10:53 AM. Noah is available from 10:00 AM, so no wait is needed.
- **Meet Noah**: 10:53 AM to 12:23 PM (90 min). Noah’s window is 10:00 AM–4:00 PM, so this is valid.
- **Travel to Pacific Heights** (11 min): Depart 12:23 PM, arrive 12:34 PM. Sophia is available from 1:15 PM, so wait 41 min.
- **Meet Sophia**: 1:15 PM to 2:15 PM (60 min). Sophia’s window is 1:15 PM–6:30 PM, so this is valid.

**Comparison**:
- Original schedule: Total waiting time = 51 min (Embarcadero) + 12 min (Pacific Heights) = 63 min.
- New schedule: Total waiting time = 19 min (Fisherman's Wharf) + 41 min (Pacific Heights) = 60 min.
The new schedule reduces waiting time by 3 minutes and is feasible.

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the optimized schedule (Liam → Noah → Sophia) to ensure it meets all constraints and correctly minimizes waiting time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Validation of Optimized Schedule**:
1. **Nob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf**: Depart 9:00 AM, travel 11 min, arrive 9:11 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM (19 min). Liam is available from 9:30 AM. Valid.
2. **Meet Liam**: 9:30 AM to 10:45 AM (75 min). Within Liam’s window (9:30 AM–2:00 PM). Valid.
3. **Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero**: Depart 10:45 AM, travel 8 min, arrive 10:53 AM. Noah is available from 10:00 AM. Valid.
4. **Meet Noah**: 10:53 AM to 12:23 PM (90 min). Within Noah’s window (10:00 AM–4:00 PM). Valid.
5. **Embarcadero to Pacific Heights**: Depart 12:23 PM, travel 11 min, arrive 12:34 PM. Sophia is available from 1:15 PM, so wait 41 min. Valid.
6. **Meet Sophia**: 1:15 PM to 2:15 PM (60 min). Within Sophia’s window (1:15 PM–6:30 PM). Valid.

The optimized schedule is feasible and reduces waiting time to 60 minutes.
