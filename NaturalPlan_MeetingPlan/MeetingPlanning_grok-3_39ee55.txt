### Problem Statement
The goal is to arrange a meeting schedule in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible (Ethan, Olivia, Nathan, Sophia, and Liam) while adhering to their availability constraints and minimizing travel time between locations. I arrive at the Mission District at 9:00 AM and must meet each friend at their specified location and time window for the required duration. Travel times between locations are provided, and I need to optimize the schedule to maximize the number of friends met while satisfying all constraints. If no schedule meets all constraints, I will explain why.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To maximize the number of friends met, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals based on friends’ availability and locations:
1. Meet Nathan at Presidio (9:30 AM–11:45 AM, 75 minutes).
2. Meet Ethan at Chinatown (11:00 AM–7:30 PM, 90 minutes).
3. Meet Sophia at North Beach (1:00 PM–4:00 PM, 45 minutes).
4. Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–9:00 PM, 60 minutes).
5. Meet Liam at Union Square (6:00 PM–8:30 PM, 60 minutes).

Each subgoal involves traveling to the friend’s location, meeting for the required duration, and ensuring the schedule aligns with their availability and travel times.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Current Goal**: Maximize the number of friends met by creating a feasible schedule.

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible (up to 5: Nathan, Ethan, Sophia, Olivia, Liam).
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Nathan at Presidio (9:30 AM–11:45 AM, ≥75 minutes).
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Ethan at Chinatown (11:00 AM–7:30 PM, ≥90 minutes).
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Sophia at North Beach (1:00 PM–4:00 PM, ≥45 minutes).
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥60 minutes).
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Liam at Union Square (6:00 PM–8:30 PM, ≥60 minutes).

The subgoals are ordered by the earliest availability to guide scheduling. The current focus is to start with Nathan’s meeting, as his time window is the earliest and most constrained (9:30 AM–11:45 AM).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Meet Nathan at Presidio for at least 75 minutes between 9:30 AM and 11:45 AM.

**Plan**: Start at Mission District at 9:00 AM. Travel to Presidio (22 minutes). Arrive by 9:22 AM and begin meeting Nathan at 9:30 AM for 75 minutes, ending at 10:45 AM. This fits within Nathan’s availability window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Depart Mission District at 9:00 AM.
- Travel 22 minutes to Presidio, arriving at 9:22 AM.
- Meet Nathan from 9:30 AM to 10:45 AM (75 minutes).
- Meeting completes within Nathan’s availability (9:30 AM–11:45 AM).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Validate the feasibility of meeting Nathan and proceeding to the next friend (Ethan, available at Chinatown from 11:00 AM).

**Plan**: After meeting Nathan at Presidio until 10:45 AM, travel to Chinatown (19 minutes) to meet Ethan for 90 minutes within his availability (11:00 AM–7:30 PM). Check if this schedule is feasible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Meeting Nathan ends at 10:45 AM at Presidio.
- Travel to Chinatown takes 19 minutes, arriving at 11:04 AM.
- Ethan is available from 11:00 AM, so start meeting at 11:04 AM for 90 minutes, ending at 12:34 PM.
- This is within Ethan’s availability (11:00 AM–7:30 PM).
- The schedule is valid so far: Nathan (9:30 AM–10:45 AM), Ethan (11:04 AM–12:34 PM).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Meet Sophia at North Beach for at least 45 minutes between 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM.

**Plan**: After meeting Ethan at Chinatown until 12:34 PM, travel to North Beach (6 minutes) to meet Sophia for 45 minutes within her availability window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Meeting Ethan ends at 12:34 PM in Chinatown.
- Travel to North Beach takes 6 minutes, arriving at 12:40 PM.
- Sophia’s availability starts at 1:00 PM, so wait until 1:00 PM.
- Meet Sophia from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM (45 minutes).
- Meeting ends at 1:45 PM, within Sophia’s availability (1:00 PM–4:00 PM).
- Current schedule: Nathan (9:30 AM–10:45 AM), Ethan (11:04 AM–12:34 PM), Sophia (1:00 PM–1:45 PM).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Validate the feasibility of meeting Olivia at Pacific Heights for at least 60 minutes between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM, and Liam at Union Square for at least 60 minutes between 6:00 PM and 8:30 PM.

**Plan**: After meeting Sophia at North Beach until 1:45 PM, travel to Pacific Heights (10 minutes) to meet Olivia, then travel to Union Square (12 minutes) to meet Liam. Check if both meetings can fit within their time windows.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Meeting Sophia ends at 1:45 PM in North Beach.
- Travel to Pacific Heights takes 10 minutes, arriving at 1:55 PM.
- Olivia is available from 5:00 PM, so wait until 5:00 PM.
- Meet Olivia from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM (60 minutes).
- Travel to Union Square takes 12 minutes, arriving at 6:12 PM.
- Liam is available from 6:00 PM, so meet Liam from 6:12 PM to 7:12 PM (60 minutes).
- Meeting Liam ends at 7:12 PM, within his availability (6:00 PM–8:30 PM).
- The schedule is valid: Nathan (9:30 AM–10:45 AM), Ethan (11:04 AM–12:34 PM), Sophia (1:00 PM–1:45 PM), Olivia (5:00 PM–6:00 PM), Liam (6:12 PM–7:12 PM).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Current Goal**: Confirm the schedule meets all friends and constraints.

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Meet as many friends as possible.
  - Subgoal 1: Meet Nathan at Presidio (9:30 AM–11:45 AM, ≥75 minutes) – Achieved (9:30 AM–10:45 AM).
  - Subgoal 2: Meet Ethan at Chinatown (11:00 AM–7:30 PM, ≥90 minutes) – Achieved (11:04 AM–12:34 PM).
  - Subgoal 3: Meet Sophia at North Beach (1:00 PM–4:00 PM, ≥45 minutes) – Achieved (1:00 PM–1:45 PM).
  - Subgoal 4: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (5:00 PM–9:00 PM, ≥60 minutes) – Achieved (5:00 PM–6:00 PM).
  - Subgoal 5: Meet Liam at Union Square (6:00 PM–8:30 PM, ≥60 minutes) – Achieved (6:12 PM–7:12 PM).

All subgoals are met, and the schedule maximizes the number of friends (5) while satisfying time and duration constraints.

### Final Answer
The optimal schedule to meet all five friends is:
- **9:30 AM–10:45 AM**: Meet Nathan at Presidio (75 minutes).
- **11:04 AM–12:34 PM**: Meet Ethan at Chinatown (90 minutes).
- **1:00 PM–1:45 PM**: Meet Sophia at North Beach (45 minutes).
- **5:00 PM–6:00 PM**: Meet Olivia at Pacific Heights (60 minutes).
- **6:12 PM–7:12 PM**: Meet Liam at Union Square (60 minutes).

This schedule accounts for travel times and ensures each meeting occurs within the friends’ availability windows, maximizing the number of friends met (5). No constraints are violated, and the schedule is feasible based on the provided travel times and time windows.
