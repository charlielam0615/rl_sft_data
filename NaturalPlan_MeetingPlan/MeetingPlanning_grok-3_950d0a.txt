**Problem Restatement:**
I need to plan a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, starting at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM. The friends are Liam (Union Square, 11:30 AM–6:00 PM, minimum 75 minutes), Emma (Marina District, 5:45 PM–8:30 PM, minimum 60 minutes), Noah (Haight-Ashbury, 1:30 PM–4:00 PM, minimum 45 minutes), Ava (Mission District, 9:15 AM–11:00 AM, minimum 60 minutes), and James (Embarcadero, 3:00 PM–7:00 PM, minimum 90 minutes). Travel times between locations are provided, and I must optimize the schedule to meet all friends while adhering to their availability and minimum meeting times.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of meeting all five friends into intermediate subgoals based on their availability and locations. The subgoals are to:
1. Meet Ava in Mission District between 9:15 AM and 11:00 AM for at least 60 minutes.
2. Meet Liam in Union Square between 11:30 AM and 6:00 PM for at least 75 minutes.
3. Meet Noah in Haight-Ashbury between 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM for at least 45 minutes.
4. Meet James in Embarcadero between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM for at least 90 minutes.
5. Meet Emma in Marina District between 5:45 PM and 8:30 PM for at least 60 minutes.
These subgoals will guide the creation of a schedule, accounting for travel times and ensuring all meetings fit within the time constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to create a feasible schedule starting at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM to meet Ava in Mission District for 60 minutes between 9:15 AM and 11:00 AM. This can be achieved by traveling from Russian Hill to Mission District and scheduling the meeting within Ava’s availability window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, travel to Mission District takes 17 minutes, so arrival is at 9:17 AM. Ava is available from 9:15 AM to 11:00 AM. Meet Ava for 60 minutes from 9:17 AM to 10:17 AM, which fits within her availability.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to meet Noah in Haight-Ashbury for 45 minutes between 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM. This can be achieved by traveling from Union Square to Haight-Ashbury after meeting Liam and scheduling the meeting within Noah’s availability window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After meeting Liam at 12:45 PM in Union Square, travel to Haight-Ashbury takes 18 minutes, so arrival is at 1:03 PM. Noah is available from 1:30 PM, so wait until 1:30 PM. Meet Noah for 45 minutes from 1:30 PM to 2:15 PM, which fits within his availability.

**Final Answer**

The optimal schedule to meet all five friends in San Francisco, starting at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, is as follows:
- **9:00 AM**: Start at Russian Hill.
- **9:17 AM**: Arrive at Mission District (17 min travel), meet Ava from 9:17 AM to 10:17 AM (60 min).
- **10:32 AM**: Arrive at Union Square (15 min travel), wait until 11:30 AM, meet Liam from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM (75 min).
- **1:03 PM**: Arrive at Haight-Ashbury (18 min travel), wait until 1:30 PM, meet Noah from 1:30 PM to 2:15 PM (45 min).
- **2:35 PM**: Arrive at Embarcadero (20 min travel), wait until 3:00 PM, meet James from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM (90 min).
- **4:44 PM**: Arrive at Marina District (14 min travel), wait until 5:45 PM, meet Emma from 5:45 PM to 6:45 PM (60 min).

This schedule satisfies all constraints, meets the minimum duration for each friend, and ensures all meetings occur within their availability windows. No other schedule was found to improve on this, as it meets all five friends efficiently with minimal waiting time.
