### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a 3-day travel plan for one person traveling from Seattle to Boise from April 10th to April 12th, 2025, with a budget of $1,200.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating a 3-day travel plan into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify transportation options from Seattle to Boise on April 10, 2025.  
2. Find accommodation options in Boise for April 10–12, 2025.  
3. Identify dining options in Boise.  
4. Identify attractions in Boise.  
5. Estimate travel costs and durations for budgeting.  
6. Store all collected information in the Notebook.  
7. Use the Planner tool to create a detailed 3-day itinerary.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify transportation options from Seattle to Boise for April 10, 2025.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the FlightSearch tool to find flights from Seattle to Boise on April 10, 2025, and use the DistanceMatrix tool to estimate driving or taxi options for comparison.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**FlightSearch [Seattle, Boise, 2025-04-10]**  
Simulated Results:  
- Alaska Airlines: Departure 8:00 AM, Arrival 10:15 AM, Cost: $150 (one-way).  
- Delta Airlines: Departure 1:00 PM, Arrival 3:15 PM, Cost: $180 (one-way).  

**DistanceMatrix [Seattle, Boise, self-driving]**  
Simulated Results:  
- Distance: 500 miles  
- Time: ~7 hours 30 minutes  
- Cost: ~$100 (fuel for a round trip, assuming 25 mpg and $5/gallon).  

**DistanceMatrix [Seattle, Boise, taxi]**  
Simulated Results:  
- Distance: 500 miles  
- Time: ~7 hours 30 minutes  
- Cost: ~$1,000 (one-way, estimated based on long-distance taxi rates).  

Given the $1,200 budget, flights are more cost-effective and faster than a taxi. Driving is cheaper but time-consuming, so flights are prioritized.

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the current path by estimating total costs against the $1,200 budget.  
**How to Achieve**: Sum the estimated costs of transportation, accommodation, dining, and attractions to ensure they fit within the budget.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Estimated Costs:  
- Transportation: Flight (Alaska Airlines, round-trip) = $300 ($150 one-way).  
- Accommodation: Budget Inn Boise, 2 nights = $160.  
- Dining: 9 meals (3 breakfasts at $15, 3 lunches at $25, 3 dinners at $30) = $180.  
- Attractions: Zoo Boise ($12) + Discovery Center ($18) = $30.  
**Total**: $300 + $160 + $180 + $30 = $670.  

The total cost ($670) is well within the $1,200 budget, leaving ~$530 for miscellaneous expenses (e.g., local transport, souvenirs). The plan is valid and feasible.
