[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using **Planner [Craft a travel plan for a solo traveler from Baltimore to Billings for 3 days, April 13-15, 2025, with a budget of $1,750]**, the following itinerary is generated based on Notebook data (simulated results):  

**3-Day Travel Plan: Baltimore to Billings, April 13–15, 2025**

**Total Estimated Cost**: $1,679  

**Day 1: April 13, 2025**  
- **Morning**: Depart Baltimore (BWI) on United Airlines flight at 8:00 AM, arrive Billings (BIL) at 12:30 PM ($422 round-trip).  [](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/bil/bwi/billings-to-baltimore)
- **Afternoon**: Take taxi from airport to Budget Inn Billings ($10, 3 miles). Check in at Budget Inn ($80/night, total $160 for 2 nights). Visit DanWalt Gardens ($5 admission, taxi $10 round-trip).  
- **Evening**: Dinner at Spud’s Diner ($15). Return to hotel by taxi (included in daily estimate).  
- **Daily Cost**: $422 (flight) + $80 (hotel) + $5 (attraction) + $15 (dinner) + $20 (taxi) = $542.

**Day 3: April 15, 2025**

- **Total**: $422 + $160 + $40 + $80 + $90 = $792 (well within $1,750 budget).  
- **Buffer**: $1,750 - $792 = $958 (for incidentals, souvenirs, or upgrades).  

**Notes**: The itinerary prioritizes budget-friendly options (e.g., Budget Inn, cheaper dining) to stay well under $1,750. The traveler has flexibility to upgrade accommodations or dining with the remaining budget. All attractions are accessible by taxi, fitting the solo traveler’s needs.
