### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a 3-day travel plan for one person traveling from Atlanta to Salt Lake City, from April 28 to April 30, 2025, with a budget of $1,600. The plan must include transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation, using provided tools (FlightSearch, DistanceMatrix, AccommodationSearch, RestaurantSearch, AttractionSearch, CitySearch, NotebookWrite, Planner). All relevant information must be stored in the Notebook tool before being processed by the Planner tool. I will simulate the tool results and follow the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) for each step, structuring responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.
