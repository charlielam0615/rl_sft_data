**Problem Restatement:**
The user requests a 3-day travel plan from Detroit to Salem for a solo trip from April 15 to April 17, 2025, with a budget of $1,550. The plan must include transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation, using provided tools (FlightSearch, DistanceMatrix, AccommodationSearch, RestaurantSearch, AttractionSearch, CitySearch, NotebookWrite, Planner).
