**Restated Problem:**  
I need to create a 5-day travel plan for one person departing from Charlotte, visiting 2 cities in Nevada, with travel dates from April 12th to April 16th, 2025, and a budget of $3,000. The plan should include transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation, using the provided tools to gather information and store it in Notebook before inputting it into the Planner tool for the final plan.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of creating a 5-day travel plan into smaller, manageable subgoals. These include identifying the two cities in Nevada to visit, arranging transportation from Charlotte to Nevada and between the cities, finding accommodations, identifying dining options and attractions in each city, and ensuring the plan fits within the $3,000 budget. The first step is to identify the cities in Nevada to visit.
