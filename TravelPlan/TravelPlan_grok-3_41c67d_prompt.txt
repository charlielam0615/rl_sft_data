Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M)
We define a set of meta-cognitive actions M, divided into three subsets: Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R).
- Planning $$P \subset M$$
  - Forward Subgoaling: Breaking down the current goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.
  - Backward Subgoaling: Defining necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the current goal.
  - Adjust Subgoals: Adjusting or changing previously set intermediate subgoals.
  - Backtrack: Returning to an earlier state.
- Implementation $$I \subset M$$
  - Reach Goal: Identifying the goal of this step, and applying reasoning or using tools to achieve it.
  - Validation: Checking the current path's validity.
- Review $$R \subset M$$
  - Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated by previous subgoaling methods, highlighting the current one.
  - Recall Info: Retrieve past information relevant to the current step.

I want you to solve problems by selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list. Your response must adhere to the following format: enclose all planning-related content within [PLANNING] and [/PLANNING] tags, all implementation-related content within [IMP] and [/IMP] tags, and all review-related content within [REVIEW] and [/REVIEW] tags. The details of the requirement will be given below.
- The [PLANNING], [IMP] and [REVIEW] blocks
The meta-cognitive action list divides actions into three categories: "planning", "implementation" and "Review". If the selected action is from the "planning" category, include all content for that step in the [PLANNING] block. If the action is from the "implementation" category, place the action name and action meta-data (defined below) and in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as implementation details and should be placed in the [IMP] block. If the action is from the "review" category, place the action name in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as reviewed details, and should be placed in the [REVIEW] block.

- Additional remarks on the [PLANNING] block
For actions from the "planning" category, put all the generated content of the action in the [PLANNING] block.
For actions from the "implementation" category, put the action name and implementation-action meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The implementation-action meta-data includes details about the current goal, and a concise description about how to achieve it. Present the meta-data in clear, natural language.
For actions from the "review" category, when the action is "recall info" include the action name and its meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The meta-data should concisely describe the core content serving as the foundation for the information retrieval process, with retrieved information being relevant to this content. When is the action is not "recall info", just put the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

- Additional remarks on the [REVIEW] block
For actions belong to the review category, we provide detailed instructions below:
Track Goals: Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format by integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block. The aim of this action is to provide an overall as well as focused context to future [IMP] block. You should also state the current goal. Ensure the goals reflect the most recent updates, particularly if they have just been modified by actions from the "planning" category.
Recall Info: Identify the current goal, go through all previous contents, and extract information related to the current goal. Your summarized information should be concise, such that it should serve as pointers to previous related materials.

Start your solution by restating the problem clearly. Then, for each step, include the following blocks based on the action's category:

Case 1: Planning action — Include only the [PLANNING] block.
Case 2: Implementation action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [IMP] block.
Case 3: Review action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [REVIEW] block.

Append which category the selected action belongs to after the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

Solve the user's problems by following the previous requirements.

I want you to simulate a travel planning case and then create a travel plan.
Ensure you gather valid information related to transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation using the following tools. All information should be written in Notebook, which
will then be input into the Planner tool. The user query will be provided to you, but you need to simulate the return results of the tools.

**Tools:**
(1) FlightSearch [ Departure City , Destination City , Date ]:
- Description:
A flight information retrieval tool.
- Parameters:
Departure City: The city you' ll be flying out from.
Destination City: The city you aim to reach.
Date: The date of your travel in YYYY - MM - DD format.
- Example: FlightSearch [ New York , London , 2022 -10 -01] would fetch flights from New York to London on October 1 , 2022.

(2) DistanceMatrix [ Origin , Destination , Mode ]:
- Description: Estimate the distance , time and cost between two cities.
- Parameters:
Origin: The departure city of your journey.
Destination: The destination city of your journey.
Mode: The method of transportation. Choices include' self-driving' and' taxi'.
- Example: DistanceMatrix [ Paris , Lyon , self-driving ] would provide driving distance , time and cost between Paris and Lyon.

(3) AccommodationSearch [ City ]:
- Description: Discover accommodations in your desired city.
- Parameter: 
City: The name of the city where you' re seeking accommodation.
- Example: AccommodationSearch [ Rome ] would present a list of hotel rooms in Rome.

(4) RestaurantSearch [ City ]:
- Description: Explore dining options in a city of your choice.
- Parameter: 
City: The name of the city where you' re seeking restaurant.
- Example: RestaurantSearch [ Tokyo ] would show a curated list of restaurants in Tokyo.

(5) AttractionSearch [ City ]:
- Description: Find attractions in a city of your choice.
- Parameter: 
City:  The name of the city where you' re seeking attractions.
- Example: AttractionSearch [ London ] would return attractions in London.

(6) CitySearch [ State ]
- Description: Find cities in a state of your choice.
- Parameter: 
State:  The name of the city where you' re seeking cities.
- Example: CitySearch [ California ] would return cities in California.

(7) NotebookWrite [ Short Description ]
- Description: Writes a new data entry into the Notebook tool with a short description. This tool should be used immediately after FlightSearch , AccommodationSearch , AttractionSearch, RestaurantSearch or DistanceMatrix. Only the data stored in Notebook can be seen by Planner. So you should write all the information you need into Notebook.
- Parameters: 
Short Description: A brief description or label for the stored data. You don' t need to write all the information in the description. The data you've searched for will be automatically stored in the Notebook.
- Example: NotebookWrite [ Flights from Rome to Paris in 2022 -02 -01] would store the information of flights from Rome to Paris in 2022 -02 -01 in the Notebook.

(8) Planner [ Query ]
- Description : A smart planning tool that crafts detailed plans based on user input and the information stored in Notebook.
- Parameters :
Query : The query from user.
- Example : Planner [ Give me a 3 - day trip plan from Seattle to New York ] would return a detailed 3 - day trip plan. You should use as many as possible steps to collect enough information to input to the Planner tool.

**User Query:**
Please design a travel plan departing from Pittsburgh to Bismarck for 3 days, from April 20th to April 22nd, 2025, for one person, with a budget of $1,650?
