**Restated Problem:**  
I need to create a 5-day travel plan for one person departing from Tampa, Florida, to visit 2 cities in Washington state. The travel dates are from April 16th to April 20th, 2025, with a total budget of $3,500. The plan should include transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation, using the provided tools to gather information and storing all data in the Notebook before inputting it into the Planner tool for the final plan.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of creating a 5-day travel plan into smaller, manageable subgoals. These include identifying the two cities in Washington to visit, arranging transportation from Tampa to these cities, finding accommodations, identifying dining options, selecting attractions, and ensuring the plan fits within the $3,500 budget.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify two cities in Washington state to visit during the trip.  
How to Achieve: Use the CitySearch tool with the parameter "Washington" to retrieve a list of cities, then select two based on popularity and tourist appeal (e.g., Seattle and Spokane).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the CitySearch tool to find cities in Washington state: CitySearch [Washington].  
Simulated Result: The tool returns a list of cities including Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, Vancouver, and Bellevue. Based on tourist appeal and diversity of attractions, I select Seattle and Spokane as the two cities to visit. Seattle is a major hub with iconic landmarks, while Spokane offers a quieter, scenic experience.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)
