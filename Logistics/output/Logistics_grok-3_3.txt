**Problem Restatement**: The task is to create a logistics plan to transport package_0 from location_1_0 (an airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (an airport in city_0). The initial conditions are:
- location_0_0 is an airport in city_0.
- location_1_0 is an airport in city_1.
- airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0.
- package_0 is at location_1_0.
- truck_0 is at location_0_0.
- truck_1 is at location_1_0.
The goal is to have package_0 at location_0_0, using actions like loading/unloading packages into/from trucks or airplanes, driving trucks within cities, and flying airplanes between cities, while respecting the given restrictions.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, I will break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0 (since package_0 is in city_1 and needs to travel to city_0, which requires an airplane).
2. Transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane.
3. Unload package_0 at location_0_0 (the airport in city_0).

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0.
  - Subgoal 2: Transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane.
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.
**Current Goal**: Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Since package_0 is already at location_1_0 (an airport), and an airplane is needed to transport it to city_0, I will first move an airplane (airplane_0 or airplane_1) from location_0_0 to location_1_0, then load package_0 into the airplane.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Step**: Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
- **Reasoning**: Airplane_0 is at location_0_0 (an airport in city_0), and location_1_0 is an airport in city_1. The action satisfies the restriction that an airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from- and to-locations are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.
- **Outcome**: Airplane_0 is now at location_1_0.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0.  
**How to Achieve**: With airplane_0 now at location_1_0, load package_0 into airplane_0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Step**: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
- **Reasoning**: Package_0 and airplane_0 are both at location_1_0. The action satisfies the restriction that a package can be loaded into an airplane if both are at the same location.
- **Outcome**: Package_0 is now in airplane_0 and no longer at location_1_0.
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Have package_0 at location_0_0.
  - Subgoal 1: Move package_0 to an airplane at location_1_0 (achieved).
  - Subgoal 2: Transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane.
  - Subgoal 3: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.
**Current Goal**: Transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Transport package_0 from city_1 to city_0 via an airplane.  
**How to Achieve**: Fly airplane_0 (with package_0 loaded) from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Step**: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
- **Reasoning**: Airplane_0 is at location_1_0 (an airport in city_1), and location_0_0 is an airport in city_0. Package_0 is in airplane_0. The action satisfies the restriction for flying an airplane between airports.
- **Outcome**: Airplane_0 (with package_0) is now at location_0_0.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Since airplane_0 (with package_0) is now at location_0_0, unload package_0 from airplane_0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Step**: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.
- **Reasoning**: Package_0 is in airplane_0, and airplane_0 is at location_0_0. The action satisfies the restriction that a package can be unloaded from an airplane if the package is in the airplane.
- **Outcome**: Package_0 is now at location_0_0 and no longer in airplane_0.
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Ensure package_0 is at location_0_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the sequence of actions has achieved the goal and if all actions were valid according to the restrictions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Validation Check**:
- **Goal Check**: The final action places package_0 at location_0_0, satisfying the main goal.
- **Action Validity**:
  - Step 3 (Fly airplane_0): Valid, as airplane_0 was at location_0_0, and both locations are airports.
  - Step 4 (Load package_0): Valid, as package_0 and airplane_0 were at location_1_0.
  - Step 6 (Fly airplane_0): Valid, as airplane_0 was at location_1_0, and both locations are airports.
  - Step 7 (Unload package_0): Valid, as package_0 was in airplane_0 at location_0_0.
- **Outcome**: The plan is valid, and the goal is achieved.
[/IMP]

### Final Logistics Plan
1. Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
2. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
3. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
4. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.

**Result**: Package_0 is now at location_0_0, as required.
