**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a logistics plan to transport package_0 from location_1_0 (an airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (an airport in city_0). The initial conditions are: location_0_0 is an airport in city_0, location_1_0 is an airport in city_1, airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, and truck_1 is at location_1_0. The goal is to ensure package_0 is at location_0_0, using actions such as loading/unloading packages into/from trucks or airplanes, driving trucks within a city, and flying airplanes between cities, while adhering to the specified restrictions.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of having package_0 at location_0_0, I will break it down into intermediate subgoals. Since package_0 is currently at location_1_0 (the airport in city_1) and needs to be at location_0_0 (the airport in city_0), the package must be transported between cities. Given that airplanes are used for inter-city transport and both locations are airports, the plan involves:  
1. Loading package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
2. Flying the airplane from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
3. Unloading package_0 at location_0_0.  
Since airplane_0 and airplane_1 are at location_0_0, an additional subgoal is to fly an airplane to location_1_0 first.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Package_0 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0.  
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Fly an airplane to location_1_0.

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Fly an airplane to location_1_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Airplane_0 is at location_0_0 (an airport in city_0). Since location_1_0 is an airport in city_1, airplane_0 can be flown from location_0_0 to location_1_0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.  
- **Precondition Check**: Airplane_0 is at location_0_0, and both location_0_0 and location_1_0 are airports.  
- **Action Execution**: Perform the action "fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0."  
- **Result**: Airplane_0 is now at location_1_0.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure airplane_0 is at location_1_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that the action in Step 3 (flying airplane_0 to location_1_0) was valid and successful.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check Preconditions**: In Step 3, airplane_0 was at location_0_0, and both locations are airports, satisfying the conditions for flying.  
- **Check Outcome**: The action specifies that airplane_0 is now at location_1_0 and no longer at location_0_0, which aligns with the goal.  
- **Result**: The path is valid; airplane_0 is at location_1_0.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Package_0 is at location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 1: Fly an airplane to location_1_0 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
  - Subgoal 3: Fly the airplane with package_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
  - Subgoal 4: Unload package_0 at location_0_0.  
**Current Goal**: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Load package_0 into an airplane at location_1_0.  
**How to Achieve**: Package_0 is at location_1_0, and airplane_0 is now at location_1_0. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.

Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
- **Precondition Check**: Package_0 and airplane_0 are both at location_1_0.  
- **Action Execution**: Perform the action "load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0."  
- **Result**: Package_0 is now in airplane_0 and no longer at location_1_0.

### Final Logistics Plan
1. Fly airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.  
2. Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.  
3. Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.  
4. Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.

This plan ensures package_0 is transported from location_1_0 to location_0_0, meeting all restrictions and achieving the goal.
