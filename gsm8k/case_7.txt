### Problem Statement
Albert wants to know how many pizza slices he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices, and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats all of them, how many slices does he eat that day?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total number of pizza slices Albert eats. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total slices from the large pizzas.  
2. Calculate the total slices from the small pizzas.  
3. Sum the slices from both types to find the total.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total slices from the large pizzas. Multiply the number of large pizzas (2) by the number of slices per large pizza (16).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
2 large pizzas × 16 slices per large pizza = 32 slices.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total slices from the small pizzas. Multiply the number of small pizzas (2) by the number of slices per small pizza (8).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
2 small pizzas × 8 slices per small pizza = 16 slices.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the total number of pizza slices Albert eats.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate slices from large pizzas (completed: 32 slices).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate slices from small pizzas (completed: 16 slices).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the slices from both types to find the total (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the slices from large and small pizzas to find the total number of slices.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the total number of slices by adding the slices from large pizzas (32) and small pizzas (16).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
32 slices (large pizzas) + 16 slices (small pizzas) = 48 slices.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking the steps. Ensure the number of pizzas and slices per pizza are correctly multiplied and summed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Large pizzas: 2 × 16 = 32 slices.  
- Small pizzas: 2 × 8 = 16 slices.  
- Total: 32 + 16 = 48 slices.  
The calculations align with the problem statement (2 large pizzas at 16 slices each and 2 small pizzas at 8 slices each). The sum is consistent, confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Albert eats 48 pizza slices in one day.
