### Problem Statement
Tim rides his bike to and from work, a distance of 20 miles each way, for 5 workdays. Additionally, he goes for a 200-mile bike ride on the weekend. If he bikes at a constant speed of 25 miles per hour, how much time does he spend biking in a week?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total biking time.  
1. Calculate the daily biking distance for work (round trip).  
2. Calculate the total biking distance for work over 5 days.  
3. Add the weekend biking distance to get the total weekly distance.  
4. Use the biking speed to compute the total time spent biking.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the daily biking distance for work. This involves determining the round-trip distance to work, which is 20 miles each way.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The round-trip distance to work is 20 miles to work + 20 miles back = 40 miles per day.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total biking distance for work over 5 days. Multiply the daily round-trip distance by the number of workdays.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Daily round-trip distance = 40 miles.  
Total work biking distance = 40 miles/day × 5 days = 200 miles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total weekly biking distance. Add the workweek biking distance to the weekend biking distance.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Workweek biking distance = 200 miles.  
Weekend biking distance = 200 miles.  
Total weekly biking distance = 200 miles + 200 miles = 400 miles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total time spent biking. Use the total weekly distance and the biking speed (25 mph) to calculate the time using the formula: time = distance / speed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total weekly distance = 400 miles.  
Speed = 25 miles per hour.  
Time = 400 miles ÷ 25 miles/hour = 16 hours.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations. Check each step to ensure accuracy in distances and time computation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Daily round-trip: 20 miles + 20 miles = 40 miles. Correct.  
- Workweek distance: 40 miles × 5 days = 200 miles. Correct.  
- Total distance: 200 miles (work) + 200 miles (weekend) = 400 miles. Correct.  
- Time: 400 miles ÷ 25 mph = 16 hours. Correct.  
All calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate total time spent biking in a week.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate daily work biking distance (completed: 40 miles).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate total workweek biking distance (completed: 200 miles).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total weekly biking distance (completed: 400 miles).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute total biking time (completed: 16 hours).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The calculations are complete, and the main goal has been achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Tim spends 16 hours biking in a week.
