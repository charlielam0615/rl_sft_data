### Problem Statement
To make pizza, Kimber needs 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that she needs to make the pizza.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this problem, I will break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the quantities of each ingredient: water, flour, and salt.
2. Calculate the amount of salt in teaspoons based on the given relationship with flour.
3. Ensure all quantities are in consistent units (cups) for the final sum.
4. Compute the combined total of water, flour, and salt in cups.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the quantities of each ingredient and calculate the amount of salt.
How to Achieve: Use the given values for water and flour, and apply the formula for salt (1/2 times the number of cups of flour) to determine the teaspoons of salt.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Water: 10 cups (given).
- Flour: 16 cups (given).
- Salt: Calculate as 1/2 × 16 cups = 8 teaspoons.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
The initial subgoals assumed all quantities need to be in cups, but salt is given in teaspoons. Adjust the plan to:
1. Convert the salt quantity from teaspoons to cups, if necessary, for consistency.
2. Sum the quantities of water, flour, and salt in appropriate units.
3. Re-evaluate if the problem expects salt to remain in teaspoons for the total.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve information about unit consistency and problem intent regarding the combined total of water, flour, and salt.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Current Goal: Determine if salt should be converted to cups or remain in teaspoons for the total.
- From Step 2: Water = 10 cups, Flour = 16 cups, Salt = 8 teaspoons.
- Problem statement asks for the "combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt," which is ambiguous.
- In standard math problems, units are typically consistent (e.g., all in cups), but the phrasing "teaspoons of salt" suggests salt may remain in teaspoons.
- No conversion rate (e.g., teaspoons to cups) is provided, implying the problem may expect salt to be kept in teaspoons for the total.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Based on the review, adjust the plan to:
1. Interpret the problem as requesting the numerical sum of the quantities: 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 8 teaspoons of salt.
2. Compute the combined total as a numerical value, acknowledging the unit inconsistency as per the problem's wording.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the combined total of water, flour, and salt.
How to Achieve: Add the quantities identified—10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 8 teaspoons of salt—following the problem's phrasing.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Water: 10 cups
- Flour: 16 cups
- Salt: 8 teaspoons
- Combined total: 10 + 16 + 8 = 34
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify quantities of each ingredient (Completed: 10 cups water, 16 cups flour, 8 teaspoons salt).
  - Subgoal 2: Address unit consistency for salt (Completed: Decided to keep salt in teaspoons per problem wording).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the combined total (Completed: 10 + 16 + 8 = 34).
Current Goal: Finalize the solution by confirming the interpretation and total.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the interpretation and calculation of the combined total.
How to Achieve: Re-check the problem statement for intent and verify the arithmetic for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Problem statement: "Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt."
- Interpretation: The phrasing suggests adding the numerical values: 10 (cups of water), 16 (cups of flour), and 8 (teaspoons of salt), despite mixed units.
- Arithmetic check: 10 + 16 = 26; 26 + 8 = 34.
- Conclusion: The calculation is correct, and the interpretation aligns with the problem's literal wording.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 34.
