### Problem Statement
Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people, and each wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does Artemis need?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the total ounces of tea needed.  
1. Determine the tea-to-cup ratio based on the given information (mom’s 8-ounce cup uses 1 ounce of tea).  
2. Calculate the total tea needed for one 6-ounce cup using the ratio.  
3. Multiply by the number of people (12) to find the total ounces of tea required.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the tea-to-cup ratio. Use the information that an 8-ounce cup requires 1 ounce of tea to establish the ratio of tea per ounce of cup size.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The ratio of tea to cup size is 1 ounce of tea per 8 ounces of tea (1:8). This means for each ounce of tea, 8 ounces of tea can be made. Equivalently, the amount of tea needed per ounce of cup size is 1/8 ounce.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the amount of tea needed for one 6-ounce cup. Use the ratio from the previous step (1/8 ounce of tea per ounce of cup) to compute the tea required for 6 ounces.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a 6-ounce cup, the amount of tea needed is 6 * (1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 ounce of tea.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total tea needed for 12 people, each wanting a 6-ounce cup. Multiply the tea needed for one 6-ounce cup (3/4 ounce) by the number of people (12).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total tea needed = 12 * (3/4) = (12 * 3) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9 ounces of tea.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation. Verify the ratio and computations by checking the steps and ensuring consistency with the problem’s requirements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Confirm the ratio: 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup implies 1/8 ounce of tea per ounce of cup size.  
- For a 6-ounce cup: 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 ounce, which is correct.  
- For 12 people: 12 * (3/4) = 9 ounces, which is consistent.  
- Alternative check: Total tea volume = 12 * 6 = 72 ounces. Using the ratio, 72 * (1/8) = 72 / 8 = 9 ounces, matching the result.  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total ounces of tea needed for the party.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the tea-to-cup ratio (completed: 1/8 ounce of tea per ounce of cup).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate tea needed for one 6-ounce cup (completed: 3/4 ounce).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total tea for 12 people (completed: 9 ounces).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations confirmed).  
**Current Goal**: No further calculations are needed as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea for the party.
