### Problem Statement
The profit from a business transaction is shared among two business partners, Mike and Johnson, in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson received $2500, determine how much Mike will have after spending $200 on a shirt.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for Mike’s final amount:
1. Determine the ratio of profit shares between Mike and Johnson.
2. Use Johnson’s share ($2500) to find the total profit.
3. Calculate Mike’s share based on the total profit.
4. Subtract the cost of the shirt ($200) from Mike’s share to find his remaining amount.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total profit using Johnson’s share and the given ratio. This will be achieved by setting up a proportion based on the ratio 2:5, where Johnson’s share corresponds to 5 parts, and solving for the total profit.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the total profit be \( P \). The ratio of Mike’s share to Johnson’s share is 2:5, so Johnson’s share is \( \frac{5}{2+5} = \frac{5}{7} \) of the total profit. Given Johnson’s share is $2500:
\[
\frac{5}{7}P = 2500
\]
Solving for \( P \):
\[
P = 2500 \times \frac{7}{5} = 2500 \times 1.4 = 3500
\]
The total profit is $3500.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Mike’s share of the profit using the total profit and the given ratio. This will be achieved by applying the ratio 2:5, where Mike’s share corresponds to 2 parts of the total profit.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Mike’s share is \( \frac{2}{2+5} = \frac{2}{7} \) of the total profit. With the total profit \( P = 3500 \):
\[
\text{Mike’s share} = \frac{2}{7} \times 3500 = 2 \times 500 = 1000
\]
Mike’s share is $1000.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find Mike’s remaining amount after spending $200 on a shirt. This will be achieved by subtracting the cost of the shirt from Mike’s share.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Mike’s share is $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800
\]
Mike’s remaining amount is $800.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by checking the consistency of the ratio and the final amounts. This will be achieved by verifying that the shares align with the 2:5 ratio and that the total profit is consistent.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Johnson’s share is $2500, and Mike’s share is $1000. The ratio of their shares is:
\[
1000 : 2500 = 1 : 2.5 = 2 : 5
\]
This matches the given ratio. The total profit is:
\[
1000 + 2500 = 3500
\]
This is consistent with the calculated total profit. After Mike spends $200, his remaining amount is $800, which is a straightforward subtraction. The calculations are valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Determine Mike’s remaining amount after spending $200.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total profit using Johnson’s share ($2500) and the ratio 2:5 (Completed: Total profit = $3500).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Mike’s share based on the total profit (Completed: Mike’s share = $1000).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the cost of the shirt ($200) from Mike’s share (Completed: Remaining amount = $800).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (Completed: Ratio and totals are consistent).
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Mike will have $800 after spending $200 on a shirt.
