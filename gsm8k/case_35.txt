### Problem Statement
Mr. Sam shared a certain amount of money between his two sons, Ken and Tony. Ken received $1750, and Tony received twice as much as Ken. Determine the total amount of money shared.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the amount of money Tony received based on Ken’s amount.  
2. Calculate the total amount of money shared by summing Ken’s and Tony’s amounts.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the amount of money Tony received.  
How to Achieve: Since Tony received twice as much as Ken, and Ken’s amount is given as $1750, multiply Ken’s amount by 2 to find Tony’s amount.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Tony’s amount = 2 × Ken’s amount = 2 × $1750 = $3500.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total amount of money shared.  
How to Achieve: Add Ken’s amount ($1750) and Tony’s amount ($3500) to find the total.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total amount = Ken’s amount + Tony’s amount = $1750 + $3500 = $5250.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the total amount of money shared.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the amount of money Tony received (completed: $3500).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total amount by summing Ken’s and Tony’s amounts (completed: $5250).  
Current Goal: The main goal is completed, as the total amount has been calculated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the total amount calculated.  
How to Achieve: Check the calculations by ensuring Tony’s amount is twice Ken’s and that the sum matches the total.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verification:  
- Ken’s amount = $1750.  
- Tony’s amount = 2 × $1750 = $3500 (correct).  
- Total = $1750 + $3500 = $5250 (correct).  
Additionally, confirm the problem’s logic: Tony’s amount ($3500) is indeed twice Ken’s ($1750), and their sum is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money shared by Mr. Sam between his two sons is $5250.
