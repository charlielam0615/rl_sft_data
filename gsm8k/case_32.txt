### Problem Statement
Noah is a painter who sells large paintings for $60 each and small paintings for $30 each. Last month, he sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much are his sales for this month?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for this month's sales.  
1. Calculate last month's sales based on the number of paintings sold and their prices.  
2. Determine the number of paintings sold this month by doubling last month's quantities.  
3. Calculate this month's sales using the doubled quantities and the given prices.  
4. Validate the calculations to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate last month's sales. This will be achieved by multiplying the number of large and small paintings sold last month by their respective prices and summing the results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Last month, Noah sold 8 large paintings at $60 each and 4 small paintings at $30 each.  
- Sales from large paintings: 8 × $60 = $480  
- Sales from small paintings: 4 × $30 = $120  
- Total sales last month: $480 + $120 = $600  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of paintings sold this month by doubling the quantities sold last month. This will be achieved by multiplying the number of large and small paintings by 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
This month, Noah sold twice as many paintings as last month.  
- Last month: 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings.  
- This month:  
  - Large paintings: 8 × 2 = 16  
  - Small paintings: 4 × 2 = 8  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate this month's sales. This will be achieved by multiplying the number of large and small paintings sold this month by their respective prices and summing the results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
This month, Noah sold 16 large paintings at $60 each and 8 small paintings at $30 each.  
- Sales from large paintings: 16 × $60 = $960  
- Sales from small paintings: 8 × $30 = $240  
- Total sales this month: $960 + $240 = $1200  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations for this month's sales. This will be achieved by checking the arithmetic steps and ensuring the interpretation of "twice as much" is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the calculations:  
- Last month's sales: (8 × $60) + (4 × $30) = $480 + $120 = $600.  
- This month's quantities: 8 × 2 = 16 large, 4 × 2 = 8 small.  
- This month's sales: (16 × $60) + (8 × $30) = $960 + $240 = $1200.  
The phrase "twice as much" is interpreted as doubling the number of paintings sold. The arithmetic is correct, and the steps align with the problem's requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate this month's sales.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate last month's sales ($600).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine this month's quantities (16 large, 8 small).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate this month's sales ($1200).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate calculations (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Review the hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are addressed.  
All subgoals have been completed, and the calculations are consistent. The final answer for this month's sales is $1200.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
This month's sales are $1200.
