### Problem Statement
Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned $60 from washing cars all week. Half of the $60 was earned by Lisa. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. How much more money did Lisa earn than Tommy?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine Lisa’s earnings based on the information that she earned half of the $60.
2. Calculate Tommy’s earnings, given that he earned half of what Lisa earned.
3. Find the difference between Lisa’s and Tommy’s earnings to determine how much more Lisa earned than Tommy.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate Lisa’s earnings.
How to Achieve: The problem states that Lisa earned half of the total $60. Compute half of $60 to find her earnings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Lisa’s earnings = (1/2) × $60 = $30.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate Tommy’s earnings.
How to Achieve: The problem states that Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. Using Lisa’s earnings from Step 2, compute half of that amount.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Lisa’s earnings = $30 (from Step 2).
Tommy’s earnings = (1/2) × $30 = $15.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy.
How to Achieve: Subtract Tommy’s earnings from Lisa’s earnings using the values calculated in Steps 2 and 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Lisa’s earnings = $30.
Tommy’s earnings = $15.
Difference = $30 - $15 = $15.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Lisa’s earnings (completed: $30).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Tommy’s earnings (completed: $15).
  - Subgoal 3: Find the difference between Lisa’s and Tommy’s earnings (completed: $15).
Current Goal: Completed (difference calculated).
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recheck the calculations for Lisa’s and Tommy’s earnings and the difference. Confirm that Lisa’s earnings are half of $60, Tommy’s earnings are half of Lisa’s, and the difference is computed correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total earnings = $60. Lisa’s earnings = (1/2) × $60 = $30 (correct).
- Tommy’s earnings = (1/2) × $30 = $15 (correct).
- Difference = $30 - $15 = $15 (correct).
- Additional check: Total earnings include Lisa ($30), Tommy ($15), and Jack’s earnings. Jack’s earnings = $60 - $30 - $15 = $15. Total = $30 + $15 + $15 = $60 (matches the problem’s total).
The calculations are consistent and correct.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.
