### Problem Statement
Five friends order food at a fast-food chain: 5 hamburgers at $3 each, 4 sets of French fries at $1.20 each, 5 cups of soda at $0.5 each, and 1 platter of spaghetti at $2.7. They plan to split the bill equally. Determine how much each friend will pay.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Calculate the total cost of each type of food item (hamburgers, French fries, soda, spaghetti).
2. Sum these costs to find the total bill.
3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends (5) to find each person's share.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total cost of each type of food item.
Description: Multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost to find the cost per item type.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Hamburgers: 5 pieces × $3 = $15
- French fries: 4 sets × $1.20 = $4.80
- Soda: 5 cups × $0.5 = $2.50
- Spaghetti: 1 platter × $2.7 = $2.70
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the costs to find the total bill.
Description: Add the individual costs of hamburgers, French fries, soda, and spaghetti to get the total amount.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total bill = $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Divide the total bill by the number of friends to find each person's share.
Description: Divide the total bill ($25) by 5 to calculate the cost per person.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Cost per person = $25 ÷ 5 = $5
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how much each friend pays.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total cost of each type of food item (completed: $15 for hamburgers, $4.80 for fries, $2.50 for soda, $2.70 for spaghetti).
  - Subgoal 2: Sum these costs to find the total bill (completed: $25).
  - Subgoal 3: Divide the total bill by the number of friends (completed: $5 per person).
Current Goal: Completed all subgoals; main goal achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure accuracy.
Description: Recheck the item costs, total bill, and division to confirm the solution.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Recalculate item costs:
  - Hamburgers: 5 × $3 = $15
  - Fries: 4 × $1.20 = $4.80
  - Soda: 5 × $0.5 = $2.50
  - Spaghetti: 1 × $2.7 = $2.70
- Total bill: $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25
- Per person: $25 ÷ 5 = $5
All calculations are consistent with previous results.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Each friend will pay $5.
