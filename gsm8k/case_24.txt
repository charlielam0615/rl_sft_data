### Problem Statement
Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75, she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. Determine the cost of each top.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the cost of each top, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the total cost of the shorts.
2. Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
3. Subtract the costs of shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops.
4. Divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost per top.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total cost of the shorts.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of shorts (5) by the cost per short ($7).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total cost of shorts = 5 × $7 = $35.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of pairs of shoes (2) by the cost per pair ($10).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total cost of shoes = 2 × $10 = $20.
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the cost of each top.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total cost of the shorts (Completed: $35).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total cost of the shoes (Completed: $20).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the costs of shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops.
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost per top.
Current Goal: Subtract the costs of shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Subtract the costs of shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops.
How to Achieve: Subtract the total cost of shorts ($35) and shoes ($20) from the total amount spent ($75).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total cost of tops = $75 - $35 - $20 = $20.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost per top.
How to Achieve: Divide the total cost of the tops ($20) by the number of tops (4).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Cost per top = $20 ÷ 4 = $5.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if all costs sum to the total amount spent.
How to Achieve: Add the total costs of shorts ($35), shoes ($20), and tops (4 × $5 = $20) and confirm they equal $75.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total cost = $35 (shorts) + $20 (shoes) + $20 (tops) = $75.
The sum matches the total amount spent, confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the costs of shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops (Completed: $20).
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost per top (Completed: $5).
Current Goal: All subgoals completed, solution validated.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The cost of each top is $5.
