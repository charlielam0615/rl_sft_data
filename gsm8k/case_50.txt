### Problem Statement
On a school trip to the seashore, Alan and his friends collected shells. Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. Ben got a late start and only collected a third of what Laurie did. If Laurie collected 36 shells, how many shells did Alan collect?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of shells Ben collected based on Laurie’s collection.  
2. Calculate the number of shells Alan collected using Ben’s amount.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of shells Ben collected. Since Ben collected a third of what Laurie did, and Laurie collected 36 shells, compute Ben’s shells as one-third of 36.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Ben’s shells = Laurie’s shells ÷ 3 = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 shells.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of shells Alan collected. Since Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben, and Ben collected 12 shells, compute Alan’s shells as four times 12.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Alan’s shells = 4 × Ben’s shells = 4 × 12 = 48 shells.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations. Check if Ben’s shells (12) are one-third of Laurie’s (36) and if Alan’s shells (48) are four times Ben’s (12).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Check Ben: 36 ÷ 3 = 12, which matches Ben’s 12 shells.  
- Check Alan: 4 × 12 = 48, which matches Alan’s 48 shells.  
The calculations are consistent with the problem’s conditions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the number of shells Alan collected.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Ben’s shells (completed: 12 shells).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Alan’s shells (completed: 48 shells).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate calculations (completed: calculations verified).  
**Current Goal**: No further calculations are needed as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Alan collected 48 shells.
