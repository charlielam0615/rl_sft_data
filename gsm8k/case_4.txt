### Problem Statement
Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she read 12 pages, and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the number of pages Julie read today.
2. Determine the total number of pages read so far.
3. Find the number of pages remaining in the book.
4. Calculate half of the remaining pages to find the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of pages Julie read today.
How to Achieve: Since Julie read 12 pages yesterday and today she read twice as many pages as yesterday, multiply 12 by 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pages read today = 12 × 2 = 24 pages.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total number of pages read so far.
How to Achieve: Add the pages read yesterday (12) to the pages read today (24).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total pages read = 12 + 24 = 36 pages.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the number of pages remaining in the book.
How to Achieve: Subtract the total pages read (36) from the total number of pages in the book (120).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Remaining pages = 120 - 36 = 84 pages.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate half of the remaining pages to find the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow.
How to Achieve: Divide the remaining pages (84) by 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pages to read tomorrow = 84 ÷ 2 = 42 pages.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate pages read today (completed: 24 pages).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine total pages read so far (completed: 36 pages).
  - Subgoal 3: Find remaining pages (completed: 84 pages).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate half of remaining pages (completed: 42 pages).
Current Goal: Completed (calculate pages to read tomorrow).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recompute each step and verify the logic: confirm pages read today, total pages read, remaining pages, and half of the remaining pages.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Pages read yesterday: 12 (given).
- Pages read today: 12 × 2 = 24 (correct).
- Total pages read: 12 + 24 = 36 (correct).
- Remaining pages: 120 - 36 = 84 (correct).
- Pages to read tomorrow: 84 ÷ 2 = 42 (correct).
The calculations are consistent and align with the problem statement.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.
