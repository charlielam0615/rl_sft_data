### Problem Statement
Rachel and Sara want to attend a beauty and modeling contest. They both want to buy new pairs of shoes and dresses. Sara buys a pair of shoes that costs $50 and a dress that costs $200. How much should Rachel budget if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine Rachel's budget. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total amount Sara spent on her shoes and dress.  
2. Determine Rachel's budget by doubling Sara's total spending.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total amount Sara spent on her shoes and dress. This will be achieved by adding the cost of Sara's shoes ($50) and dress ($200).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find Sara's total spending, add the cost of her shoes and dress:  
$50 + $200 = $250.  
Sara spent a total of $250.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine Rachel's budget for shoes and dress.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total amount Sara spent (completed: $250).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine Rachel's budget by doubling Sara's total spending (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Determine Rachel's budget by doubling Sara's total spending.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine Rachel's budget by doubling Sara's total spending. This will be achieved by multiplying Sara's total spending ($250) by 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find Rachel's budget, double Sara's total spending:  
$250 × 2 = $500.  
Rachel should budget $500.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of Rachel's budget. This will be achieved by checking the steps: ensuring Sara’s total is correct and that Rachel’s budget is indeed twice that amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify Sara’s total: $50 (shoes) + $200 (dress) = $250. Correct.  
Verify Rachel’s budget: $250 × 2 = $500. Correct.  
The calculations are consistent and align with the problem statement.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine Rachel's budget for shoes and dress (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total amount Sara spent (completed: $250).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine Rachel's budget by doubling Sara's total spending (completed: $500).  
**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; validate final answer.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Rachel should budget $500 to spend twice as much as Sara on the pair of shoes and dress.
