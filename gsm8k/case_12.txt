### Problem Statement
Tobias wants to buy a pair of shoes costing $95. He has saved money over three months from a $5 monthly allowance and earnings from mowing lawns ($15 per lawn) and shoveling driveways ($7 per driveway). After buying the shoes, he has $15 left. Given that he mowed 4 lawns, we need to determine how many driveways he shoveled.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the number of driveways shoveled. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate Tobias’s total savings before buying the shoes.  
2. Compute the total allowance over three months.  
3. Compute earnings from mowing 4 lawns.  
4. Set up an equation to find the number of driveways shoveled based on total savings, allowance, lawn-mowing earnings, and money left after the purchase.  
5. Solve for the number of driveways.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate Tobias’s total savings before buying the shoes. Since he has $15 left after spending $95, add these amounts to find total savings.  

[IMP]  
Total savings before buying the shoes = cost of shoes + money left = $95 + $15 = $110.  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the total allowance over three months. Tobias gets $5 per month for three months, so multiply the monthly allowance by the number of months.  

[IMP]  
Total allowance = $5/month × 3 months = $15.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute earnings from mowing 4 lawns. Tobias charges $15 per lawn, so multiply the number of lawns by the rate per lawn.  

[IMP]  
Earnings from mowing lawns = 4 lawns × $15/lawn = $60.  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of driveways Tobias shoveled.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total savings before buying the shoes (completed: $110).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute total allowance over three months (completed: $15).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute earnings from mowing 4 lawns (completed: $60).  
  - Subgoal 4: Set up an equation to find the number of driveways shoveled.  
  - Subgoal 5: Solve for the number of driveways.  
**Current Goal**: Set up an equation to find the number of driveways shoveled.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to set up an equation for the number of driveways shoveled. Total savings ($110) equals the sum of allowance ($15), lawn-mowing earnings ($60), and driveway-shoveling earnings ($7 per driveway). Let \( x \) be the number of driveways shoveled, and set up the equation: allowance + lawn earnings + driveway earnings = total savings.  

[IMP]  
Equation: $15 + $60 + $7x = $110.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve the equation for the number of driveways shoveled. Simplify the equation $15 + $60 + $7x = $110 and solve for \( x \).  

[IMP]  
Simplify: $75 + $7x = $110.  
Subtract $75: $7x = $35.  
Divide by $7: x = 5.  
So, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.  

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution. Check if 5 driveways, along with other earnings, result in $110 in total savings, leaving $15 after spending $95.  

[IMP]  
Total earnings:  
- Allowance: $15.  
- Mowing 4 lawns: 4 × $15 = $60.  
- Shoveling 5 driveways: 5 × $7 = $35.  
Total savings = $15 + $60 + $35 = $110.  
After buying shoes ($95), money left = $110 - $95 = $15, which matches the problem.  
The solution is valid.

### Final Answer
Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.
