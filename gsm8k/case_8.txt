### Problem Statement
Ken created a care package for his brother by placing a box on a scale and adding items sequentially. Initially, he poured enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to triple the weight. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight again. Determine the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this problem, break it into intermediate subgoals based on the sequence of actions described:
1. Determine the weight after adding jelly beans to reach 2 pounds.
2. Calculate the weight after adding brownies to triple the previous weight.
3. Compute the weight after adding 2 more pounds of jelly beans.
4. Find the final weight after adding gummy worms to double the weight.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the weight after adding jelly beans to reach 2 pounds.
How to Achieve: The problem states that Ken poured enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds, which includes the box’s weight. Let the box’s weight be \( x \) pounds. After adding jelly beans, the total weight (box + jelly beans) is 2 pounds. Thus, set up the equation: \( x + \text{jelly beans} = 2 \).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Assume the weight of the jelly beans is \( j_1 \). The total weight is given as:
\[ x + j_1 = 2 \]
So, the weight after this step is 2 pounds. The exact weights of the box and jelly beans are not specified separately, so we proceed with the total weight of 2 pounds for now.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the weight after adding brownies to triple the previous weight.
How to Achieve: The previous weight (box + jelly beans) is 2 pounds. Adding brownies triples this weight. Multiply the previous weight by 3 to find the new total weight.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The weight after the first step is 2 pounds. Tripling this weight:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]
So, after adding brownies, the total weight (box + jelly beans + brownies) is 6 pounds.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the weight after adding 2 more pounds of jelly beans.
How to Achieve: The current weight is 6 pounds. Adding 2 pounds of jelly beans increases the weight by 2 pounds. Add 2 to the previous weight.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The weight after the previous step is 6 pounds. Adding 2 pounds of jelly beans:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
So, the total weight (box + jelly beans + brownies + additional jelly beans) is 8 pounds.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the final weight after adding gummy worms to double the weight.
How to Achieve: The current weight is 8 pounds. Adding gummy worms doubles this weight. Multiply the previous weight by 2 to find the final weight.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The weight after the previous step is 8 pounds. Doubling this weight:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]
So, the final weight of the box of goodies (box + jelly beans + brownies + additional jelly beans + gummy worms) is 16 pounds.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the final weight of the care package.
  - Subgoal 1: Weight after adding jelly beans = 2 pounds.
  - Subgoal 2: Weight after adding brownies = triple the previous weight (6 pounds).
  - Subgoal 3: Weight after adding 2 more pounds of jelly beans = 8 pounds.
  - Subgoal 4: Final weight after adding gummy worms = double the previous weight (16 pounds).
Current Goal: The final weight has been calculated as 16 pounds.
The goals reflect the sequential steps taken, and all subgoals have been addressed.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure the final weight is correct.
How to Achieve: Recompute each step to confirm the sequence of operations and check for consistency in the calculations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let’s verify:
1. After jelly beans: Total weight = 2 pounds.
2. After brownies: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds.
3. After additional jelly beans: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) pounds.
4. After gummy worms: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) pounds.
The calculations are consistent. To further validate, consider the box’s weight. If the box has weight \( x \), then:
- Step 1: \( x + j_1 = 2 \).
- Step 2: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).
- Step 3: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \).
- Step 4: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).
The box’s weight \( x \) does not affect the operations (tripling, adding 2, doubling), as they apply to the total weight at each step. The final weight of 16 pounds holds regardless of \( x \), assuming \( x \geq 0 \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.
