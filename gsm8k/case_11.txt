### Problem Statement
A deep-sea monster rises every hundred years to consume a ship, eating 847 people over three hundred years. Each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one. Determine the number of people on the ship consumed in the first hundred years.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define the number of people on the first ship as a variable.
2. Express the number of people on subsequent ships based on the doubling pattern.
3. Set up an equation for the total number of people consumed over three ships.
4. Solve the equation to find the number of people on the first ship.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the number of people on the first ship and express the number of people on subsequent ships.
How to Achieve: Let the number of people on the first ship (first hundred years) be \( x \). Since each ship has twice as many people as the previous one, the second ship (second hundred years) has \( 2x \) people, and the third ship (third hundred years) has \( 4x \) people.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Assign \( x \) as the number of people on the first ship. The second ship has \( 2x \) people, and the third ship has \( 4x \) people, reflecting the doubling pattern over the three hundred years.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up an equation for the total number of people consumed.
How to Achieve: Sum the number of people on the three ships (\( x + 2x + 4x \)) and set it equal to 847, the total number of people consumed.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total number of people consumed is:
\[ x + 2x + 4x = 847 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ 7x = 847 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find the number of people on the first ship.
How to Achieve: Solve \( 7x = 847 \) for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[ 7x = 847 \]
\[ x = \frac{847}{7} = 121 \]
So, the number of people on the first ship is 121.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the total number of people matches 847.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 121 \) into the expressions for the three ships and sum them.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
First ship: \( x = 121 \)
Second ship: \( 2x = 2 \times 121 = 242 \)
Third ship: \( 4x = 4 \times 121 = 484 \)
Total: \( 121 + 242 + 484 = 847 \)
The sum matches the given total, confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the number of people on the first ship.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the number of people on the first ship as \( x \).
  - Subgoal 2: Express the number of people on subsequent ships (\( 2x \), \( 4x \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve the equation \( x + 2x + 4x = 847 \).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution by checking the total.
Current Goal: Completed (solution verified).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The number of people on the ship consumed in the first hundred years is 121.
