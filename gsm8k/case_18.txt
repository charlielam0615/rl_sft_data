### Problem Statement
In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Calculate the total number of hard hats that remain in the truck.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the initial number of each type of hard hat.
2. Calculate the number of hard hats Carl removes.
3. Calculate the number of hard hats John removes, including both pink and green hats.
4. Subtract the total number of hard hats removed from the initial total to find the remaining number.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the initial number of each type of hard hat and the total.
How to Achieve: Use the given quantities of each type of hard hat (pink, green, yellow) and sum them to find the total number of hard hats initially in the truck.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The problem states there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats.
Initial total = 26 (pink) + 15 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 65 hard hats.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of hard hats Carl removes.
How to Achieve: Identify the number of pink hard hats Carl takes away as provided in the problem.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of hard hats John removes, including both pink and green hats.
How to Achieve: Use the problem’s description to determine the number of pink hard hats John removes and calculate the number of green hard hats based on the given condition (twice as many green as pink he removed).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
John takes away 6 pink hard hats.
The number of green hard hats John removes is twice the number of pink hard hats he removes: 2 × 6 = 12 green hard hats.
Total hard hats removed by John = 6 (pink) + 12 (green) = 18 hard hats.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of hard hats that remain in the truck.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the initial number of hard hats (completed: 65 total).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of hard hats Carl removes (completed: 4 pink).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of hard hats John removes (completed: 6 pink, 12 green, total 18).
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract the total number of hard hats removed from the initial total (pending).
Current Goal: Subtract the total number of hard hats removed from the initial total to find the remaining number.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Subtract the total number of hard hats removed from the initial total to find the remaining number.
How to Achieve: Sum the hard hats removed by Carl and John, then subtract from the initial total calculated in Step 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total hard hats removed = Carl’s removal + John’s removal = 4 (pink) + 18 (6 pink + 12 green) = 22 hard hats.
Remaining hard hats = Initial total − Total removed = 65 − 22 = 43 hard hats.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure the solution is correct.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each step to confirm the number of hard hats removed and the final total, checking for consistency with the problem’s conditions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Initial: 26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow = 65 hard hats.
- Carl removes 4 pink hats.
- John removes 6 pink hats and 2 × 6 = 12 green hats, so 6 + 12 = 18 hats.
- Total removed: 4 + 18 = 22 hats.
- Remaining: 65 − 22 = 43 hats.
The calculations are consistent, and the conditions (John removing twice as many green hats as pink hats) are satisfied.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of hard hats that remain in the truck (completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the initial number of hard hats (completed: 65 total).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of hard hats Carl removes (completed: 4 pink).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of hard hats John removes (completed: 6 pink, 12 green, total 18).
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract the total number of hard hats removed from the initial total (completed: 43 hats).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the calculations (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution has been validated.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The total number of hard hats that remain in the truck is 43.
