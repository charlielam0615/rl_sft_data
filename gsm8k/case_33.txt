### Problem Statement
A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns and must navigate a ring that requires 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a certain distance, and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. The total distance driven around the ring is 23 meters. Determine the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the total distance traveled around the ring (given as 23 meters).
2. Sum the known distances after the 1st and 2nd turns (5 meters and 8 meters).
3. Subtract these from the total distance to find the distance after the 3rd turn.
4. Verify the interpretation of "at the 4th turn, it immediately exits" to ensure no additional distance is added after the 4th turn.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the known distances after the 1st and 2nd turns.
How to Achieve: Add the distances given for the 1st turn (5 meters) and the 2nd turn (8 meters).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Add the distances: 5 meters (after 1st turn) + 8 meters (after 2nd turn) = 13 meters.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the distance traveled after the 3rd turn.
How to Achieve: Subtract the sum of the distances after the 1st and 2nd turns (13 meters) from the total distance around the ring (23 meters).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Calculate the distance after the 3rd turn: 23 meters (total) - 13 meters (after 1st and 2nd turns) = 10 meters.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the interpretation that no distance is traveled after the 4th turn.
How to Achieve: Analyze the problem statement, which says "at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel," implying no additional distance is traveled after the 3rd turn to the exit.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The statement "at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel" suggests that the 4th turn marks the exit point, and no further distance is traveled after the 3rd turn’s distance. Thus, the total distance of 23 meters includes only the distances after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd turns (5 + 8 + 10 = 23 meters), which is consistent with the calculation.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the distance traveled after the 3rd turn.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify total distance (23 meters).
  - Subgoal 2: Sum distances after 1st and 2nd turns (5 + 8 = 13 meters).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate distance after 3rd turn (23 - 13 = 10 meters).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify no additional distance after 4th turn (confirmed).
Current Goal: Completed—distance after 3rd turn is 10 meters.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn is 10 meters.
