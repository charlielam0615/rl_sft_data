### Problem Statement
Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the total number of clips sold.  
1. Determine the number of clips sold in April.  
2. Calculate the number of clips sold in May based on the April sales.  
3. Sum the clips sold in April and May to find the total.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of clips sold in April. The problem states that Natalia sold clips to 48 friends in April, which directly provides the number of clips sold.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Natalia sold 48 clips in April, as given in the problem statement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of clips sold in May, which is half as many as those sold in April. Using the result from Step 2, compute half of 48.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
In April, Natalia sold 48 clips. Since she sold half as many in May:  
Clips sold in May = 48 ÷ 2 = 24 clips.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the total number of clips sold in April and May. Add the clips sold in April (from Step 2) and May (from Step 3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Clips sold in April = 48  
Clips sold in May = 24  
Total clips sold = 48 + 24 = 72 clips.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of clips sold in April (completed: 48 clips).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of clips sold in May (completed: 24 clips).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the clips sold in April and May (completed: 72 clips).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the total number of clips sold, which has been calculated as 72 clips.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of the total number of clips sold. Recheck the steps: verify the number of clips sold in April, confirm the May calculation as half of April’s sales, and ensure the addition is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Step 2: The problem states 48 clips were sold in April, which is directly provided.  
- Step 3: Clips sold in May = 48 ÷ 2 = 24, which is half of 48.  
- Step 4: Total = 48 + 24 = 72.  
Recalculation confirms: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips. The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.
