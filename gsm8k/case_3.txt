### Problem Statement
Betty is saving money for a new wallet that costs $100. She currently has half of the money needed. Her parents give her $15 for this purpose, and her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents. Determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
1. Determine how much money Betty currently has (half of $100).  
2. Calculate the contributions from her parents and grandparents.  
3. Sum Betty’s current savings and the contributions to find her total money.  
4. Subtract the total money from the wallet’s cost to find how much more she needs.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine how much money Betty currently has. Since she has half of the money needed for a $100 wallet, calculate half of $100.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Betty needs $100 for the wallet, and she has half of this amount.  
Half of $100 is $100 ÷ 2 = $50.  
Therefore, Betty currently has $50.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the contributions from Betty’s parents and grandparents. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents. Compute these amounts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Parents’ contribution: $15.  
Grandparents’ contribution: Twice the parents’ contribution = 2 × $15 = $30.  
Total contributions: $15 + $30 = $45.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal based on previous planning and implementation steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine Betty’s current savings (completed: $50).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate contributions from parents and grandparents (completed: $15 + $30 = $45).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum Betty’s savings and contributions to find her total money.  
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract the total money from the wallet’s cost to find the remaining amount needed.  
**Current Goal**: Sum Betty’s savings and contributions to find her total money.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum Betty’s current savings and the contributions to find her total money. Add her savings ($50) to the contributions ($45).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Betty’s savings: $50.  
Contributions from parents and grandparents: $45.  
Total money: $50 + $45 = $95.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine how much more money Betty needs. Subtract her total money ($95) from the wallet’s cost ($100).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Wallet cost: $100.  
Betty’s total money: $95.  
Money needed: $100 − $95 = $5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations to ensure correctness. Recheck each step’s computations and logic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Betty’s savings: Half of $100 = $50. Correct.  
- Parents’ contribution: $15 (given). Correct.  
- Grandparents’ contribution: 2 × $15 = $30. Correct.  
- Total contributions: $15 + $30 = $45. Correct.  
- Total money: $50 + $45 = $95. Correct.  
- Money needed: $100 − $95 = $5. Correct.  
The calculations are consistent and align with the problem’s requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the final hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals are completed and the main goal is achieved.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine Betty’s current savings (completed: $50).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate contributions from parents and grandparents (completed: $45).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum Betty’s savings and contributions (completed: $95).  
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract total money from wallet’s cost (completed: $5).  
**Current Goal**: None; all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.
