### Problem Statement
Anna goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision where she gets 14 pieces of candy per house, and there are 60 houses. Her brother Billy goes trick-or-treating in a neighboring subdivision where he gets 11 pieces of candy per house, and there are 75 houses. Determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the total candy Anna collects from her subdivision.
2. Calculate the total candy Billy collects from his subdivision.
3. Find the difference between Anna’s and Billy’s candy totals to determine how many more pieces Anna gets.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total candy Anna collects.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of houses in Anna’s subdivision (60) by the candy per house (14).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total candy for Anna = 60 houses × 14 pieces per house = 840 pieces.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total candy Billy collects.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of houses in Billy’s subdivision (75) by the candy per house (11).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total candy for Billy = 75 houses × 11 pieces per house = 825 pieces.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the difference between Anna’s and Billy’s candy totals.
How to Achieve: Subtract Billy’s total candy (825) from Anna’s total candy (840).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Difference = 840 pieces (Anna) - 825 pieces (Billy) = 15 pieces.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recheck the multiplication for Anna’s and Billy’s totals and confirm the subtraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Anna: 60 × 14 = 840 (correct).
- Billy: 75 × 11 = 825 (75 × 10 = 750, 75 × 1 = 75, 750 + 75 = 825, correct).
- Difference: 840 - 825 = 15 (correct).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Anna’s total candy (completed: 840 pieces).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Billy’s total candy (completed: 825 pieces).
  - Subgoal 3: Find the difference between Anna’s and Billy’s candy totals (completed: 15 pieces).
Current Goal: All subgoals completed; confirm the final answer.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.
