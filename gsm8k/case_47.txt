### Problem Statement
Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day and the violin for three times as long. If she practices six days a week, how many minutes does she spend practicing in a month with four weeks?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the total practice time in a month:  
1. Calculate the daily practice time for the piano.  
2. Calculate the daily practice time for the violin.  
3. Compute the total daily practice time.  
4. Determine the weekly practice time.  
5. Calculate the total practice time for a month with four weeks.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the daily practice time for the piano. According to the problem, Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes each day. This information is directly provided, so no further computation is needed for this step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carolyn’s daily piano practice time is 20 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the daily practice time for the violin. The problem states that violin practice is three times as long as piano practice. Using the piano practice time (20 minutes), multiply by 3 to find the violin practice time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Violin practice time = 20 minutes × 3 = 60 minutes per day.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total daily practice time. Add the daily practice times for the piano (20 minutes) and the violin (60 minutes) to get the total daily practice time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total daily practice time = 20 minutes (piano) + 60 minutes (violin) = 80 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the weekly practice time. Since Carolyn practices 6 days a week, multiply the total daily practice time (80 minutes) by 6 to find the weekly practice time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Weekly practice time = 80 minutes/day × 6 days = 480 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total practice time for a month with four weeks. Multiply the weekly practice time (480 minutes) by 4 to find the monthly practice time.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Monthly practice time = 480 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 1920 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate total practice time in a month with four weeks.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate daily piano practice time (completed: 20 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate daily violin practice time (completed: 60 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute total daily practice time (completed: 80 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine weekly practice time (completed: 480 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate monthly practice time (completed: 1920 minutes).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the completion of all subgoals to ensure the main goal is achieved. All subgoals have been completed, and the final result is 1920 minutes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated monthly practice time. Recalculate the total practice time using an alternative approach to confirm correctness: compute the total weekly practice for both instruments separately, then multiply by 4 weeks.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Piano: 20 minutes/day × 6 days = 120 minutes/week.  
- Violin: 60 minutes/day × 6 days = 360 minutes/week.  
- Total weekly practice = 120 + 360 = 480 minutes/week.  
- Monthly practice = 480 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 1920 minutes.  
This matches the previous result, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Carolyn spends 1920 minutes practicing in a month with four weeks.
