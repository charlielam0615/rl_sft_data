### Problem Statement
Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. After a $600 salary increase, her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of her new monthly income. Determine her previous monthly income.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for the previous monthly income.  
1. Define variables for the previous and new monthly incomes.  
2. Set up equations based on the given percentages and the salary increase.  
3. Solve the equations to find the previous monthly income.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem's conditions. Let \( x \) represent Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. The new income is \( x + 600 \). The rent and utilities, which remain constant, are 40% of the previous income and 25% of the new income. Create equations to express this relationship and prepare to solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.  
- Previous rent and utilities: \( 0.4x \).  
- New monthly income: \( x + 600 \).  
- New rent and utilities: \( 0.25(x + 600) \).  
Since the rent and utilities amount remains the same:  
\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \) for \( x \), the previous monthly income. Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \]  
Distribute:  
\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 \]  
Subtract \( 0.25x \) from both sides:  
\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = 150 \]  
\[ 0.15x = 150 \]  
Divide by 0.15:  
\[ x = \frac{150}{0.15} = 1000 \]  
So, the previous monthly income is $1000.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 1000 \) by checking if it satisfies the problem's conditions. Substitute \( x = 1000 \) into the original equation and verify that the rent and utilities amount is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check:  
- Previous income: \( x = 1000 \).  
- Rent and utilities: \( 0.4 \times 1000 = 400 \).  
- New income: \( 1000 + 600 = 1600 \).  
- Rent and utilities as 25% of new income: \( 0.25 \times 1600 = 400 \).  
Since \( 0.4x = 400 \) and \( 0.25(x + 600) = 400 \), the solution is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Determine Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation for the previous income (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are completed and the main goal is achieved.  
All subgoals are completed, and the previous monthly income is calculated as $1000, with validation confirming correctness.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.
