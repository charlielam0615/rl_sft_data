### Problem Statement
Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 4 pieces. Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas, while Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas. Determine how many pizza pieces are left uneaten.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Calculate the total number of pizza pieces from all four pizzas.  
2. Determine how many pieces each person eats based on the percentage of their pizza consumed.  
3. Subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left uneaten.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of pizza pieces from all four pizzas. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of pieces per pizza.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each person (Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale) has one pizza, and each pizza is cut into 4 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces is:  
4 people × 4 pieces per pizza = 16 pieces.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine how many pieces each person eats based on the percentage of their pizza consumed. This can be achieved by calculating 50% of 4 pieces for Bill and Dale, and 75% of 4 pieces for Ann and Cate, then summing the pieces eaten.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 4 pieces, 50% of 4 is:  
  0.5 × 4 = 2 pieces per person.  
  For Bill and Dale (2 people): 2 × 2 = 4 pieces eaten.  
- Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 4 pieces, 75% of 4 is:  
  0.75 × 4 = 3 pieces per person.  
  For Ann and Cate (2 people): 2 × 3 = 6 pieces eaten.  
- Total pieces eaten: 4 (Bill and Dale) + 6 (Ann and Cate) = 10 pieces.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many pizza pieces are left uneaten.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of pizza pieces (completed: 16 pieces).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine how many pieces each person eats (completed: 10 pieces eaten).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left uneaten (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left uneaten.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left uneaten. This can be achieved by subtracting the pieces eaten (10) from the total pieces (16).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total pieces: 16  
Pieces eaten: 10  
Pieces left uneaten: 16 − 10 = 6 pieces.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the consistency of the results. This can be achieved by verifying the calculations for total pieces, pieces eaten, and pieces left uneaten.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Verify total pieces: 4 people × 4 pieces per pizza = 16 pieces (correct).  
- Verify pieces eaten:  
  - Bill and Dale: 2 × (0.5 × 4) = 2 × 2 = 4 pieces.  
  - Ann and Cate: 2 × (0.75 × 4) = 2 × 3 = 6 pieces.  
  - Total eaten: 4 + 6 = 10 pieces (correct).  
- Verify pieces left: 16 − 10 = 6 pieces (correct).  
The calculations are consistent, and the result is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
There are 6 pizza pieces left uneaten.
