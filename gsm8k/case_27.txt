### Problem Statement
Jack is stranded on a desert island and collects 2 liters of seawater in a bucket. The seawater is 20% salt. How many milliliters of salt will Jack obtain after all the water evaporates?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for the amount of salt in milliliters.  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the volume of seawater in milliliters.  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the volume of salt based on the given percentage.  
- Subgoal 3: Ensure the units and calculations align with the problem's requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the volume of seawater in milliliters. Convert the given 2 liters of seawater into milliliters using the conversion factor (1 liter = 1000 milliliters).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Convert 2 liters to milliliters:  
2 liters × 1000 milliliters/liter = 2000 milliliters.  
The volume of seawater is 2000 milliliters.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the volume of salt based on the 20% salt concentration in 2000 milliliters of seawater. Multiply the total volume by the salt percentage (20% = 0.2) to find the salt volume in milliliters.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the volume of salt:  
20% of 2000 milliliters = 0.2 × 2000 = 400 milliliters.  
The volume of salt is 400 milliliters.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals to ensure alignment with the problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the milliliters of salt Jack obtains after the water evaporates.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the volume of seawater in milliliters (completed: 2000 milliliters).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the volume of salt based on the 20% salt concentration (completed: 400 milliliters).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure units and calculations align with the problem's requirements (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the calculations and units are correct for the final answer.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations and ensure the units are consistent with the problem's requirements. Check if the 20% salt concentration applied to 2000 milliliters correctly yields 400 milliliters of salt and confirm the unit (milliliters) matches the question.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the calculation:  
- Seawater volume: 2 liters = 2000 milliliters (correct, as 1 liter = 1000 milliliters).  
- Salt volume: 20% of 2000 milliliters = 0.2 × 2000 = 400 milliliters.  
- Units: The problem asks for the salt volume in milliliters, and 400 milliliters is consistent.  
The calculations are correct, and the unit (milliliters) matches the problem's requirement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer by retrieving and summarizing all relevant information related to the calculations performed.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Summarized Information**:  
- From Step 2: The seawater volume is 2 liters, converted to 2000 milliliters.  
- From Step 3: The salt volume is 20% of 2000 milliliters, calculated as 400 milliliters.  
- From Step 5: The calculations were verified, confirming 400 milliliters of salt with correct units.  
All steps align, and the final answer is 400 milliliters of salt.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Jack will obtain 400 milliliters of salt after all the water evaporates.
