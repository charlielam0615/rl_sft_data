### Problem Statement
Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting. She worked for 50 minutes yesterday. Calculate how much she earned.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Convert the 50 minutes of babysitting into hours, since the pay rate is given per hour.
2. Calculate the earnings by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate.
3. Ensure the final answer is in the correct format (dollars).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Convert 50 minutes into hours.
How to Achieve: Divide the number of minutes by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert 50 minutes to hours, divide 50 by 60:
50 ÷ 60 = 5/6 hours ≈ 0.8333 hours.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate Weng's earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting.
  - Subgoal 1: Convert 50 minutes into hours (completed: 50 minutes = 5/6 hours).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate earnings by multiplying hours worked by hourly rate.
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure the final answer is in the correct format (dollars).
Current Goal: Calculate earnings by multiplying hours worked by hourly rate.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate earnings by multiplying hours worked by hourly rate.
How to Achieve: Multiply the hours (5/6) by the hourly rate ($12).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Earnings = (5/6) × 12 = 60/6 = $10.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation is correct.
How to Achieve: Recalculate the earnings using the decimal form of hours (0.8333) to confirm consistency and check if the result aligns with the problem's context.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the decimal form: 0.8333 × 12 ≈ 10. Confirming: 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour, and (5/6) × 12 = 10. The calculation is consistent, and $10 is reasonable for 50 minutes at $12 per hour.
[/IMP]
