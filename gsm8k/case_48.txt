### Problem Statement
Calculate the total time required to download a 90-megabyte file, given that the download speed is 5 megabytes per second for the first 60 megabytes and 10 megabytes per second for the remaining portion.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total download time.  
1. Calculate the time to download the first 60 megabytes at 5 megabytes per second.  
2. Calculate the time to download the remaining 30 megabytes at 10 megabytes per second.  
3. Sum the times from both parts to find the total download time.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time to download the first 60 megabytes at 5 megabytes per second. Use the formula: time = size / speed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the first 60 megabytes, the download speed is 5 megabytes per second.  
Time = 60 MB / 5 MB/s = 12 seconds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time to download the remaining 30 megabytes at 10 megabytes per second. Use the formula: time = size / speed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The remaining portion is 90 MB - 60 MB = 30 megabytes, downloaded at 10 megabytes per second.  
Time = 30 MB / 10 MB/s = 3 seconds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the total time to download a 90-megabyte file.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate time for the first 60 megabytes (completed: 12 seconds).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate time for the remaining 30 megabytes (completed: 3 seconds).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the times to find the total download time (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the times from both parts to find the total download time.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the times from the first and second parts to find the total download time. Add the previously calculated times.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total time = Time for first 60 MB + Time for remaining 30 MB = 12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the total download time by checking calculations and assumptions. Recalculate and confirm the steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- First part: 60 MB at 5 MB/s = 60 / 5 = 12 seconds.  
- Second part: 30 MB at 10 MB/s = 30 / 10 = 3 seconds.  
- Total: 12 + 3 = 15 seconds.  
The file size is 90 MB, and 60 MB + 30 MB = 90 MB, confirming the split is correct. The calculations align with the given rates.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The total time to download the 90-megabyte file is 15 seconds.
