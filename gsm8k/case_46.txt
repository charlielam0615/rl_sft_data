### Problem Statement
Calculate the total cost of a unicorn piñata and the treats purchased for Ava's birthday party. The piñata costs $13, 4 bags of Reese's cost $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers cost $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles cost $7 per bag.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total cost:
1. Calculate the cost of the Reese's bags.
2. Calculate the cost of the Snickers bags.
3. Calculate the cost of the Skittles bags.
4. Sum the costs of the piñata and all treats to find the total cost.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the cost of the Reese's bags.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of Reese's bags (4) by the cost per bag ($9).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Cost of Reese's = 4 bags × $9 per bag = $36.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the cost of the Snickers bags.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of Snickers bags (3) by the cost per bag ($5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Cost of Snickers = 3 bags × $5 per bag = $15.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the cost of the Skittles bags.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of Skittles bags (5) by the cost per bag ($7).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Cost of Skittles = 5 bags × $7 per bag = $35.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total cost of the piñata and treats.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the cost of Reese's bags (completed: $36).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the cost of Snickers bags (completed: $15).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the cost of Skittles bags (completed: $35).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the costs of the piñata and all treats (current goal).
Current Goal: Sum the costs of the piñata and all treats to find the total cost.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the costs of the piñata and all treats.
How to Achieve: Add the cost of the piñata ($13), Reese's ($36), Snickers ($15), and Skittles ($35).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total cost = $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the total cost calculation.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each component and sum to confirm the total cost.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Reese's: 4 × $9 = $36.
- Snickers: 3 × $5 = $15.
- Skittles: 5 × $7 = $35.
- Piñata: $13.
- Total: $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.
The calculation is consistent with the previous result.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.
