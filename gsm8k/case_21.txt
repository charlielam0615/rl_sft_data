### Problem Statement
Bella bought stamps at the post office with snowflake, truck, and rose designs. She bought 11 snowflake stamps, 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Determine the total number of stamps Bella bought.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the number of snowflake stamps.
2. Calculate the number of truck stamps based on the number of snowflake stamps.
3. Calculate the number of rose stamps based on the number of truck stamps.
4. Sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the number of snowflake stamps.
How to Achieve: The problem directly states that Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps, so this number is given.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps, as stated in the problem.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of truck stamps.
How to Achieve: The problem states that Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Using the number of snowflake stamps from the previous step, add 9 to find the number of truck stamps.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. Since she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:
11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of rose stamps.
How to Achieve: The problem states that Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Using the number of truck stamps from the previous step, subtract 13 to find the number of rose stamps.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Bella bought 20 truck stamps. Since she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, the number of rose stamps is:
20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the total number of stamps Bella bought.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of snowflake stamps (Completed: 11 snowflake stamps).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of truck stamps (Completed: 20 truck stamps).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of rose stamps (Completed: 7 rose stamps).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total (Pending).
Current Goal: Sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total.
How to Achieve: Add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps calculated in previous steps to compute the total number of stamps.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Bella bought:
- 11 snowflake stamps,
- 20 truck stamps,
- 7 rose stamps.
Total stamps = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 stamps.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations for accuracy.
How to Achieve: Recompute each step to ensure correctness:
- Confirm snowflake stamps: Given as 11.
- Truck stamps: 11 + 9 = 20.
- Rose stamps: 20 - 13 = 7.
- Total: 11 + 20 + 7 = 38.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Verification:
- Snowflake stamps: The problem states 11, which is correct.
- Truck stamps: 11 snowflake stamps + 9 = 20 truck stamps, correct.
- Rose stamps: 20 truck stamps - 13 = 7 rose stamps, correct.
- Total: 11 + 20 + 7 = 38, correct.
All calculations are consistent with the problem statement.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.
