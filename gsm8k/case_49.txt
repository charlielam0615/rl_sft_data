### Problem Statement
Sam memorized six more digits of pi than Carlos memorized. Mina memorized six times as many digits of pi as Carlos memorized. If Mina memorized 24 digits of pi, how many digits did Sam memorize?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of digits Carlos memorized using the information about Mina.  
2. Calculate the number of digits Sam memorized based on Carlos’s count.  
3. Verify the solution aligns with the problem’s conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of digits Carlos memorized.  
How to Achieve: Mina memorized 24 digits, which is six times the number of digits Carlos memorized. Set up an equation where Carlos’s digits are represented by \( C \), so \( 6C = 24 \), and solve for \( C \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( C \) represent the number of digits Carlos memorized. Since Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, and Mina memorized 24 digits, we have:  
\[ 6C = 24 \]  
Divide both sides by 6:  
\[ C = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]  
Thus, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of digits Sam memorized.  
How to Achieve: Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos. Using Carlos’s digit count from Step 2, add 6 to find Sam’s digit count.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carlos memorized 4 digits. Since Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos, we calculate:  
\[ S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \]  
Thus, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of digits Sam memorized.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of digits Carlos memorized (completed: Carlos memorized 4 digits).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of digits Sam memorized (completed: Sam memorized 10 digits).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution aligns with the problem’s conditions (pending).  
Current Goal: Verify the solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution aligns with the problem’s conditions.  
How to Achieve: Check if the calculated values satisfy all given conditions: Mina’s digits (24) should be six times Carlos’s digits, and Sam’s digits (10) should be six more than Carlos’s digits.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Condition 1: Mina memorized 24 digits, which should be six times Carlos’s digits. Carlos memorized 4 digits, so \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \), which satisfies the condition.  
- Condition 2: Sam memorized 10 digits, which should be six more than Carlos’s 4 digits. Calculate \( 4 + 6 = 10 \), which satisfies the condition.  
The solution is valid as both conditions are met.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.
