### Problem Statement
James creates a movie for a production cost of $2000. Each DVD costs $6 to produce and is sold at 2.5 times the production cost. He sells 500 DVDs per day, 5 days a week. Determine the profit he makes in 20 weeks.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the profit over 20 weeks:  
1. Calculate the selling price per DVD.  
2. Determine the profit per DVD.  
3. Calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks.  
4. Compute the total revenue and total production cost for DVDs.  
5. Subtract the total costs (movie production and DVD production) from the total revenue to find the profit.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the selling price per DVD. This can be achieved by multiplying the production cost per DVD ($6) by 2.5.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Selling price per DVD = $6 × 2.5 = $15.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the profit per DVD. This can be achieved by subtracting the production cost per DVD ($6) from the selling price per DVD ($15).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Profit per DVD = $15 - $6 = $9.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of DVDs sold per day (500) by the number of days per week (5) and then by the number of weeks (20).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total DVDs sold = 500 DVDs/day × 5 days/week × 20 weeks = 50,000 DVDs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the profit James makes in 20 weeks.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the selling price per DVD (Completed: $15).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the profit per DVD (Completed: $9).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks (Completed: 50,000 DVDs).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the total revenue and total production cost for DVDs (Current).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the total profit by subtracting total costs from total revenue.  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total revenue and total production cost for DVDs.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total revenue and total production cost for DVDs. Total revenue is calculated by multiplying the selling price per DVD ($15) by the total number of DVDs sold (50,000). Total production cost for DVDs is calculated by multiplying the production cost per DVD ($6) by the total number of DVDs sold (50,000).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total revenue = $15 × 50,000 = $750,000.  
Total DVD production cost = $6 × 50,000 = $300,000.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total profit. Retrieve information related to total revenue, total DVD production cost, and the initial movie production cost to calculate the profit.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- Selling price per DVD: $15 (Step 2).  
- Profit per DVD: $9 (Step 3).  
- Total DVDs sold: 50,000 (Step 4).  
- Total revenue: $750,000 (Step 6).  
- Total DVD production cost: $300,000 (Step 6).  
- Movie production cost: $2000 (Problem Statement).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total profit. This can be achieved by subtracting the total costs (movie production cost and DVD production cost) from the total revenue.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total cost = Movie production cost + DVD production cost = $2000 + $300,000 = $302,000.  
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $750,000 - $302,000 = $448,000.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the profit calculation. This can be achieved by recalculating the profit using an alternative method (e.g., profit per DVD × total DVDs sold - movie production cost) and checking consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Alternative profit calculation:  
Profit per DVD = $9, Total DVDs = 50,000, Movie production cost = $2000.  
Total profit = ($9 × 50,000) - $2000 = $450,000 - $2000 = $448,000.  
The result matches the previous calculation ($448,000), confirming its validity.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Review the hierarchy of goals to ensure all subgoals are completed and confirm the final profit calculation.
