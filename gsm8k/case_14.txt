### Problem Statement
Jasper is hosting a dinner party and plans to serve charcuterie. He purchases 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Determine the total amount he spends on these ingredients.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total cost:  
1. Determine the cost of the cheddar cheese.  
2. Calculate the cost of the cream cheese based on the cheddar cheese price.  
3. Calculate the cost of the cold cuts based on the cheddar cheese price.  
4. Sum the costs of all ingredients to find the total expenditure.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the cost of the cheddar cheese. Since the problem states that 2 pounds of cheddar cheese cost $10, we can directly use this information to establish the cost.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The problem specifies that Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. Therefore, the cost of the cheddar cheese is $10.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of the cream cheese. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Using the cheddar cheese cost from the previous step, compute the cream cheese cost.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The cheddar cheese costs $10 for 2 pounds. Since the cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, we calculate:  
Cost of cream cheese = $10 รท 2 = $5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of the cold cuts. The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Using the cheddar cheese cost, compute the cold cuts cost.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The cheddar cheese costs $10. Since the cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese, we calculate:  
Cost of cold cuts = $10 ร 2 = $20.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the total amount Jasper spends on charcuterie ingredients.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the cost of the cheddar cheese (completed: $10).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the cost of the cream cheese (completed: $5).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the cost of the cold cuts (completed: $20).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the costs of all ingredients (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the costs of all ingredients to find the total expenditure.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the costs of all ingredients (cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts) to find the total amount spent. Add the previously calculated costs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Costs:  
- Cheddar cheese: $10  
- Cream cheese: $5  
- Cold cuts: $20  
Total cost = $10 + $5 + $20 = $35.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the total cost by checking the calculations for each item and their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify each cost:  
- Cheddar cheese: Given as $10 for 2 pounds, correct.  
- Cream cheese: Half of $10 = $5, correct.  
- Cold cuts: Twice $10 = $20, correct.  
- Total: $10 + $5 + $20 = $35, correct.  
The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Jasper spends $35 on the charcuterie ingredients.
