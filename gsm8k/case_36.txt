### Problem Statement
Mr. Sanchez has 60 Grade 5 students, and 40% of them received a final grade below B. We need to determine how many students received a final grade of B or above.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of students with a grade of B or above. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of students with a grade below B using the given percentage (40%) and total students (60).  
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find those with a grade of B or above.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students with a grade below B. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of students (60) by the percentage of students with a grade below B (40%, or 0.4).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the number of students with a grade below B:  
Number of students below B = Total students × Percentage below B  
= 60 × 0.4  
= 24 students.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of students with a grade of B or above. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of students with a grade below B (calculated as 24) from the total number of students (60).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the number of students with a grade of B or above:  
Number of students with B or above = Total students − Students below B  
= 60 − 24  
= 36 students.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the calculations align with the problem's requirements. This can be achieved by verifying the percentage and ensuring the total number of students is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Students below B: 24 students (from Step 2).  
- Students with B or above: 36 students (from Step 3).  
- Total students: 24 + 36 = 60, which matches the total number of students.  
- Percentage check: Students below B = 24/60 = 0.4 or 40%, which matches the given percentage.  
The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of students with a grade of B or above.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of students with a grade below B (completed: 24 students).  
  - Subgoal 2: Subtract the number of students below B from the total to find those with B or above (completed: 36 students).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations are consistent).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, and all subgoals are complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
36 students received a final grade of B or above.
