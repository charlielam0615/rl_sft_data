### Problem Statement
Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the total number of beetles eaten each day, we need to work backward from the given number of jaguars (6) to determine the number of snakes, birds, and ultimately beetles consumed. The subgoals are:
1. Calculate the number of snakes eaten by 6 jaguars per day.
2. Calculate the number of birds eaten by the resulting number of snakes per day.
3. Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the resulting number of birds per day.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of snakes eaten by 6 jaguars per day.
How to Achieve: Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and there are 6 jaguars. Multiply the number of jaguars by the number of snakes each jaguar eats.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, so 6 jaguars eat:
6 jaguars × 5 snakes per jaguar = 30 snakes per day.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of birds eaten by 30 snakes per day.
How to Achieve: Each snake eats 3 birds per day, and we have 30 snakes. Multiply the number of snakes by the number of birds each snake eats.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so 30 snakes eat:
30 snakes × 3 birds per snake = 90 birds per day.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of beetles eaten by 90 birds per day.
How to Achieve: Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, and we have 90 birds. Multiply the number of birds by the number of beetles each bird eats.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so 90 birds eat:
90 birds × 12 beetles per bird = 1080 beetles per day.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of beetles eaten each day.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of snakes eaten by 6 jaguars per day (completed: 30 snakes).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of birds eaten by 30 snakes per day (completed: 90 birds).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of beetles eaten by 90 birds per day (completed: 1080 beetles).
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, as we have calculated the total number of beetles eaten per day.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each step to confirm the number of snakes, birds, and beetles, and check for logical consistency in the food chain.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Step 1: 6 jaguars × 5 snakes per jaguar = 30 snakes.
- Step 2: 30 snakes × 3 birds per snake = 90 birds.
- Step 3: 90 birds × 12 beetles per bird = 1080 beetles.
The calculations are consistent, and the logic follows the food chain: jaguars eat snakes, snakes eat birds, and birds eat beetles. The result of 1080 beetles per day is valid.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The total number of beetles eaten each day in the forest is 1080.
