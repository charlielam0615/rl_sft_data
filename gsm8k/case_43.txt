### Problem Statement
A family of 12 monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas. 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, while the remaining piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas. How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands each.  
2. Calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining piles with 12 hands each.  
3. Sum the bananas from all piles to get the total number of bananas.  
4. Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys (12) to find the bananas per monkey.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands each, where each hand has 14 bananas.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of piles (6) by the number of hands per pile (9) and then by the number of bananas per hand (14).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the 6 piles:  
6 piles × 9 hands/pile × 14 bananas/hand = 6 × 9 × 14 = 54 × 14 = 756 bananas.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining piles with 12 hands each, where each hand has 9 bananas.  
How to Achieve: Determine the number of remaining piles (10 total piles - 6 piles = 4 piles), then multiply by the number of hands per pile (12) and the number of bananas per hand (9).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Remaining piles: 10 - 6 = 4 piles.  
For the 4 piles:  
4 piles × 12 hands/pile × 9 bananas/hand = 4 × 12 × 9 = 48 × 9 = 432 bananas.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the bananas from all piles to get the total number of bananas.  
How to Achieve: Add the bananas from the 6 piles (calculated in Step 2) to the bananas from the 4 piles (calculated in Step 3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total bananas = 756 (from 6 piles) + 432 (from 4 piles) = 1188 bananas.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculations for the total number of bananas.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate each part and confirm the sum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For 6 piles: 6 × 9 × 14 = 54 × 14 = 756 bananas.  
- For 4 piles: 4 × 12 × 9 = 48 × 9 = 432 bananas.  
- Total: 756 + 432 = 1188 bananas.  
The calculations are consistent with previous results.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many bananas each monkey gets.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate bananas in 6 piles with 9 hands each (completed: 756 bananas).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate bananas in 4 piles with 12 hands each (completed: 432 bananas).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum total bananas (completed: 1188 bananas).  
  - Subgoal 4: Divide total bananas by 12 monkeys (pending).  
Current Goal: Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find bananas per monkey.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys (12) to find bananas per monkey.  
How to Achieve: Divide the total bananas (1188) by the number of monkeys (12).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total bananas = 1188.  
Number of monkeys = 12.  
Bananas per monkey = 1188 ÷ 12 = 99 bananas.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the division of bananas per monkey.  
How to Achieve: Check if 1188 ÷ 12 = 99 and confirm with multiplication (99 × 12).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Division: 1188 ÷ 12 = 99.  
Verification: 99 × 12 = 1188.  
The division is correct, and the distribution is exact with no remainder.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Each monkey gets 99 bananas.
