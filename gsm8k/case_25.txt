### Problem Statement
Mary does her grocery shopping on Saturday at a store where she has a $100 credit limit, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. She spent the full $100 credit limit during her shopping. She paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. How much credit does Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the remaining credit Mary needs to pay.  
1. Identify the total credit amount used by Mary.  
2. Calculate the total payments made by Mary.  
3. Subtract the total payments from the total credit to find the remaining amount to be paid.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the total credit amount used by Mary. According to the problem, Mary spent the full credit limit, so we need to confirm the credit limit amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem states that Mary spent the full credit limit, which is $100. Therefore, the total credit amount used is $100.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total payments made by Mary. The problem mentions payments of $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday, so we need to sum these amounts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Mary paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday.  
Total payments = $15 + $23 = $38.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the remaining credit Mary needs to pay. This involves subtracting the total payments ($38) from the total credit amount ($100).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total credit amount = $100.  
Total payments = $38.  
Remaining credit to be paid = $100 - $38 = $62.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by ensuring the arithmetic is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. We need to confirm that $100 - ($15 + $23) = $62.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the payments: $15 + $23 = $38.  
Subtract from the credit limit: $100 - $38 = $62.  
The calculation is consistent. The problem specifies no additional payments or conditions, so the remaining amount of $62 should be correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the total credit amount used ($100).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total payments made ($38).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the remaining credit to be paid ($62).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (confirmed $62).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, as all subgoals have been addressed and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Mary needs to pay $62 in credit before her next shopping trip.
