### Problem Statement
Mark has a garden with flowers of three different colors: yellow, purple, and green. There are 10 yellow flowers, and the number of purple flowers is 80% more than the number of yellow flowers. The number of green flowers is 25% of the combined number of yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the total number of flowers.  
1. Calculate the number of purple flowers based on the number of yellow flowers.  
2. Calculate the combined number of yellow and purple flowers.  
3. Calculate the number of green flowers based on the combined number of yellow and purple flowers.  
4. Sum the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to find the total number of flowers in the garden.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of purple flowers. Since there are 10 yellow flowers and the number of purple flowers is 80% more than the number of yellow flowers, we will compute 80% of 10 and add it to the number of yellow flowers to find the number of purple flowers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of purple flowers:  
- There are 10 yellow flowers.  
- "80% more" means 100% of the yellow flowers plus an additional 80%, or 180% of the yellow flowers.  
- Calculate: \( 10 \times 1.8 = 18 \).  
Thus, there are 18 purple flowers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the combined number of yellow and purple flowers. Using the known number of yellow flowers (10) and the calculated number of purple flowers (18), we will add these two quantities together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the combined number of yellow and purple flowers:  
- Yellow flowers: 10  
- Purple flowers: 18  
- Total: \( 10 + 18 = 28 \).  
Thus, there are 28 yellow and purple flowers combined.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of green flowers. Since the number of green flowers is 25% of the combined number of yellow and purple flowers (28), we will compute 25% of 28.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of green flowers:  
- Combined yellow and purple flowers: 28  
- Green flowers are 25% of this total, or \( 0.25 \times 28 \).  
- Calculate: \( 0.25 \times 28 = 7 \).  
Thus, there are 7 green flowers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the total number of flowers in Mark's garden.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of purple flowers (completed: 18 purple flowers).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the combined number of yellow and purple flowers (completed: 28 flowers).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of green flowers (completed: 7 green flowers).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to find the total (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to find the total number of flowers in the garden.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Using the calculated numbers of yellow (10), purple (18), and green (7) flowers, we will sum these to find the total.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the total number of flowers:  
- Yellow flowers: 10  
- Purple flowers: 18  
- Green flowers: 7  
- Total: \( 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 \).  
Thus, the total number of flowers is 35.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by checking the consistency of each step. We will recompute each step to ensure the total number of flowers (35) is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate:  
1. **Purple flowers**: 10 yellow flowers, 80% more means \( 10 \times 1.8 = 18 \). Correct.  
2. **Combined yellow and purple**: \( 10 + 18 = 28 \). Correct.  
3. **Green flowers**: 25% of 28 is \( 0.25 \times 28 = 7 \). Correct.  
4. **Total flowers**: \( 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 \). Correct.  
All calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Mark has 35 flowers in his garden.
