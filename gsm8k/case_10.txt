### Problem Statement
Tina makes $18.00 per hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid at her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate Tina’s regular hourly wage and overtime wage.  
2. Determine the number of regular and overtime hours per day.  
3. Compute the daily earnings based on regular and overtime hours.  
4. Calculate the total earnings over 5 days.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Tina’s regular and overtime wages. To achieve this, use the given hourly wage of $18.00 and compute the overtime wage as the regular wage plus half the regular wage.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Regular wage = $18.00 per hour.  
Overtime wage = $18.00 + ($18.00 × 0.5) = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00 per hour.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of regular and overtime hours per day. Since Tina works 10 hours per day and overtime applies after 8 hours, calculate the hours accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Regular hours per day = 8 hours.  
Overtime hours per day = 10 hours − 8 hours = 2 hours.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute Tina’s daily earnings. Multiply the regular hours by the regular wage and the overtime hours by the overtime wage, then sum the results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Regular earnings per day = 8 hours × $18.00/hour = $144.00.  
Overtime earnings per day = 2 hours × $27.00/hour = $54.00.  
Total daily earnings = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals:  
- Main goal: Calculate Tina’s total earnings for 5 days of work.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate regular and overtime wages (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine regular and overtime hours per day (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute daily earnings (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate total earnings over 5 days (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to calculate total earnings over 5 days. Previous steps established:  
- Regular wage: $18.00/hour, overtime wage: $27.00/hour.  
- Regular hours: 8/day, overtime hours: 2/day.  
- Daily earnings: $198.00.  
This information is sufficient to proceed with the final calculation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate total earnings over 5 days. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days (5).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total earnings = $198.00/day × 5 days = $990.00.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation. Recheck the steps: verify wages, hours, daily earnings, and total earnings for accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Regular wage: $18.00/hour, overtime wage: $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00/hour (correct).  
- Hours: 8 regular + 2 overtime = 10 hours/day (matches problem).  
- Daily earnings: (8 × $18.00) + (2 × $27.00) = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 (correct).  
- Total earnings: $198.00 × 5 = $990.00 (correct).  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Tina makes $990.00 for working 10 hours each day for 5 days.
