### Problem Statement
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in total?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total cost:  
1. Determine the number of tickets eligible for the discount.  
2. Calculate the cost of tickets without the discount.  
3. Calculate the discount amount for eligible tickets.  
4. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the number of tickets eligible for the discount. Since the discount applies to tickets exceeding 10, subtract 10 from the total number of tickets (12).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total tickets = 12. Tickets exceeding 10 = 12 - 10 = 2.  
Therefore, 2 tickets are eligible for the 5% discount.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the cost of tickets without the discount. Multiply the total number of tickets (12) by the full ticket price ($40).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total tickets = 12, ticket price = $40.  
Cost without discount = 12 × $40 = $480.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the discount amount for eligible tickets. For each of the 2 eligible tickets, apply a 5% discount on the $40 ticket price and sum the discounts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Number of discounted tickets = 2.  
Discount per ticket = 5% of $40 = 0.05 × $40 = $2.  
Total discount = 2 × $2 = $4.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the final amount paid by subtracting the total discount from the total cost without discount.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total cost without discount = $480.  
Total discount = $4.  
Final amount paid = $480 - $4 = $476.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid for 12 concert tickets with a 5% discount on tickets exceeding 10.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of tickets eligible for the discount (completed: 2 tickets).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the cost of tickets without the discount (completed: $480).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the discount amount for eligible tickets (completed: $4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the final amount paid (completed: $476).  
**Current Goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to ensure all subgoals are completed and consistent. All subgoals have been addressed, and the final amount paid has been calculated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the steps: verify the number of discounted tickets, the cost without discount, the discount amount, and the final amount.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Number of discounted tickets**: 12 tickets total, discount applies to tickets exceeding 10, so 12 - 10 = 2 tickets. Correct.  
- **Cost without discount**: 12 tickets × $40 = $480. Correct.  
- **Discount amount**: 5% of $40 = $2 per ticket, 2 tickets × $2 = $4. Correct.  
- **Final amount**: $480 - $4 = $476. Correct.  
All calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Mr. Benson paid $476 in total for the 12 concert tickets.
