### Problem Statement
James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write in a year?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of calculating the total number of pages James writes in a year, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of pages written to each friend per week.  
2. Calculate the total pages written per week for all friends.  
3. Determine the number of weeks in a year.  
4. Compute the total pages written in a year by multiplying the weekly total by the number of weeks.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of pages written to each friend per week.  
How to Achieve: Each letter is 3 pages, and James writes to each friend twice a week. Multiply the pages per letter by the number of letters per friend per week.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For each friend, James writes a 3-page letter twice a week. Thus, pages per friend per week = 3 pages/letter × 2 letters/week = 6 pages/week per friend.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total pages written per week for all friends.  
How to Achieve: James writes to 2 friends. Multiply the pages written per friend per week by the number of friends.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
James writes to 2 friends, and each friend receives 6 pages per week (from Step 2). Total pages per week = 6 pages/friend × 2 friends = 12 pages/week.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of weeks in a year.  
How to Achieve: Use the standard approximation of 52 weeks in a year for simplicity, as this is a common assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A year is approximately 52 weeks.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of pages James writes in a year.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine pages written to each friend per week (completed: 6 pages/week per friend).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate total pages per week for all friends (completed: 12 pages/week).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine number of weeks in a year (completed: 52 weeks).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute total pages written in a year (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is updated with all subgoals completed except the final calculation. The current goal is to compute the total pages written in a year using the results from previous steps.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the total pages written in a year.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the total pages written per week by the number of weeks in a year.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total pages per week = 12 pages (from Step 3). Weeks per year = 52 (from Step 4). Total pages per year = 12 pages/week × 52 weeks = 624 pages.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the current path.  
How to Achieve: Verify calculations by rechecking each step’s logic and ensuring consistency with the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Step 2: 3 pages/letter × 2 letters/week = 6 pages/week per friend. Correct.  
- Step 3: 6 pages/friend × 2 friends = 12 pages/week. Correct.  
- Step 4: 52 weeks/year is a standard approximation. Correct.  
- Step 6: 12 pages/week × 52 weeks = 624 pages. Calculation confirmed (12 × 50 = 600, 12 × 2 = 24, 600 + 24 = 624).  
The problem states James writes 3-page letters to 2 friends twice a week, so 2 friends × 2 letters/friend × 3 pages/letter = 12 pages/week, and 12 × 52 = 624 pages/year. The path is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
James writes 624 pages in a year.
