### Problem Statement
James is a first-year student at a University in Chicago with a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. Determine how much money he spends on coursework materials.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the amount spent on food (30% of $1000).
2. Calculate the amount spent on accommodation (15% of $1000).
3. Calculate the amount spent on entertainment (25% of $1000).
4. Sum the amounts spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment.
5. Subtract the total spent from the budget to find the amount spent on coursework materials.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the amount spent on food, which is 30% of the $1000 budget.
How to Achieve: Multiply the total budget ($1000) by 30% (0.30) to find the amount spent on food.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the amount spent on food:
30% of $1000 = 0.30 × $1000 = $300.
James spends $300 on food.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the amount spent on accommodation, which is 15% of the $1000 budget.
How to Achieve: Multiply the total budget ($1000) by 15% (0.15) to find the amount spent on accommodation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the amount spent on accommodation:
15% of $1000 = 0.15 × $1000 = $150.
James spends $150 on accommodation.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the amount spent on entertainment, which is 25% of the $1000 budget.
How to Achieve: Multiply the total budget ($1000) by 25% (0.25) to find the amount spent on entertainment.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the amount spent on entertainment:
25% of $1000 = 0.25 × $1000 = $250.
James spends $250 on entertainment.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the amount James spends on coursework materials.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate amount spent on food (completed: $300).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate amount spent on accommodation (completed: $150).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate amount spent on entertainment (completed: $250).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the amounts spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment (pending).
  - Subgoal 5: Subtract the total spent from the budget to find the amount for coursework materials (pending).
Current Goal: Sum the amounts spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the amounts spent on food ($300), accommodation ($150), and entertainment ($250).
How to Achieve: Add the amounts calculated in previous steps: $300 + $150 + $250.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the total amount spent:
$300 (food) + $150 (accommodation) + $250 (entertainment) = $700.
James spends a total of $700 on food, accommodation, and entertainment.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the amount spent on coursework materials by subtracting the total spent ($700) from the budget ($1000).
How to Achieve: Subtract the sum of expenses ($700) from the total budget ($1000) to find the remaining amount for coursework materials.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the amount for coursework materials:
$1000 (budget) - $700 (total spent) = $300.
James spends $300 on coursework materials.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure the amount spent on coursework materials is correct.
How to Achieve: Check that the percentages sum to the correct total and confirm the subtraction.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To validate:
- Sum of percentages: 30% (food) + 15% (accommodation) + 25% (entertainment) = 70%.
- Amount spent: $300 (food) + $150 (accommodation) + $250 (entertainment) = $700.
- Remaining: $1000 - $700 = $300 for coursework materials.
- Alternatively, remaining percentage: 100% - 70% = 30%, and 30% of $1000 = $300.
The calculations are consistent and correct.
