### Problem Statement
Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the number of coconut trees based on the given relationship with mango trees.
2. Calculate the total number of trees by adding mango and coconut trees.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the number of coconut trees.
How to Achieve: The problem states there are 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. With 60 mango trees, compute half of 60 and subtract 5 to find the number of coconut trees.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Half of 60 mango trees is 60 ÷ 2 = 30. Subtract 5 to get the number of coconut trees: 30 - 5 = 25. So, there are 25 coconut trees.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of coconut trees.
How to Achieve: Recheck the computation for coconut trees to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The problem states coconut trees are 5 less than half of 60. Half of 60 is 30, and 30 - 5 = 25. The calculation is consistent and correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of trees.
How to Achieve: Add the number of mango trees (60) and coconut trees (25) to find the total.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total trees = 60 (mango) + 25 (coconut) = 85 trees.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of trees on Randy’s farm.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of coconut trees (completed: 25 coconut trees).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of trees by adding mango and coconut trees (completed: 85 trees).
Current Goal: Completed all subgoals; total trees calculated.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the total number of trees.
How to Achieve: Confirm the addition of mango and coconut trees and ensure all problem conditions are met.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Mango trees: 60. Coconut trees: 25 (from half of 60 minus 5). Total: 60 + 25 = 85. The problem’s conditions are satisfied, and the addition is correct.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Randy has 85 trees in total on his farm.
