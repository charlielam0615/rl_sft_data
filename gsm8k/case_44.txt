### Problem Statement
An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each subsequent earthquake would cause double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous one, due to increasingly unstable foundations. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed, including those from the first earthquake?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total number of collapsed buildings after three additional earthquakes.  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the number of buildings that collapse in each of the four earthquakes (initial plus three more).  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of collapsed buildings by summing the collapses from all four earthquakes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of buildings that collapse in each of the four earthquakes. To achieve this, model the number of collapses as a geometric sequence where the first earthquake causes 4 collapses, and each subsequent earthquake doubles the previous number.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first earthquake causes 4 buildings to collapse. Each subsequent earthquake doubles the number of collapses:  
- Earthquake 1: 4 buildings.  
- Earthquake 2: 4 × 2 = 8 buildings.  
- Earthquake 3: 8 × 2 = 16 buildings.  
- Earthquake 4: 16 × 2 = 32 buildings.  
Thus, the number of buildings collapsing in each earthquake is 4, 8, 16, and 32, respectively.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the geometric sequence calculated for the number of buildings collapsing in each earthquake. Check if the sequence correctly follows the doubling pattern and aligns with the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The problem states that the first earthquake causes 4 buildings to collapse, and each subsequent earthquake doubles the number of collapses:  
- Earthquake 1: 4 (given).  
- Earthquake 2: 4 × 2 = 8 (correct).  
- Earthquake 3: 8 × 2 = 16 (correct).  
- Earthquake 4: 16 × 2 = 32 (correct).  
The sequence 4, 8, 16, 32 follows the doubling pattern and matches the problem’s description. The calculation is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of buildings that collapsed across all four earthquakes. Sum the number of collapses from each earthquake (4, 8, 16, 32).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Sum the number of buildings that collapsed:  
4 (Earthquake 1) + 8 (Earthquake 2) + 16 (Earthquake 3) + 32 (Earthquake 4) = 60 buildings.  
Alternatively, recognize the sequence as geometric with first term 4, common ratio 2, and 4 terms:  
Sum = 4 × (1 - 2⁴) / (1 - 2) = 4 × (1 - 16) / (-1) = 4 × 15 = 60.  
The total number of collapsed buildings is 60.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of buildings collapsed after three more earthquakes, including the first.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of buildings collapsing in each of the four earthquakes (completed: 4, 8, 16, 32).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of collapsed buildings by summing (completed: 60).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, final answer reached).  
The goal hierarchy is complete, with the main goal achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final sum of collapsed buildings (60) to ensure it aligns with the problem’s requirements. Recheck the summation and consider an alternative method to confirm accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the sum: 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60.  
Alternatively, use the geometric series formula for 4 terms:  
Sum = a × (1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r), where a = 4, r = 2, n = 4.  
Sum = 4 × (1 - 2⁴) / (1 - 2) = 4 × (1 - 16) / (-1) = 4 × 15 = 60.  
The problem asks for the total including the first earthquake, which is satisfied by summing all four earthquakes. The result of 60 is consistent across methods.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to summarize all relevant information related to the calculation of the total number of collapsed buildings to ensure completeness. Retrieve key details from previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- The problem involves a geometric sequence of building collapses starting with 4 buildings in the first earthquake, doubling each time (Step 2).  
- The sequence for four earthquakes is 4, 8, 16, 32 (Step 2, validated in Step 3).  
- The total sum is 60 buildings, calculated by adding the collapses (Step 4) and verified using the geometric series formula (Step 6).  
- The goal hierarchy confirms all subgoals are complete (Step 5).  
All relevant information supports the final answer of 60 collapsed buildings.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The total number of buildings that collapsed after the first earthquake and three additional earthquakes is 60.
