### Problem Statement
Alexis has a budget of $200 for business clothes and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes but lost the receipt. After all purchases, she has $16 left. Determine the cost of the shoes.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the cost of the shoes, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total amount spent on known items (shirt, pants, coat, socks, belt).  
2. Determine the total amount spent, including the shoes, by subtracting the remaining budget from the initial budget.  
3. Find the cost of the shoes by subtracting the known expenses from the total spent.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total amount spent on known items (shirt, pants, coat, socks, belt). This will be achieved by summing the given costs: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the costs of the known items:  
$30 + $46 = 76$  
$76 + $38 = 114$  
$114 + $11 = 125$  
$125 + $18 = 143$  
The total spent on known items is $143.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total amount spent, including the shoes, by subtracting the remaining budget ($16) from the initial budget ($200).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Subtract the remaining budget from the initial budget:  
$200 - $16 = 184$  
The total amount spent, including the shoes, is $184.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the cost of the shoes by subtracting the total spent on known items ($143) from the total amount spent ($184).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Subtract the known expenses from the total spent:  
$184 - $143 = 41$  
The cost of the shoes is $41.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the cost of the shoes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total spent on known items ($143). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine total amount spent, including shoes ($184). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the cost of the shoes ($41). [Completed]  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by reviewing the calculations.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the sum of all expenses, including the calculated shoe cost ($41), plus the remaining budget ($16), equals the initial budget ($200).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Sum all expenses and the remaining budget:  
$30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 + $41 = 184$  
$184 + $16 = 200$  
The total matches the initial budget of $200, confirming the calculations are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The cost of the shoes is $41.
