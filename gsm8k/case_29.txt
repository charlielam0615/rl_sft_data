### Problem Statement
There are 5 houses on a street. Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in their garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the number of gnomes in the fifth house.  
1. Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses.  
2. Subtract this from the total number of gnomes on the street to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of gnomes per house by the number of houses.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes. Therefore, the total number of gnomes in the first four houses is:  
4 houses × 3 gnomes per house = 12 gnomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of gnomes in the fifth house.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses (completed: 12 gnomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house (pending).  
**Current Goal:** Subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house by subtracting the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes on the street. This can be achieved by subtracting the result from Step 2 (12 gnomes) from the total of 20 gnomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of gnomes on the street is 20. The first four houses have 12 gnomes (from Step 2). Therefore, the number of gnomes in the fifth house is:  
20 gnomes - 12 gnomes = 8 gnomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the calculation by ensuring the total number of gnomes matches the problem statement. This can be achieved by adding the number of gnomes in all five houses and checking if it equals 20.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The first four houses have 12 gnomes (4 × 3 = 12), and the fifth house has 8 gnomes (from Step 4). The total number of gnomes is:  
12 + 8 = 20 gnomes.  
This matches the total given in the problem statement, confirming the calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of gnomes in the fifth house (completed: 8 gnomes).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses (completed: 12 gnomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house (completed: 8 gnomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation by checking the total number of gnomes (completed: 12 + 8 = 20 gnomes).  
**Current Goal:** All subgoals have been completed, and the main goal has been achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The fifth house has 8 gnomes.
