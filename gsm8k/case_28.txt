### Problem Statement
Brennan downloaded 800 files for his school project and deleted 70% of them as they were not helpful. He then downloaded 400 more files, but realized that 3/5 of these were irrelevant and deleted them. How many valuable files remain after these deletions?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the number of valuable files remaining.  
1. Calculate the number of files remaining after deleting 70% of the initial 800 files.  
2. Determine the number of irrelevant files (3/5) from the second batch of 400 files and subtract them to find the remaining files from this batch.  
3. Sum the remaining files from both batches to find the total number of valuable files.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of files remaining after deleting 70% of the initial 800 files. This involves finding 70% of 800, subtracting it from 800 to get the remaining files.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the number of files deleted:  
70% of 800 = 0.7 × 800 = 560 files deleted.  
Remaining files = 800 - 560 = 240 files.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of irrelevant files (3/5 of 400) from the second batch and subtract them to find the remaining files from this batch. This involves computing 3/5 of 400 and subtracting from 400.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the number of irrelevant files:  
3/5 × 400 = (3 × 400) / 5 = 1200 / 5 = 240 files deleted.  
Remaining files = 400 - 240 = 160 files.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the remaining files from both batches to find the total number of valuable files. This involves adding the files remaining from the first batch (240) and the second batch (160).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total valuable files = 240 (from first batch) + 160 (from second batch) = 400 files.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the total number of valuable files remaining.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate files remaining after deleting 70% of 800 files (completed: 240 files).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate files remaining after deleting 3/5 of 400 files (completed: 160 files).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the remaining files from both batches (completed: 400 files).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the total number of valuable files, which has been calculated as 400.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by rechecking each step to ensure accuracy. This involves verifying the percentage calculations and the final sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- First batch: 70% of 800 = 0.7 × 800 = 560 files deleted; 800 - 560 = 240 files remain.  
- Second batch: 3/5 × 400 = 240 files deleted; 400 - 240 = 160 files remain.  
- Total: 240 + 160 = 400 files.  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Brennan was left with 400 valuable files after deleting the unrelated files.
