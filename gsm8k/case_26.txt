### Problem Statement
Ralph loads a tennis ball machine with 175 tennis balls. He hits 2/5 of the first 100 balls and 1/3 of the next 75 balls. We need to determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit out of the total 175.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the number of balls Ralph hits from the first 100 balls.
2. Calculate the number of balls Ralph hits from the next 75 balls.
3. Sum the balls hit in both sets to find the total number of balls hit.
4. Subtract the total balls hit from the initial 175 balls to find the number of balls not hit.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of balls Ralph hits from the first 100 balls.
How to Achieve: Multiply 100 by 2/5 to find the number of balls hit from the first set.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the number of balls Ralph hits from the first 100 balls:
\[ 100 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]
So, Ralph hits 40 balls from the first 100.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of balls Ralph hits from the next 75 balls.
How to Achieve: Multiply 75 by 1/3 to find the number of balls hit from the second set.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the number of balls Ralph hits from the next 75 balls:
\[ 75 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{75}{3} = 25 \]
So, Ralph hits 25 balls from the next 75.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit out of 175.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate balls hit from the first 100 balls (Completed: 40 balls hit).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate balls hit from the next 75 balls (Completed: 25 balls hit).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the balls hit in both sets (Pending).
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract total balls hit from 175 to find balls not hit (Pending).
Current Goal: Sum the balls hit in both sets.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the balls hit from both sets to find the total number of balls hit.
How to Achieve: Add the number of balls hit from the first set (40) and the second set (25).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the total number of balls hit:
\[ 40 + 25 = 65 \]
So, Ralph hits a total of 65 balls.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of balls Ralph did not hit.
How to Achieve: Subtract the total number of balls hit (65) from the initial 175 balls.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the number of balls Ralph did not hit:
\[ 175 - 65 = 110 \]
So, Ralph did not hit 110 balls.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each step and confirm the total balls not hit aligns with the problemâ€™s constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Recalculate:
- First set: \( 100 \times \frac{2}{5} = 40 \) balls hit, so \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) not hit.
- Second set: \( 75 \times \frac{1}{3} = 25 \) balls hit, so \( 75 - 25 = 50 \) not hit.
- Total not hit: \( 60 + 50 = 110 \).
- Total balls: \( 100 + 75 = 175 \).
- Total hit: \( 40 + 25 = 65 \).
- Balls not hit: \( 175 - 65 = 110 \).
All calculations are consistent, and the total matches the sum of balls not hit from each set.
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit out of 175 (Completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate balls hit from the first 100 balls (Completed: 40 balls hit).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate balls hit from the next 75 balls (Completed: 25 balls hit).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the balls hit in both sets (Completed: 65 balls hit).
  - Subgoal 4: Subtract total balls hit from 175 to find balls not hit (Completed: 110 balls not hit).
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).

### Final Answer
Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.
