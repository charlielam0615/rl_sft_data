### Problem Statement
Joy can read 8 pages of a book in 20 minutes. How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine Joy's reading rate in pages per minute.
2. Calculate the time required to read 120 pages in minutes.
3. Convert the time from minutes to hours.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine Joy's reading rate in pages per minute.
How to Achieve: Use the given information (8 pages in 20 minutes) to compute the reading rate by dividing the number of pages by the number of minutes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find Joy's reading rate, divide the number of pages by the time taken:
Reading rate = 8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the time required to read 120 pages in minutes.
How to Achieve: Use the reading rate (0.4 pages per minute) to find the total time by dividing the total pages (120) by the reading rate.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Time to read 120 pages = 120 pages / 0.4 pages per minute = 120 / 0.4 = 300 minutes.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
How to Achieve: Divide the total time in minutes (300 minutes) by the number of minutes in an hour (60 minutes) to get the time in hours.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the time in hours for Joy to read 120 pages.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine Joy's reading rate in pages per minute (Completed: 0.4 pages per minute).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time to read 120 pages in minutes (Completed: 300 minutes).
  - Subgoal 3: Convert the time from minutes to hours (Completed: 5 hours).
Current Goal: Completed all subgoals; main goal achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each step and cross-check the results to confirm accuracy.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
1. Reading rate: 8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute.
2. Time for 120 pages: 120 / 0.4 = 300 minutes.
3. Convert to hours: 300 / 60 = 5 hours.
All calculations are consistent with previous results.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
It will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.
