### Problem Statement
It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work each week with walking and biking?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the total time spent walking to and from work in a week.
2. Calculate the total time spent biking to and from work in a week.
3. Sum the walking and biking times to find the total time spent commuting.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total time spent walking to and from work in a week.
How to Achieve: Determine the time for one round trip by walking, multiply by the number of walking days, and account for both to and from trips.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Roque walks to work and back three times a week. Each one-way walking trip takes 2 hours, so a round trip (to and from work) takes 2 + 2 = 4 hours. For three days:
3 days × 4 hours/day = 12 hours.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total time spent biking to and from work in a week.
How to Achieve: Determine the time for one round trip by biking, multiply by the number of biking days, and account for both to and from trips.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Roque rides his bike to work and back twice a week. Each one-way biking trip takes 1 hour, so a round trip takes 1 + 1 = 2 hours. For two days:
2 days × 2 hours/day = 4 hours.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate total hours Roque spends commuting to and from work each week.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate walking time (completed: 12 hours).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate biking time (completed: 4 hours).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum walking and biking times to find total commuting time.
Current Goal: Sum the walking and biking times to find the total time spent commuting.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the walking and biking times to find the total time spent commuting.
How to Achieve: Add the total walking time and total biking time calculated in previous steps.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total walking time: 12 hours.
Total biking time: 4 hours.
Total commuting time: 12 + 4 = 16 hours.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the total commuting time calculation.
How to Achieve: Recheck the calculations for walking and biking times and their sum, ensuring all trips (to and from) and days are correctly accounted for.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Walking: 3 days × (2 hours to + 2 hours from) = 3 × 4 = 12 hours.
- Biking: 2 days × (1 hour to + 1 hour from) = 2 × 2 = 4 hours.
- Total: 12 + 4 = 16 hours.
The calculations are consistent and account for all trips and days as stated in the problem.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Roque takes a total of 16 hours to get to and from work each week with walking and biking.
