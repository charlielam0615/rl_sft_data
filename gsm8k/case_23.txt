### Problem Statement
Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the number of letters in Samantha’s last name.  
1. Determine the number of letters in Jamie’s last name, as it is given directly.  
2. Use the condition about Bobbie’s modified last name (after removing two letters) being twice the length of Jamie’s last name to set up an equation.  
3. Relate Samantha’s last name to Bobbie’s last name using the given condition (three fewer letters).  
4. Solve for the number of letters in Samantha’s last name.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of letters in Jamie’s last name. Since Jamie’s full name is given as Jamie Grey, count the letters in “Grey.”  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. The last name is “Grey,” which has 4 letters (G, r, e, y).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an equation using the condition that Bobbie’s last name, after removing two letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s last name. Let \( B \) represent the number of letters in Bobbie’s last name. Use the number of letters in Jamie’s last name (4) to form the equation \( B - 2 = 2 \times 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( B \) be the number of letters in Bobbie’s last name. According to the problem, if Bobbie removes two letters from her last name, the result is twice the length of Jamie’s last name. Since Jamie’s last name (Grey) has 4 letters, we have:  
\[ B - 2 = 2 \times 4 \]  
\[ B - 2 = 8 \]  
\[ B = 10 \]  
Thus, Bobbie’s last name has 10 letters.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of letters in Samantha’s last name using the condition that it has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. Use the result \( B = 10 \) to compute Samantha’s last name length as \( B - 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. Since Bobbie’s last name has 10 letters, Samantha’s last name has:  
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]  
Thus, Samantha’s last name has 7 letters.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the derived values satisfy all given conditions. Verify that Bobbie’s last name (10 letters) minus two letters equals twice Jamie’s last name (4 letters), and that Samantha’s last name (7 letters) is three fewer than Bobbie’s.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Check Bobbie’s condition: Bobbie’s last name has 10 letters. After removing 2 letters, \( 10 - 2 = 8 \), which should be twice Jamie’s last name. Since Jamie’s last name has 4 letters, \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \), which matches.  
- Check Samantha’s condition: Samantha’s last name has 7 letters. Bobbie’s last name has 10 letters, and \( 10 - 3 = 7 \), which matches.  
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of letters in Samantha’s last name.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of letters in Jamie’s last name (completed: 4 letters).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation for Bobbie’s last name length using the condition about removing two letters (completed: \( B = 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute Samantha’s last name length using the relation to Bobbie’s last name (completed: 7 letters).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: all conditions satisfied).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The number of letters in Samantha’s last name is 7.
