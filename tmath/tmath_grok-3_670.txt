### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that the sum of the numbers on two fair, six-sided dice is less than 11 when rolled.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice.
2. Identify all outcomes where the sum of the dice is less than 11.
3. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice. This can be achieved by calculating the product of the number of outcomes for each die.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes for two dice is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all outcomes where the sum of the two dice is less than 11. This can be achieved by listing all possible sums and counting those less than 11, or by calculating the complement (sums of 11 or more).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each die can show a number from 1 to 6, so the possible sums range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6). To find outcomes where the sum is less than 11, it’s easier to calculate the complement: outcomes where the sum is 11 or 12.

- **Sum = 11**: Possible pairs are (5,6), (6,5). That’s 2 outcomes.
- **Sum = 12**: Possible pair is (6,6). That’s 1 outcome.

Total outcomes with sum \(\geq 11\): \(2 + 1 = 3\).  
Thus, outcomes with sum < 11: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation of outcomes with a sum less than 11. This can be achieved by cross-checking the complement method with a direct count of favorable outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s verify by directly counting outcomes for sums from 2 to 10:
- Sum = 2: (1,1) → 1 outcome
- Sum = 3: (1,2), (2,1) → 2 outcomes
- Sum = 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) → 3 outcomes
- Sum = 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) → 4 outcomes
- Sum = 6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) → 5 outcomes
- Sum = 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) → 6 outcomes
- Sum = 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) → 5 outcomes
- Sum = 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) → 4 outcomes
- Sum = 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) → 3 outcomes

Total favorable outcomes: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 33\).  
This matches the complement method (\(36 - 3 = 33\)), confirming the count is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. This can be achieved by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Favorable outcomes (sum < 11): 33.  
Total outcomes: 36.  
Probability = \(\frac{33}{36} = \frac{11}{12}\).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that the sum of two dice is less than 11.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes (completed: 36 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify outcomes where the sum is less than 11 (completed: 33 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability (completed: \(\frac{11}{12}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed: verified by direct count).

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The probability that the sum of the numbers on two fair, six-sided dice is less than 11 is \(\frac{11}{12}\).
