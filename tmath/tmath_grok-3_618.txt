### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that the area of triangle \( PBC \), formed by a randomly placed point \( P \) inside right triangle \( ABC \), is less than half the area of triangle \( ABC \). Triangle \( ABC \) has vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \), forming a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \). The answer should be a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Compute the area of triangle \( ABC \).  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for the area of triangle \( PBC \) to be less than half the area of triangle \( ABC \).  
- Subgoal 3: Represent point \( P \) in a suitable coordinate system to model its random placement.  
- Subgoal 4: Calculate the probability by finding the region where the area of triangle \( PBC \) satisfies the condition.  
- Subgoal 5: Express the probability as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the area of triangle \( ABC \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the coordinates of vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \) to calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \) using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:  
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right|
  \]
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), \( C(0,0) \), apply the area formula:  
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 \cdot (0 - 0) + 8 \cdot (0 - 5) + 0 \cdot (5 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 40 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 40 = 20.
\]
Alternatively, since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with legs \( BC = 8 \) (along x-axis) and \( AC = 5 \) (along y-axis), the area is:  
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 5 = 20.
\]
Both methods confirm the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 20 square units.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the area of triangle \( PBC \) to be less than half the area of triangle \( ABC \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate half the area of \( \triangle ABC \). Then, express the area of \( \triangle PBC \) with \( P(x,y) \) and find the condition such that its area is less than half of \( \triangle ABC \)'s area.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Half the area of \( \triangle ABC \):  
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 = 10.
\]
For triangle \( PBC \) with vertices \( P(x,y) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \), use the area formula:  
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_P (y_B - y_C) + x_B (y_C - y_P) + x_C (y_P - y_B) \right|.
\]
Substituting coordinates:  
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| x \cdot (0 - 0) + 8 \cdot (0 - y) + 0 \cdot (y - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 8y + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8y = 4y.
\]
The condition requires:  
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PBC < 10 \implies 4y < 10 \implies y < \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}.
\]
Thus, the area of \( \triangle PBC \) is less than 10 when \( y < \frac{5}{2} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Represent point \( P \) to model its random placement inside \( \triangle ABC \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Define the region of \( \triangle ABC \) using the equations of its sides. Assume \( P(x,y) \) is uniformly distributed, and determine the bounds for \( x \) and \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Triangle \( ABC \) has vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), \( C(0,0) \). The sides are:  
- **Side \( BC \)**: Line from \( C(0,0) \) to \( B(8,0) \), equation \( y = 0 \).  
- **Side \( AC \)**: Line from \( C(0,0) \) to \( A(0,5) \), equation \( x = 0 \).  
- **Side \( AB \)**: Line from \( A(0,5) \) to \( B(8,0) \). Slope = \(\frac{0-5}{8-0} = -\frac{5}{8}\). Equation:  
  \[
  y - 5 = -\frac{5}{8} (x - 0) \implies y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5.
  \]
For point \( P(x,y) \) inside \( \triangle ABC \):  
- \( x \geq 0 \) (left of line \( x = 0 \)).  
- \( y \geq 0 \) (above line \( y = 0 \)).  
- \( y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \) (below line \( AB \)).  
Thus, for a given \( x \in [0,8] \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the area of \( \triangle PBC \) is less than half the area of \( \triangle ABC \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute the area of \( \triangle ABC \) (Completed: Area = 20).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for the area of \( \triangle PBC \) to be less than half the area of \( \triangle ABC \) (Completed: \( y < \frac{5}{2} \)).

  - Subgoal 5: Express the probability as a common fraction.  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability by finding the region where the area of \( \triangle PBC \) is less than 10.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the probability by finding the region where the area of \( \triangle PBC \) is less than 10.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute the area of the region inside \( \triangle ABC \) where \( y < \frac{5}{2} \). Divide this by the total area of \( \triangle ABC \) to find the probability.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The condition is \( y < \frac{5}{2} \). We need the area within \( \triangle ABC \) where \( y < \frac{5}{2} \).  
Region of \( \triangle ABC \): \( 0 \leq x \leq 8 \), \( 0 \leq y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \).  
Find the intersection of \( y = \frac{5}{2} \) with side \( AB \):  
\[
\frac{5}{2} = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \implies \frac{5}{2} - 5 = -\frac{5}{8}x \implies -\frac{5}{2} = -\frac{5}{8}x \implies x = \frac{\frac{5}{2}}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 4.
\]
Point of intersection: \( (4, \frac{5}{2}) \).  
The region \( y < \frac{5}{2} \) splits into:  
- For \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \), \( y \) from 0 to \( \frac{5}{2} \).  
- For \( 4 < x \leq 8 \), \( y \) from 0 to \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \) (since \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 < \frac{5}{2} \) when \( x > 4 \)).  

Compute the area:  
- **Part 1**: \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \), \( 0 \leq y \leq \frac{5}{2} \). Rectangle area:  
  \[
  4 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = 10.
  \]
- **Part 2**: \( 4 \leq x \leq 8 \), \( 0 \leq y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \). Integrate:  
  \[
  \text{Area} = \int_4^8 \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \right) dx.
  \]
  Antiderivative:  
  \[
  -\frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} + 5x = -\frac{5}{16}x^2 + 5x.
  \]
  Evaluate:  
  \[
  \left[ -\frac{5}{16}x^2 + 5x \right]_4^8 = \left( -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 64 + 40 \right) - \left( -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 16 + 20 \right) = (-20 + 40) - (-5 + 20) = 20 - 15 = 5.
  \]
Total area where \( y < \frac{5}{2} \):  
\[
10 + 5 = 15.
\]
Probability:  
\[
\frac{\text{Area where } y < \frac{5}{2}}{\text{Area of } \triangle ABC} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the probability calculation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use an alternative geometric approach to confirm the region where the area of \( \triangle PBC \) is less than 10, ensuring the probability is \( \frac{3}{4} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider a geometric interpretation. The area of \( \triangle PBC \) is \( 4y \), so \( 4y < 10 \implies y < \frac{5}{2} \). The line \( y = \frac{5}{2} \) divides \( \triangle ABC \).  
Points on \( y = \frac{5}{2} \):  
- At \( x = 0 \), \( y = \frac{5}{2} \), point \( (0, \frac{5}{2}) \).  
- At \( x = 4 \), \( y = \frac{5}{2} \) (from Step 6).  
This line from \( (0, \frac{5}{2}) \) to \( (4, \frac{5}{2}) \) is parallel to \( BC \). The region below is a trapezoid (or triangle-like region).  
Alternatively, scale coordinates: Let \( u = \frac{x}{8} \), \( v = \frac{y}{5} \), so \( \triangle ABC \) maps to a right triangle with vertices \( (0,0) \), \( (1,0) \), \( (0,1) \). Area = \( \frac{1}{2} \).  
Line \( AB \): \( v = 1 - u \). Condition \( y < \frac{5}{2} \implies \frac{y}{5} < \frac{1}{2} \implies v < \frac{1}{2} \).  
Area where \( v < \frac{1}{2} \), \( 0 \leq u \leq 1 \), \( 0 \leq v \leq 1-u \):  
- For \( 0 \leq u \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( v \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Area:  
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
  \]
- For \( \frac{1}{2} \leq u \leq 1 \), \( v \) from 0 to \( 1-u \). Integrate:  
  \[
  \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^1 (1-u) du = \left[ u - \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_{\frac{1}{2}}^1 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{8} \right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{8}.
  \]
Total area:  
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}.
\]
Probability:  
\[
\frac{\frac{3}{8}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
This confirms the probability is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

- **How to Achieve**: Present the probability from the calculations, ensuring it is a common fraction in simplest form.

The probability, calculated and verified, is \( \frac{3}{4} \), a common fraction in simplest form (since 3\) and 4 are coprime).
