### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that the area of triangle \( PBC \), formed by a randomly placed point \( P \) in the interior of right triangle \( ABC \), is less than half the area of triangle \( ABC \). Triangle \( ABC \) has vertices at \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \). The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the coordinates of vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \). Since \( ABC \) is a right triangle with legs along the axes, apply the formula for the area of a right triangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).

[IMP]
Triangle \( ABC \) has vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \). The base \( BC \) lies along the x-axis from \( (0,0) \) to \( (8,0) \), so its length is 8. The height is the y-coordinate of \( A \), which is 5. Thus, the area of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 5 = 20.
\]

Half of this area is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10.
\]

So, we need the area of triangle \( PBC \) to be less than 10.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the area of triangle \( PBC \) to be less than 10.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the coordinates of points \( P(x,y) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \) to compute the area of triangle \( PBC \). Apply the area formula for a triangle given its vertices and set up the inequality for the area being less than 10.

[IMP]
For triangle \( PBC \) with vertices \( P(x,y) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \), we can use the shoelace formula to find the area. The vertices are \( (x,y) \), \( (8,0) \), and \( (0,0) \). The area of triangle \( PBC \) is:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates \( P(x,y) \), \( B(8,0) \), \( C(0,0) \):

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| x(0 - 0) + 8(0 - y) + 0(y - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -8y \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8y = 4y.
\]

Since \( y \geq 0 \) (as \( P \) is inside the triangle), the area is:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = 4y.
\]

We need this area to be less than 10:

\[
4y < 10 \implies y < \frac{10}{4} = 2.5.
\]

Thus, the condition for the area of triangle \( PBC \) to be less than 10 is \( y < 2.5 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define the region where point \( P(x,y) \) lies within triangle \( ABC \).  
**How to Achieve**: Determine the boundaries of triangle \( ABC \) using the coordinates of its vertices and find the equations of its sides to define the region where \( P \) can be placed.

[IMP]
Triangle \( ABC \) has vertices \( A(0,5) \), \( B(8,0) \), and \( C(0,0) \). Point \( P(x,y) \) lies inside the triangle, so we need the equations of the sides to bound the region:

- **Side \( BC \)**: From \( (0,0) \) to \( (8,0) \), along the x-axis, so \( y \geq 0 \).
- **Side \( AC \)**: From \( (0,5) \) to \( (0,0) \), along the y-axis, so \( x \geq 0 \).
- **Side \( AB \)**: From \( A(0,5) \) to \( B(8,0) \). The slope of \( AB \) is:

\[
m = \frac{0 - 5}{8 - 0} = -\frac{5}{8}.
\]

The equation of line \( AB \) using point-slope form at \( A(0,5) \):

\[
y - 5 = -\frac{5}{8}(x - 0) \implies y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5.
\]

For \( P(x,y) \) to be inside or on the boundary of triangle \( ABC \), it must satisfy:

- \( x \geq 0 \) (from side \( AC \)).
- \( y \geq 0 \) (from side \( BC \)).
- \( y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \) (below or on line \( AB \)).

Thus, the region is defined by:

\[
0 \leq x \leq 8, \quad 0 \leq y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5.
\]

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the probability that the area of triangle \( PBC \) is less than half the area of triangle \( ABC \).

  - Subgoal 5: Express the probability as a common fraction.

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability that \( y < 2.5 \) within the region of triangle \( ABC \).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability that \( y < 2.5 \) within the region of triangle \( ABC \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( P \) is randomly placed with uniform distribution in triangle \( ABC \), the probability is the ratio of the area of the region where \( y < 2.5 \) to the total area of triangle \( ABC \). Use geometric methods or integration to find the area where \( y < 2.5 \).

[IMP]
The total area of triangle \( ABC \) is 20 (from Step 2). We need the area of the region inside triangle \( ABC \) where \( y < 2.5 \). The region is bounded by:

- \( x \geq 0 \),
- \( y \geq 0 \),
- \( y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \),
- \( y < 2.5 \).

First, find the x-range where \( y = 2.5 \) intersects the boundary \( y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \):

\[
2.5 = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \implies 2.5 - 5 = -\frac{5}{8}x \implies -2.5 = -\frac{5}{8}x \implies x = \frac{2.5 \cdot 8}{5} = 4.
\]

So, the line \( y = 2.5 \) intersects line \( AB \) at \( (4, 2.5) \). The region where \( y < 2.5 \) within the triangle depends on the x-range:

- For \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \), the upper bound is \( y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \), since \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \geq 2.5 \) when \( x \leq 4 \).
- For \( 4 < x \leq 8 \), the upper bound is \( y = 2.5 \), since \( 2.5 < -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \) for \( x > 4 \).

**Case 1: \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \)**  
The region is from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \). The area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^4 \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \right) dx.
\]

Compute the integral:

\[
\int \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \right) dx = -\frac{5}{16}x^2 + 5x.
\]

Evaluate from 0 to 4:

\[
\left[ -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 16 + 5 \cdot 4 \right] - \left[ 0 \right] = -\frac{5 \cdot 16}{16} + 20 = -5 + 20 = 15.
\]

**Case 2: \( 4 < x \leq 8 \)**  
The region is from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = 2.5 \). The area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_4^8 2.5 \, dx = 2.5 \cdot (8 - 4) = 2.5 \cdot 4 = 10.
\]

Total favorable area:

\[
15 + 10 = 25.
\]

However, this exceeds the area of triangle \( ABC \) (20), indicating an error. Letâ€™s correct by considering only the region where \( y < 2.5 \). The correct approach is to find the area where \( y < 2.5 \) and \( y \leq -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \):

For \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( \min(2.5, -\frac{5}{8}x + 5) \). Since \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \geq 2.5 \) for \( x \leq 4 \), the upper bound is \( y = 2.5 \). Thus, the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^4 2.5 \, dx = 2.5 \cdot 4 = 10.
\]

For \( 4 < x \leq 8 \), \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 < 2.5 \), so the upper bound is \( y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \). The area is:

\[
\int_4^8 \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \right) dx.
\]

Evaluate:

\[
\left[ -\frac{5}{16}x^2 + 5x \right]_4^8 = \left( -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 64 + 5 \cdot 8 \right) - \left( -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 16 + 5 \cdot 4 \right) = (-20 + 40) - (-5 + 20) = 20 - 15 = 5.
\]

Total favorable area:

\[
10 + 5 = 15.
\]

Probability:

\[
\frac{\text{Favorable area}}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the probability calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the favorable area geometrically to confirm the result and ensure the fraction is in simplest form.

[IMP]
Consider the region geometrically. The line \( y = 2.5 \) divides triangle \( ABC \). Points below \( y = 2.5 \) form a region bounded by:

- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and the line \( y = 2.5 \) up to \( x = 4 \), then along \( y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \) from \( x = 4 \) to \( x = 8 \).

Alternatively, consider the complementary region where \( y \geq 2.5 \):

- From \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 4 \), \( y \) ranges from 2.5 to \( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \).

Area:

\[
\int_0^4 \left( \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 5 \right) - 2.5 \right) dx = \int_0^4 \left( -\frac{5}{8}x + 2.5 \right) dx.
\]

\[
= \left[ -\frac{5}{16}x^2 + 2.5x \right]_0^4 = \left( -\frac{5}{16} \cdot 16 + 2.5 \cdot 4 \right) = -5 + 10 = 5.
\]

Complementary probability:

\[
\frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Desired probability:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

This confirms the result. The fraction \( \frac{3}{4} \) is in simplest form.
