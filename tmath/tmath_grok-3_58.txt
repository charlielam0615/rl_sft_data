**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \(\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)}\) given the system of equations for real numbers \(x, y, z\):
\[
y + z = 13, \quad z + x = 14, \quad x + y = 15.
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find \(x, y, z\).  
2. Compute the product \(xyz\).  
3. Compute the sum \(x + y + z\).  
4. Calculate \(xyz(x + y + z)\).  
5. Take the square root to find \(\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(y + z = 13\), \(z + x = 14\), \(x + y = 15\) to find \(x, y, z\). This can be achieved by adding all equations to find \(x + y + z\), then using substitution or elimination to solve for individual variables.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the three equations:  
\[
(y + z) + (z + x) + (x + y) = 13 + 14 + 15
\]
\[
2x + 2y + 2z = 42 \implies x + y + z = 21.
\]
Now, solve for each variable using \(x + y + z = 21\) and the given equations. Subtract the first equation from this sum:  
\[
(x + y + z) - (y + z) = 21 - 13 \implies x = 8.
\]
Subtract the second equation:  
\[
(x + y + z) - (z + x) = 21 - 14 \implies y = 7.
\]
Subtract the third equation:  
\[
(x + y + z) - (x + y) = 21 - 15 \implies z = 6.
\]
Thus, \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 6\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the values \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 6\) satisfy all equations. This can be achieved by substituting these values into each equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the equations:  
- \(y + z = 7 + 6 = 13\), which satisfies \(y + z = 13\).  
- \(z + x = 6 + 8 = 14\), which satisfies \(z + x = 14\).  
- \(x + y = 8 + 7 = 15\), which satisfies \(x + y = 15\).  
The solution \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 6\) is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \(x, y, z\) (completed: \(x = 8, y = 7, z = 6\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(xyz\) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(x + y + z\) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate \(xyz(x + y + z)\) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the square root (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(xyz\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(xyz\) using \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 6\). This can be achieved by multiplying these values.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
xyz = 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(x + y + z\) using \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 6\). This can be achieved by adding these values.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
x + y + z = 8 + 7 + 6 = 21.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate \(xyz(x + y + z)\) using \(xyz = 336\) and \(x + y + z = 21\). This can be achieved by multiplying these results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
xyz(x + y + z) = 336 \times 21 = 7056.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \(\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}\) using \(xyz(x + y + z) = 7056\). This can be achieved by taking the square root.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)} = \sqrt{7056}.
\]
Factorize 7056:  
\[
7056 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 7^2.
\]
\[
\sqrt{7056} = \sqrt{2^4 \times 3^2 \times 7^2} = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 = 4 \times 3 \times 7 = 84.
\]
Thus, \(\sqrt{7056} = 84\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify \(\sqrt{7056} = 84\). This can be achieved by squaring 84 and checking if it equals 7056.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
84^2 = (80 + 4)^2 = 80^2 + 2 \times 80 \times 4 + 4^2 = 6400 + 640 + 16 = 7056.
\]
The result is correct.
