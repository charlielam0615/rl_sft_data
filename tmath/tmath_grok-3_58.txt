**Problem Restatement**: We are given a system of equations involving three real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
- \(y + z = 13\)
- \(z + x = 14\)
- \(x + y = 15\)
We need to find the value of \(\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)}\).

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), and then compute the required expression. The subgoals are:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).  
2. Calculate the sum \(x + y + z\).  
3. Compute the product \(xyz\).  
4. Evaluate the expression inside the square root, \(xyz(x + y + z)\).  
5. Take the square root of the result to find the final answer.

**Step 2**

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).  
How to Achieve: Add all three equations to find \(x + y + z\), then use this to solve for each variable by subtracting the appropriate equation from the sum.

[IMP]  
Adding the three equations:  
\((y + z) + (z + x) + (x + y) = 13 + 14 + 15\)  
\(2x + 2y + 2z = 42\)  
\(x + y + z = 21\)  

Now, solve for each variable:  
- \(x = (x + y + z) - (y + z) = 21 - 13 = 8\)  
- \(y = (x + y + z) - (z + x) = 21 - 14 = 7\)  
- \(z = (x + y + z) - (x + y) = 21 - 15 = 6\)  

So, \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), and \(z = 6\).

**Step 4**

Current Goal: Calculate \(x + y + z\).  
How to Achieve: Use the previously computed sum of the variables from the system of equations.

From the earlier step, we have \(x + y + z = 21\).

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute the product \(xyz\).  
How to Achieve: Multiply the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) obtained earlier.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using \(x = 8\), \(y = 7\), and \(z = 6\):  
\(xyz = 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Evaluate the expression \(xyz(x + y + z)\).  
How to Achieve: Multiply the product \(xyz\) by the sum \(x + y + z\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have \(xyz = 336\) and \(x + y + z = 21\):  
\(xyz(x + y + z) = 336 \times 21 = 7056\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute the square root of \(xyz(x + y + z)\).  
How to Achieve: Take the square root of the result obtained in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have \(xyz(x + y + z) = 7056\):  
\(\sqrt{7056} = 84\).  
Therefore, \(\sqrt{xyz(x + y + z)} = 84\).
