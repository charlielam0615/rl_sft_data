Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the problem: We are given a quadratic equation $kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0$ and its solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -\frac{4}{3}$. We need to find the value of $k$.
2. Use the fact that if $x = a$ is a solution to the quadratic equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$, then it must satisfy the equation.
3. Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation to form an equation in terms of $k$.
4. Substitute $x = -\frac{4}{3}$ into the equation to form another equation in terms of $k$.
5. Solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of $k$.

Goal of this step: Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation $kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0$ to form an equation in terms of $k$.

[IMP]
Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation:
$$
k(3)^2 - 5(3) - 12 = 0
$$
$$
9k - 15 - 12 = 0
$$
$$
9k - 27 = 0
$$
$$
9k = 27
$$
$$
k = 3

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $ x = -\frac{4}{3} $ into the equation $ kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 $ to form another equation in terms of $ k $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = -\frac{4}{3} $ into the equation:  
$$
k\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 - 5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) - 12 = 0
$$  
$$
k\left(\frac{16}{9}\right) + \frac{20}{3} - 12 = 0
$$  
$$
\frac{16k}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - 12 = 0
$$  
Simplify the constants:  
$$
\frac{20}{3} - 12 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{36}{3} = -\frac{16}{3}
$$  
Now the equation becomes:  
$$
\frac{16k}{9} - \frac{16}{3} = 0
$$  
Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the denominators:  
$$
16k - 48 = 0
$$  
$$
16k = 48
$$  
$$
k = 3
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the consistency of k=3 derived from both roots and validate the quadratic equation with k=3.

[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of k=3 from x=3:**
   - Original equation: $3x^2 -5x -12 = 0$ with $k=3$.
   - Substitute $x=3$: $3(3)^2 -5(3) -12 = 27 -15 -12 = 0$. ✔️

2. **Verification of k=3 from $x=-\frac{4}{3}$:**
   - Substitute $x=-\frac{4}{3}$ into $3x^2 -5x -12 = 0$:
     $$
     3\left(\frac{16}{9}\right) -5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) -12 = \frac{48}{9} + \frac{20}{3} -12
     $$
     Convert to common denominator (9):
     $$
     \frac{48}{9} + \frac{60}{9} - \frac{108}{9} = \frac{0}{9} = 0
     $$
     ✔️

3. **Consistency check:**
   - Both roots satisfy the equation when $k=3$. No contradictions detected.
   - The quadratic equation with $k=3$ factors as $(x-3)(3x+4) = 3x^2 -5x -12$, confirming the roots. ✔️

All steps validate $k=3$ as the correct solution. No errors detected.
