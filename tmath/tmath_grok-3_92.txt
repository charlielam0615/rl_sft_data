### Problem Statement
We need to find integers \( G \) and \( H \) such that the equation

\[
\frac{G}{x+5} + \frac{H}{x^2 - 4x} = \frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x^3 + x^2 - 20x}
\]

holds for all real values of \( x \) except \( x = -5, 0, 4 \), and then compute the ratio \( \frac{H}{G} \).

### Step 1: Understand the equation and set the goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( \frac{H}{G} \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation by rewriting the denominators to have a common form.  
2. Set up an equation by equating numerators after combining the left-hand side over a common denominator.  
3. Solve for \( G \) and \( H \) by comparing coefficients or substituting values.  
4. Compute the ratio \( \frac{H}{G} \).

### Step 2: Simplify the denominators

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the denominators of both sides of the equation to facilitate comparison. Achieve this by factoring the denominators and finding a common denominator for the left-hand side.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The right-hand side denominator is \( x^3 + x^2 - 20x \). Factorize it:  
\[
x^3 + x^2 - 20x = x(x^2 + x - 20) = x(x + 5)(x - 4).
\]

The left-hand side denominators are:  
- \( x + 5 \),  
- \( x^2 - 4x = x(x - 4) \).

The common denominator for the left-hand side is \( x(x - 4)(x + 5) \), which matches the right-hand side denominator. Rewrite the left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{G}{x + 5} + \frac{H}{x(x - 4)}.
\]
Multiply the first term by \( x(x - 4) / x(x - 4) \) and the second by \( (x + 5) / (x + 5) \):  
\[
\frac{G \cdot x(x - 4) + H \cdot (x + 5)}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
The equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5)}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
Since the denominators are equal, equate the numerators:  
\[
G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10.
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 3: Review the equation setup

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the equation \( G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10 \) is correctly set up by checking the denominators and ensuring the equation holds for permissible values of \( x \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The common denominator \( x(x - 4)(x + 5) \) matches the factored form of \( x^3 + x^2 - 20x \). The equation is undefined at \( x = -5, 0, 4 \), consistent with the problem statement. Test the numerator equation at a permissible value, e.g., \( x = 1 \):  
This requires values of \( G \) and \( H \), which we donâ€™t have yet, so defer numerical validation until after solving. The algebraic setup appears correct since the denominators align, and the numerators are equated.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4: Solve for \( G \) and \( H \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( G \) and \( H \) using the equation \( G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10 \) by expanding the left-hand side and comparing coefficients with the right-hand side.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\[
G x(x - 4) = G x^2 - 4G x,  
\]
\[
H (x + 5) = H x + 5H.
\]
Combine:  
\[
G x^2 - 4G x + H x + 5H = G x^2 + (-4G + H) x + 5H.
\]
The right-hand side is \( x^2 - 2x + 10 \). Equate and compare coefficients:  
\[
G x^2 + (-4G + H) x + 5H = x^2 - 2x + 10.
\]
Coefficient of \( x^2 \):  
\[
G = 1.
\]
Coefficient of \( x \):  
\[
-4G + H = -2.
\]
Substitute \( G = 1 \):  
\[
-4(1) + H = -2 \implies -4 + H = -2 \implies H = 2.
\]
Constant term:  
\[
5H = 10.
\]
\[
5 \cdot 2 = 10, \text{ which is consistent.}
\]
Thus, \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \).  

[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validate the solution

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \) by substituting into the numerator equation and checking if it holds for a permissible value of \( x \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \) into \( G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) \):  
\[
1 \cdot x(x - 4) + 2 (x + 5) = x^2 - 4x + 2x + 10 = x^2 - 2x + 10.
\]
This matches the right-hand side numerator. Test at \( x = 1 \):  
Left-hand side:  
\[
1 \cdot 1(1 - 4) + 2(1 + 5) = 1 \cdot (-3) + 2 \cdot 6 = -3 + 12 = 9.
\]
Right-hand side:  
\[
1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 10 = 1 - 2 + 10 = 9.
\]
The equation holds, confirming the solution.

### Step 6: Compute the final answer

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( \frac{H}{G} \) using \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[
\frac{H}{G} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
\]

[/IMP]

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
