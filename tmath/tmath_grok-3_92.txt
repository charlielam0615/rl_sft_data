### Problem Restatement
We need to find the integers \( G \) and \( H \) such that the equation
\[
\frac{G}{x+5} + \frac{H}{x^2 - 4x} = \frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x^3 + x^2 - 20x}
\]
holds for all real values of \( x \) except \( x = -5 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = 4 \). Then, compute the ratio \( H/G \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Simplify the given equation by working with the denominators to ensure they match.
2. Rewrite the left-hand side with a common denominator.
3. Equate the numerators of both sides after obtaining a common denominator.
4. Solve for \( G \) and \( H \) by comparing coefficients or substituting values.
5. Compute the ratio \( H/G \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to simplify the denominators and rewrite the equation. Achieve this by factoring the denominators on both sides to identify a common denominator.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factor the denominators:
- Left-hand side:
  - \( x + 5 \) is already factored.
  - \( x^2 - 4x = x(x - 4) \).
- Right-hand side:
  - \( x^3 + x^2 - 20x = x(x^2 + x - 20) = x(x + 5)(x - 4) \).

The common denominator for the left-hand side is \( x(x - 4)(x + 5) \). Rewrite the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{G}{x + 5} + \frac{H}{x(x - 4)} = \frac{G \cdot x(x - 4) + H \cdot (x + 5)}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
The right-hand side is:
\[
\frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
Since the denominators match, equate the numerators:
\[
G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve for \( G \) and \( H \) using the numerator equation \( G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10 \). Achieve this by expanding the left-hand side and comparing coefficients of the polynomials.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the left-hand side:
\[
G x(x - 4) + H (x + 5) = G (x^2 - 4x) + H x + 5H = G x^2 - 4G x + H x + 5H = G x^2 + (H - 4G) x + 5H.
\]
Equate to the right-hand side \( x^2 - 2x + 10 \):
\[
G x^2 + (H - 4G) x + 5H = x^2 - 2x + 10.
\]
Compare coefficients:
- \( x^2 \): \( G = 1 \).
- \( x \): \( H - 4G = -2 \).
- Constant: \( 5H = 10 \).

Solve:
- From \( G = 1 \), substitute into the second equation:
  \[
  H - 4 \cdot 1 = -2 \implies H - 4 = -2 \implies H = 2.
  \]
- Check the constant term:
  \[
  5H = 10 \implies H = \frac{10}{5} = 2.
  \]
Thus, \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \) satisfies the original equation. Achieve this by substituting \( G \) and \( H \) back into the left-hand side and checking if it equals the right-hand side.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( G = 1 \), \( H = 2 \):
\[
\frac{1}{x + 5} + \frac{2}{x(x - 4)}.
\]
With the common denominator \( x(x - 4)(x + 5) \):
\[
\frac{x(x - 4) + 2 (x + 5)}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)} = \frac{x^2 - 4x + 2x + 10}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)} = \frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
This matches the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x - 4)(x + 5)}.
\]
The solution is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute the ratio \( H/G \). Achieve this by dividing \( H \) by \( G \) using the values found.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\frac{H}{G} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
\]
[/IMP]
