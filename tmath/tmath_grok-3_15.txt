**Problem Statement**: The taxi fare is directly proportional to the distance traveled. Ann is charged $120 for traveling 50 miles. We need to determine the fare for traveling 70 miles.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the fare for 70 miles:  
1. Determine the fare per mile using the given data (50 miles for $120).  
2. Use the fare per mile to calculate the fare for 70 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the fare per mile.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the total fare ($120) by the distance traveled (50 miles) to find the cost per mile.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the fare per mile:  
Fare per mile = Total fare ÷ Distance  
= $120 ÷ 50 miles  
= $2.4 per mile.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the fare for 70 miles.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the fare per mile ($2.4) by the distance (70 miles) to find the total fare.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total fare = Fare per mile × Distance  
= $2.4 × 70  
= $168.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated fare for 70 miles.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the fare per mile ($2.4) is consistent with the given data and confirm the calculation for 70 miles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the fare per mile: $120 ÷ 50 = $2.4 per mile.  
Recalculate for 70 miles: $2.4 × 70 = $168.  
To ensure correctness, check proportionality: For 50 miles, $2.4 × 50 = $120, which matches the given fare. The calculation for 70 miles is consistent.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the fare for 70 miles.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the fare per mile (completed: $2.4 per mile).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the fare for 70 miles (completed: $168).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: calculation is consistent).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, solution reached).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Ann would be charged $168 for traveling 70 miles.
