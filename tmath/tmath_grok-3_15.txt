**Problem Restatement**: Ann is charged $120 for a 50-mile taxi ride, and the fare is directly proportional to the distance traveled. We need to determine the fare for a 70-mile trip.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the taxi fare per mile based on the given 50-mile trip costing $120.  
2. Use the fare per mile to calculate the cost for a 70-mile trip.  
3. Ensure the calculation aligns with the direct proportionality assumption.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the fare per mile for the taxi ride.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the total fare ($120) by the distance traveled (50 miles) to find the cost per mile.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the fare per mile, perform the calculation:  
\[ \text{Fare per mile} = \frac{120}{50} = 2.4 \text{ dollars per mile} \]  
The taxi fare is $2.4 per mile.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the fare for a 70-mile trip.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the fare per mile ($2.4) by the distance (70 miles) to find the total fare.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the fare for 70 miles, perform the calculation:  
\[ \text{Total fare} = 2.4 \times 70 = 168 \text{ dollars} \]  
The fare for a 70-mile trip is $168.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation aligns with the direct proportionality assumption.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the ratio of fare to distance is consistent for both trips and confirm the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, check the proportionality:  
- For 50 miles, fare = $120, so the ratio is \( \frac{120}{50} = 2.4 \) dollars per mile.  
- For 70 miles, fare = $168, so the ratio is \( \frac{168}{70} = 2.4 \) dollars per mile.  
The ratios are equal, confirming direct proportionality. The calculation is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the fare for a 70-mile taxi trip.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the fare per mile (completed: $2.4 per mile).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the fare for 70 miles (completed: $168).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: ratios are consistent).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The final answer is $168 for a 70-mile trip.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Ann would be charged $168 for a 70-mile taxi trip.
