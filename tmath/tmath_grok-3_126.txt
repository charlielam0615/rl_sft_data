### Problem Restatement
We need to find the current \( I \) in the equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V = 1 - i \) is the voltage, \( Z = 1 + 3i \) is the impedance, and \( I \) is the current. The answer should be a complex number in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( I \), we need to isolate \( I \) in the equation \( V = IZ \). This suggests dividing both sides by \( Z \), giving \( I = \frac{V}{Z} \). The subgoals are:
1. Compute the division \( \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \).
2. Simplify the result to the form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( I = \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \).
How to Achieve: To divide complex numbers, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (\( 1 - 3i \)) to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, then simplify.

[IMP]
Perform the division:
\[
I = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \cdot \frac{1 - 3i}{1 - 3i} = \frac{(1 - i)(1 - 3i)}{(1 + 3i)(1 - 3i)}.
\]
Numerator:
\[
(1 - i)(1 - 3i) = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-3i) + (-i) \cdot 1 + (-i) \cdot (-3i) = 1 - 3i - i + 3i^2 = 1 - 4i + 3(-1) = 1 - 4i - 3 = -2 - 4i.
\]
Denominator:
\[
(1 + 3i)(1 - 3i) = 1^2 - (3i)^2 = 1 - 9i^2 = 1 - 9(-1) = 1 + 9 = 10.
\]
So:
\[
I = \frac{-2 - 4i}{10} = \frac{-2}{10} - \frac{4i}{10} = -0.2 - 0.4i.
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the result \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \) and \( Z = 1 + 3i \) back into \( V = IZ \) and check if the result equals \( V = 1 - i \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \( V = IZ \):
\[
I = -0.2 - 0.4i, \quad Z = 1 + 3i.
\]
\[
V = (-0.2 - 0.4i)(1 + 3i) = (-0.2) \cdot 1 + (-0.2) \cdot 3i + (-0.4i) \cdot 1 + (-0.4i) \cdot 3i.
\]
\[
= -0.2 - 0.6i - 0.4i - 1.2i^2 = -0.2 - (0.6 + 0.4)i - 1.2(-1) = -0.2 - i + 1.2 = 1 - i.
\]
This matches \( V = 1 - i \), confirming the solution is correct.
