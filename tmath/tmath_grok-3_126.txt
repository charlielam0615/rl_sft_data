### Problem Restatement
We need to find the current \( I \) in the equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V = 1 - i \) (voltage), \( Z = 1 + 3i \) (impedance), and \( I \) is the current. The answer should be expressed as a complex number in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( I \) in \( V = IZ \), we need to isolate \( I \). This suggests dividing both sides of the equation by \( Z \). Thus, the forward-looking subgoals are:  
1. Rearrange the equation to solve for \( I \), i.e., \( I = \frac{V}{Z} \).  
2. Compute the division \( \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \).  
3. Simplify the result to the form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( I = \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \). To achieve this, we will perform complex number division by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.

[IMP]  
To compute \( I = \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \), multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, \( 1 - 3i \):  

\[
\frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \cdot \frac{1 - 3i}{1 - 3i} = \frac{(1 - i)(1 - 3i)}{(1 + 3i)(1 - 3i)}
\]

**Numerator**:  
\[
(1 - i)(1 - 3i) = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-3i) + (-i) \cdot 1 + (-i) \cdot (-3i) = 1 - 3i - i + 3i^2
\]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( 3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3 \). Thus:  
\[
1 - 3i - i - 3 = 1 - 3 - 4i = -2 - 4i
\]

**Denominator**:  
\[
(1 + 3i)(1 - 3i) = 1^2 - (3i)^2 = 1 - 9i^2 = 1 - 9(-1) = 1 + 9 = 10
\]

So:  
\[
I = \frac{-2 - 4i}{10} = \frac{-2}{10} - \frac{4i}{10} = -0.2 - 0.4i
\]

The result is \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \) satisfies the original equation \( V = IZ \). We will substitute \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \) and \( Z = 1 + 3i \) into the equation and check if the result equals \( V = 1 - i \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( IZ \):  
\[
I = -0.2 - 0.4i, \quad Z = 1 + 3i
\]
\[
IZ = (-0.2 - 0.4i)(1 + 3i) = (-0.2) \cdot 1 + (-0.2) \cdot 3i + (-0.4i) \cdot 1 + (-0.4i) \cdot 3i
\]
\[
= -0.2 - 0.6i - 0.4i - 1.2i^2
\]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( -1.2i^2 = -1.2(-1) = 1.2 \). Thus:  
\[
-0.2 - 0.6i - 0.4i + 1.2 = (-0.2 + 1.2) + (-0.6i - 0.4i) = 1 - i
\]
This matches \( V = 1 - i \), confirming the solution is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( I \) in \( V = IZ \) and express it as \( a + bi \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rearrange the equation to \( I = \frac{V}{Z} \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( \frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \) (completed, result: \( -0.2 - 0.4i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result by checking \( IZ = V \) (completed, verified correct).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as we have computed \( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \) and verified it. No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The current \( I \) is \( -0.2 - 0.4i \).  
Thus, the answer is:  
\[
\boxed{-0.2 - 0.4i}
