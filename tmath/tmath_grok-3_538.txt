**Problem Statement**: Determine the initial investment amount required to grow to $500,000 in 10 years at an annually compounded interest rate of 5%. The answer should be a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for compound interest to calculate the present value.  
2. Gather the given values (future value, interest rate, time period, compounding frequency).  
3. Apply the formula to compute the initial investment.  
4. Round the result to the nearest cent.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the formula for compound interest and apply it to find the present value.  
How to Achieve: Use the compound interest formula for present value, \( P = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n} \), where \( P \) is the present value, \( F \) is the future value, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( n \) is the number of years, since the problem specifies annual compounding.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula for annually compounded interest to find the present value is:  
\[ P = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n} \]  
Given:  
- Future value, \( F = 500,000 \)  
- Annual interest rate, \( r = 5\% = 0.05 \)  
- Time, \( n = 10 \) years  
- Compounding is annual, so one period per year.  

Substitute the values:  
\[ P = \frac{500,000}{(1 + 0.05)^{10}} = \frac{500,000}{(1.05)^{10}} \]  

Calculate \( (1.05)^{10} \):  
\[ (1.05)^{10} \approx 1.628894626777441 \]  

Compute the present value:  
\[ P = \frac{500,000}{1.628894626777441} \approx 306,957.774 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated present value to ensure correctness.  
How to Achieve: Use the future value formula \( F = P (1 + r)^n \) to check if the computed present value grows to $500,000 in 10 years at 5% interest.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the future value formula:  
\[ F = P (1 + r)^n \]  
From Step 2, \( P \approx 306,957.774 \), \( r = 0.05 \), \( n = 10 \).  

Calculate:  
\[ F = 306,957.774 \times (1.05)^{10} \]  
\[ (1.05)^{10} \approx 1.628894626777441 \]  
\[ F \approx 306,957.774 \times 1.628894626777441 \approx 500,000 \]  

The calculation confirms that the present value is correct, as it yields approximately $500,000.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Round the present value to the nearest cent.  
How to Achieve: Take the computed present value from Step 2 and round it to two decimal places.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The present value from Step 2 is approximately $306,957.774.  
Rounding to the nearest cent (two decimal places):  
\[ 306,957.774 \rightarrow 306,957.77 \]
