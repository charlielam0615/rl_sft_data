**Problem Statement**: Calculate the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die, which has 8 faces numbered from 1 to 8, and express the answer as a decimal.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the expected value of a fair octahedral die, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the expected value for a discrete random variable.  
2. Identify the probabilities and outcomes for the die roll.  
3. Compute the expected value using the formula.  
4. Express the result as a decimal.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the expected value for a discrete random variable.  
How to Achieve: Recall the mathematical definition of expected value for a discrete random variable and state it clearly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expected value \( E(X) \) of a discrete random variable \( X \) is the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability. For a fair die, this is expressed as \( E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot P(x_i) \), where \( x_i \) are the outcomes and \( P(x_i) \) is the probability of each outcome.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the probabilities and outcomes for the die roll.  
How to Achieve: Determine the possible outcomes of the octahedral die and their associated probabilities, assuming the die is fair.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
An octahedral die has 8 faces, numbered from 1 to 8. Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up. Thus, the probability of each outcome is \( P(x_i) = \frac{1}{8} \), and the outcomes are \( x_i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the expected value using the formula.  
How to Achieve: Apply the expected value formula \( E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^8 x_i \cdot \frac{1}{8} \) using the outcomes and probabilities identified.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the formula \( E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^8 x_i \cdot \frac{1}{8} \), compute:  
\( E(X) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 7 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} \)  
\( = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{8} \)  
\( = \frac{36}{8} = 4.5 \)  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the expected value calculation.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the expected value using an alternative approach (e.g., the average of outcomes) and confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a fair die with faces numbered consecutively from 1 to \( n \), the expected value can also be computed as the average of the outcomes: \( E(X) = \frac{1 + n}{2} \). For an octahedral die (\( n = 8 \)):  
\( E(X) = \frac{1 + 8}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \).  
This matches the result from Step 4, confirming the calculation.
