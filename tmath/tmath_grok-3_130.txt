### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\) for \(x\). To achieve this, isolate one square root, square both sides to eliminate square roots, simplify, and solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\), let’s isolate one square root:

\[
\sqrt{5 + x} = 7 - \sqrt{20 - x}
\]

Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:

\[
(\sqrt{5 + x})^2 = (7 - \sqrt{20 - x})^2
\]

\[
5 + x = 49 - 14\sqrt{20 - x} + (20 - x)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
5 + x = 49 + 20 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]

\[
5 + x = 69 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]

Move terms involving \(x\) to one side and constants to the other:

\[
x + x + 14\sqrt{20 - x} = 69 - 5
\]

\[
2x + 14\sqrt{20 - x} = 64
\]

Divide through by 2:

\[
x + 7\sqrt{20 - x} = 32
\]

Isolate the square root:

\[
7\sqrt{20 - x} = 32 - x
\]

\[
\sqrt{20 - x} = \frac{32 - x}{7}
\]

Square both sides again to eliminate the remaining square root:

\[
20 - x = \left(\frac{32 - x}{7}\right)^2
\]

\[
20 - x = \frac{(32 - x)^2}{49}
\]

Multiply through by 49 to clear the denominator:

\[
49(20 - x) = (32 - x)^2
\]

\[
980 - 49x = 1024 - 64x + x^2
\]

Rearrange all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 64x + 49x + 1024 - 980 = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 15x + 44 = 0
\]

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -15\), \(c = 44\):

\[
x = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{(-15)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 44}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{225 - 176}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{15 \pm 7}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{15 + 7}{2} = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{15 - 7}{2} = 4
\]

We have two potential solutions: \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) satisfy the original equation \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\) and check the domain constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, check the domain of the equation. Since we have square roots, the expressions inside must be non-negative:

- \(5 + x \geq 0 \implies x \geq -5\)
- \(20 - x \geq 0 \implies x \leq 20\)

Thus, \(-5 \leq x \leq 20\). Both \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) satisfy this domain.

Now, substitute each solution into the original equation:

**For \(x = 4\)**:

\[
\sqrt{5 + 4} + \sqrt{20 - 4} = \sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} = 3 + 4 = 7
\]

This satisfies the equation.

**For \(x = 11\)**:

\[
\sqrt{5 + 11} + \sqrt{20 - 11} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{9} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

This also satisfies the equation.

Both solutions are valid. Now, compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) for each:

**For \(x = 4\)**:

\[
(5 + 4)(20 - 4) = 9 \cdot 16 = 144
\]

**For \(x = 11\)**:

\[
(5 + 11)(20 - 11) = 16 \cdot 9 = 144
\]

Interestingly, both solutions yield the same value.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Solve \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\) and compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the equation for \(x\) (completed: \(x = 4, 11\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) (completed: 144 for both solutions).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions (completed: both solutions valid).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the consistency of the result.

The solutions \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) both produce \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\), suggesting the expression’s value is consistent regardless of the solution chosen. This consistency may indicate that \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) is invariant for valid solutions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final value of \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) and confirm it as the answer. Since both solutions give the same result, we can also explore if this can be computed directly without solving for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Notice that \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 100 + 15x - x^2\). However, let’s try to compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) directly using the original equation. From the equation \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\), let:

\[
a = \sqrt{5 + x}, \quad b = \sqrt{20 - x}
\]

So, \(a + b = 7\). Then:

\[
a^2 = 5 + x, \quad b^2 = 20 - x
\]

\[
a^2 + b^2 = (5 + x) + (20 - x) = 25
\]

We need \((5 + x)(20 - x)\):

\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = a^2 \cdot b^2
\]

Use the identity:

\[
(a^2 + b^2)^2 = a^4 + 2a^2 b^2 + b^4
\]

\[
a^4 + b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)^2 - 2a^2 b^2
\]

\[
a^4 + b^4 = 25^2 - 2a^2 b^2 = 625 - 2a^2 b^2
\]

Since \(a + b = 7\), we also have:

\[
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]

\[
7^2 = 25 + 2ab
\]

\[
49 = 25 + 2ab
\]

\[
2ab = 24 \implies ab = 12
\]

Thus:

\[
a^2 b^2 = (ab)^2 = 12^2 = 144
\]

So:

\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = a^2 \cdot b^2 = 144
\]

This confirms the result without needing the specific values of \(x\).

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the direct computation of \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\) and ensure it aligns with previous results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The direct method using \(a = \sqrt{5 + x}\), \(b = \sqrt{20 - x}\), and \(a + b = 7\) yielded \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\), which matches the results from \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\). To further confirm, note that the domain \(-5 \leq x \leq 20\) and the equation’s structure suggest a quadratic relationship, and the consistent result across methods reinforces confidence in the answer.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) is \(144\).

\[
\boxed{144}
\]
