**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the given equation \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\) for \(x\).  
2. Use the value of \(x\) to compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\) for \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Isolate one square root, square both sides to eliminate radicals, simplify, and solve the resulting equation for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s solve \(\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7\).  
Isolate one square root:  
\[
\sqrt{5 + x} = 7 - \sqrt{20 - x}
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:  
\[
(\sqrt{5 + x})^2 = (7 - \sqrt{20 - x})^2
\]
\[
5 + x = 49 - 14\sqrt{20 - x} + (20 - x)
\]
Simplify:  
\[
5 + x = 49 + 20 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]
\[
5 + x = 69 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]
Move terms involving \(x\) and constants to one side:  
\[
x + x = 69 - 5 - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]
\[
2x = 64 - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
\]
Divide through by 2:  
\[
x = 32 - 7\sqrt{20 - x}
\]
Let \(u = \sqrt{20 - x}\), so \(u^2 = 20 - x\) and \(x = 20 - u^2\). Substitute into the equation:  
\[
20 - u^2 = 32 - 7u
\]
Rearrange:  
\[
u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:  
\[
u = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 48}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 1}{2}
\]
\[
u = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad u = 3
\]
Since \(u = \sqrt{20 - x}\), compute \(x\):  
- If \(u = 4\), then \(u^2 = 16\), so \(20 - x = 16 \implies x = 4\).  
- If \(u = 3\), then \(u^2 = 9\), so \(20 - x = 9 \implies x = 11\).  

Check both solutions in the original equation:  
- For \(x = 4\):  
  \[
  \sqrt{5 + 4} + \sqrt{20 - 4} = \sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} = 3 + 4 = 7
  \]
  This satisfies the equation.  
- For \(x = 11\):  
  \[
  \sqrt{5 + 11} + \sqrt{20 - 11} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{9} = 4 + 3 = 7
  \]
  This also satisfies the equation.  

Both \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) are valid solutions.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) using the values of \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) into \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \(x = 4\):  
\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = (5 + 4)(20 - 4) = 9 \cdot 16 = 144
\]
For \(x = 11\):  
\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = (5 + 11)(20 - 11) = 16 \cdot 9 = 144
\]
In both cases, \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\) holds consistently and confirm the domain of \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The domain of \(x\) requires \(5 + x \geq 0\) and \(20 - x \geq 0\), so \(-5 \leq x \leq 20\). Both \(x = 4\) and \(x = 11\) are within this domain.  
The expression \((5 + x)(20 - x)\) simplifies to:  
\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = 100 + 15x - x^2
\]
However, we notice both solutions yield 144, suggesting the expression’s value may be independent of the specific \(x\). Let’s express \((5 + x)(20 - x)\):  
\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = 100 + 20x - 5x - x^2 = 100 + 15x - x^2
\]
To confirm, use the original equation. Let \(a = \sqrt{5 + x}\), \(b = \sqrt{20 - x}\), so \(a + b = 7\). Then:  
\[
5 + x = a^2, \quad 20 - x = b^2
\]
\[
(5 + x)(20 - x) = a^2 \cdot b^2 = (ab)^2
\]
Since \(a + b = 7\), we need \(ab\). From Step 2:  
\[
x = 32 - 7\sqrt{20 - x} \implies 2x = 64 - 14b \implies 2(20 - b^2) = 64 - 14b
\]
\[
40 - 2b^2 = 64 - 14b \implies 2b^2 - 14b + 24 = 0 \implies b^2 - 7b + 12 = 0
\]
\[
(b - 4)(b - 3) = 0 \implies b = 4 \text{ or } 3
\]
If \(b = 4\), then \(a = 7 - 4 = 3\), so \(ab = 4 \cdot 3 = 12\).  
If \(b = 3\), then \(a = 7 - 3 = 4\), so \(ab = 3 \cdot 4 = 12\).  
Thus, \((ab)^2 = 12^2 = 144\). This confirms \((5 + x)(20 - x) = 144\) for both solutions.
