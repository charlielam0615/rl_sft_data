**Problem Statement**: Find the largest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the absolute value equation and set up two cases based on the definition of absolute value.  
2. Solve each case to find possible values of \( x \).  
3. Identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the absolute value equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \). Achieve this by setting up two equations based on the absolute value: \( x - 5 = 12 \) and \( x - 5 = -12 \), then solving each for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The absolute value equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \) means the expression inside the absolute value, \( x - 5 \), is either 12 or -12. This gives two cases:  
- **Case 1**: \( x - 5 = 12 \)  
  Solving:  
  \( x - 5 = 12 \)  
  \( x = 12 + 5 \)  
  \( x = 17 \)  
- **Case 2**: \( x - 5 = -12 \)  
  Solving:  
  \( x - 5 = -12 \)  
  \( x = -12 + 5 \)  
  \( x = -7 \)  
Thus, the solutions are \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \) satisfy the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \). Achieve this by substituting each value back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For \( x = 17 \):  
  \( |17 - 5| = |12| = 12 \), which satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x = -7 \):  
  \( |-7 - 5| = |-12| = 12 \), which satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the largest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |x - 5| = 12 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the absolute value equation and set up two cases (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve each case to find possible values of \( x \) (completed: \( x = 17, -7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solutions (completed: both solutions verified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the largest value of \( x \) (current).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \). Achieve this by comparing the numerical values of the solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \). Comparing these, \( 17 > -7 \), so the largest value is \( x = 17 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The largest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \) is \( 17 \).
