**Problem Statement**: Find the largest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the absolute value equation. Subgoals:  
1. Understand the absolute value equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \).  
2. Solve for \( x \) by considering the definition of absolute value, which leads to two possible cases.  
3. Identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \) by considering the two cases for the absolute value.  
**How to Achieve**: The absolute value \( |x - 5| = 12 \) means \( x - 5 = 12 \) or \( x - 5 = -12 \). Solve each case to find the possible values of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \):  
- **Case 1**: \( x - 5 = 12 \)  
  \( x = 12 + 5 = 17 \)  
- **Case 2**: \( x - 5 = -12 \)  
  \( x = -12 + 5 = -7 \)  
Thus, the solutions are \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the largest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |x - 5| = 12 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the absolute value equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) by considering two cases (completed, solutions: \( x = 17 \), \( x = -7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the largest value of \( x \) (current).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest value of \( x \) from the solutions \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the numerical values of the solutions and select the larger one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \). Comparing them, \( 17 > -7 \), so the largest value is \( x = 17 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 17 \) and \( x = -7 \) satisfy the equation \( |x - 5| = 12 \), and confirm \( x = 17 \) is the largest.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute both values into the original equation to check if they satisfy it, then confirm the larger value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \( x = 17 \):  
  \( |17 - 5| = |12| = 12 \), which satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x = -7 \):  
  \( |-7 - 5| = |-12| = 12 \), which satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are valid. Since \( 17 > -7 \), the largest value is \( x = 17 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The largest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |x - 5| = 12 \) is \( 17 \).
