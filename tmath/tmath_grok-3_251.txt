### Problem Statement
Expand the product \((x + 3)(x - 8)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of expanding \((x + 3)(x - 8)\) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Apply the distributive property (FOIL method) to multiply the binomials.
2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the distributive property to multiply \((x + 3)(x - 8)\).
Description: Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to compute the product of the binomials.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the binomials using FOIL:
- First: \(x \cdot x = x^2\)
- Outer: \(x \cdot (-8) = -8x\)
- Inner: \(3 \cdot x = 3x\)
- Last: \(3 \cdot (-8) = -24\)

Result: \(x^2 - 8x + 3x - 24\)
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine like terms in the expression \(x^2 - 8x + 3x - 24\).
Description: Add or subtract coefficients of like terms to simplify the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Combine like terms:
- \(x^2\) has no other like terms.
- \(-8x + 3x = -5x\)
- \(-24\) has no other like terms.

Simplified expression: \(x^2 - 5x - 24\)
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the expanded expression \(x^2 - 5x - 24\).
Description: Check the result by substituting a value for \(x\) into both the original product and the expanded expression to ensure they yield the same result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose \(x = 2\):
- Original: \((x + 3)(x - 8) = (2 + 3)(2 - 8) = 5 \cdot (-6) = -30\)
- Expanded: \(x^2 - 5x - 24 = 2^2 - 5 \cdot 2 - 24 = 4 - 10 - 24 = -30\)

Since both yield \(-30\), the expansion is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Expand \((x + 3)(x - 8)\)
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the distributive property (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (Completed).

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The final expanded expression is \(x^2 - 5x - 24\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The expanded product of \((x + 3)(x - 8)\) is \(x^2 - 5x - 24\).
