**Problem Restatement**: Expand the product \((x + 3)(x - 8)\) to obtain a simplified polynomial expression.

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem of expanding \((x + 3)(x - 8)\), break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Apply the distributive property (or FOIL method) to multiply the binomials.
2. Combine like terms to simplify the resulting expression.
3. Verify the final expression for correctness.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the distributive property to multiply \((x + 3)(x - 8)\).
Description: Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to compute the product of the binomials, resulting in four terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the FOIL method:
- **First**: \(x \cdot x = x^2\)
- **Outer**: \(x \cdot (-8) = -8x\)
- **Inner**: \(3 \cdot x = 3x\)
- **Last**: \(3 \cdot (-8) = -24\)

The result is: \(x^2 - 8x + 3x - 24\).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine like terms in the expression \(x^2 - 8x + 3x - 24\).
Description: Identify and add/subtract terms with the same degree to simplify the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Combine the like terms:
- \(x^2\) has no other terms of degree 2.
- \(-8x + 3x = -5x\)
- \(-24\) is a constant term.

The simplified expression is: \(x^2 - 5x - 24\).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the expanded expression \(x^2 - 5x - 24\).
Description: Check the result by substituting a value for \(x\) into both the original product \((x + 3)(x - 8)\) and the expanded expression, ensuring they yield the same result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose \(x = 2\):
- Original: \((2 + 3)(2 - 8) = 5 \cdot (-6) = -30\)
- Expanded: \(2^2 - 5 \cdot 2 - 24 = 4 - 10 - 24 = -30\)

Since both yield \(-30\), the expression \(x^2 - 5x - 24\) is correct.
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

Action: Track Goals (Review)
