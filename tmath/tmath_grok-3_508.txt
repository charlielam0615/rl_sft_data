### Problem Statement
We need to determine the value of the quadratic function \( y = q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) at \( x = 15 \), given that this value is an integer. The Asymptote code provides the function definition as \( q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \). Our task is to compute \( q(15) \) and confirm that it is an integer.

To solve for \( q(15) \), we need to:  
1. Derive the quadratic function \( q(x) \) from the given expression \( 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \).  
2. Compute \( q(15) \) by substituting \( x = 15 \) into the function.

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the quadratic function \( q(x) \) from the expression \( 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \) and compute \( q(15) \). This will be achieved by simplifying the expression into standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), then substituting \( x = 15 \).

Start with the given function:  
\[ q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \]

**Step 1: Simplify the expression**  
Expand the term \( (x-8)(x-7) \):  
\[ (x-8)(x-7) = x^2 - 7x - 8x + 56 = x^2 - 15x + 56 \]

Divide by 8:  
\[ \frac{x^2 - 15x + 56}{8} = \frac{x^2}{8} - \frac{15x}{8} + \frac{56}{8} = \frac{1}{8}x^2 - \frac{15}{8}x + 7 \]

Subtract from 4:  
\[ q(x) = 4 - \left( \frac{1}{8}x^2 - \frac{15}{8}x + 7 \right) = 4 - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 7 = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x + (4 - 7) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \]

Thus, the quadratic function is:  
\[ q(x) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \]

**Step 2: Compute \( q(15) \)**  
Substitute \( x = 15 \):  
\[ q(15) = -\frac{1}{8}(15)^2 + \frac{15}{8}(15) - 3 \]  
\[ = -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 225 + \frac{15 \cdot 15}{8} - 3 \]  
\[ = -\frac{225}{8} + \frac{225}{8} - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \]

**Step 3: Verify**  
The result \( q(15) = -3 \) is an integer, as required.
