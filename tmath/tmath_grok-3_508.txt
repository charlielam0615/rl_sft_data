**Problem Statement**: We need to determine the value of the quadratic function \( y = q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) at \( x = 15 \), given that this value is an integer. The function is defined in the Asymptote code as \( q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \).

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Break Down the Problem

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( q(15) \), we need to:  
1. Express the given function \( q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \) in the standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c \).  
2. Compute \( q(15) \) using the derived quadratic function.  
3. Verify that the result is an integer.

### Step 2: Convert the Function to Standard Quadratic Form

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \) in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \). This will be achieved by expanding the expression and simplifying it to identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given function:  
\[ q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \]

Expand the term \( (x-8)(x-7) \):  
\[ (x-8)(x-7) = x^2 - 7x - 8x + 56 = x^2 - 15x + 56 \]

Now compute:  
\[ \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} = \frac{x^2 - 15x + 56}{8} = \frac{x^2}{8} - \frac{15x}{8} + \frac{56}{8} = \frac{1}{8}x^2 - \frac{15}{8}x + 7 \]

Substitute into the function:  
\[ q(x) = 4 - \left( \frac{1}{8}x^2 - \frac{15}{8}x + 7 \right) = 4 - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 7 \]

Simplify:  
\[ q(x) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x + (4 - 7) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \]

Thus, the quadratic function in standard form is:  
\[ q(x) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \]  
with coefficients \( a = -\frac{1}{8} \), \( b = \frac{15}{8} \), \( c = -3 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( q(15) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( q(15) \) using the function \( q(x) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 15 \) into the quadratic function and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 15 \) into \( q(x) = -\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{15}{8}x - 3 \):  
\[ q(15) = -\frac{1}{8}(15^2) + \frac{15}{8}(15) - 3 \]

Calculate each term:  
- First term: \( 15^2 = 225 \), so \( -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 225 = -\frac{225}{8} = -28.125 \).  
- Second term: \( \frac{15}{8} \cdot 15 = \frac{15 \cdot 15}{8} = \frac{225}{8} = 28.125 \).  
- Third term: \( -3 \).

Combine:  
\[ q(15) = -28.125 + 28.125 - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \]

Thus, \( q(15) = -3 \), which is an integer.

### Step 4: Verify the Calculation Using the Original Function

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( q(15) \) by using the original function form \( q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \) and checking if the result matches \( q(15) = -3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the original function:  
\[ q(x) = 4 - \frac{(x-8)(x-7)}{8} \]

Substitute \( x = 15 \):  
\[ (15-8)(15-7) = 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \]  
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]  
\[ q(15) = 4 - 7 = -3 \]

The result matches \( q(15) = -3 \), confirming the calculation is correct.
