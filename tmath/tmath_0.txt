2. Ensure continuity at $ x = -2 $ by equating the left and right limits to the function value at $ x = -2 $.  
3. Solve the system of equations obtained from the continuity conditions to find $ a $ and $ b $.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The definition of continuity for a piecewise function and the expressions for $ f(x) $ in each interval.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
For a piecewise function to be continuous at a point, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point must all be equal. The function is defined as:  
- $ f(x) = ax + 3 $ for $ x > 2 $,  
- $ f(x) = x - 5 $ for $ -2 \le x \le 2 $,  
- $ f(x) = 2x - b $ for $ x < -2 $.  

The critical points for continuity are $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $, where the definition of the function changes.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Ensure continuity at $ x = 2 $ by equating the left and right limits to the function value at $ x = 2 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To ensure continuity at $ x = 2 $, we equate the left-hand limit (from the interval $ -2 \le x \le 2 $) to the right-hand limit (from the interval $ x > 2 $) and to the function value at $ x = 2 $.  

- Left-hand limit (from $ -2 \le x \le 2 $):  
  $$
  f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3
  $$

- Right-hand limit (from $ x > 2 $):  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = a(2) + 3 = 2a + 3
  $$

For continuity, the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:  
$$
2a + 3 = -3
$$

Solving for $ a $:  
$$
2a = -6 \Rightarrow a = -3
$$

Goal of this step: Ensure continuity at $ x = -2 $ by equating the left and right limits to the function value at $ x = -2 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To ensure continuity at $ x = -2 $, we equate the left-hand limit (from the interval $ x < -2 $) to the right-hand limit (from the interval $ -2 \le x \le 2 $) and to the function value at $ x = -2 $.  

- Right-hand limit (from $ -2 \le x \le 2 $):  
  $$
  f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7
  $$

- Left-hand limit (from $ x < -2 $):  
  $$
  \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b
  $$

For continuity, the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:  
$$
-4 - b = -7
$$

Solving for $ b $:  
$$
-b = -3 \Rightarrow b = 3
$$

What to recall: The values of $ a $ and $ b $ found in the previous steps.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
From the implementation steps, we found that $ a = -3 $ and $ b = 3 $. These values ensure the piecewise function is continuous at the critical points $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $, respectively.

From the previous steps, we have determined that $ a = -3 $ and $ b = 3 $.

$$
a + b = -3 + 3 = 0

1. Verify that the values $ a = -3 $ and $ b = 3 $ ensure continuity at both $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that the values $ a = -3 $ and $ b = 3 $ satisfy continuity at both $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $, and that $ a + b = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Continuity at $ x = 2 $:**  
   - From the implementation step, $ a = -3 $. The right-hand limit is $ 2a + 3 = 2(-3) + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3 $.  
   - The function value at $ x = 2 $ is $ f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3 $.  
   - Since $ \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = f(2) $, continuity is satisfied at $ x = 2 $.  

2. **Continuity at $ x = -2 $:**  
   - From the implementation step, $ b = 3 $. The left-hand limit is $ -4 - b = -4 - 3 = -7 $.  
   - The function value at $ x = -2 $ is $ f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7 $.  
   - Since $ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = f(-2) $, continuity is satisfied at $ x = -2 $.  

3. **Sum $ a + b $:**  
   - $ a = -3 $, $ b = 3 $, so $ a + b = -3 + 3 = 0 $.  

All calculations align with the continuity conditions and the derived values. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
