**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the logarithm \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6})\).

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To evaluate \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6})\), I will break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the base and argument of the logarithm using properties of exponents and roots.  
2. Apply logarithm properties to rewrite the expression.  
3. Compute the numerical value of the resulting expression.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the base and argument of the logarithm.  
**How to Achieve**: Express \(\sqrt{6}\) and \(216\sqrt{6}\) in terms of exponents with base 6 to align with logarithm properties. Specifically, rewrite \(\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\) and simplify \(216\sqrt{6}\) by expressing 216 as a power of 6 and handling the \(\sqrt{6}\) term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the base: \(\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\).  
Rewrite the argument: \(216\sqrt{6} = 216 \cdot 6^{1/2}\).  
Express 216 in terms of base 6:  
- Note that \(6^3 = 216\), since \(6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 36 \cdot 6 = 216\).  
- Thus, \(216 = 6^3\).  
So, \(216\sqrt{6} = 6^3 \cdot 6^{1/2} = 6^{3 + 1/2} = 6^{7/2}\).  
The original expression becomes:  
\[
\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6}) = \log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2}).
\]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply logarithm properties to simplify \(\log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2})\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the logarithm property \(\log_{a^b} (c) = \frac{1}{b} \log_a (c)\) to handle the base \(6^{1/2}\), and then simplify the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the property \(\log_{a^b} (c) = \frac{1}{b} \log_a (c)\), rewrite:  
\[
\log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2}) = \frac{1}{1/2} \log_6 (6^{7/2}) = 2 \log_6 (6^{7/2}).
\]  
Now, apply the power rule \(\log_a (b^c) = c \log_a (b)\):  
\[
\log_6 (6^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2} \log_6 (6).
\]  
Since \(\log_6 (6) = 1\), we have:  
\[
\log_6 (6^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{7}{2}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
2 \log_6 (6^{7/2}) = 2 \cdot \frac{7}{2} = 7.
\]  
So, \(\log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2}) = 7\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the result \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6}) = 7\).  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \((\sqrt{6})^7 = 216\sqrt{6}\), as the logarithm \(\log_b (a) = x\) implies \(b^x = a\). Alternatively, recompute using an alternative logarithm property to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Method 1: Exponentiation Check**  
If \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6}) = 7\), then \((\sqrt{6})^7 = 216\sqrt{6}\).  
Compute the left-hand side:  
\[
(\sqrt{6})^7 = (6^{1/2})^7 = 6^{7/2}.
\]  
From Step 2, we know \(216\sqrt{6} = 6^3 \cdot 6^{1/2} = 6^{7/2}\).  
Thus, \((\sqrt{6})^7 = 6^{7/2} = 216\sqrt{6}\), which confirms the result.  

**Method 2: Alternative Logarithm Approach**  
Use the change of base formula: \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6}) = \frac{\ln (216\sqrt{6})}{\ln (\sqrt{6})}\).  
Compute the numerator:  
\[
\ln (216\sqrt{6}) = \ln (216 \cdot 6^{1/2}) = \ln (216) + \ln (6^{1/2}) = \ln (216) + \frac{1}{2} \ln (6).
\]  
Since \(216 = 6^3\), we have \(\ln (216) = \ln (6^3) = 3 \ln (6)\).  
So:  
\[
\ln (216\sqrt{6}) = 3 \ln (6) + \frac{1}{2} \ln (6) = \frac{6}{2} \ln (6) + \frac{1}{2} \ln (6) = \frac{7}{2} \ln (6).
\]  
Compute the denominator:  
\[
\ln (\sqrt{6}) = \ln (6^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2} \ln (6).
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6}) = \frac{\frac{7}{2} \ln (6)}{\frac{1}{2} \ln (6)} = \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = 7.
\]  
Both methods confirm the result is 7.
