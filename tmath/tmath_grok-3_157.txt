[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem of evaluating \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216\sqrt{6})\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression inside the logarithm, \(216\sqrt{6}\), by expressing it in terms of its prime factors.  
2. Rewrite the base \(\sqrt{6}\) in a form that facilitates logarithm manipulation.  
3. Apply logarithm properties to compute the value.  
4. Validate the final result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the argument \(216\sqrt{6}\) and the base \(\sqrt{6}\) using their prime factorizations.  
**How to Achieve**: Express \(216\) and \(\sqrt{6}\) in terms of their prime factors, rewrite \(\sqrt{6}\) as \(6^{1/2}\), and prepare the expression for logarithm properties.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To simplify:  
- Factorize \(216\): \(216 = 2^3 \cdot 3^3\), since \(216 = 6^3 = (2 \cdot 3)^3 = 2^3 \cdot 3^3\).  
- Express \(\sqrt{6}\): \(\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2} = (2 \cdot 3)^{1/2} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 3^{1/2}\).  
- The argument becomes: \(216 \sqrt{6} = 2^3 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 6^{1/2} = 2^3 \cdot 3^3 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)^{1/2} = 2^3 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} \cdot 3^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} \cdot 3^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{7/2} \cdot 3^{7/2}\).  
- The base is: \(\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 3^{1/2}\).  
Thus, the expression is: \(\log_{2^{1/2} \cdot 3^{1/2}} (2^{7/2} \cdot 3^{7/2})\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply logarithm properties to evaluate \(\log_{2^{1/2} \cdot 3^{1/2}} (2^{7/2} \cdot 3^{7/2})\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the logarithm property \(\log_{b^c} (a) = \frac{1}{c} \log_b (a)\) and the product rule \(\log (xy) = \log x + \log y\) to simplify the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the logarithm using the base change property:  
\[
\log_{6^{1/2}} (216 \sqrt{6}) = \log_{6^{1/2}} (6^3 \cdot 6^{1/2}) = \log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{3 + 1/2}) = \log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2}).
\]  
Using the property \(\log_{b^c} (a) = \frac{1}{c} \log_b (a)\):  
\[
\log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2}) = \frac{1}{1/2} \log_6 (6^{7/2}) = 2 \log_6 (6^{7/2}).
\]  
Apply the power rule \(\log_b (a^c) = c \log_b a\):  
\[
\log_6 (6^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2} \log_6 6 = \frac{7}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{7}{2}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
2 \cdot \frac{7}{2} = 7.
\]  
So, \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216 \sqrt{6}) = 7\).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the result \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216 \sqrt{6}) = 7\).  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \((\sqrt{6})^7 = 216 \sqrt{6}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \((\sqrt{6})^7 = (6^{1/2})^7 = 6^{7/2} = 6^3 \cdot 6^{1/2} = 216 \cdot \sqrt{6}\).  
Since the base \(\sqrt{6}\) raised to the power 7 equals the argument \(216 \sqrt{6}\), the result is correct: \(\log_{\sqrt{6}} (216 \sqrt{6}) = 7\).
