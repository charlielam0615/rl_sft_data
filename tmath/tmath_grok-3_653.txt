### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $(x+1)^{42}$, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the method to find the coefficient in a binomial expansion.  
2. Determine the specific term in the expansion that corresponds to $x^2$.  
3. Calculate the coefficient for that term.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the method to find the coefficient in a binomial expansion. Use the binomial theorem, which states that for $(a+b)^n$, the general term is given by $\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The binomial theorem provides the expansion of $(x+1)^{42}$ as:  
\[
(x+1)^{42} = \sum_{k=0}^{42} \binom{42}{k} x^{42-k} \cdot 1^k.
\]  
The general term is $\binom{42}{k} x^{42-k}$. To find the coefficient of $x^2$, we need the term where the exponent of $x$ is 2, i.e., $42-k=2$.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the specific term corresponding to $x^2$. Solve for $k$ in the exponent equation $42-k=2$, then find the coefficient using the binomial formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the general term $\binom{42}{k} x^{42-k}$, set the exponent equal to 2:  
\[
42-k = 2 \implies k = 40.
\]  
The term with $x^2$ is when $k=40$. The coefficient is:  
\[
\binom{42}{k} = \binom{42}{40}.
\]  
Using the binomial coefficient property $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$, we have:  
\[
\binom{42}{40} = \binom{42}{2}.
\]  
Now, calculate:  
\[
\binom{42}{2} = \frac{42 \cdot 41}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1722}{2} = 861.
\]  
Thus, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is 861.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the binomial coefficient and ensuring the correct term was identified. Recalculate $\binom{42}{40}$ directly and verify the exponent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the coefficient for $k=40$:  
\[
\binom{42}{40} = \frac{42!}{40! \cdot 2!} = \frac{42 \cdot 41}{2 \cdot 1} = 861.
\]  
Confirm the term: For $k=40$, the general term is:  
\[
\binom{42}{40} x^{42-40} \cdot 1^{40} = \binom{42}{40} x^2.
\]  
The exponent matches $x^2$, and the coefficient is consistent. The calculation is valid.
