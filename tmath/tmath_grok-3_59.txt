**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\left\lceil\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\right\rceil\), where \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) denotes the ceiling function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To evaluate \(\left\lceil\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\right\rceil\), break the problem into subgoals:
1. Compute the value of \(-\frac{5}{3}\).
2. Square the result.
3. Apply the ceiling function to the squared value.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the value of \(-\frac{5}{3}\).
How to Achieve: Recognize that \(-\frac{5}{3}\) is a fraction and express it as a decimal for clarity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression \(-\frac{5}{3}\) is a negative fraction. Dividing 5 by 3 gives approximately 1.666..., so:
\[
-\frac{5}{3} \approx -1.666...
\]
As a fraction, it remains \(-\frac{5}{3}\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Square the result of \(-\frac{5}{3}\).
How to Achieve: Compute \(\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\) by multiplying \(-\frac{5}{3}\) by itself, using fraction arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the square:
\[
\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) \times \left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) = \frac{(-5) \times (-5)}{3 \times 3} = \frac{25}{9}.
\]
Convert \(\frac{25}{9}\) to a decimal for clarity:
\[
25 \div 9 \approx 2.777...
\]
So, \(\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9} \approx 2.777...\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the ceiling function to \(\frac{25}{9}\).
How to Achieve: Determine the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{25}{9}\) by comparing its decimal value to nearby integers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The value \(\frac{25}{9} \approx 2.777...\). The ceiling function \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) returns the smallest integer \(\geq x\). Since:
- \(2 < 2.777... < 3\),
- The smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.777... is 3.

Thus:
\[
\left\lceil \frac{25}{9} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2.777... \right\rceil = 3.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \(\left\lceil\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\right\rceil\).
How to Achieve: Recompute the steps briefly and check consistency, ensuring the ceiling function is applied correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
1. \(-\frac{5}{3} \approx -1.666...\).
2. \(\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9} \approx 2.777...\).
3. Ceiling of 2.777...:
   - Since 2.777... is between 2 and 3, \(\left\lceil 2.777... \right\rceil = 3\).

The result is consistent with the previous computation, confirming the answer is 3.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\left\lceil\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\right\rceil\).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(-\frac{5}{3}\) (completed: \(-\frac{5}{3} \approx -1.666...\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Square the result (completed: \(\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9} \approx 2.777...\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the ceiling function (completed: \(\left\lceil \frac{25}{9} \right\rceil = 3\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation (completed: result verified as 3).

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, final answer obtained).
The final answer is 3, as computed and validated.

**Final Answer**: \(\left\lceil\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2\right\rceil = 3\).
