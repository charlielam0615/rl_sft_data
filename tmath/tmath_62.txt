Goal of this step: Complete the square for $x$ in the equation $x^2 - 8x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To complete the square for $x^2 - 8x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $-8$, square it to get $16$, and add and subtract $16$ inside the equation.

So, $x^2 - 8x$ becomes $(x - 4)^2 - 16$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Complete the square for $ y $ in the equation $ y^2 + 6y $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To complete the square for $ y^2 + 6y $, we take half of the coefficient of $ y $, which is $ 6 $, square it to get $ 9 $, and add and subtract $ 9 $ inside the equation.  

So, $ y^2 + 6y $ becomes $ (y + 3)^2 - 9 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Rewrite the original equation in standard form by combining the completed square expressions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The original equation is $x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20$.  

From the previous steps, we have:  
$$
x^2 - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16
$$
$$
y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9
$$

Substitute these into the original equation:  
$$
(x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -20
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:  
$$
(x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 = -20
$$

Add 25 to both sides to isolate the squared terms:  
$$
(x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5
$$

This is the standard form of the equation of a circle, $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center. Here, the center is $(4, -3)$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $x + y$ for the center $(4, -3)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The center of the circle is at $(4, -3)$.  
To calculate $x + y$, we sum the coordinates:  
$$
x + y = 4 + (-3) = 1
$$

[VERIFY]
1. Original equation: $x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20$.  
   - Correctly rearranged to $x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 6y = -20$.  

2. Completing the square for $x^2 - 8x$:  
   - Half of -8 is -4, squared to 16.  
   - Expression becomes $(x - 4)^2 - 16$.  
   - Correctly applied.  

3. Completing the square for $y^2 + 6y$:  
   - Half of 6 is 3, squared to 9.  
   - Expression becomes $(y + 3)^2 - 9$.  
   - Correctly applied.  

4. Substituting into the equation:  
   - $(x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -20$.  
   - Simplified to $(x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 = -20$.  
   - Adding 25 to both sides gives $(x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5$.  
   - Correct transformation to standard form.  

5. Center identification:  
   - Standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ implies center $(h, k) = (4, -3)$.  
   - Correctly identified.  

6. Calculation of $x + y$:  
   - $4 + (-3) = 1$.  
   - Correct arithmetic.  

All steps are logically consistent and algebraically valid. No errors detected in reasoning or computation.
