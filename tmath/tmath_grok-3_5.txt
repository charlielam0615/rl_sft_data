**Problem Statement**: Find the center of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the center of the circle, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) by completing the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms.
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the circle equation in standard form by completing the square.
**How to Achieve**: Group the \(x\) and \(y\) terms, complete the square for each, and adjust the constant term to match the standard form of a circle equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation: \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).

**For the \(x\)-terms**: \( x^2 - 6x \)
- The coefficient of \(x\) is \(-6\). Half of \(-6\) is \(-3\), and squaring it gives \(9\).
- Add and subtract 9: \( x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9 \).

**For the \(y\)-terms**: \( y^2 + 2y \)
- The coefficient of \(y\) is \(2\). Half of \(2\) is \(1\), and squaring it gives \(1\).
- Add and subtract 1: \( y^2 + 2y + 1 - 1 = (y + 1)^2 - 1 \).

Rewrite the equation:
\[ (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 = 9 \]
Combine constants: \(-9 - 1 + 9 = -1\), so:
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 = 9 \]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10 \]

The equation is now in standard form: \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Identify the center of the circle from the standard form.
**How to Achieve**: Extract the center \((h, k)\) by comparing the equation \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10\) to the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the standard form \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10\), compare with \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\):
- \( x - h = x - 3 \implies h = 3 \)
- \( y - k = y + 1 = y - (-1) \implies k = -1 \)

Thus, the center is \((h, k) = (3, -1)\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Verify the center by checking the completed square form and ensuring consistency with the original equation.
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the center \((3, -1)\) back into the context of the original equation and confirm the standard form is correct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The standard form \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10\) indicates the center at \((3, -1)\). To validate, expand the standard form back:
\[ (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 \]
\[ (y + 1)^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1 \]
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y + 10 \]
Since the equation equals 10, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y + 10 - 10 = 0 \implies x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 0 \]

The original equation is \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \). Notice the discrepancy in the constant term. Recompute the constant:
From Step 2: \( x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 \), so:
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 - 10 = 9 \]

Correct the standard form: \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10\) was incorrect. The correct form is:
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \]
Center remains \((3, -1)\), and the radius is \(\sqrt{19}\). Verify by expanding:
\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 19 \implies x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 19 - 10 = 9 \]
This matches the original equation, confirming the center \((3, -1)\).
