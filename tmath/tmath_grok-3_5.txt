**Problem Restatement**: Find the center of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the center of the circle, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle's equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) by completing the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms.  
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the circle's equation in standard form by completing the square.  
How to Achieve: Group \(x\) and \(y\) terms, complete the square for each, and adjust the equation to match the standard form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation: \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).

**Complete the square for \(x\)**:  
\( x^2 - 6x = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9 \).

**Complete the square for \(y\)**:  
\( y^2 + 2y = (y^2 + 2y + 1) - 1 = (y + 1)^2 - 1 \).

Substitute back into the equation:  
\( (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 = 9 \).

Simplify:  
\( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 10 = 9 \).  
\( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \).

The equation is now in standard form: \( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the center of the circle from the standard form.  
How to Achieve: Extract the values of \(h\) and \(k\) from the equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The standard form is \( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \).  
Compare with \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \):  
- \( x - h = x - 3 \implies h = 3 \).  
- \( y - k = y + 1 = y - (-1) \implies k = -1 \).  

Thus, the center is \((h, k) = (3, -1)\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the center by checking the completed square form and equation consistency.  
How to Achieve: Ensure the completed square process is correct and the center aligns with the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the completion of the square to confirm:  
- For \( x^2 - 6x \): Half of \(-6\) is \(-3\), and \((-3)^2 = 9\). So, \( x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 \).  
- For \( y^2 + 2y \): Half of \(2\) is \(1\), and \(1^2 = 1\). So, \( y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y + 1)^2 \).  

Original equation: \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).  
After substitution: \( (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 = 9 \).  
Simplify: \( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \), which matches Step 2.  

The center \((3, -1)\) is consistent with the standard form.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the center of the circle \( x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center from the standard form (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 4).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The center of the circle is \((3, -1)\).

**Final Answer**: The center of the circle is \((3, -1)\).
