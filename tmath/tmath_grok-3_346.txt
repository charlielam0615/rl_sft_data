**Problem Statement**: A television's price is discounted by 40%, and then the resulting price is further reduced by 40% during a liquidation sale. We need to determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the price after the first 40% discount.  
2. Calculate the price after the second 40% discount.  
3. Determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the price after the first 40% discount.  
How to Achieve: Assume the original price is 100 units for simplicity. A 40% discount means paying 60% of the original price, so multiply the original price by 0.6.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the original price be 100.  
After a 40% discount, the price is:  
100 × (1 - 0.4) = 100 × 0.6 = 60.  
The price after the first discount is 60 units.  

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the price after the second 40% discount.  
How to Achieve: Take the price after the first discount (60 units) and apply another 40% discount, meaning multiply by 0.6 again.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The price after the first discount is 60.  
A second 40% discount means paying 60% of 60:  
60 × (1 - 0.4) = 60 × 0.6 = 36.  
The price after the second discount is 36 units.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the total reduction (original price minus final price), then express it as a percentage of the original price.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original price: 100 units.  
Final price: 36 units.  
Total reduction: 100 - 36 = 64 units.  
Percentage reduction: (64 / 100) × 100 = 64%.  
The total percentage reduction is 64%.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of the total percentage reduction.  
How to Achieve: Use an alternative method, such as combining the discounts mathematically, to confirm the result.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Each 40% discount multiplies the price by 0.6. For two successive 40% discounts:  
0.6 × 0.6 = 0.36.  
Final price = 100 × 0.36 = 36.  
Reduction = 100 - 36 = 64.  
Percentage reduction = (64 / 100) × 100 = 64%, which matches the previous result.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the price after the first 40% discount (completed: price = 60 units).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the price after the second 40% discount (completed: price = 36 units).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the total percentage reduction (completed: 64%).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed: confirmed 64%).  
Current Goal: Completed all subgoals; the total percentage reduction is 64%.

**Final Answer**: The original price has been reduced by 64%.
