**Problem Statement**: A television's price is discounted by 40%, and then the resulting price is discounted by another 40% during a liquidation sale. We need to determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total percentage reduction:  
1. Calculate the price after the first 40% discount.  
2. Calculate the price after the second 40% discount.  
3. Determine the total percentage reduction from the original price.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the price after the first 40% discount. Assume the original price is $100 for simplicity, then apply a 40% discount to find the new price.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the original price be $100. A 40% discount means the price is reduced to 60% of the original:  
Price after first discount = $100 × (1 - 0.40) = $100 × 0.60 = $60.  

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the price after the second 40% discount. Take the price after the first discount ($60) and apply another 40% discount to find the final price.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The price after the first discount is $60. A 40% discount on $60 means the price is reduced to 60% of $60:  
Final price = $60 × (1 - 0.40) = $60 × 0.60 = $36.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total percentage reduction from the original price. Compare the final price ($36) to the original price ($100) to calculate the percentage reduction.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The original price is $100, and the final price is $36. The reduction is $100 - $36 = $64.  
Percentage reduction = (Reduction / Original price) × 100 = ($64 / $100) × 100 = 64%.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation of the total percentage reduction. Check the result by computing the combined discount mathematically and confirm it matches the 64% reduction.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The combined discount can be calculated as follows:  
First discount: 40% off means paying 60% (0.60).  
Second discount: 40% off the result means paying 60% of that (0.60).  
Combined effect: $100 × 0.60 × 0.60 = $100 × 0.36 = $36.  
Reduction = $100 - $36 = $64.  
Percentage reduction = ($64 / $100) × 100 = 64%, which matches the previous result.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the total percentage reduction of the television's price.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the price after the first 40% discount (completed: $60).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the price after the second 40% discount (completed: $36).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the total percentage reduction (completed: 64%).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed: confirmed 64%).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The total percentage reduction is 64%.

**Final Answer**: The original price has been reduced by 64%.
