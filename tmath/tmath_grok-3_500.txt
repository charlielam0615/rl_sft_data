### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the common ratio \( r \):  
1. Define the infinite geometric series and its sum.  
2. Express the series after removing the first three terms and its sum.  
3. Set up the relationship given in the problem (sum of original series is 27 times the sum of the new series).  
4. Solve for the common ratio \( r \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Define the infinite geometric series and compute its sum.  
- **How to Achieve**: Assume the series has first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \). Use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \), valid for \( |r| < 1 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The infinite geometric series is \( a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots \).  
The sum of this series, assuming \( |r| < 1 \), is:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Express the series after removing the first three terms and compute its sum.  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify the new series starting from the fourth term and use the infinite geometric series sum formula.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Removing the first three terms \( a, ar, ar^2 \), the new series starts with the fourth term \( ar^3, ar^4, ar^5, \ldots \).  
This is a geometric series with:  
- First term: \( ar^3 \)  
- Common ratio: \( r \)  
The sum of this series, assuming \( |r| < 1 \), is:  
\[ S_{\text{new}} = \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the relationship between the sums and derive an equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the given condition that the original series' sum is 27 times the sum of the new series, i.e., \( S = 27 \cdot S_{\text{new}} \). Substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( S_{\text{new}} \) and simplify.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
\[ S = 27 \cdot S_{\text{new}} \]  
Substitute the sums:  
\[ \frac{a}{1 - r} = 27 \cdot \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \]  
Assuming \( a \neq 0 \) and \( 1 - r \neq 0 \), simplify by canceling \( a \) and \( 1 - r \) from both sides:  
\[ \frac{1}{1 - r} = 27 \cdot \frac{r^3}{1 - r} \]  
Since \( 1 - r \) cancels out, multiply through by \( 1 - r \):  
\[ 1 = 27 r^3 \]  
Solve for \( r^3 \):  
\[ r^3 = \frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{3^3} \]  
Take the cube root:  
\[ r = \left( \frac{1}{3^3} \right)^{1/3} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
Since the series converges, check \( |r| < 1 \):  
\[ \left| \frac{1}{3} \right| = \frac{1}{3} < 1 \]  
This satisfies the convergence condition.

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the solution by substituting \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) back into the relationship \( S = 27 \cdot S_{\text{new}} \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute \( S \) and \( S_{\text{new}} \) using \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) and check if the condition holds.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume \( a = 1 \) for simplicity (since \( a \) cancels out in the equation).  
Original series sum:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2} \]  
New series sum (starting from \( ar^3 \)):  
\[ r = \frac{1}{3}, \quad r^3 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{27} \]  
\[ S_{\text{new}} = \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} = \frac{1 \cdot \frac{1}{27}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{27}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{18} \]  
Check the condition:  
\[ 27 \cdot S_{\text{new}} = 27 \cdot \frac{1}{18} = \frac{27}{18} = \frac{3}{2} = S \]  
The condition \( S = 27 \cdot S_{\text{new}} \) holds, confirming the solution is correct.
