**Problem Statement**: We need to find the common ratio \( r \) of an infinite geometric series whose sum is 27 times the sum of the series obtained by removing its first three terms.

### Step 1: Define the problem and set up the initial approach

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the common ratio \( r \):  
1. Express the sum of the infinite geometric series.  
2. Express the sum of the series after removing the first three terms.  
3. Set up the equation based on the given condition (sum of original series is 27 times the sum of the modified series).  
4. Solve for the common ratio \( r \).

### Step 2: Express the sum of the original series

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Derive the formula for the sum of the infinite geometric series.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, assuming the first term is \( a \) and the common ratio is \( r \), and ensure \( |r| < 1 \) for convergence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For an infinite geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \), the sum is given by:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]  
This represents the sum of the original series.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Express the sum of the series without the first three terms

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Derive the sum of the series after removing the first three terms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify the first term of the new series (the fourth term of the original series) and apply the infinite geometric series sum formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The original series is \( a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots \).  
Removing the first three terms (\( a, ar, ar^2 \)), the new series starts with the fourth term, \( ar^3 \), and has the same common ratio \( r \).  
The sum of this new series is:  
\[ S_{\text{new}} = ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 + \cdots = ar^3 (1 + r + r^2 + \cdots) = \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Set up the equation based on the given condition

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Formulate the equation using the given condition that the sum of the original series is 27 times the sum of the series without the first three terms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the expressions for \( S \) and \( S_{\text{new}} \) and set up the equation \( S = 27 S_{\text{new}} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given: \( S = 27 S_{\text{new}} \).  
Substitute the expressions:  
\[ \frac{a}{1 - r} = 27 \cdot \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \]  
Simplify by canceling \( a \) (assuming \( a \neq 0 \)) and \( 1 - r \) (assuming \( r \neq 1 \)):  
\[ \frac{1}{1 - r} = 27 \cdot \frac{r^3}{1 - r} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - r \):  
\[ 1 = 27 r^3 \]  
Thus:  
\[ r^3 = \frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{3^3} \]  
\[ r = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{1/3} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validate the solution

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) satisfies the original condition and ensures the series converges.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) into the sums \( S \) and \( S_{\text{new}} \), and check if \( S = 27 S_{\text{new}} \). Also, confirm \( |r| < 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( r = \frac{1}{3} \):  
- Original series sum:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{a}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3a}{2} \]  
- New series sum (starting from \( ar^3 \)):  
\[ r^3 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{27} \]  
\[ S_{\text{new}} = \frac{a \cdot \frac{1}{27}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{a}{27}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{a}{27} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{a}{18} \]  
- Check the condition:  
\[ 27 S_{\text{new}} = 27 \cdot \frac{a}{18} = \frac{27a}{18} = \frac{3a}{2} = S \]  
The condition \( S = 27 S_{\text{new}} \) holds.  
- Convergence check: \( |r| = \left| \frac{1}{3} \right| < 1 \), so the series converges.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the common ratio \( r \) of the infinite geometric series.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the sum of the original series (\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the sum of the series after removing the first three terms (\( S_{\text{new}} = \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve the equation \( S = 27 S_{\text{new}} \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution for \( r \).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the common ratio.  
The solution \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) has been derived and validated.

**Final Answer**: The common ratio of the series is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
