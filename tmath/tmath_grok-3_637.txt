**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number of sides of a regular polygon such that the number of diagonals equals the number of sides, i.e., the number of diagonals subtracted from the number of sides results in zero.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Derive the formula for the number of diagonals of a polygon with \( n \) sides.  
2. Set up an equation where the number of diagonals equals the number of sides.  
3. Solve the equation for \( n \).  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Derive the formula for the number of diagonals of a polygon with \( n \) sides.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the standard formula for the number of diagonals, which accounts for choosing 2 vertices and excluding sides.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:  
\[
\text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}
\]  
This formula arises because each vertex connects to \( n-3 \) other vertices (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), and each diagonal is counted twice (once from each endpoint).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up an equation where the number of diagonals equals the number of sides.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the diagonal formula from Step 2 and set it equal to \( n \), the number of sides.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the number of diagonals equals the number of sides:  
\[
\frac{n(n-3)}{2} = n
\]  
This is the equation to solve for \( n \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = n \) for \( n \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Simplify and solve the quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[
\frac{n(n-3)}{2} = n
\]  
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[
n(n-3) = 2n
\]  
Expand and rearrange:  
\[
n^2 - 3n = 2n
\]  
\[
n^2 - 3n - 2n = 0
\]  
\[
n^2 - 5n = 0
\]  
Factorize:  
\[
n(n-5) = 0
\]  
Solutions are \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 5 \). Since \( n = 0 \) is not valid for a polygon (a polygon must have at least 3 sides), we have \( n = 5 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that a polygon with 5 sides satisfies the condition.  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate the number of diagonals for \( n = 5 \) and check if it equals 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a polygon with \( n = 5 \) sides:  
\[
\text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = \frac{5(5-3)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{2} = 5
\]  
Since the number of diagonals (5) equals the number of sides (5), the condition is satisfied.  
[/IMP]
