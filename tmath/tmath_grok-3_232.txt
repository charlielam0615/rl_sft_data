[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling - Planning  
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable subgoals. The goal is to find two integers, \( a \) and \( b \), such that \( a + b = 246 \) and their product \( a \cdot b \) is maximized. Subgoals:  
1. Formulate the problem mathematically to express the product in terms of one variable.  
2. Determine the optimal values of the integers by maximizing the product.  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it meets the constraints and is the maximum.

### Step 2: Select Action from Meta-Cognitive Action Set

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal - Implementation  
Current Goal: Formulate the product mathematically in terms of one variable.  
How to Achieve: Express one integer in terms of the other using the sum constraint \( a + b = 246 \), and write the product as a function of one variable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the two integers be \( a \) and \( b \). Given \( a + b = 246 \), we can express \( b \) as \( b = 246 - a \). The product to maximize is \( P = a \cdot b = a \cdot (246 - a) \). Thus, the product function is:  
\[ P(a) = a (246 - a) = 246a - a^2 \]  
This is a quadratic function in \( a \).

### Step 3: Select Action from Meta-Cognitive Action Set

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal - Implementation  
Current Goal: Determine the optimal values of the integers by maximizing the product.  
How to Achieve: Since \( P(a) = 246a - a^2 \) is a quadratic function, find the vertex of the parabola to maximize the product, as the coefficient of \( a^2 \) is negative, indicating a downward-opening parabola.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To maximize \( P(a) = 246a - a^2 \), rewrite it in standard quadratic form:  
\[ P(a) = -a^2 + 246a \]  
The vertex of a quadratic function \( f(a) = ma^2 + na + c \) occurs at \( a = -\frac{n}{2m} \). Here, \( m = -1 \), \( n = 246 \), so:  
\[ a = -\frac{246}{2 \cdot (-1)} = \frac{246}{2} = 123 \]  
Then, \( b = 246 - a = 246 - 123 = 123 \).  
The product is:  
\[ P = a \cdot b = 123 \cdot 123 = 123^2 \]  
Calculate \( 123^2 \):  
\[ 123 \cdot 123 = (120 + 3) \cdot (120 + 3) = 120^2 + 2 \cdot 120 \cdot 3 + 3^2 = 14400 + 720 + 9 = 15129 \]  
Thus, when \( a = 123 \) and \( b = 123 \), the product is 15129.

### Step 4: Select Action from Meta-Cognitive Action Set

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation - Implementation  
Current Goal: Verify that the solution \( a = 123 \), \( b = 123 \) maximizes the product and satisfies the constraints.  
How to Achieve: Check if the sum is 246, compare the product with nearby integer pairs, and confirm the quadratic functionâ€™s maximum occurs at \( a = 123 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. **Check the sum**:  
\[ a + b = 123 + 123 = 246 \]  
The sum constraint is satisfied.  

2. **Compare with nearby integer pairs**:  
Test pairs like \( (122, 124) \) and \( (124, 122) \):  
\[ 122 \cdot 124 = 122 \cdot (120 + 4) = 122 \cdot 120 + 122 \cdot 4 = 14640 + 488 = 15128 \]  
Test \( (121, 125) \):  
\[ 121 \cdot 125 = 121 \cdot (120 + 5) = 121 \cdot 120 + 121 \cdot 5 = 14520 + 605 = 15125 \]  
The product 15128 (for \( 122, 124 \)) is less than 15129, and 15125 (for \( 121, 125 \)) is also less, suggesting \( 123 \cdot 123 = 15129 \) is the maximum.  

3. **Confirm the quadratic maximum**:  
The vertex at \( a = 123 \) gives the maximum for \( P(a) = -a^2 + 246a \). Alternatively, note that for a fixed sum \( S = a + b \), the product is maximized when \( a \) and \( b \) are as equal as possible (by AM-GM inequality):  
\[ \frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab} \implies \frac{246}{2} = 123 \geq \sqrt{ab} \]  
Equality holds when \( a = b \), so \( a = b = 123 \).
