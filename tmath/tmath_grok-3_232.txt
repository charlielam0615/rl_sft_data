### Problem Statement
Find the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to maximize the product of two integers summing to 246.  
1. Define the two integers as \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 246 \).  
2. Express the product as \( P = x \cdot y \) and rewrite it using the sum constraint: \( y = 246 - x \), so \( P = x \cdot (246 - x) \).  
3. Determine the value of \( x \) that maximizes the quadratic function \( P = x \cdot (246 - x) \).  
4. Verify the integers are valid and compute the maximum product.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maximize the product \( P = x \cdot (246 - x) \). This can be achieved by finding the vertex of the quadratic function, either through calculus (taking the derivative) or by recognizing the symmetry of the parabola.

[IMP]
Rewrite the product: \( P = x \cdot (246 - x) = 246x - x^2 \). This is a quadratic function in the form \( P(x) = -x^2 + 246x \). The maximum of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \), \( b = 246 \), so:  
\[ x = -\frac{246}{2(-1)} = \frac{246}{2} = 123. \]  
Thus, \( x = 123 \), and \( y = 246 - 123 = 123 \). The product is:  
\[ P = 123 \cdot 123 = 123^2 = 15129. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( x = 123 \) and \( y = 123 \) yield the maximum product by checking the sum and testing nearby integer pairs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the sum: \( 123 + 123 = 246 \), which satisfies the condition.  
Test nearby integer pairs to confirm the maximum:  
- For \( x = 122 \), \( y = 124 \): \( 122 + 124 = 246 \), product = \( 122 \cdot 124 = 15128 \).  
- For \( x = 121 \), \( y = 125 \): \( 121 + 125 = 246 \), product = \( 121 \cdot 125 = 15125 \).  
- For \( x = 124 \), \( y = 122 \): Same as \( 122 \cdot 124 = 15128 \).  
Since \( 15128 < 15129 \) and \( 15125 < 15129 \), the product at \( x = 123 \), \( y = 123 \) is larger.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest product of two integers summing to 246.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the integers and express the product (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Maximize the product using the quadratic function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by summarizing results.  
The maximum product is achieved when \( x = 123 \), \( y = 123 \), yielding \( 123 \cdot 123 = 15129 \).

### Final Answer
The greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246 is **15129**, achieved when both integers are 123.
