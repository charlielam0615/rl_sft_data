**Problem Statement**: Find the greatest integer \( x \) such that \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) is a prime number.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the greatest integer \( x \) that makes \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) prime. Subgoals:  
1. Understand the expression \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) and the condition for it to be prime.  
2. Since \( x \) is an integer, evaluate the quadratic expression \( 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \) for integer values of \( x \).  
3. Determine the range of \( x \) values to test, considering the absolute value and prime condition.  
4. Test integer values of \( x \) to find when the expression yields a prime number.  
5. Identify the greatest \( x \) among the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to understand the expression \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) and the condition for it to be prime. Achieve this by analyzing the quadratic \( 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \), noting that the absolute value ensures the result is non-negative, and a prime number must be a positive integer greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The expression is \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \). Let \( f(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \). Since the absolute value is taken, we need \( |f(x)| = f(x) \) (when \( f(x) \geq 0 \)) or \( |f(x)| = -f(x) \) (when \( f(x) < 0 \)) to be prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.). Thus, we need to compute \( f(x) \) for integer \( x \), take the absolute value, and check if the result is prime.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the approach by determining the behavior of \( f(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \) and the effect of the absolute value. Analyze the quadratic to understand when \( f(x) \) is positive or negative and how this impacts \( |f(x)| \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic \( f(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \) has a positive leading coefficient (6), so the parabola opens upward. Find the roots to determine where \( f(x) \geq 0 \):  
Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 6 \), \( b = -47 \), \( c = 15 \).  
Discriminant: \( (-47)^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 15 = 2209 - 360 = 1849 \).  
Since \( \sqrt{1849} = 43 \), roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{47 \pm 43}{12} \]  
- \( x_1 = \frac{47 + 43}{12} = \frac{90}{12} = 7.5 \)  
- \( x_2 = \frac{47 - 43}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \)  
Since the parabola opens upward, \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for \( x \leq \frac{1}{3} \) or \( x \geq 7.5 \). For integers:  
- \( x \leq 0 \) or \( x \geq 8 \): \( f(x) \geq 0 \), so \( |f(x)| = f(x) \).  
- \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \): \( f(x) < 0 \), so \( |f(x)| = -f(x) \).  
This validates that we need to compute \( f(x) \) and check \( |f(x)| \) for primality, considering the sign change.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since \( f(x) \) changes sign, adjust the subgoals to account for testing both \( f(x) \) and \( -f(x) \) where appropriate:  
1. Test integer \( x \) where \( f(x) \geq 0 \) (i.e., \( x \leq 0 \) or \( x \geq 8 \)) for \( f(x) \) being prime.  
2. Test integer \( x \) where \( f(x) < 0 \) (i.e., \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \)) for \( -f(x) \) being prime.  
3. Since we want the greatest \( x \), prioritize testing larger \( x \) values first, then smaller (including negative) values.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to test integer \( x \geq 8 \) where \( f(x) \geq 0 \), so \( |f(x)| = f(x) \), and check if \( f(x) \) is prime. Start with larger \( x \) to find the greatest \( x \). Compute \( f(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \) and test for primality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test \( x \geq 8 \):  
- \( x = 8 \): \( f(8) = 6(64) - 47(8) + 15 = 384 - 376 + 15 = 23 \). Prime (divisors: 1, 23).  
- \( x = 9 \): \( f(9) = 6(81) - 47(9) + 15 = 486 - 423 + 15 = 78 \). Not prime (\( 78 = 2 \cdot 39 \)).  
- \( x = 10 \): \( f(10) = 6(100) - 47(10) + 15 = 600 - 470 + 15 = 145 \). Not prime (\( 145 = 5 \cdot 29 \)).  
- \( x = 11 \): \( f(11) = 6(121) - 47(11) + 15 = 726 - 517 + 15 = 224 \). Not prime (\( 224 = 2 \cdot 112 \)).  
Since \( f(x) \) grows quadratically, larger \( x \) yields larger values, which are less likely to be prime. Stop testing larger \( x \) as values like 78, 145, 224 are composite. The greatest \( x \geq 8 \) yielding a prime is \( x = 8 \) with \( f(8) = 23 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to test integer \( x \) from 1 to 7 where \( f(x) < 0 \), so \( |f(x)| = -f(x) \), and check if \( -f(x) \) is prime. Compute \( f(x) \) and test \( -f(x) \) for primality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 7 \):  
- \( x = 1 \): \( f(1) = 6(1) - 47(1) + 15 = 6 - 47 + 15 = -26 \). \( |-26| = 26 \). Not prime (\( 26 = 2 \cdot 13 \)).  
- \( x = 2 \): \( f(2) = 6(4) - 47(2) + 15 = 24 - 94 + 15 = -55 \). \( |-55| = 55 \). Not prime (\( 55 = 5 \cdot 11 \)).  
- \( x = 3 \): \( f(3) = 6(9) - 47(3) + 15 = 54 - 141 + 15 = -72 \). \( |-72| = 72 \). Not prime (\( 72 = 2 \cdot 36 \)).  
- \( x = 4 \): \( f(4) = 6(16) - 47(4) + 15 = 96 - 188 + 15 = -77 \). \( |-77| = 77 \). Not prime (\( 77 = 7 \cdot 11 \)).  
- \( x = 5 \): \( f(5) = 6(25) - 47(5) + 15 = 150 - 235 + 15 = -70 \). \( |-70| = 70 \). Not prime (\( 70 = 2 \cdot 35 \)).  
- \( x = 6 \): \( f(6) = 6(36) - 47(6) + 15 = 216 - 282 + 15 = -51 \). \( |-51| = 51 \). Not prime (\( 51 = 3 \cdot 17 \)).  
- \( x = 7 \): \( f(7) = 6(49) - 47(7) + 15 = 294 - 329 + 15 = -20 \). \( |-20| = 20 \). Not prime (\( 20 = 2 \cdot 10 \)).  
No prime values found in this range.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to test negative integers \( x \leq 0 \) where \( f(x) \geq 0 \), so \( |f(x)| = f(x) \), and check if \( f(x) \) is prime. Test negative \( x \) to ensure all possibilities are covered.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test \( x \leq 0 \):  
- \( x = 0 \): \( f(0) = 6(0) - 47(0) + 15 = 15 \). Not prime (\( 15 = 3 \cdot 5 \)).  
- \( x = -1 \): \( f(-1) = 6(1) - 47(-1) + 15 = 6 + 47 + 15 = 68 \). Not prime (\( 68 = 2 \cdot 34 \)).  
- \( x = -2 \): \( f(-2) = 6(4) - 47(-2) + 15 = 24 + 94 + 15 = 133 \). Not prime (\( 133 = 7 \cdot 19 \)).  
- \( x = -3 \): \( f(-3) = 6(9) - 47(-3) + 15 = 54 + 141 + 15 = 210 \). Not prime (\( 210 = 2 \cdot 105 \)).  
Since \( f(x) \) grows quadratically for negative \( x \), larger negative values yield larger composites. Stop testing as values like 68, 133, 210 are not prime.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest integer \( x \) such that \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) is prime.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the expression and primality condition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate \( f(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \) for integer \( x \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine range of \( x \) (completed: \( x \leq 0 \), \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \), \( x \geq 8 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test integers for primality (completed: tested \( x \geq 8 \), \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \), \( x \leq 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify greatest \( x \) (current).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest \( x \) where \( |f(x)| \) is prime. From tests:  
- \( x = 8 \): \( |f(8)| = 23 \) (prime).  
- No other tested \( x \) yielded a prime.  
Thus, the greatest \( x \) is likely 8.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate if \( x = 8 \) is the greatest integer by considering if larger \( x \) could yield smaller primes (e.g., 2, 3, 5). Check if \( |f(x)| \) can equal small primes for \( x > 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x > 8 \), \( f(x) \geq f(8) = 23 \), since \( f(x) \) is increasing (derivative \( f'(x) = 12x - 47 > 0 \) for \( x > \frac{47}{12} \approx 3.916 \)). Solve \( f(x) = p \) for small primes \( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 \):  
\[ 6x^2 - 47x + 15 = p \]  
\[ 6x^2 - 47x + (15 - p) = 0 \]  
Discriminant: \( \Delta = (-47)^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot (15 - p) = 2209 - 24(15 - p) = 1849 + 24p \).  
For integer solutions, \( \Delta \) must be a perfect square, and \( x = \frac{47 \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{12} \) must be an integer. Test small primes:  
- \( p = 2 \): \( \Delta = 1849 + 24 \cdot 2 = 1897 \). Not a perfect square (\( 43^2 = 1849 \), \( 44^2 = 1936 \)).  
- \( p = 3 \): \( \Delta = 1849 + 24 \cdot 3 = 1921 \). Not a perfect square.  
- \( p = 5 \): \( \Delta = 1849 + 24 \cdot 5 = 1969 \). Not a perfect square.  
- \( p = 7 \): \( \Delta = 1849 + 24 \cdot 7 = 2017 \). Not a perfect square.  
Similarly, for \( p = 11, 13, 17, 19 \), \( \Delta \) is not a perfect square. For negative \( f(x) \), solve \( f(x) = -p \), but \( -f(x) = p \) was tested in \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \) and yielded no primes. Thus, no \( x > 8 \) yields small primes.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest integer \( x \) such that \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) is prime.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate \( f(x) \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine range of \( x \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test integers for primality (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify greatest \( x \) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the greatest \( x \). From tests, \( x = 8 \) gives \( |f(8)| = 23 \), which is prime. No larger \( x \) yielded a prime, and smaller primes were not achievable for \( x > 8 \). Negative \( x \) and \( 1 \leq x \leq 7 \) yielded no primes. Thus, the greatest \( x \) is 8.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The greatest integer \( x \) such that \( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \) is prime is \( 8 \).  
\[ \boxed{8} \]
