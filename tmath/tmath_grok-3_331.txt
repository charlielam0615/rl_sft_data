**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( ab \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers satisfying \( a + b = 24 \) and \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the first equation \( a + b = 24 \) to express one variable in terms of the other.  
2. Substitute into the second equation \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \) to form a single equation.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for possible values of \( a \) and \( b \).  
4. Verify solutions to ensure they are positive integers and satisfy both equations.  
5. Compute \( ab \) for the valid solution(s).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using \( a + b = 24 \).  
Description: From \( a + b = 24 \), solve for \( b \) to obtain \( b = 24 - a \). This will allow substitution into the second equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \( a + b = 24 \), we get:  
\[ b = 24 - a \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute \( b = 24 - a \) into the second equation \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \) to form a single equation in \( a \).  
Description: Replace \( b \) with \( 24 - a \) in \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \), simplify, and form a quadratic equation in \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( b = 24 - a \) into \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \):  
\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 3(24 - a) + 222 \]  
Left side:  
\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 48a - 2a^2 + 10a = -2a^2 + 58a \]  
Right side:  
\[ 3(24 - a) + 222 = 72 - 3a + 222 = 294 - 3a \]  
Equate both sides:  
\[ -2a^2 + 58a = 294 - 3a \]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ -2a^2 + 58a + 3a - 294 = 0 \]  
\[ -2a^2 + 61a - 294 = 0 \]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) for simplicity:  
\[ 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \) for \( a \).  
Description: Use the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 2 \), \( B = -61 \), \( C = 294 \), to find possible values of \( a \). Check if solutions are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \), apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ a = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]  
Here, \( A = 2 \), \( B = -61 \), \( C = 294 \).  
Discriminant:  
\[ B^2 - 4AC = (-61)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 294 = 3721 - 2352 = 1369 \]  
\[ \sqrt{1369} = 37 \]  
So:  
\[ a = \frac{61 \pm 37}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{61 \pm 37}{4} \]  
Solutions:  
\[ a = \frac{61 + 37}{4} = \frac{98}{4} = 24.5 \]  
\[ a = \frac{61 - 37}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]  
Since \( a \) must be a positive integer, \( a = 6 \) is valid; \( a = 24.5 \) is not.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find \( b \) using \( a = 6 \) and verify the solution satisfies both equations.  
Description: Use \( b = 24 - a \) to compute \( b \). Substitute \( a = 6 \), \( b \) into \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \) to confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( a = 6 \):  
\[ b = 24 - 6 = 18 \]  
Verify in \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \):  
Left side:  
\[ 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 18 + 10 \cdot 6 = 216 + 60 = 276 \]  
Right side:  
\[ 3 \cdot 18 + 222 = 54 + 222 = 276 \]  
\[ 276 = 276 \], so the equation holds.  
Check \( a + b = 24 \):  
\[ 6 + 18 = 24 \], which is satisfied.  
Both equations are satisfied with \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( ab \) for the solution \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \).  
Description: Multiply \( a \) and \( b \) to find \( ab \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[ ab = 6 \cdot 18 = 108 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm there are no other valid solutions.  
Description: Since \( a + b = 24 \), test if other integer pairs yield valid solutions by rechecking the quadratic or testing values, ensuring all possibilities are covered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \) yielded \( a = 6 \) or \( a = 24.5 \). Since \( a = 24.5 \) is not an integer, consider if other approaches might yield different solutions.  
Since \( a + b = 24 \), if \( a = 18 \), then \( b = 6 \). Test \( a = 18 \), \( b = 6 \):  
\[ 2 \cdot 18 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 18 = 216 + 180 = 396 \]  
\[ 3 \cdot 6 + 222 = 18 + 222 = 240 \]  
\[ 396 \neq 240 \], so this does not satisfy.  
The quadratic equation accounts for all substitutions of \( b = 24 - a \), and only \( a = 6 \) was an integer. Thus, no other positive integer solutions exist.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( ab \) where \( a + b = 24 \) and \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \( b \) as \( b = 24 - a \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute into the second equation to form \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the quadratic for \( a \), yielding \( a = 6 \).

[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( ab \) is \( 108 \).
