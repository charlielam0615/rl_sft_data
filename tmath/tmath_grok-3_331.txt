**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( ab \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers satisfying \( a + b = 24 \) and the equation \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( ab \).  
1. Use the first equation \( a + b = 24 \) to express one variable in terms of the other.  
2. Substitute into the second equation \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \) to form a single equation.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.  
4. Ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers and compute \( ab \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using \( a + b = 24 \) and substitute into the second equation to create a solvable equation for \( a \). This will be achieved by isolating \( b \) and substituting into \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \( a + b = 24 \), we get \( b = 24 - a \).  
Substitute \( b = 24 - a \) into the second equation:  
\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 3(24 - a) + 222 \]  
Expand both sides:  
- Left: \( 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 48a - 2a^2 + 10a = -2a^2 + 58a \).  
- Right: \( 3(24 - a) + 222 = 72 - 3a + 222 = 294 - 3a \).  
Equate:  
\[ -2a^2 + 58a = 294 - 3a \]  
Simplify:  
\[ -2a^2 + 58a + 3a - 294 = 0 \]  
\[ -2a^2 + 61a - 294 = 0 \]  
Multiply by \(-1\) for simplicity:  
\[ 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \) for \( a \), ensuring solutions are positive integers, then find corresponding \( b \) using \( b = 24 - a \), and compute \( ab \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \).  
Use the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 2 \), \( B = -61 \), \( C = 294 \):  
- Discriminant: \( B^2 - 4AC = (-61)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 294 = 3721 - 2352 = 1369 \).  
- Since \( \sqrt{1369} = 37 \), we have:  
\[ a = \frac{61 \pm 37}{4} \]  
- Case 1: \( a = \frac{61 + 37}{4} = \frac{98}{4} = 24.5 \).  
- Case 2: \( a = \frac{61 - 37}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \).  
Since \( a \) must be a positive integer, discard \( a = 24.5 \) and take \( a = 6 \).  
Then, \( b = 24 - a = 24 - 6 = 18 \).  
Compute \( ab = 6 \cdot 18 = 108 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \) satisfies the second equation \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \), and confirm both are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \) satisfies \( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \):  
- Left: \( 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 18 + 10 \cdot 6 = 216 + 60 = 276 \).  
- Right: \( 3 \cdot 18 + 222 = 54 + 222 = 276 \).  
Since \( 276 = 276 \), the solution is valid.  
Confirm: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \) are positive integers, and \( a + b = 6 + 18 = 24 \).  
Thus, \( ab = 108 \).

  - Subgoal 2: Substitute into the second equation to form a quadratic in \( a \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the quadratic for integer solutions of \( a \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( b \) and verify the solution.  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution and finalize \( ab \).  
The solution \( a = 6 \), \( b = 18 \), \( ab = 108 \) has been validated.
