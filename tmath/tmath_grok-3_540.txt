**Problem Restatement**: Find the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots\), and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
2. Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence.  
3. Compute the sum for the first six terms.  
4. Simplify the result to a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence. This can be achieved by examining the given terms and calculating the ratio between consecutive terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The first term is \(\frac{1}{2}\).  
To find the common ratio, divide the second term by the first term:  
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Verify with the next pair:  
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Thus, the first term \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and the common ratio \(r = \frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term and common ratio (completed: \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(r = \frac{1}{2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the sum for the first six terms.  
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the result to a common fraction.  
**Current Goal**: Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence. The formula is \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\), where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms. We will use \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(n = 6\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is:  
\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.
\]
Substitute \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(n = 6\):  
\[
S_6 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}.
\]
Compute the components:  
- \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64}\).  
- Numerator: \(1 - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{64}{64} - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{63}{64}\).  
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\).  

Thus:  
\[
S_6 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\frac{63}{64}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{63}{64} \cdot 2 = \frac{63}{64}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed sum \(\frac{63}{64}\). This can be achieved by manually calculating the sum of the first six terms and comparing the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
List the first six terms:  
\[
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}, \frac{1}{64}.
\]
Sum them:  
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{64}.
\]
Use a common denominator (64):  
\[
\frac{32}{64} + \frac{16}{64} + \frac{8}{64} + \frac{4}{64} + \frac{2}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1}{64} = \frac{63}{64}.
\]
The manual sum matches the formula result, confirming \(\frac{63}{64}\).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term and common ratio (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the sum for the first six terms (completed: \(\frac{63}{64}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the result to a common fraction (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the result to a common fraction.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the result \(\frac{63}{64}\) to a common fraction. This involves checking if the fraction can be reduced by finding common factors of the numerator and denominator.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if \(\frac{63}{64}\) can be simplified:  
- Numerator: \(63 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 7\).  
- Denominator: \(64 = 2^6\).  
No common factors exist between 63 and 64. Thus, \(\frac{63}{64}\) is already in its simplest form as a common fraction.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence is \(\frac{63}{64}\).
