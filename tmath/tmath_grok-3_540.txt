**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence. Subgoals:  
1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence.  
2. Verify that the sequence is geometric.  
3. Apply the geometric series sum formula for the first six terms.  
4. Simplify the result into a common fraction.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence.  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the given terms (\(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots\)) to determine the first term and calculate the ratio between consecutive terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first term is \(\frac{1}{2}\). To find the common ratio, divide the second term by the first: \(\frac{1/4}{1/2} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2}\). Verify with the next pair: \(\frac{1/8}{1/4} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{2}\). Thus, the first term \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and the common ratio \(r = \frac{1}{2}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the sequence is geometric.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the ratio between consecutive terms remains constant for additional terms in the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence is \(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots\). From Step 2, the ratio between the first and second terms is \(\frac{1}{2}\). For the third to fourth term, the next term is \(\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}\), and the ratio is \(\frac{1/16}{1/8} = \frac{1}{16} \cdot 8 = \frac{1}{2}\). The constant ratio \(\frac{1}{2}\) confirms the sequence is geometric.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term and common ratio (completed: \(a = \frac{1}{2}, r = \frac{1}{2}\)).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the geometric series sum formula for the first six terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series, \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\), with \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(n = 6\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\). Substituting \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(n = 6\):  
\[ S_6 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]  
Calculate \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).  
Numerator: \(1 - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{64}{64} - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{63}{64}\).  
Denominator: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
Thus, \(S_6 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\frac{63}{64}}{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{63}{64} \cdot 2 = \frac{63}{64}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the sum calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the sum by adding the first six terms manually and compare with the formula result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first six terms are: \(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}, \frac{1}{64}\).  
Sum: \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{64}\).  
Common denominator is 64:  
\(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{32}{64}\), \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{16}{64}\), \(\frac{1}{8} = \frac{8}{64}\), \(\frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{64}\), \(\frac{1}{32} = \frac{2}{64}\), \(\frac{1}{64} = \frac{1}{64}\).  
Total: \(\frac{32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1}{64} = \frac{63}{64}\).  
This matches the formula result from Step 5.

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the result into a common fraction.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \(\frac{63}{64}\) can be simplified by finding common factors of the numerator and denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To simplify \(\frac{63}{64}\), find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 63 and 64.  
Factors of 63: 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63.  
Factors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.  
GCD is 1, so \(\frac{63}{64}\) is already in its simplest form.

The sum of the first six terms of the geometric sequence is \(\frac{63}{64}\).
