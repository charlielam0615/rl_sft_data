**Problem Statement**: Given that \( a = 3b \), \( b = 2c \), and \( c = 4d \), find the value of \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \):  
1. Express \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in terms of \( d \) using the given relationships.  
2. Substitute these expressions into the expression \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to find the numerical value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in terms of \( d \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the given relationships \( a = 3b \), \( b = 2c \), and \( c = 4d \) to derive expressions for each variable in terms of \( d \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \( c = 4d \), we have \( c = 4d \).  
From \( b = 2c \), substitute \( c = 4d \):  
\[ b = 2 \cdot (4d) = 8d. \]  
From \( a = 3b \), substitute \( b = 8d \):  
\[ a = 3 \cdot (8d) = 24d. \]  
Thus, \( a = 24d \), \( b = 8d \), and \( c = 4d \).

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in terms of \( d \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute expressions into \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the expression (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Substitute the expressions for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Substitute the expressions \( a = 24d \), \( b = 8d \), and \( c = 4d \) into \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Plug the expressions into the formula and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 24d \), \( b = 8d \), \( c = 4d \), and \( d = d \) into \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \):  
\[ \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{(24d) \cdot (4d)}{(8d) \cdot d}. \]  
Simplify the expression:  
\[ \frac{24d \cdot 4d}{8d \cdot d} = \frac{96d^2}{8d^2}. \]  
Since \( d \neq 0 \) (to avoid division by zero), cancel \( d^2 \) from the numerator and denominator:  
\[ \frac{96}{8} = 12. \]  
Thus, the value is 12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the computed value \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the expression using an alternative approach or check consistency with the given relationships.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Alternative approach: Express the fraction directly in terms of the relationships.  
From \( a = 3b \), \( b = 2c \), and \( c = 4d \), compute the fraction:  
\[ \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{(3b) \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{3b \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 3 \cdot \frac{c}{d}, \]  
since \( b \) cancels out (assuming \( b \neq 0 \)).  
Now, \( c = 4d \), so:  
\[ \frac{c}{d} = \frac{4d}{d} = 4. \]  
Thus:  
\[ 3 \cdot 4 = 12. \]  
This matches the previous result, confirming the value is 12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the final answer by recalling relevant information.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the relationships \( a = 3b \), \( b = 2c \), \( c = 4d \), and the expression \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- Relationships: \( a = 3b \), \( b = 2c \), \( c = 4d \).  
- From Step 2: \( a = 24d \), \( b = 8d \), \( c = 4d \).  
- From Step 4: Substituting into \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \) yields \( \frac{96d^2}{8d^2} = 12 \).  
- From Step 5: Alternative computation using relationships directly gives \( 3 \cdot \frac{c}{d} = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \).  
The recalled information consistently points to \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} \) is 12.
