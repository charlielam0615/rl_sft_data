### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\), given the relationships:
- \(a = 3b\),
- \(b = 2c\),
- \(c = 4d\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express all variables (\(a\), \(b\), \(c\)) in terms of a single variable (\(d\)) using the given relationships.  
2. Substitute these expressions into the expression \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\).  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to compute the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(d\) using the given relationships. This will be achieved by applying the equations \(a = 3b\), \(b = 2c\), and \(c = 4d\) sequentially.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the given relationships:  
- \(c = 4d\).  
- \(b = 2c = 2 \cdot 4d = 8d\).  
- \(a = 3b = 3 \cdot 8d = 24d\).  

Thus, we have:  
- \(a = 24d\),  
- \(b = 8d\),  
- \(c = 4d\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute the expressions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(d\) into \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\) and simplify the result. This will be achieved by plugging in \(a = 24d\), \(b = 8d\), \(c = 4d\) into the expression and performing algebraic simplification.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute the expressions into \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\):  
\[
\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{(24d) \cdot (4d)}{(8d) \cdot d}.
\]  

Simplify the expression:  
\[
\frac{(24d) \cdot (4d)}{(8d) \cdot d} = \frac{24 \cdot 4 \cdot d^2}{8 \cdot d^2}.
\]  

Cancel \(d^2\) from the numerator and denominator (since \(d \neq 0\)):  
\[
\frac{24 \cdot 4}{8}.
\]  

Compute the numerical value:  
\[
24 \cdot 4 = 96, \quad \frac{96}{8} = 12.
\]  

Thus, the value of \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed value of \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12\) by rechecking the substitutions and simplification steps, and possibly using an alternative approach to confirm the result. This will be achieved by recomputing the expression using the relationships directly in terms of ratios and cross-checking.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, letâ€™s recompute \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\) using the relationships directly:  
- From \(a = 3b\), \(b = 2c\), and \(c = 4d\), express the ratio:  
\[
\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{(3b) \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 3 \cdot \frac{c}{d} \quad (\text{cancel } b, \text{ since } b \neq 0).
\]  
- Since \(c = 4d\), we have \(\frac{c}{d} = \frac{4d}{d} = 4\).  
- Thus:  
\[
3 \cdot \frac{c}{d} = 3 \cdot 4 = 12.
\]  

This confirms the result.  

Alternatively, assign a numerical value to \(d\) (e.g., \(d = 1\)) and compute:  
- \(c = 4d = 4 \cdot 1 = 4\),  
- \(b = 2c = 2 \cdot 4 = 8\),  
- \(a = 3b = 3 \cdot 8 = 24\).  
- Then:  
\[
\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{24 \cdot 4}{8 \cdot 1} = \frac{96}{8} = 12.
\]  

Both methods yield \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12\), confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute the value of \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(d\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute expressions into \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\) and simplify.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computed result.  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, and the result (\(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = 12\)) has been validated. No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}\) is \(12\).
