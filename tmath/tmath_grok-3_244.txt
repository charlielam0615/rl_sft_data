**Problem Statement**: Given three complex numbers \( a + bi \), \( c + di \), and \( e + fi \), with the conditions \( b = 1 \), \( e = -a - c \), and their sum equal to \( -i \), find the value of \( d + f \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( d + f \).  
1. Express the sum of the complex numbers using the given conditions.  
2. Set up equations based on the real and imaginary parts of the sum.  
3. Use the condition \( e = -a - c \) to substitute and simplify.  
4. Solve for the variables and compute \( d + f \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the sum of the complex numbers and set it equal to \( -i \).  
**How to Achieve**: Write the sum \( (a + bi) + (c + di) + (e + fi) \), substitute \( b = 1 \) and \( e = -a - c \), and equate to \( -i \). Separate real and imaginary parts to form equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of the complex numbers is:  
\[ (a + bi) + (c + di) + (e + fi) = (a + c + e) + (b + d + f)i \]  
Given \( b = 1 \), the sum becomes:  
\[ (a + c + e) + (1 + d + f)i \]  
Given \( e = -a - c \), substitute:  
\[ a + c + e = a + c + (-a - c) = a + c - a - c = 0 \]  
Thus, the sum is:  
\[ 0 + (1 + d + f)i = (1 + d + f)i \]  
The problem states the sum equals \( -i \), or \( 0 - i \). Equate real and imaginary parts:  
- Real part: \( 0 = 0 \) (satisfied).  
- Imaginary part: \( 1 + d + f = -1 \).  
This gives the equation:  
\[ d + f = -1 - 1 = -2 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the equation \( d + f = -2 \) is consistent with all given conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if substituting \( d + f = -2 \) and the given conditions into the sum yields \( -i \), and ensure no contradictions arise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( d + f = -2 \), the sum from Step 2 is:  
\[ 0 + (1 + d + f)i = 0 + (1 - 2)i = -i \]  
This matches the given sum \( -i \).  
Re-evaluate the conditions:  
- \( b = 1 \) is used in the sum.  
- \( e = -a - c \) ensures the real part of the sum is zero.  
- The imaginary part equation \( 1 + d + f = -1 \) is satisfied.  
No additional constraints restrict \( d \) or \( f \) individually, so \( d + f = -2 \) is consistent.
