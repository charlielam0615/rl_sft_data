### Problem Statement
We are given three complex numbers \( a + bi \), \( c + di \), and \( e + fi \), with the conditions:
- \( b = 1 \)
- \( e = -a - c \)
- The sum of the complex numbers is \( -i \)
We need to find the value of \( d + f \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( d + f \):
1. Express the sum of the complex numbers using the given conditions.
2. Set up equations based on the sum equaling \( -i \).
3. Use the condition \( e = -a - c \) to substitute and simplify.
4. Solve for the variables and compute \( d + f \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Express the sum of the complex numbers and set it equal to \( -i \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Write the sum \( (a + bi) + (c + di) + (e + fi) \), substitute \( b = 1 \) and \( e = -a - c \), and equate to \( -i \). This will give equations for the real and imaginary parts.  

[IMP]  
The sum of the complex numbers is:  
\[ (a + bi) + (c + di) + (e + fi) = (a + c + e) + (b + d + f)i \]  
Given \( b = 1 \), the sum becomes:  
\[ (a + c + e) + (1 + d + f)i \]  
Given \( e = -a - c \), substitute:  
\[ a + c + e = a + c + (-a - c) = 0 \]  
So the sum is:  
\[ 0 + (1 + d + f)i = (1 + d + f)i \]  
This is equal to \( -i \), or \( 0 - 1i \). Equate real and imaginary parts:  
- Real part: \( 0 = 0 \) (satisfied)  
- Imaginary part: \( 1 + d + f = -1 \)  
Thus:  
\[ d + f = -2 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the equation \( d + f = -2 \) and ensure no contradictions arise from the given conditions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if the solution satisfies all conditions and consider whether additional constraints exist.  

[IMP]  
The equation \( d + f = -2 \) was derived from equating the imaginary parts. Let’s verify:  
- The real part of the sum is \( a + c + e = a + c + (-a - c) = 0 \), which holds.  
- The imaginary part gives \( 1 + d + f = -1 \), so \( d + f = -2 \).  
- No additional constraints are provided for \( d \) or \( f \) individually, so the solution is consistent with the given conditions.  
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the problem’s requirements.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals:  
- Main goal: Find \( d + f \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the sum of complex numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations using the sum \( -i \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Substitute \( e = -a - c \) and solve (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer for \( d + f \).  

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals shows we have systematically worked through expressing the sum, applying the given conditions, and solving for \( d + f \). The result \( d + f = -2 \) was derived and verified. No further subgoals are needed, as the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
\[ d + f = -2 \]  
\[ \boxed{-2} \]
