**Problem Statement**: A study surveyed 100 men, of whom 60% support increased funding for medical research, and 900 women, of whom 80% support increased funding. We need to calculate the overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the number of men who support increased funding.
2. Calculate the number of women who support increased funding.
3. Sum the number of supporters from both groups.
4. Calculate the total number of people surveyed.
5. Compute the overall percentage of people who support increased funding by dividing the total supporters by the total surveyed and multiplying by 100.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of men and women who support increased funding.

**How to Achieve**: Use the given percentages and sample sizes to compute the number of supporters. For men, multiply 100 by 60% (0.6). For women, multiply 900 by 80% (0.8).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

- Number of men who support funding: 100 × 0.6 = 60 men.
- Number of women who support funding: 900 × 0.8 = 720 women.

[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Sum the number of supporters and calculate the total number of people surveyed.

**How to Achieve**: Add the number of men and women who support funding (60 + 720). Then, add the total number of men and women surveyed (100 + 900).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

- Total supporters: 60 (men) + 720 (women) = 780 people.
- Total people surveyed: 100 (men) + 900 (women) = 1000 people.

[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute the overall percentage of people who support increased funding.

**How to Achieve**: Divide the total number of supporters (780) by the total number of people surveyed (1000), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

- Overall percentage: (780 / 1000) × 100 = 78%.

[/IMP]

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Calculate the overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of men who support funding (completed: 60 men).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of women who support funding (completed: 720 women).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the number of supporters (completed: 780 people).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the total number of people surveyed (completed: 1000 people).
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the overall percentage (completed: 78%).

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.

[/REVIEW]

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations to ensure the overall percentage is correct.

**How to Achieve**: Recheck the calculations for each step and confirm the final percentage by recomputing.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

- Verify men’s supporters: 100 × 0.6 = 60 (correct).
- Verify women’s supporters: 900 × 0.8 = 720 (correct).
- Verify total supporters: 60 + 720 = 780 (correct).
- Verify total surveyed: 100 + 900 = 1000 (correct).
- Verify percentage: (780 / 1000) × 100 = 78% (correct).

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**

The overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding is 78%.
