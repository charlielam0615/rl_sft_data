**Problem Statement**: A study surveyed 100 men and 900 women, finding that 60% of men and 80% of women support increased funding for medical research. We need to calculate the overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of men who support increased funding.  
2. Calculate the number of women who support increased funding.  
3. Sum the number of supporters from both groups.  
4. Divide the total number of supporters by the total number of people surveyed to find the overall percentage.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of men who support increased funding. This will be achieved by multiplying the percentage of men who support funding (60%) by the total number of men surveyed (100).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given that 60% of men support increased funding and 100 men were surveyed:  
Number of men supporting = 60% of 100 = 0.60 × 100 = 60 men.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of women who support increased funding. This will be achieved by multiplying the percentage of women who support funding (80%) by the total number of women surveyed (900).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given that 80% of women support increased funding and 900 women were surveyed:  
Number of women supporting = 80% of 900 = 0.80 × 900 = 720 women.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of people who support increased funding and find the overall percentage. This will be achieved by summing the number of men and women who support funding, dividing by the total number of people surveyed (100 men + 900 women = 1000), and converting to a percentage.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total supporters = 60 men + 720 women = 780 people.  
Total surveyed = 100 men + 900 women = 1000 people.  
Overall percentage = (780 / 1000) × 100 = 78%.  

[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of men who support increased funding (completed: 60 men).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of women who support increased funding (completed: 720 women).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the number of supporters and compute the overall percentage (completed: 78%).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the completion of the main goal, which has been achieved.  
The overall percentage of people surveyed who support increased funding is 78%.
