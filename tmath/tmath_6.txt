Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Determine the value of $f(1)$.
2. Determine the value of $f(f(1))$.
3. Determine the value of $f(f(f(1)))$.
4. Determine the value of $f(f(f(f(1))))$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $f(1)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since 1 is odd, we use the second case of the function definition: $f(x) = 3x + 1$.
Therefore, $f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $f(f(1))$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, $f(1) = 4$. Since 4 is even, we use the first case of the function definition: $f(x) = x/2$.
Therefore, $f(4) = 4/2 = 2$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $f(f(f(1)))$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, $f(f(1)) = 2$. Since 2 is even, we use the first case of the function definition: $f(x) = x/2$.  
Therefore, $f(2) = 2/2 = 1$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $f(f(f(f(1))))$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since 1 is odd, we use the second case of the function definition: $f(x) = 3x + 1$.  
Therefore, $f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4$.
