Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The standard form of a quadratic function and the formula for the vertex of a parabola.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The function $ y = x^2 + 10x + 21 $ is a quadratic function in the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $. For a quadratic function, the vertex (which gives the minimum or maximum value) is located at $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. Since $ a = 1 $ (positive), the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex represents the minimum value of $ y $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For the quadratic function $ y = x^2 + 10x + 21 $, the coefficients are $ a = 1 $, $ b = 10 $, and $ c = 21 $.  

The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:  
$$ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{10}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{10}{2} = -5 $$

I am focusing on calculating the y-value at the vertex.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the y-value at the vertex $ x = -5 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = -5 $ into the function $ y = x^2 + 10x + 21 $:  
$$ y = (-5)^2 + 10(-5) + 21 $$  
$$ y = 25 - 50 + 21 $$  
$$ y = -4 $$  
The y-value at the vertex is $ -4 $.

[PLANNING]
Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the calculation of the y-value at the vertex and the application of the vertex formula.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
To verify the calculation of the y-value at the vertex $ x = -5 $:

1. **Substitution Check**:
   - Start with the original function $ y = x^2 + 10x + 21 $.
   - Substitute $ x = -5 $:
     $$
     y = (-5)^2 + 10(-5) + 21
     $$
     $$
     y = 25 - 50 + 21
     $$
     $$
     y = (25 + 21) - 50 = 46 - 50 = -4
     $$
   - The arithmetic steps are correct, and the result $ y = -4 $ is consistent.

2. **Vertex Formula Check**:
   - The vertex formula $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $ was applied correctly:
     - $ a = 1 $, $ b = 10 $, so $ x = -\frac{10}{2(1)} = -5 $.
   - This is valid for a quadratic in the form $ ax^2 + bx + c $.

3. **Alternative Method (Completing the Square)**:
   - Rewrite the function:
     $$
     y = x^2 + 10x + 21 = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 4 = (x + 5)^2 - 4
     $$
   - The minimal value occurs when $ (x + 5)^2 = 0 $, i.e., $ x = -5 $, yielding $ y = -4 $.
   - This confirms the vertex calculation.

4. **Direction of Parabola**:
   - Since $ a = 1 > 0 $, the parabola opens upward, ensuring the vertex is indeed the minimum point.

**Conclusion**: All calculations and logical steps are consistent and correct. No errors detected.
