### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that five distinct integers, randomly chosen from the set {20, 21, ..., 69}, each have a different tens digit. The numbers range from 20 to 69, inclusive, and we must determine the likelihood that the tens digits of the five chosen numbers are all distinct.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose 5 distinct integers from 20 to 69.
2. Identify the possible tens digits and calculate the number of favorable outcomes where each number has a different tens digit.
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 distinct integers from 20 to 69.  
**How to Achieve**: Use combinatorics to find the number of ways to select 5 numbers from the given range, which is the total number of possible outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The range from 20 to 69, inclusive, contains 69 − 20 + 1 = 50 numbers. Since we need 5 distinct integers, the total number of ways to choose them is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 50 \) and \( k = 5 \):

\[
C(50, 5) = \frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \frac{50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47 \cdot 46}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{254,251,200}{120} = 2,118,760
\]

Thus, there are 2,118,760 possible ways to choose 5 distinct integers.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the number of favorable outcomes where the five chosen numbers have distinct tens digits.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the tens digits in the range 20 to 69, assign one number per tens digit, and calculate the number of ways to select one number from each chosen tens digit group.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The numbers from 20 to 69 have tens digits ranging from 2 to 6 (since 20–29 have tens digit 2, 30–39 have tens digit 3, ..., 60–69 have tens digit 6). Thus, there are 5 possible tens digits (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Each tens digit corresponds to 10 numbers:

- Tens digit 2: 20, 21, ..., 29 (10 numbers)
- Tens digit 3: 30, 31, ..., 39 (10 numbers)
- Tens digit 4: 40, 41, ..., 49 (10 numbers)
- Tens digit 5: 50, 51, ..., 59 (10 numbers)
- Tens digit 6: 60, 61, ..., 69 (10 numbers)

To have distinct tens digits, we must choose one number from each of the 5 tens digit groups. The number of ways to select one number from each group is:

\[
10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 10^5 = 100,000
\]

Thus, there are 100,000 favorable outcomes.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all numbers in the favorable outcomes are distinct and have different tens digits.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that selecting one number from each tens digit group ensures distinct numbers and distinct tens digits.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since we select one number from each tens digit group (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the tens digits are inherently distinct (one number has tens digit 2, another has tens digit 3, etc.). Additionally, because each number comes from a different tens digit group, the numbers themselves are distinct (e.g., a number from 20–29 cannot equal a number from 30–39). This confirms that the favorable outcomes satisfy the condition of having distinct tens digits and distinct numbers.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{100,000}{2,118,760}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \frac{10,000}{211,876} = \frac{5,000}{105,938}
\]

To check if it simplifies further, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5,000 and 105,938. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

- 105,938 ÷ 5,000 = 21 remainder 938
- 5,000 ÷ 938 = 5 remainder 310
- 938 ÷ 310 = 3 remainder 8
- 310 ÷ 8 = 38 remainder 6
- 8 ÷ 6 = 1 remainder 2
- 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0

The GCD is 2. Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{5,000 \div 2}{105,938 \div 2} = \frac{2,500}{52,969}
\]

Since 2,500 = 2 × 5⁴ and 52,969 = 127 × 417 (both prime), there are no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is in its simplest form. The exact probability is:

\[
\frac{2,500}{52,969}
\]

For a decimal approximation:

\[
\frac{2,500}{52,969} \approx 0.0472
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{2,500}{52,969}\), or approximately 0.0472.
