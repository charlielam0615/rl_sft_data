### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies the equation \( 13^{3n} = \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n-24} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation \( 13^{3n} = \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n-24} \), break it into subgoals:
1. Simplify the right-hand side using exponent rules.
2. Equate the exponents after expressing both sides with the same base.
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
How to Achieve: Rewrite \( \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n-24} \) as \( 13^{-(n-24)} \) using the property \( \left( \frac{1}{a} \right)^b = a^{-b} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the exponent rule, \( \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n-24} = 13^{-(n-24)} \). The equation becomes:
\[ 13^{3n} = 13^{-(n-24)}. \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Equate the exponents since both sides have the same base.
How to Achieve: Since \( 13^{3n} = 13^{-(n-24)} \), and the bases are equal, set the exponents equal: \( 3n = -(n-24) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With the same base \( 13 \), equate the exponents:
\[ 3n = -(n-24). \]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ -(n-24) = -n + 24. \]
Thus, the equation is:
\[ 3n = -n + 24. \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the linear equation for \( n \).
How to Achieve: Solve \( 3n = -n + 24 \) by isolating \( n \) through addition and division.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with:
\[ 3n = -n + 24, \]
add \( n \) to both sides:
\[ 3n + n = 24, \]
\[ 4n = 24. \]
Divide by 4:
\[ n = \frac{24}{4} = 6. \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( n = 6 \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 6 \) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( n = 6 \):
Left-hand side: \( 13^{3 \cdot 6} = 13^{18} \).
Right-hand side: \( \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{6-24} = \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{-18} = 13^{18} \).
Since \( 13^{18} = 13^{18} \), the solution is valid.
[/IMP]
