**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( n \):  
1. Simplify the equation by expressing both sides with the same base.  
2. Equate the exponents since the bases are equal.  
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( n \).  
4. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation by expressing both sides with the same base.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite \( \frac{1}{13} \) as \( 13^{-1} \), so the right-hand side becomes \( (13^{-1})^{n - 24} \), and then apply the power rule to simplify.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 13^{3n} = \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n - 24} \]  

Since \( \frac{1}{13} = 13^{-1} \), rewrite the right-hand side:  
\[ \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n - 24} = (13^{-1})^{n - 24} \]  

Apply the power rule \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} \):  
\[ (13^{-1})^{n - 24} = 13^{-1 \cdot (n - 24)} = 13^{-(n - 24)} = 13^{24 - n} \]  

The equation becomes:  
\[ 13^{3n} = 13^{24 - n} \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Equate the exponents since the bases are equal.  
**How to Achieve**: Since both sides have the base 13, set the exponents equal to form a linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 3n = 24 - n \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the linear equation for \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve \( 3n = 24 - n \) by isolating \( n \) through algebraic manipulation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ 3n = 24 - n \]  

Add \( n \) to both sides:  
\[ 3n + n = 24 \]  
\[ 4n = 24 \]  

Divide by 4:  
\[ n = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by substituting \( n = 6 \) back into the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 6 \) into both sides of the equation and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 6 \) into the original equation \( 13^{3n} = \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{n - 24} \):  

Left-hand side:  
\[ 3n = 3 \cdot 6 = 18 \]  
\[ 13^{18} \]  

Right-hand side:  
\[ n - 24 = 6 - 24 = -18 \]  
\[ \left( \frac{1}{13} \right)^{-18} = (13^{-1})^{-18} = 13^{18} \]  

Both sides equal \( 13^{18} \), so the solution is valid.
