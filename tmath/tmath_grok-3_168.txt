**Problem Statement**: Calculate the total value of a $10,000 investment in a government bond paying 6% interest compounded annually after five years, rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the final solution:  
1. Identify the formula for compound interest.  
2. Assign known values to the formula variables.  
3. Calculate the future value of the investment.  
4. Round the result to the nearest whole number.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for compound interest. This can be achieved by recalling the standard formula for compound interest, which calculates the future value of an investment with annual compounding.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The formula for compound interest is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  
where:  
- \( A \) is the future value of the investment,  
- \( P \) is the principal (initial investment),  
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),  
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,  
- \( t \) is the number of years.  
For annual compounding, \( n = 1 \), simplifying the formula to:  
\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assign known values to the formula variables. This involves substituting the given values (\( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \), \( t = 5 \), \( n = 1 \)) into the compound interest formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given:  
- Principal (\( P \)) = $10,000  
- Interest rate (\( r \)) = 6% = 0.06  
- Time (\( t \)) = 5 years  
- Compounding frequency (\( n \)) = 1 (annually)  
The formula becomes:  
\[ A = 10,000 (1 + 0.06)^5 \]  
\[ A = 10,000 (1.06)^5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the future value of the investment using the formula \( A = 10,000 (1.06)^5 \). This requires computing \( (1.06)^5 \) and multiplying by 10,000.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):  
\[ 1.06^2 = 1.1236 \]  
\[ 1.06^3 = 1.1236 \times 1.06 \approx 1.191016 \]  
\[ 1.06^4 = 1.191016 \times 1.06 \approx 1.26247696 \]  
\[ 1.06^5 = 1.26247696 \times 1.06 \approx 1.3382255776 \]  
Now compute:  
\[ A = 10,000 \times 1.3382255776 \approx 13,382.255776 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to round the calculated future value ($13,382.255776) to the nearest whole number. This involves examining the decimal part to determine whether to round up or down.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The calculated value is $13,382.255776. The decimal part is 0.255776, which is less than 0.5. Therefore, rounding to the nearest whole number gives:  
\[ 13,382 \]  
[/IMP]
