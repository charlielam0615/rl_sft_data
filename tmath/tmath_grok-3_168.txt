**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution:  
1. Identify the formula for compound interest.  
2. Assign the given values to the formula variables.  
3. Compute the final investment value.  
4. Round the result to the nearest whole number.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the formula for compound interest.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the standard compound interest formula, which calculates the future value of an investment with interest compounded annually.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula for compound interest is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  
where:  
- \( A \) is the final amount,  
- \( P \) is the principal (initial investment),  
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),  
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,  
- \( t \) is the time in years.  
For annual compounding, \( n = 1 \), so the formula simplifies to:  
\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Assign the given values to the formula variables.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the given values (\( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \), \( t = 5 \), \( n = 1 \)) into the simplified compound interest formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
- Principal, \( P = 10,000 \)  
- Interest rate, \( r = 6\% = 0.06 \)  
- Time, \( t = 5 \) years  
- Compounding frequency, \( n = 1 \) (annually)  

The formula becomes:  
\[ A = 10,000 (1 + 0.06)^5 \]  
\[ A = 10,000 (1.06)^5 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the final investment value.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate \( (1.06)^5 \) and multiply by 10,000 to find the final amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \( (1.06)^5 \):  
\[ 1.06^2 = 1.1236 \]  
\[ 1.06^3 = 1.1236 \times 1.06 = 1.191016 \]  
\[ 1.06^4 = 1.191016 \times 1.06 = 1.26247696 \]  
\[ 1.06^5 = 1.26247696 \times 1.06 = 1.3382255776 \]  

Now compute:  
\[ A = 10,000 \times 1.3382255776 = 13,382.255776 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Round the result to the nearest whole number.  
**How to Achieve**: Round the calculated amount, 13,382.255776, to the nearest whole number.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The calculated amount is 13,382.255776.  
Since the decimal part (0.255776) is less than 0.5, rounding to the nearest whole number gives:  
\[ 13,382 \]  
[/IMP]
