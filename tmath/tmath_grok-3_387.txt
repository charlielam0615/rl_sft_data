**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number of integer values of \( x \) such that the square root of \( 2x \) is greater than 3 and less than 4. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Translate the inequality \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) into a condition on \( x \).  
2. Solve the resulting inequality to find the range of \( x \).  
3. Identify all integer values of \( x \) within this range.  
4. Count the number of integers to obtain the final answer.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Translate the inequality \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) into a condition on \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Since \( \sqrt{2x} \) is positive, square all parts of the inequality to remove the square root, ensuring the inequality direction remains the same. Then, solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).  
Square all parts to eliminate the square root:  
- \( 3^2 < (\sqrt{2x})^2 < 4^2 \)  
- \( 9 < 2x < 16 \)  
Divide all parts by 2 to isolate \( x \):  
- \( \frac{9}{2} < x < \frac{16}{2} \)  
- \( 4.5 < x < 8 \)  
Thus, \( x \) must satisfy \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify all integer values of \( x \) within the range \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).  
How to Achieve: List all integers strictly greater than 4.5 and strictly less than 8.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The inequality \( 4.5 < x < 8 \) means \( x \) is greater than 4.5 but less than 8. Since \( x \) must be an integer:  
- \( 4.5 = 4.5 \), so \( x > 4.5 \) excludes \( x = 4 \) and includes integers starting from 5.  
- \( x < 8 \) excludes \( x = 8 \).  
The integers in the open interval \( (4.5, 8) \) are:  
- \( x = 5, 6, 7 \).  
Thus, the possible integer values are 5, 6, and 7.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = 5, 6, 7 \) satisfy \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \), and check for any other integers.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 5, 6, 7 \) into \( \sqrt{2x} \) and confirm the inequality holds. Also, test boundary integers (e.g., \( x = 4, 8 \)) to ensure no others are missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each integer:  
- For \( x = 5 \): \( 2x = 10 \), \( \sqrt{10} \approx 3.162 \). Since \( 3 < 3.162 < 4 \), \( x = 5 \) satisfies the inequality.  
- For \( x = 6 \): \( 2x = 12 \), \( \sqrt{12} \approx 3.464 \). Since \( 3 < 3.464 < 4 \), \( x = 6 \) satisfies the inequality.  
- For \( x = 7 \): \( 2x = 14 \), \( \sqrt{14} \approx 3.742 \). Since \( 3 < 3.742 < 4 \), \( x = 7 \) satisfies the inequality.  

Check boundary values:  
- For \( x = 4 \): \( 2x = 8 \), \( \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828 \). Since \( 2.828 < 3 \), \( x = 4 \) does not satisfy the inequality.  
- For \( x = 8 \): \( 2x = 16 \), \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Since \( 4 \not< 4 \), \( x = 8 \) does not satisfy the inequality.  

No other integers outside \( 5, 6, 7 \) need checking, as \( x < 4.5 \) (e.g., \( x = 4 \)) yields \( \sqrt{2x} < 3 \), and \( x \geq 8 \) yields \( \sqrt{2x} \geq 4 \).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of integer values of \( x \) such that \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) into a condition on \( x \). (Completed: \( 4.5 < x < 8 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify all integer values of \( x \) in \( 4.5 < x < 8 \). (Completed: \( x = 5, 6, 7 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the integers satisfy the inequality. (Completed: \( x = 5, 6, 7 \) are valid)  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the number of integers. (Current goal)  

Current Goal: Count the number of integers found (\( x = 5, 6, 7 \)).

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Count the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy the condition.  
How to Achieve: Count the integers identified in the previous steps (\( x = 5, 6, 7 \)).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) are \( x = 5, 6, 7 \).  
Counting these:  
- \( 5, 6, 7 \) â†’ 3 integers.  
Thus, there are 3 integer values of \( x \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: There are 3 integer values of \( x \) that satisfy the condition \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).  
\[ \boxed{3} \]
