**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number of integer values of \( x \) such that the square root of \( 2x \) is greater than 3 and less than 4. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Translate the inequality \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) into an inequality for \( x \).  
2. Solve the resulting inequality to find the range of possible \( x \) values.  
3. Identify the integer values of \( x \) within that range.  
4. Count the number of integers to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Translate the inequality \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) into an inequality for \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Square all parts of the inequality to eliminate the square root, ensuring \( 2x \geq 0 \) to maintain the validity of the square root.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \), we square all parts of the inequality to remove the square root:  
- For the lower bound: \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} \) implies \( 3^2 < (\sqrt{2x})^2 \), so \( 9 < 2x \).  
- For the upper bound: \( \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) implies \( (\sqrt{2x})^2 < 4^2 \), so \( 2x < 16 \).  
Combining these, we get \( 9 < 2x < 16 \).  
Since squaring is a monotonic operation for non-negative values and \( \sqrt{2x} \geq 0 \), the inequality holds. We also note that \( 2x \geq 0 \), so \( x \geq 0 \), but this is automatically satisfied since \( 9 < 2x \) implies positive \( x \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality \( 9 < 2x < 16 \) to find the range of \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide all parts of the inequality by 2 to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( 9 < 2x < 16 \), divide all parts by 2:  
- \( \frac{9}{2} < x < \frac{16}{2} \), which simplifies to \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).  
Thus, \( x \) must satisfy \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution to the inequality \( 4.5 < x < 8 \) and ensure the original condition \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) holds.  
**How to Achieve**: Test boundary and intermediate values to confirm the derived range is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, substitute boundary values into the original inequality \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \):  
- For \( x = 4.5 \): \( 2x = 2 \cdot 4.5 = 9 \), so \( \sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \). This satisfies \( 3 = \sqrt{2x} < 4 \), but not \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} \) (strict inequality).  
- For \( x = 8 \): \( 2x = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 \), so \( \sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \). This satisfies \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} = 4 \), but not \( \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) (strict inequality).  
- For an interior point, say \( x = 5 \): \( 2x = 10 \), so \( \sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.162 \), which satisfies \( 3 < 3.162 < 4 \).  
Since the inequality is strict (\( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \)), the endpoints \( x = 4.5 \) and \( x = 8 \) are excluded. Thus, the range \( 4.5 < x < 8 \) is correct for the strict inequality.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the integer values of \( x \) within the range \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: List all integers between 4.5 and 8, excluding the endpoints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The range \( 4.5 < x < 8 \) includes all real numbers between 4.5 and 8. The integers strictly greater than 4.5 and less than 8 are:  
- \( x = 5, 6, 7 \).  
Thus, the possible integer values are \( 5, 6, 7 \).

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of integer values of \( x \) such that \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the inequality into an inequality for \( x \) (completed: \( 9 < 2x < 16 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) (completed: \( 4.5 < x < 8 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify integer values in the range (completed: \( x = 5, 6, 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the number of integers (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of integers to obtain the final answer.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy the condition.  
**How to Achieve**: Count the integers identified in the range \( 4.5 < x < 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( 4.5 < x < 8 \) are \( 5, 6, 7 \). Counting these, we have:  
- Number of integers = 3.  
Thus, the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) is 3.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( 3 < \sqrt{2x} < 4 \) is **3**.
