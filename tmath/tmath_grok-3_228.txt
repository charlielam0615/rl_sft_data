[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) to find the two solutions.
2. Compare the solutions to identify the greater one.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = -54 \), to compute the two solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-54) = 225 + 216 = 441
\]
Apply the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-15 \pm 21}{2}
\]
Compute the two solutions:
- \( x_1 = \frac{-15 + 21}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
- \( x_2 = \frac{-15 - 21}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \)
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \) are correct.

**How to Achieve**: Substitute both solutions back into the original equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) to confirm they satisfy it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \( x = 3 \):
\[
3^2 + 15 \cdot 3 - 54 = 9 + 45 - 54 = 0
\]
Check \( x = -18 \):
\[
(-18)^2 + 15 \cdot (-18) - 54 = 324 - 270 - 54 = 324 - 324 = 0
\]
Both solutions satisfy the equation, confirming they are correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the greater of the solutions to \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the quadratic equation (completed: solutions are \( x = 3 \), \( x = -18 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compare the solutions to identify the greater one (pending).

**Current Goal**: Compare the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \) to determine the greater one.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compare the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \) to find the greater one.

**How to Achieve**: Directly compare the numerical values of the solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare \( 3 \) and \( -18 \):
- \( 3 > -18 \)

The greater solution is \( x = 3 \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The greater of the solutions to the equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) is \( 3 \).
