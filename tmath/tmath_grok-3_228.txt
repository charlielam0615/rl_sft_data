**Problem Statement**: Find the solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) and determine which solution is greater.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) to find the roots.  
2. Compare the roots to determine which is greater.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) to find the roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = -54 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply the quadratic formula:  
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = -54 \).  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-54) = 225 + 216 = 441 \).  
- Roots:  
  \[
  x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-15 \pm 21}{2}
  \]  
- First root: \( x_1 = \frac{-15 + 21}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).  
- Second root: \( x_2 = \frac{-15 - 21}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \).  
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute both values back into the original equation to check if they satisfy it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- For \( x = 3 \):  
  \[
  3^2 + 15 \cdot 3 - 54 = 9 + 45 - 54 = 0
  \]  
  This satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x = -18 \):  
  \[
  (-18)^2 + 15 \cdot (-18) - 54 = 324 - 270 - 54 = 324 - 324 = 0
  \]  
  This also satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greater of the solutions to \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the quadratic equation (completed: roots are \( x = 3 \), \( x = -18 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compare the roots to determine the greater one (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Compare the roots to determine which is greater.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compare the roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -18 \) to find the greater one.  
**How to Achieve**: Perform a numerical comparison of the values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the roots:  
- \( 3 > -18 \).  
The greater solution is \( x = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greater of the solutions to the equation \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) is \( 3 \).
