### Problem Restatement
We need to completely factor the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\]. This involves simplifying the expression by performing the subtraction, combining like terms, and then factoring the resulting polynomial as fully as possible.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of completely factoring the expression into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression by handling the subtraction and combining like terms.  
2. Identify the structure of the resulting polynomial (e.g., degree, terms).  
3. Factor the polynomial by finding common factors or using factoring techniques (e.g., grouping, factoring by substitution, or trial and error for roots).  
4. Verify that the factorization is complete by ensuring all factors are irreducible.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\] by performing the subtraction and combining like terms to obtain a single polynomial. This will be achieved by distributing the negative sign and adding corresponding terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute the negative sign in the expression:  
\[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\] = \(15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5\).  

Combine like terms:  
- **Cubic terms**: \(15x^3 + 4x^3 = 19x^3\)  
- **Linear terms**: \(80x - 4x = 76x\)  
- **Constant terms**: \(-5 + 5 = 0\)  

The simplified expression is:  
\(19x^3 + 76x\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the simplified polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\) as completely as possible. This will be achieved by identifying common factors and applying appropriate factoring techniques.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Observe the polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\):  
- Each term contains \(x\), so factor out \(x\):  
  \(19x^3 + 76x = x(19x^2 + 76)\).  
- Check the quadratic \(19x^2 + 76\) for further factorization:  
  - Factor out any common numerical factors: The greatest common divisor of 19 and 76 is 19 (since \(76 = 19 \cdot 4\)).  
    \(19x^2 + 76 = 19(x^2 + 4)\).  
  - Thus, \(x(19x^2 + 76) = x \cdot 19 \cdot (x^2 + 4) = 19x(x^2 + 4)\).  
- Check if \(x^2 + 4\) can be factored over the real numbers:  
  - Solve \(x^2 + 4 = 0 \implies x^2 = -4 \implies x = \pm 2i\), which are complex roots.  
  - Since there are no real roots, \(x^2 + 4\) is irreducible over the real numbers.  

The factored form is:  
\(19x(x^2 + 4)\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the factorization \(19x(x^2 + 4)\) is complete and correct by expanding it and comparing it to the simplified polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the factored expression:  
\(19x(x^2 + 4) = 19x \cdot x^2 + 19x \cdot 4 = 19x^3 + 76x\).  

This matches the simplified polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\), confirming the factorization is correct.  
Check for further factorization:  
- \(19\) is a prime number and cannot be factored.  
- \(x\) is a linear factor, irreducible.  
- \(x^2 + 4\) is a quadratic with no real roots (discriminant: \(0 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = -16\)), so it is irreducible over the reals.  

The factorization \(19x(x^2 + 4)\) is complete over the real numbers.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Completely factor the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\].  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by performing subtraction and combining like terms (completed: \(19x^3 + 76x\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Factor the simplified polynomial completely (completed: \(19x(x^2 + 4)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factorization (completed: factorization is correct and complete).  

**Current Goal**: The factorization is complete, and no further action is needed unless additional requirements (e.g., complex factorization) are specified.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The completely factored form of the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\] over the real numbers is:  
\[19x(x^2 + 4)\]
