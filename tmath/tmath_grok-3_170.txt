### Problem Statement
We need to completely factor the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\].

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of factoring the expression into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given expression by performing the subtraction.  
2. Combine like terms to obtain a single polynomial.  
3. Factor the resulting polynomial completely.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\] by performing the subtraction. This will be achieved by distributing the negative sign and combining like terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the expression:  
\[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\]  

Distribute the negative sign:  
\[15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5\]  

Combine like terms:  
- \(x^3\) terms: \(15x^3 + 4x^3 = 19x^3\)  
- \(x\) terms: \(80x - 4x = 76x\)  
- Constant terms: \(-5 + 5 = 0\)  

The simplified expression is:  
\[19x^3 + 76x\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Completely factor the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\].  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by performing the subtraction (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms to obtain a single polynomial (completed, result: \(19x^3 + 76x\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Factor the resulting polynomial completely (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Factor the polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\) completely.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\) completely. This will be achieved by identifying common factors and factoring the expression as much as possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider the polynomial:  
\[19x^3 + 76x\]  

Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF):  
- The terms are \(19x^3\) and \(76x\).  
- The GCF of the coefficients 19 and 76 is 19 (since 76 = 19 Ã— 4).  
- The GCF of the variables \(x^3\) and \(x\) is \(x\).  

Thus, factor out \(19x\):  
\[19x^3 + 76x = 19x(x^2 + 4)\]  

Check if \(x^2 + 4\) can be factored further over the real numbers:  
- \(x^2 + 4\) is a sum of squares, which does not factor over the reals (since \(x^2 + 4 = (x^2 + 4)\) has no real roots, as the discriminant \(0 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = -16 < 0\)).  

Thus, the factored form is:  
\[19x(x^2 + 4)\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the factored form \(19x(x^2 + 4)\). This will be achieved by expanding the factored expression and checking if it matches the simplified polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the factored expression:  
\[19x(x^2 + 4) = 19x \cdot x^2 + 19x \cdot 4 = 19x^3 + 76x\]  

This matches the simplified polynomial \(19x^3 + 76x\), confirming the factoring is correct.  

Additionally, verify if further factoring is possible:  
- \(19\) is a prime number.  
- \(x\) is a single variable term.  
- \(x^2 + 4\) has no real roots (as checked previously).  

The expression \(19x(x^2 + 4)\) is completely factored over the real numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Completely factor the expression \[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\].  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by performing the subtraction (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms to obtain a single polynomial (completed, result: \(19x^3 + 76x\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Factor the resulting polynomial completely (completed, result: \(19x(x^2 + 4)\)).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed. The final factored form is \(19x(x^2 + 4)\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The completely factored expression is:  
\[19x(x^2 + 4)\]
