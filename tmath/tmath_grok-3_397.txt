### Problem Restatement
Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\)) and \(\lceil x \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\) into subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\).  
2. Compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
3. Add the results from subgoals 1 and 2.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\).  
- **How to achieve it**: Apply the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to 0.999.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since 0.999 is less than 1 but greater than 0, the greatest integer less than or equal to 0.999 is 0. Thus, \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
- **How to achieve it**: Apply the ceiling function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.001.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since 2.001 is greater than 2 but less than 3, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.001 is 3. Thus, \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Add the results from the previous subgoals, i.e., compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
- **How to achieve it**: Use the computed values \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\) and \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\), and perform the addition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Add the results: \(0 + 3 = 3\). Thus, \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Verify the correctness of the computed result \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).  
- **How to achieve it**: Recompute the floor and ceiling values and their sum to confirm consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recompute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\): Since \(0 < 0.999 < 1\), \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\).  
- Recompute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\): Since \(2 < 2.001 < 3\), \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).  
- Add: \(0 + 3 = 3\).  
The result matches the previous computation, confirming that \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\) is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\) (completed: result = 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\) (completed: result = 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results (completed: result = 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: result = 3 confirmed).  

**Current goal**: None (all subgoals completed, and the main goal is achieved).  
The final result is \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\)
