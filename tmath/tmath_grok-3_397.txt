**Problem Restatement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\)) and \(\lceil x \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression. The expression consists of two parts: \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\) and \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\). The subgoals are:  
1. Compute the floor of 0.999.  
2. Compute the ceiling of 2.001.  
3. Add the results to obtain the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\).  
**How to Achieve**: The floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to 0.999. Since 0.999 is between 0 and 1, evaluate which integer it is closest to but does not exceed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\), note that 0.999 is less than 1 but greater than 0. The greatest integer less than or equal to 0.999 is 0. Thus, \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
**How to Achieve**: The ceiling function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.001. Since 2.001 is between 2 and 3, evaluate which integer it is at least equal to.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\), note that 2.001 is greater than 2 but less than 3. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.001 is 3. Thus, \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add the results of \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\) and \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the results from the previous steps (\(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\) and \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\)) and perform the addition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the results: \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor = 0\) and \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\), compute the sum:  
\(0 + 3 = 3\).  
Thus, the value of the expression is 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor\) (completed, result: 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lceil 2.001 \rceil\) (completed, result: 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results (completed, result: 3).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been completed.  
The final result of the expression is 3.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\(\lfloor 0.999 \rfloor + \lceil 2.001 \rceil = 3\)
