**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the nonnegative difference between the roots:

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form. Achieve this by moving all terms to one side to set the equation equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\(x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36\)  
Add 36 to both sides to get standard form (\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)):  
\(x^2 + 30x + 180 + 36 = 0\)  
Simplify:  
\(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\)  
The equation is now in standard form: \(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the equation \(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\), identify coefficients:  
- \(a = 1\)  
- \(b = 30\)  
- \(c = 216\)  

Compute the discriminant:  
\(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 30^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 216 = 900 - 864 = 36\)  

Apply the quadratic formula:  
\(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-30 \pm 6}{2}\)  

Calculate the roots:  
- \(x_1 = \frac{-30 + 6}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12\)  
- \(x_2 = \frac{-30 - 6}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18\)  

The roots are \(x = -12\) and \(x = -18\).

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the nonnegative difference between the roots of \(x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (completed: \(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the roots using the quadratic formula (completed: roots are \(-12\) and \(-18\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the absolute difference between the roots (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the absolute difference between the roots.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the nonnegative difference between the roots (\(-12\) and \(-18\)). Achieve this by computing the absolute value of the difference between the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The roots are \(-12\) and \(-18\).  
Calculate the difference: \(-12 - (-18) = -12 + 18 = 6\).  
The nonnegative difference is the absolute value: \(|6| = 6\).  

Alternatively, confirm with the formula for the difference of roots in a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):  
The absolute difference between roots is \(\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{|a|} = \frac{\sqrt{36}}{|1|} = \frac{6}{1} = 6\).  
This matches the calculated difference.

**Final Answer**: The nonnegative difference between the roots of the equation \(x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36\) is **6**.
