### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.
Description: Move all terms to one side of the equation by adding 36 to both sides to set the equation equal to zero.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[ x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36 \]
Add 36 to both sides:
\[ x^2 + 30x + 180 + 36 = 0 \]
Simplify:
\[ x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0 \]
The equation is now in standard form: \( x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve for the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0 \).
Description: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 30 \), and \( c = 216 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0 \):
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 30 \), \( c = 216 \).
- Quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
- Compute the discriminant:
  \[ b^2 - 4ac = 30^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 216 = 900 - 864 = 36 \]
- Apply the formula:
  \[ x = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-30 \pm 6}{2} \]
- Calculate the roots:
  - First root: \( x_1 = \frac{-30 + 6}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12 \)
  - Second root: \( x_2 = \frac{-30 - 6}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \)

The roots are \( x = -12 \) and \( x = -18 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the roots of the equation.
Description: Substitute the roots \( x = -12 \) and \( x = -18 \) back into the original equation \( x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36 \) to confirm they are correct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -12 \):
\[ (-12)^2 + 30(-12) + 180 = 144 - 360 + 180 = 144 - 180 = -36 \]
This satisfies the equation.

Substitute \( x = -18 \):
\[ (-18)^2 + 30(-18) + 180 = 324 - 540 + 180 = 324 - 360 = -36 \]
This also satisfies the equation.

Both roots are valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the nonnegative difference between the roots.
Description: Compute the absolute difference between the roots \( x_1 = -12 \) and \( x_2 = -18 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The roots are \( x_1 = -12 \) and \( x_2 = -18 \).
Calculate the difference:
\[ |x_1 - x_2| = |-12 - (-18)| = |-12 + 18| = |6| = 6 \]
The nonnegative difference is 6.
