Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The given equation and the substitution of $ y = 1 $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The given equation is $ y = \frac{1}{3x+1} $. When $ y = 1 $, we substitute $ 1 $ for $ y $ in the equation, resulting in $ 1 = \frac{1}{3x+1} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ 1 = \frac{1}{3x+1} $ for $ x $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation:  
$$
1 = \frac{1}{3x+1}
$$  
To solve for $ x $, multiply both sides of the equation by $ 3x+1 $:  
$$
1 \cdot (3x + 1) = 1  
$$  
$$
3x + 1 = 1  
$$  
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
$$
3x = 0  
$$  
Divide both sides by 3:  
$$
x = 0  
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the algebraic steps and solution validity for $ x = 0 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Original Equation**: $ y = \frac{1}{3x+1} $.  
   Substituting $ y = 1 $:  
   $ 1 = \frac{1}{3x+1} $.  

2. **Multiplication Step**:  
   Multiply both sides by $ 3x+1 $:  
   $ 1 \cdot (3x+1) = 1 $.  
   This simplifies to $ 3x + 1 = 1 $.  
   **Critical Check**: This step assumes $ 3x+1 \neq 0 $, which is valid because division by zero is undefined in the original equation.  

3. **Solving for $ x $**:  
   Subtract 1: $ 3x = 0 $.  
   Divide by 3: $ x = 0 $.  

4. **Back-Substitution Verification**:  
   Plug $ x = 0 $ into the original equation:  
   $ y = \frac{1}{3(0)+1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 $.  
   This confirms $ x = 0 $ satisfies the equation.  

**Conclusion**: All algebraic steps are valid, and the solution satisfies the original equation. No errors detected.
