**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression. The expression involves two floor functions, so the subgoals are:  
1. Compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\).  
2. Compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\).  
3. Add the results of the two floor functions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\). This involves applying the floor function to 17.2, which means finding the greatest integer less than or equal to 17.2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) returns the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\). For \(x = 17.2\), since 17.2 is between 17 and 18, the greatest integer less than or equal to 17.2 is 17. Thus, \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). This involves applying the floor function to -17.2, which means finding the greatest integer less than or equal to -17.2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(x = -17.2\), since -17.2 is between -18 and -17, the greatest integer less than or equal to -17.2 is -18. Thus, \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the results of the two floor functions, \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). This involves summing the values computed in the previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous steps, we have \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\) and \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\). Now, compute the sum:  
\[ 17 + (-18) = 17 - 18 = -1. \]  
Thus, \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result of \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\). This involves checking the calculations of the floor functions and their sum for correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
- For \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\), since \(17 < 17.2 < 18\), the floor is 17.  
- For \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\), since \(-18 < -17.2 < -17\), the floor is -18.  
- Sum: \(17 + (-18) = 17 - 18 = -1\).  
The calculations are consistent with the previous results, confirming the answer is correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\) (completed, result: 17).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\) (completed, result: -18).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results (completed, result: -1).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed, confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with the result \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\). No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\).
