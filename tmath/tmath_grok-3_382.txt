**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression. The expression involves two floor function terms: \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\) and \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). Subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\).  
2. Compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\).  
3. Add the results of the two floor functions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\). The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). To achieve this, identify the integer part of 17.2 by finding the largest integer not exceeding 17.2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since 17.2 is between 17 and 18, the greatest integer less than or equal to 17.2 is 17. Thus, \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). To achieve this, identify the largest integer not exceeding -17.2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since -17.2 is between -18 and -17, the greatest integer less than or equal to -17.2 is -18. Thus, \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the results of the two floor functions: \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). Using the results from previous steps, compute \(17 + (-18)\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\), \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\).  
Thus, \(17 + (-18) = 17 - 18 = -1\).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\). Recheck the floor function calculations and the addition to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Recompute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\): Since \(17 < 17.2 < 18\), \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\). Correct.  
- Recompute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\): Since \(-18 < -17.2 < -17\), \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\). Correct.  
- Recompute addition: \(17 + (-18) = 17 - 18 = -1\). Correct.  
The computation is valid.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor\). (Completed: \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor = 17\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor\). (Completed: \(\lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -18\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results. (Completed: \(17 + (-18) = -1\))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation. (Completed: Computation verified)  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is resolved.  
**Result**: The value of \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\lfloor 17.2 \rfloor + \lfloor -17.2 \rfloor = -1\).
