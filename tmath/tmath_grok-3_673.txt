### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Identify the total number of ways to choose three vertices from the eight vertices of the octagon.  
2. Determine if any restrictions apply (e.g., are degenerate triangles allowed?).  
3. Calculate the final number based on the findings.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose three vertices from eight.  
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 8 \) (vertices) and \( k = 3 \) (vertices for a triangle). This assumes all sets of three vertices form valid triangles, which we will validate next.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( C(8, 3) \):  
\( C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \).  
So, there are 56 ways to choose three vertices.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if all sets of three vertices form valid triangles.  
How to Achieve: Check if any three vertices of a regular octagon can be collinear, as collinear points would form a degenerate triangle, which may not count.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In a regular octagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle (at angles \( 0^\circ, 45^\circ, 90^\circ, \ldots, 315^\circ \)). For three points to be collinear, they must lie on a straight line through the center of the circle. However, no three vertices of a regular octagon align in this way due to its cyclic symmetry and the angular spacing (multiples of \( 45^\circ \)). Thus, all sets of three vertices form non-degenerate triangles.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of triangles formed by vertices of a regular octagon.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate combinations of choosing three vertices (completed: 56 combinations).  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate that all combinations form valid triangles (completed: no collinear points).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution based on previous steps.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Provide the final number of triangles.  
How to Achieve: Since all 56 combinations of three vertices form valid triangles, report 56 as the answer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon is 56.

**Final Answer**: 56 triangles can be formed.
