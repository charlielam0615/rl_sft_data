**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(3x^y + 4y^x\) when \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) into the expression \(3x^y + 4y^x\).
2. Compute \(x^y = 2^3\).
3. Compute \(y^x = 3^2\).
4. Multiply each result by the respective coefficients (3 and 4).
5. Add the two results to obtain the final value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) into the expression and compute the components.
How to Achieve: Substitute the values into \(3x^y + 4y^x\), calculate \(2^3\) and \(3^2\), multiply by the coefficients, and sum the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) into the expression:
- Compute \(x^y = 2^3 = 8\).
- Compute \(y^x = 3^2 = 9\).
- Calculate \(3x^y = 3 \cdot 8 = 24\).
- Calculate \(4y^x = 4 \cdot 9 = 36\).
- Sum the results: \(24 + 36 = 60\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the calculations for accuracy.
How to Achieve: Recalculate each component step-by-step and confirm the final sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute to validate:
- \(2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8\), so \(3 \cdot 8 = 24\).
- \(3^2 = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\), so \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\).
- Sum: \(24 + 36 = 60\).
The calculations are consistent with the previous step.

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(3x^y + 4y^x\) when \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\).
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(2^3\) (completed, result: 8).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(3^2\) (completed, result: 9).
  - Subgoal 4: Multiply by coefficients (completed, \(3 \cdot 8 = 24\), \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\)).
  - Subgoal 5: Sum the results (completed, \(24 + 36 = 60\)).

Current Goal: Finalize the solution as all subgoals are completed.
The final result is \(60\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(3x^y + 4y^x\) when \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) is \(60\).
