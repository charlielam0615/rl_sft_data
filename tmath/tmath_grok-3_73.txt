**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(3x^y + 4y^x\) when \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(3x^y + 4y^x\) into subgoals:  
1. Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) into the expression.  
2. Compute \(x^y = 2^3\).  
3. Compute \(y^x = 3^2\).  
4. Multiply each term by its coefficient (3 for \(x^y\), 4 for \(y^x\)).  
5. Add the results to get the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute \(x = 2\), \(y = 3\) into the expression and set up the terms.  
How to Achieve: Replace \(x\) and \(y\) in \(3x^y + 4y^x\) to get \(3 \cdot 2^3 + 4 \cdot (3^2)\), then proceed to compute the exponents.  
[END]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 2\), \(y = 3\):  
\[ 3x^y + 4y^x = 3 \cdot 2^3 + 4 \cdot 3^2 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Goal: Compute \(2^3\).  
How to Achieve: Calculate \(2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\).  
[END]  
[IMP]  
\[ 2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \]  
So, \(3 \cdot 2^3 = 3 \cdot 8\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Goal: Compute \(3^2\).  
How to Achieve: Calculate \(3^2 = 3 \cdot 3\).  
[END]  
[IMP]  
\[ 3^2 = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]  
So, \(4 \cdot 3^2 = 4 \cdot 9\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Goal: Multiply each term by its coefficient.  
How to Achieve: Compute \(3 \cdot 8\) and \(4 \cdot 9\).  
[END]  
[IMP]  
\[ 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \]  
\[ 4 \cdot 9 = 36 \]  
So, the expression is now: \(24 + 36\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Goal: Add the final terms to evaluate the expression.  
How to Achieve: Compute \(24 + 36\).  
[END]  
[IMP]  
\[ 24 + 36 = 60 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Goal: Verify the calculations for correctness.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate each term and check the sum matches.  
[END]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- \(2^3 = 8\), so \(3 \cdot 8 = 24\).  
- \(3^2 = 9\), so \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\).  
- Sum: \(24 + 36 = 60\).  
The result is consistent with previous steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(3x^y + 4y^x\) when \(x = 2\), \(y = 3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \(x = 2\), \(y = 3\). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(2^3\). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(3^2\). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 4: Multiply by coefficients (3 and 4). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 5: Add the results. [Completed]  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \(60\).

**Final Answer**:  
\[ \boxed{60} \] \]
