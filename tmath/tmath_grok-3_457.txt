**Problem Statement**: Find the inverse function value \( f^{-1}(58) \) for the function \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f^{-1}(58) \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand that \( f^{-1}(58) \) means finding \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 58 \).  
2. Set up the equation \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \).  
3. Solve for \( x \) by isolating \( x^3 \) and then finding the cube root.  
4. Verify the solution by checking if \( f(x) = 58 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \) to find \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Subtract 4 from both sides, divide by 2, and take the cube root to isolate \( x \).

Starting with \( 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \):  
- Subtract 4: \( 2x^3 = 54 \).  
- Divide by 2: \( x^3 = 27 \).  
- Take the cube root: \( x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \).  
Thus, \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( f(x) = 58 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \) and check if the result equals 58.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( f(3) \):  
\( f(3) = 2(3)^3 + 4 = 2 \cdot 27 + 4 = 54 + 4 = 58 \).  
The result matches, so \( x = 3 \) is correct.

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( f^{-1}(58) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up \( 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) (completed: \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: \( f(3) = 58 \)).  
Current Goal: Conclude that \( f^{-1}(58) = 3 \).
