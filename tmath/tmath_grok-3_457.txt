**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \), find the inverse function value \( f^{-1}(58) \), which means finding the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 58 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find \( f^{-1}(58) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation \( f(x) = 58 \).  
2. Solve for \( x \) by isolating the cubic term and taking the cube root.  
3. Verify the solution by checking if \( f(x) = 58 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation \( f(x) = 58 \). This involves substituting \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \) into the equation and solving for \( x \).

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \), set \( f(x) = 58 \):  
\[ 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 2x^3 = 54 \]  
Divide by 2:  
\[ x^3 = 27 \]  
Take the cube root of both sides:  
\[ x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \]  
Thus, \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( f(x) = 58 \). This will be done by substituting \( x = 3 \) into the original function and checking the output.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = 2x^3 + 4 \):  
\[ f(3) = 2(3^3) + 4 = 2(27) + 4 = 54 + 4 = 58 \]  
The result matches the target value, confirming that \( x = 3 \) is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( f^{-1}(58) \), i.e., solve \( f(x) = 58 \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \( 2x^3 + 4 = 58 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) by isolating the cubic term and taking the cube root.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution by substituting back into the function.  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  
The solution \( x = 3 \) has been validated, so \( f^{-1}(58) = 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ f^{-1}(58) = 3 \]
