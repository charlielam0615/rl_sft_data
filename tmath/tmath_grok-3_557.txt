**Problem Restatement**: We are given points X, Y, and Z with the condition that the ratio XZ/XY = ZY/XY = 1/2. We know the coordinates of Y as (1, 7) and Z as (-1, -7). Our goal is to find the sum of the coordinates of point X.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals. First, I need to interpret the given ratios. The condition XZ/XY = 1/2 suggests a relationship between the distances from X to Z and X to Y. Similarly, ZY/XY = 1/2 relates the distances from Z to Y and X to Y. My initial subgoals are:  
1. Understand and interpret the ratio conditions geometrically or algebraically.  
2. Set up equations based on the distances using the coordinates of Y and Z.  
3. Solve for the coordinates of X.  
4. Compute the sum of X's coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Interpret the ratio conditions.  
How to Achieve: I will assume the ratios refer to distances between the points. XZ is the distance from X to Z, XY is the distance from X to Y, and ZY is the distance from Z to Y. I will use the distance formula to express these ratios algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the distance formula, let X = (a, b). Then:  
- Distance XZ = sqrt((a - (-1))^2 + (b - (-7))^2) = sqrt((a + 1)^2 + (b + 7)^2)  
- Distance XY = sqrt((a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2)  
- Distance ZY = sqrt((-1 - 1)^2 + (-7 - 7)^2) = sqrt(4 + 196) = sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2)  

Given XZ/XY = 1/2, so:  
sqrt((a + 1)^2 + (b + 7)^2) / sqrt((a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2) = 1/2  
Squaring both sides:  
((a + 1)^2 + (b + 7)^2) / ((a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2) = 1/4  
Thus, 4*(a + 1)^2 + 4*(b + 7)^2 = (a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2  

Given ZY/XY = 1/2, so:  
ZY / XY = 10*sqrt(2) / sqrt((a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2) = 1/2  
Thus, sqrt((a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2) = 20*sqrt(2)  
Squaring: (a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2 = 800

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Solve the equations derived from the ratios to find coordinates of X.  
How to Achieve: Substitute the second equation into the first to solve for a and b, the coordinates of X.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, I have:  
1. 4*(a + 1)^2 + 4*(b + 7)^2 = (a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2  
2. (a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2 = 800  

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:  
4*(a + 1)^2 + 4*(b + 7)^2 = 800  
Divide through by 4:  
(a + 1)^2 + (b + 7)^2 = 200  

Now expand both equations:  
- (a + 1)^2 + (b + 7)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1 + b^2 + 14b + 49 = a^2 + b^2 + 2a + 14b + 50 = 200  
- (a - 1)^2 + (b - 7)^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 - 14b + 49 = a^2 + b^2 - 2a - 14b + 50 = 800  

So I have:  
1. a^2 + b^2 + 2a + 14b = 150  
2. a^2 + b^2 - 2a - 14b = 750  

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:  
(a^2 + b^2 - 2a - 14b) - (a^2 + b^2 + 2a + 14b) = 750 - 150  
-4a - 28b = 600  
Divide by -4:  
a + 7b = -150  

Add equation 1 and equation 2:  
(a^2 + b^2 + 2a + 14b) + (a^2 + b^2 - 2a - 14b) = 150 + 750  
2a^2 + 2b^2 = 900  
a^2 + b^2 = 450  

Now solve a + 7b = -150 for a: a = -150 - 7b  
Substitute into a^2 + b^2 = 450:  
(-150 - 7b)^2 + b^2 = 450  
22500 + 1050b + 49b^2 + b^2 = 450  
50b^2 + 1050b + 22500 - 450 = 0  
50b^2 + 1050b + 22050 = 0  
Divide by 50:  
b^2 + 21b + 441 = 0  
Solve for b: b = [-21 ± sqrt(441 - 1764)] / 2 = [-21 ± sqrt(-1323)] / 2  
Since the discriminant is negative, there must be an error in the setup. I will reconsider the problem interpretation.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Backtrack (Planning Category)  
I realize there might be a misinterpretation of the ratios. The problem states XZ/XY = ZY/XY = 1/2, which led to a contradiction (negative discriminant). I will backtrack and reinterpret the ratios. Perhaps they refer to directed distances or coordinates along a line, not Euclidean distances. I will assume the points are colinear and test this hypothesis.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Reinterpret the ratios as directed distances or coordinate ratios along a line.  
How to Achieve: Assume points X, Y, Z are colinear, and the ratios apply to the differences in coordinates. Set up equations based on coordinate ratios.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume the points are colinear. Given Y = (1, 7) and Z = (-1, -7), the line passing through them has slope (7 - (-7))/(1 - (-1)) = 14/2 = 7, so the line equation is y = 7x. Let X = (a, 7a).  

Interpret XZ/XY = 1/2 for x-coordinates:  
(XZ)/(XY) = (z_x - x)/(y_x - x) = (-1 - a)/(1 - a) = 1/2  
So, 2(-1 - a) = 1 - a  
-2 - 2a = 1 - a  
-2a + a = 1 + 2  
a = 3  

Check y-coordinates: XZ/XY = (-7 - 7a)/(7 - 7a) = (-7(1 + a))/(7(1 - a)) = -(1 + a)/(1 - a)  
For a = 3: -(1 + 3)/(1 - 3) = -4/(-2) = 2, which does not equal 1/2. I will test the correct interpretation.  

If ZY/XY = 1/2 for x-coordinates:  
(ZY)/(XY) = (y_x - z_x)/(y_x - x) = (1 - (-1))/(1 - a) = 2/(1 - a) = 1/2  
So, 2 = (1 - a)/2  
4 = 1 - a  
a = -3  

Then X = (-3, 7*(-3)) = (-3, -21)  
Check XZ/XY: XZ = z_x - x = -1 - (-3) = 2, XY = 1 - (-3) = 4, so XZ/XY = 2/4 = 1/2  
Similarly for y: XZ = -7 - (-21) = 14, XY = 7 - (-21) = 28, so 14/28 = 1/2  
ZY/XY: ZY = 1 - (-1) = 2, XY = 4, 2/4 = 1/2  
All conditions are satisfied. So X = (-3, -21)  
Sum of coordinates = -3 + (-21) = -24
