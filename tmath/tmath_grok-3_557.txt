### Problem Statement
We need to find the coordinates of point \( X \) such that the ratios \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\), where \( Y = (1, 7) \) and \( Z = (-1, -7) \). Then, compute the sum of the coordinates of \( X \).

Let’s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the coordinates of \( X \) and compute their sum:  
1. Interpret the given ratios \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
2. Compute the distance \( ZY \) using the coordinates of \( Y \) and \( Z \).  
3. Set up equations based on the ratios using distances \( XZ \) and \( XY \).  
4. Solve for the coordinates of \( X \).  
5. Calculate the sum of the coordinates of \( X \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Interpret the given ratios \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the ratios to understand their geometric or algebraic meaning, assuming \( XZ \), \( XY \), and \( ZY \) represent distances between points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The ratios are given as \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\). Here, \( XZ \), \( XY \), and \( ZY \) likely represent the Euclidean distances between points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \). Let’s denote the distances:
- \( XY = d(X, Y) \): distance between \( X(x, y) \) and \( Y(1, 7) \).
- \( XZ = d(X, Z) \): distance between \( X(x, y) \) and \( Z(-1, -7) \).
- \( ZY = d(Z, Y) \): distance between \( Z(-1, -7) \) and \( Y(1, 7) \).

From \(\frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:
\[
ZY = \frac{1}{2} XY
\]
This implies:
\[
XY = 2 \cdot ZY
\]
From \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:
\[
XZ = \frac{1}{2} XY
\]
Since \( XY = 2 \cdot ZY \), substitute into the second equation:
\[
XZ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2 \cdot ZY) = ZY
\]
Thus, the distances satisfy:
\[
XZ = ZY \quad \text{and} \quad XY = 2 \cdot ZY
\]
This suggests a geometric configuration where the distance from \( X \) to \( Z \) equals the distance from \( Z \) to \( Y \), and the distance from \( X \) to \( Y \) is twice that distance. Let’s proceed by computing the distance \( ZY \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the distance \( ZY \) using the coordinates of \( Y(1, 7) \) and \( Z(-1, -7) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between \( Z \) and \( Y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The distance \( ZY \) is calculated as:
\[
ZY = \sqrt{(x_Z - x_Y)^2 + (y_Z - y_Y)^2}
\]
Given \( Z = (-1, -7) \) and \( Y = (1, 7) \):
\[
x_Z = -1, \quad x_Y = 1, \quad y_Z = -7, \quad y_Y = 7
\]
\[
ZY = \sqrt{((-1) - 1)^2 + ((-7) - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-14)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 196} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}
\]
So, the distance \( ZY = 10\sqrt{2} \).  
Using the ratio \( XY = 2 \cdot ZY \):
\[
XY = 2 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} = 20\sqrt{2}
\]
And from \( XZ = ZY \):
\[
XZ = 10\sqrt{2}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up equations based on the ratios using distances \( XZ \) and \( XY \).  
**How to Achieve**: Express distances \( XY \) and \( XZ \) in terms of the coordinates of \( X(x, y) \), using the known distances \( XY = 20\sqrt{2} \) and \( XZ = 10\sqrt{2} \), and set up equations to solve for \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( X = (x, y) \). The distance formulas are:
- \( XY = \sqrt{(x - x_Y)^2 + (y - y_Y)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 7)^2} = 20\sqrt{2} \)
- \( XZ = \sqrt{(x - x_Z)^2 + (y - y_Z)^2} = \sqrt{(x - (-1))^2 + (y - (-7))^2} = \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2} = 10\sqrt{2} \)

Square both equations to eliminate square roots:
1. For \( XY \):
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = (20\sqrt{2})^2 = 400 \cdot 2 = 800
\]
2. For \( XZ \):
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = (10\sqrt{2})^2 = 100 \cdot 2 = 200
\]
We now have the system:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 800 \tag{1}
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = 200 \tag{2}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve for the coordinates of \( X(x, y) \) using the system of equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the system of equations (1) and (2) algebraically to find \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the equations:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 14y + 49 = x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 14y + 50 = 800 \tag{1}
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + 14y + 49 = x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 14y + 50 = 200 \tag{2}
\]
Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate common terms:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 14y + 50) - (x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 14y + 50) = 800 - 200
\]
\[
(-2x - 14y + 50) - (2x + 14y + 50) = 600
\]
\[
-2x - 14y + 50 - 2x - 14y - 50 = 600
\]
\[
-4x - 28y = 600
\]
\[
x + 7y = -150 \tag{3}
\]
Now, substitute \( x = -150 - 7y \) into equation (2):
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = 200
\]
\[
((-150 - 7y) + 1)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = 200
\]
\[
(-149 - 7y)^2 + (y + 7)^2 = 200
\]
Expand:
\[
(-149 - 7y)^2 = 22201 + 298 \cdot 7y + 49y^2 = 22201 + 2086y + 49y^2
\]
\[
(y + 7)^2 = y^2 + 14y + 49
\]
\[
22201 + 2086y + 49y^2 + y^2 + 14y + 49 = 200
\]
\[
50y^2 + 2100y + 22250 = 200
\]
\[
50y^2 + 2100y + 22250 - 200 = 0
\]
\[
50y^2 + 2100y + 22050 = 0
\]
\[
y^2 + 42y + 441 = 0 \quad (\text{divide by 50})
\]
\[
(y + 21)^2 = 0
\]
\[
y = -21
\]
Substitute \( y = -21 \) into equation (3):
\[
x + 7(-21) = -150
\]
\[
x - 147 = -150
\]
\[
x = -3
\]
So, the coordinates of \( X \) are \( (-3, -21) \).

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the coordinates \( X = (-3, -21) \) satisfy the given ratios.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the distances \( XY \), \( XZ \), and \( ZY \), and check if \(\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate distances:
- \( XY = \sqrt{((-3) - 1)^2 + ((-21) - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-28)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 784} = \sqrt{800} = 20\sqrt{2} \)
- \( XZ = \sqrt{((-3) - (-1))^2 + ((-21) - (-7))^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-14)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 196} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \)
- \( ZY = 10\sqrt{2} \) (from Step 3).

Check ratios:
\[
\frac{XZ}{XY} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{20\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{ZY}{XY} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{20\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Both ratios are satisfied, confirming the coordinates are correct.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the coordinates of \( X \).  
**How to Achieve**: Add the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of \( X = (-3, -21) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
x + y = -3 + (-21) = -24
\]
The sum of the coordinates is \(-24\).
