Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the fare per mile based on the given 50 miles and \$120.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since the taxi fare is directly proportional to the distance traveled, we can calculate the fare per mile by dividing the total fare by the total distance. That is:  

$$
\text{Fare per mile} = \frac{\$120}{50 \text{ miles}}.
$$  

Performing the calculation:  

$$
\text{Fare per mile} = \$2.40 \text{ per mile}.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the fare per mile to calculate the fare for 70 miles.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the fare per mile calculated as $2.40, we can compute the total fare for 70 miles by multiplying the fare per mile by the new distance:  

$$
\text{Total fare for 70 miles} = 2.40 \times 70.
$$  

Performing the calculation:  

$$
\text{Total fare for 70 miles} = 168.
$$

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The fare per mile, the calculation method, and the total fare for 70 miles.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The fare per mile is calculated as $ \frac{\$120}{50} = \$2.40 $. The calculation method involves multiplying the fare per mile by the distance traveled. For 70 miles, the total fare is $ 2.40 \times 70 = \$168 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the fare calculation for 70 miles based on the proportional relationship and arithmetic operations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Proportionality Check**: Direct proportionality implies fare = k * distance, where k is the constant of proportionality. Given fare = $120 for 50 miles, k = 120/50 = 2.40 per mile. This is correctly calculated.

2. **Multiplication Check**: For 70 miles, fare = 2.40 * 70. Breaking down:
   - 2.40 * 70 = (2 + 0.40) * 70 = 2*70 + 0.40*70 = 140 + 28 = 168. This matches the result.

3. **Consistency Check**: If 50 miles = $120, then 1 mile = $2.40. Scaling up to 70 miles: 70 * 2.40 = 168. The logic and arithmetic are consistent.

No contradictions or errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The solution aligns with the principles of direct proportionality and accurate arithmetic.
