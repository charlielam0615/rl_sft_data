### Problem Restatement
Given two functions:
- \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \)
- \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \)
We need to find the value of \( k \) such that \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( k \):  
1. Compute \( f(10) \) using the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \).  
2. Compute \( g(10) \) using the function \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \).  
3. Set up the equation \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
4. Solve for \( k \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute \( f(10) \) using \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( f(x) \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \):  
\[ f(10) = 3(10)^2 - 2(10) + 4 = 3 \cdot 100 - 20 + 4 = 300 - 20 + 4 = 284 \]  
So, \( f(10) = 284 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute \( g(10) \) using \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( g(x) \) and express the result in terms of \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \):  
\[ g(10) = 10^2 - k \cdot 10 - 6 = 100 - 10k - 6 = 94 - 10k \]  
So, \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up and solve the equation \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \) to find \( k \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the computed values of \( f(10) \) and \( g(10) \), substitute them into the given equation, and solve for \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the problem, \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \). Using \( f(10) = 284 \) and \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \):  
\[ 284 - (94 - 10k) = 10 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 284 - 94 + 10k = 10 \]  
\[ 190 + 10k = 10 \]  
\[ 10k = 10 - 190 \]  
\[ 10k = -180 \]  
\[ k = -18 \]  
So, \( k = -18 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( k = -18 \) satisfies \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( k = -18 \) into \( g(x) \), recompute \( g(10) \), and check if \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With \( k = -18 \), the function \( g(x) = x^2 - (-18)x - 6 = x^2 + 18x - 6 \).  
Compute \( g(10) \):  
\[ g(10) = 10^2 + 18 \cdot 10 - 6 = 100 + 180 - 6 = 274 \]  
Now check:  
\[ f(10) - g(10) = 284 - 274 = 10 \]  
The equation holds, confirming \( k = -18 \) is correct.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( k \) such that \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(10) \). (Completed: \( f(10) = 284 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(10) \). (Completed: \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \). (Completed: \( k = -18 \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution. (Completed: Verified \( k = -18 \))  

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The solution process is complete with \( k = -18 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( k \) is \(-18\).
