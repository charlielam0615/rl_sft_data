**Problem Restatement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \), we need to find the value of \( k \) such that \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( k \), break down the problem into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(10) \) using the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \).  
2. Compute \( g(10) \) using the function \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \).  
3. Set up the equation \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
4. Solve the resulting equation for \( k \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(10) \) using \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( f(x) \), perform the arithmetic operations, and obtain the numerical value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4 \):  
\( f(10) = 3(10)^2 - 2(10) + 4 = 3(100) - 20 + 4 = 300 - 20 + 4 = 284 \).  
So, \( f(10) = 284 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(10) \) using \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( g(x) \), keeping \( k \) as a variable, to obtain an expression for \( g(10) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( g(x) = x^2 - kx - 6 \):  
\( g(10) = (10)^2 - k(10) - 6 = 100 - 10k - 6 = 94 - 10k \).  
So, \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up and solve the equation \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \) to find \( k \).  
How to Achieve: Use the computed values \( f(10) = 284 \) and \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \), substitute them into the equation \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \), and solve for \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( f(10) = 284 \) and \( g(10) = 94 - 10k \), set up the equation:  
\( f(10) - g(10) = 284 - (94 - 10k) = 10 \).  
Simplify:  
\( 284 - 94 + 10k = 10 \).  
\( 190 + 10k = 10 \).  
Solve for \( k \):  
\( 10k = 10 - 190 = -180 \).  
\( k = \frac{-180}{10} = -18 \).  
So, \( k = -18 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if \( k = -18 \) satisfies \( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute \( g(10) \) with \( k = -18 \), calculate \( f(10) - g(10) \), and confirm it equals 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With \( k = -18 \), the function \( g(x) = x^2 - (-18)x - 6 = x^2 + 18x - 6 \).  
Compute \( g(10) \):  
\( g(10) = (10)^2 + 18(10) - 6 = 100 + 180 - 6 = 274 \).  
Now, \( f(10) - g(10) = 284 - 274 = 10 \).  
The equation holds, confirming \( k = -18 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

Action: Track Goals (Review)
