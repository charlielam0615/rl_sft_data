**Problem Statement**: We need to find the vertical asymptotes of the rational function \( y = \frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2} \), which occur where the denominator is zero, and compute the sum of the x-values (\( a + b \)) of these asymptotes.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the vertical asymptotes, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the vertical asymptotes by finding where the denominator \( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0 \).  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the roots \( x = a \) and \( x = b \).  
3. Compute the sum \( a + b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the roots of the denominator \( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0 \). This can be achieved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula to find the values of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The denominator is \( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 \). To find the roots, attempt to factor the quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to \( 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \) and add to 5 (the coefficient of \( x \)). The numbers 2 and 3 satisfy this: \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), \( 2 + 3 = 5 \).  

Rewrite the middle term:  
\[ 3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 2x + 2 \]  
Group and factor:  
\[ (3x^2 + 3x) + (2x + 2) = 3x(x + 1) + 2(x + 1) = (3x + 2)(x + 1) \]  

Set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ (3x + 2)(x + 1) = 0 \]  
Solve:  
\[ 3x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{2}{3} \]  
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]  

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -1 \) are the correct roots of the denominator and confirm they are vertical asymptotes by checking the numerator at these points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the roots by substituting back into the denominator:  
For \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \):  
\[ 3\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) + 2 = 3 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - \frac{10}{3} + 2 = \frac{12}{9} - \frac{30}{9} + \frac{18}{9} = \frac{12 - 30 + 18}{9} = 0 \]  

For \( x = -1 \):  
\[ 3(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 2 = 3 \cdot 1 - 5 + 2 = 3 - 5 + 2 = 0 \]  

Both roots make the denominator zero. Next, ensure the numerator is non-zero at these points to confirm vertical asymptotes:  
Numerator: \( 5x^2 - 9 \)  
At \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \):  
\[ 5\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 9 = 5 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - 9 = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{81}{9} = -\frac{61}{9} \neq 0 \]  
At \( x = -1 \):  
\[ 5(-1)^2 - 9 = 5 \cdot 1 - 9 = 5 - 9 = -4 \neq 0 \]  

Since the numerator is non-zero at both points, \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -1 \) are indeed vertical asymptotes.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the vertical asymptotes, \( a + b \), where \( a = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( b = -1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -1 \). Compute:  
\[ a + b = -\frac{2}{3} + (-1) = -\frac{2}{3} - 1 = -\frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = -\frac{5}{3} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( a + b \), the sum of the x-values of the vertical asymptotes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator \( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the roots of the denominator (found \( x = -\frac{2}{3}, -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the roots are vertical asymptotes (confirmed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( a + b \) (calculated as \( -\frac{5}{3} \)).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer and ensure all steps are complete. The sum \( a + b = -\frac{5}{3} \) has been computed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = -1 \), so \( a + b = -\frac{5}{3} \).  

\[ \boxed{-\dfrac{5}{3}} \]
