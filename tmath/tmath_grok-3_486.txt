**Problem Restatement**: Find the values of \(a\) and \(b\), where the graph of \(y = \frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2}\) has vertical asymptotes at \(x = a\) and \(x = b\), and compute \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the vertical asymptotes, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the condition for vertical asymptotes (denominator equals zero).  
2. Find the roots of the denominator by solving the quadratic equation.  
3. Sum the roots to find \(a + b\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the condition for vertical asymptotes.  
Description: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the rational function is zero, provided the numerator is non-zero at those points.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the function \(y = \frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2}\), vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator \(3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0\), as long as the numerator \(5x^2 - 9 \neq 0\) at those points.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for the roots of the denominator.  
Description: Solve the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0\) to find the values of \(x\) (i.e., \(a\) and \(b\)) where the denominator is zero.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve \(3x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0\).  
Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 3\), \(B = 5\), \(C = 2\).  
Discriminant: \(B^2 - 4AC = 5^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 25 - 24 = 1\).  
Roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{6} \]  
\[ x = \frac{-4}{6} = -\frac{2}{3}, \quad x = \frac{-6}{6} = -1 \]  
Thus, the potential vertical asymptotes are at \(x = -1\) and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\).  
Check the numerator at these points to ensure they are not holes:  
- At \(x = -1\): \(5(-1)^2 - 9 = 5 - 9 = -4 \neq 0\).  
- At \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\): \(5\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 9 = 5 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - 9 = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{81}{9} = -\frac{61}{9} \neq 0\).  
Since the numerator is non-zero, vertical asymptotes exist at \(x = -1\) and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the roots and asymptotes.  
Description: Confirm the roots of the denominator are correct and that they correspond to vertical asymptotes by rechecking calculations and conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck the quadratic solution:  
Factorize \(3x^2 + 5x + 2\). Try factors: \((3x + 2)(x + 1)\).  
\[ (3x + 2)(x + 1) = 3x^2 + 3x + 2x + 2 = 3x^2 + 5x + 2 \]  
Roots: \(3x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{2}{3}\), \(x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1\).  
This confirms the roots \(x = -1\), and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\).  
Reverify numerator: Already confirmed non-zero at both roots.  
The vertical asymptotes are correctly identified.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).  
Description: Assign \(a = -1\), \(b = -\frac{2}{3}\) (or vice versa), and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \(a = -1\), \(b = -\frac{2}{3}\).  
\[ a + b = -1 + \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) = -1 - \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{5}{3} \]  
Thus, \(a + b = -\frac{5}{3}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Description: List all goals and confirm the current goal has been achieved.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b\), where vertical asymptotes occur at \(x = a\) and \(x = b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for asymptotes (denominator = 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the roots of the denominator.  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b\).  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\) (completed: \(a + b = -\frac{5}{3}\)).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The vertical asymptotes are at \(x = -1\) and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\), so \(a + b = -\frac{5}{3}\).  
\[ \boxed{-\dfrac{5}{3}} \]
