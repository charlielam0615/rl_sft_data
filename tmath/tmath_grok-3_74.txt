**Problem Statement**: The quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \) can be written in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \), where \( b \) and \( c \) are constants. We need to find the value of \( \frac{c}{b} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \) in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \) by completing the square.  
2. Identify the constants \( b \) and \( c \) from the resulting expression.  
3. Compute the ratio \( \frac{c}{b} \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \) in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \) by completing the square. This involves manipulating the quadratic expression to match the desired form, identifying \( b \) and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To complete the square for \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \):  
1. Focus on the quadratic and linear terms: \( x^2 + 1300x \).  
2. The coefficient of \( x \) is 1300. Halve it to get \( \frac{1300}{2} = 650 \), and square it: \( 650^2 = 422500 \).  
3. Rewrite the quadratic by adding and subtracting this square inside the expression:  
   \[
   x^2 + 1300x + 1300 = (x^2 + 1300x + 422500 - 422500) + 1300.
   \]
4. Group the perfect square trinomial:  
   \[
   (x^2 + 1300x + 422500) - 422500 + 1300 = (x + 650)^2 - 421200.
   \]
Thus, the quadratic in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \) is \( (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \), so \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the expression \( (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \) is equivalent to \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \). This will be done by expanding the expression and comparing it to the original quadratic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \):  
- \( (x + 650)^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot 650 \cdot x + 650^2 = x^2 + 1300x + 422500 \).  
- Subtract 421200:  
  \[
  x^2 + 1300x + 422500 - 421200 = x^2 + 1300x + 1300.
  \]
This matches the original quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \), confirming that \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \) are correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( \frac{c}{b} \) for the quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \) written as \( (x + b)^2 + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \( b \) and \( c \) (completed: \( b = 650 \), \( c = -421200 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( \frac{c}{b} \) (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \( \frac{c}{b} \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( \frac{c}{b} \) using the identified values \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \). This involves performing the division and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \):  
\[
\frac{c}{b} = \frac{-421200}{650}.
\]
Simplify the fraction:  
- Divide numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. First, check if 650 divides 421200 evenly:  
  \[
  421200 \div 650 = 648.
  \]
- Since \( 650 \times 648 = 421200 \), the division is exact. Thus:  
  \[
  \frac{-421200}{650} = -648.
  \]
So, \( \frac{c}{b} = -648 \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \( \frac{c}{b} = -648 \). This will be done by checking the division and ensuring the values of \( b \) and \( c \) align with the problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify:  
- From Step 2, \( b = 650 \), \( c = -421200 \).  
- Compute: \( \frac{-421200}{650} = -648 \), as \( 650 \times 648 = 421200 \), and the negative sign is preserved.  
- Alternatively, recompute \( c \): From completing the square, \( c = 1300 - 422500 = -421200 \), and \( b = 650 \), which are consistent.  
The result \( \frac{c}{b} = -648 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( \frac{c}{b} \) is \(-648\).
