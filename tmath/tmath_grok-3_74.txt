Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[IMP]
Start with the quadratic:
\[ x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \]

To complete the square, focus on the quadratic and linear terms \( x^2 + 1300x \). The general form for completing the square is:
\[ x^2 + 2bx = (x + b)^2 - b^2 \]

Here, the coefficient of \( x \) is 1300, so compare \( 2b = 1300 \):
\[ b = \frac{1300}{2} = 650 \]

Thus:
\[ x^2 + 1300x = (x + 650)^2 - 650^2 \]

Calculate \( 650^2 \):
\[ 650^2 = 650 \cdot 650 = 422500 \]

So:
\[ x^2 + 1300x = (x + 650)^2 - 422500 \]

Now include the constant term from the original quadratic:
\[ x^2 + 1300x + 1300 = (x + 650)^2 - 422500 + 1300 \]

Compute the constant:
\[ -422500 + 1300 = -421200 \]

Thus, the quadratic in the form \( (x + b)^2 + c \) is:
\[ (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \]

So, \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \).

Goal-Management System:
- Main Goal: Find \( \frac{c}{b} \) for the quadratic \( x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \) written as \( (x + b)^2 + c \).

Current Goal: Compute \( \frac{c}{b} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( \frac{c}{b} \).
How to Achieve: Use the values \( b = 650 \) and \( c = -421200 \) to calculate the ratio \( \frac{c}{b} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given:
\[ b = 650, \quad c = -421200 \]

Compute:
\[ \frac{c}{b} = \frac{-421200}{650} \]

Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. First, check if 650 divides 421200:
\[ 421200 \div 650 = 648 \]

Since 650 divides 421200 evenly:
\[ \frac{-421200}{650} = -648 \]

To confirm, factorize:
- \( 650 = 2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 13 \)
- \( 421200 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 13^2 \) (by prime factorization or trial division)

The GCD of 650 and 421200 is \( 2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 13 = 650 \), so:
\[ \frac{-421200 \div 650}{650 \div 650} = \frac{-648}{1} = -648 \]

Thus:
\[ \frac{c}{b} = -648 \]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of \( \frac{c}{b} = -648 \).
How to Achieve: Check the completed square form and recompute \( \frac{c}{b} \) to ensure consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the completing the square to verify:
\[ x^2 + 1300x = (x + 650)^2 - 650^2 \]
\[ 650^2 = 422500 \]
\[ x^2 + 1300x + 1300 = (x + 650)^2 - 422500 + 1300 = (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \]

Confirm \( b = 650 \), \( c = -421200 \).

Recalculate:
\[ \frac{c}{b} = \frac{-421200}{650} = -648 \]

The calculation is consistent. To further validate, expand \( (x + 650)^2 - 421200 \):
\[ (x + 650)^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot 650 \cdot x + 650^2 = x^2 + 1300x + 422500 \]
\[ (x + 650)^2 - 421200 = x^2 + 1300x + 422500 - 421200 = x^2 + 1300x + 1300 \]

The expansion matches the original quadratic, confirming the form is correct. Thus, \( \frac{c}{b} = -648 \) is valid.
