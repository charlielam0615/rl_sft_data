**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \), where \( x > 0 \) and \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \). Express the answer as a simplified common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation.
2. Filter the solutions to ensure \( x > 0 \).
3. Simplify the positive solution to a common fraction, if possible.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = -18 \), to compute the roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Identify the coefficients: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = -18 \).

Compute the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 9^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-18) = 81 + 360 = 441.
\]

Apply the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-9 \pm 21}{10}.
\]

Calculate the two roots:
- \( x_1 = \frac{-9 + 21}{10} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5} \).
- \( x_2 = \frac{-9 - 21}{10} = \frac{-30}{10} = -3 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions and ensure they meet the condition \( x > 0 \).

**How to Achieve**: Check both roots (\( x = \frac{6}{5} \), \( x = -3 \)) against the condition \( x > 0 \), and validate the positive root by substituting it back into the original equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the condition \( x > 0 \):
- \( x = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2 > 0 \), satisfies the condition.
- \( x = -3 < 0 \), does not satisfy the condition.

Validate \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) in the original equation \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \):
\[
x = \frac{6}{5}, \quad x^2 = \left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{36}{25}.
\]
\[
5x^2 = 5 \cdot \frac{36}{25} = \frac{180}{25} = \frac{36}{5}.
\]
\[
9x = 9 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{54}{5}.
\]
\[
5x^2 + 9x - 18 = \frac{36}{5} + \frac{54}{5} - 18 = \frac{36 + 54}{5} - \frac{90}{5} = \frac{90}{5} - \frac{90}{5} = 0.
\]
The equation holds, so \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) is a valid solution.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Solve \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), expressing the answer as a simplified common fraction.
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Filter solutions to ensure \( x > 0 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the positive solution to a common fraction (in progress).

**Current Goal**: Simplify the positive solution \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) to a common fraction, if needed, and confirm it is in the required form.

The solution \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) is already a common fraction. Check for simplification: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 5 is 1, so \( \frac{6}{5} \) is in its simplest form.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) as the simplified common fraction.

**How to Achieve**: Since the solution is already simplified and validated, present it as the final answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The positive solution to \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \) that satisfies \( x > 0 \) is \( x = \frac{6}{5} \). It is a simplified common fraction, as 6 and 5 are coprime.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \( x = \frac{6}{5} \)
