**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation.  
2. Select the positive root since \( x > 0 \).  
3. Simplify the root to express it as a common fraction if possible.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the quadratic formula to solve \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \). The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = -18 \). Compute the discriminant, evaluate the roots, and identify the positive root.

[IMP]  
For the equation \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = -18 \).  
The quadratic formula is:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 9^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-18) = 81 + 360 = 441 \]  
Since \( \sqrt{441} = 21 \), the roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-9 \pm 21}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-9 \pm 21}{10} \]  
Positive root:  
\[ x = \frac{-9 + 21}{10} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5} \]  
Negative root:  
\[ x = \frac{-9 - 21}{10} = \frac{-30}{10} = -3 \]  
Since \( x > 0 \), select \( x = \frac{6}{5} \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) satisfies the equation \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = 0 \) and is a positive simplified fraction. Substitute \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) into the equation and check if the result is zero. Also, confirm the fraction is simplified and \( x > 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{6}{5} \) into \( 5x^2 + 9x - 18 \):  
\[ x^2 = \left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{36}{25} \]  
\[ 5x^2 = 5 \cdot \frac{36}{25} = \frac{180}{25} \]  
\[ 9x = 9 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{54}{5} = \frac{270}{25} \]  
\[ 5x^2 + 9x - 18 = \frac{180}{25} + \frac{270}{25} - 18 = \frac{180 + 270 - 18 \cdot 25}{25} = \frac{180 + 270 - 450}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0 \]  
The equation holds. Check if \( \frac{6}{5} \) is simplified: GCD of 6 and 5 is 1, so it is simplified. Confirm \( x = \frac{6}{5} > 0 \), which is true.
