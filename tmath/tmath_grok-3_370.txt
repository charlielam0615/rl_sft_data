### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation to eliminate the fraction and express it as a polynomial.  
2. Determine the condition for the polynomial to have exactly one real solution.  
3. Solve for the values of \( r \) that satisfy this condition.  
4. Compute the product of all such \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation \(\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}\) to eliminate the fraction and form a polynomial.  
How to Achieve: Cross-multiply to remove denominators, then simplify to obtain a polynomial equation in \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[
\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}
\]  
Cross-multiply:  
\[
7 \cdot 1 = 2x \cdot (r - x)
\]  
\[
7 = 2x(r - x)
\]  
Expand and rearrange:  
\[
7 = 2rx - 2x^2
\]  
\[
2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0
\]  
This is a quadratic equation in \( x \):  
\[
2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the condition for the quadratic \( 2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution.  
How to Achieve: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero (\(\Delta = 0\)). Compute the discriminant and set it equal to zero to find \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( 2x^2 - bx2rx + c7 = 0 \), the coefficients are:  
- \( a = 2 \)  
- \( b = -2r \)  
- \( c = 7 \)  

The discriminant is:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2r)^2 - 4 \cdot 2)( \cdot 7) = 4r^2 - 56
\]  
Set the discriminant to zero for exactly one solution:  
\[
4 r^2 - 56 = 0
\]  
\[
r^2 = 14
\]  
\[
r = \pm \sqrt{14}
\]  
Thus, the possible values of \( r \) are \( r = \sqrt{14} \) and \( r = -\sqrt{14} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( r = \pm \sqrt{14} \) leads to exactly one real solution and check for other possible \( r \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( r = \sqrt{14} \) and \( r = -\sqrt{14} \) back into the quadratic to confirm the discriminant is zero and the solution is real. Also, consider if the original equationâ€™s denominator (\( 2x \neq 0 \)) affects the solution or if other conditions (e.g., \( x = 0 \)) yield additional \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Check \( r = \sqrt{14} \)**:  
The quadratic is:  
\[
2 x^2 - 2(\sqrt{14}) x + 7 = 0
\]  
Discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = (-2\sqrt{14})^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 14 - 56 = 56 - 56 = 0
\]  
Since \(\Delta = 0\), there is exactly one real solution. Solve for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{2\sqrt{14}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}
\]  
Verify in the original equation:  
Left side:  
\[
\frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]  
Right side:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt{14} - \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{14} - \sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{14} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]  
Both sides match, and \( x = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2} \neq 0 \), so the solution is valid.  

**Check \( r = -\sqrt{14} \)**:  
The quadratic is:  
\[
2 x^2 - 2(-\sqrt{14}) x + 7 = 2 x^2 + 2\sqrt{14} x + 7 = 0
\]  
Discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = (2\sqrt{14})^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 14 - 56 = 56 - 56 = 0
\]  
One real solution at:  
\[
x = \frac{-2\sqrt{14}}{2 \cdot 2} = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}
\]  
Verify:  
Left side:  
\[
\frac{1}{2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{14}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]  
Right side:  
\[
\frac{-\sqrt{14} - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}\right)}{7} = \frac{-\sqrt{14} + \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\frac{-2\sqrt{14} + \sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{14} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]  
Both sides match, and \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2} \neq 0 \).  

**Check for other conditions**:  
The original equation has \( 2x \neq 0 \), so \( x \neq 0 \), which is satisfied. Consider if \( x = 0 \) could yield a solution:  
Left side: \(\frac{1}{2 \cdot 0}\) is undefined, so \( x = 0 \) is not possible.  
The quadratic approach covers all cases since cross-multiplication assumed \( x \neq 0 \). No other \( r \) values arise from the discriminant condition.
