### Problem Statement
We need to find the product of all real values of \( r \) for which the equation \(\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}\) has exactly one real solution for \( x \). This means that for each such \( r \), solving the equation should yield exactly one real value of \( x \), and we must compute the product of all possible \( r \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the product of all \( r \) values:
1. Solve the equation \(\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}\) for \( x \) in terms of \( r \).
2. Determine the condition for the equation to have exactly one real solution.
3. Find all real values of \( r \) that satisfy this condition.
4. Compute the product of these \( r \) values.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \(\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}\) for \( x \) in terms of \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions, simplify the resulting equation, and solve for \( x \). This will likely result in a quadratic equation, which we can analyze later for the number of solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}
\]
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[
7 \cdot 1 = 2x \cdot (r - x)
\]
\[
7 = 2x(r - x)
\]
\[
7 = 2rx - 2x^2
\]
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:
\[
2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \( x \):
\[
2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution.  
**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero (\(\Delta = 0\)). Compute the discriminant of the quadratic and set it equal to zero to find the values of \( r \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 2rx + 7 = 0 \), identify the coefficients:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = -2r \)
- \( c = 7 \)

The discriminant is:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2r)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 4r^2 - 56
\]
For exactly one real solution, set the discriminant to zero:
\[
4r^2 - 56 = 0
\]
\[
4r^2 = 56
\]
\[
r^2 = 14
\]
\[
r = \pm \sqrt{14}
\]
Thus, the possible values of \( r \) are:
\[
r = \sqrt{14}, \quad r = -\sqrt{14}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( r = \sqrt{14} \) and \( r = -\sqrt{14} \) each produce exactly one real solution for \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r = \sqrt{14} \) and \( r = -\sqrt{14} \) back into the quadratic equation, solve for \( x \), and confirm that each yields exactly one real solution. Additionally, check the original equation to ensure no solutions are lost due to domain restrictions (e.g., \( x \neq 0 \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Case 1: \( r = \sqrt{14} \)**  
The quadratic becomes:
\[
2x^2 - 2\sqrt{14}x + 7 = 0
\]
Discriminant:
\[
\Delta = 4(\sqrt{14})^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 14 - 56 = 56 - 56 = 0
\]
Since \(\Delta = 0\), there is exactly one real solution. Solve using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{2\sqrt{14} \pm \sqrt{0}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{2\sqrt{14}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}
\]
Check the domain: \( x = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2} \neq 0 \), so it is valid. Verify in the original equation:
\[
\text{Left side: } \frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
\[
\text{Right side: } \frac{r - x}{7} = \frac{\sqrt{14} - \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{14} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
Both sides match, confirming the solution is valid.

**Case 2: \( r = -\sqrt{14} \)**  
The quadratic becomes:
\[
2x^2 - 2(-\sqrt{14})x + 7 = 0 \implies 2x^2 + 2\sqrt{14}x + 7 = 0
\]
Discriminant:
\[
\Delta = (2\sqrt{14})^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 14 - 56 = 56 - 56 = 0
\]
Since \(\Delta = 0\), there is exactly one real solution:
\[
x = \frac{-2\sqrt{14} \pm \sqrt{0}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-2\sqrt{14}}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}
\]
Check the domain: \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2} \neq 0 \). Verify in the original equation:
\[
\text{Left side: } \frac{1}{2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{14}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
\[
\text{Right side: } \frac{r - x}{7} = \frac{-\sqrt{14} - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}\right)}{7} = \frac{-\sqrt{14} + \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = \frac{-\frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}}{7} = -\frac{\sqrt{14}}{14} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
Both sides match, confirming the solution is valid.

Both values of \( r \) produce exactly one real solution, and no solutions are lost due to the domain restriction \( x \neq 0 \).

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the product of all real values of \( r \), which are \( r = \sqrt{14} \) and \( r = -\sqrt{14} \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

\[

\]
[/IMP]

The product of all real values of \( r \) for which the equation \(\frac{1}{2x} = \frac{r - x}{7}\) has exactly one real solution is:
\[
\boxed{-14}
