### Problem Restatement
The Cookie Monster has encountered a cookie with a boundary defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \). He wants to determine whether this cookie is lunch-sized or snack-sized by finding its radius.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the radius of the cookie, we need to identify the shape described by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \). The goal is to find the radius, which suggests the equation represents a circle. The subgoals are:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard circle form to identify the center and radius.
2. Extract the radius from the standard form.
3. Interpret the radius to determine if the cookie is lunch-sized or snack-sized.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \) into the standard form of a circle, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), to identify the radius. This can be achieved by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \]

Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 21 = 0 \]

Group the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms:
\[ (x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 18y) + 21 = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):
- For \( x^2 - 4x \), the coefficient of \( x \) is \(-4\). Half of \(-4\) is \(-2\), and its square is \( (-2)^2 = 4 \).
- Add and subtract 4 inside the expression: \( x^2 - 4x = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \).

Complete the square for \( y \):
- For \( y^2 - 18y \), the coefficient of \( y \) is \(-18\). Half of \(-18\) is \(-9\), and its square is \( (-9)^2 = 81 \).
- Add and subtract 81 inside the expression: \( y^2 - 18y = (y - 9)^2 - 81 \).

Rewrite the equation:
\[ (x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 18y) + 21 = (x - 2)^2 - 4 + (y - 9)^2 - 81 + 21 \]

Simplify the constants:
\[ -4 - 81 + 21 = -64 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 - 64 = 0 \]

\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 64 \]

This is the standard form of a circle, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where the center is \((h, k) = (2, 9)\) and the radius \( r = \sqrt{64} = 8 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the equation \( (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 64 \) correctly represents the original equation and that the radius is \( r = 8 \). This can be achieved by expanding the standard form back to the original form and checking for consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 64 \):
- \( (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \)
- \( (y - 9)^2 = y^2 - 18y + 81 \)

So:
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 18y + 81 = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 \]

Set equal to 64:
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 = 64 \]

\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 - 64 = 0 \]

\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 21 = 0 \]

This matches the original equation after moving terms:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \]

The derivation is consistent, confirming the radius is \( r = 8 \).

### Step 4: Track Goals

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- **Main Goal:** Determine the radius of the cookie and classify it as lunch-sized or snack-sized.
  - **Subgoal 1:** Rewrite the equation in standard circle form (completed).
  - **Subgoal 2:** Extract the radius from the standard form (completed, radius = 8).
  - **Subgoal 3:** Interpret the radius to classify the cookie (pending).

**Current Goal:** Interpret the radius to determine if the cookie is lunch-sized or snack-sized.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to interpret the radius \( r = 8 \) to classify the cookie as lunch-sized or snack-sized. Since no specific criteria for "lunch-sized" or "snack-sized" are provided, we will assume a reasonable threshold (e.g., a radius greater than 5 units is lunch-sized, otherwise snack-sized) and conclude based on the radius.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The radius of the cookie is 8 units. Assuming a threshold where a radius greater than 5 units indicates a lunch-sized cookie (a common-sense assumption for a larger cookie suitable for a meal), since \( 8 > 5 \), the cookie is classified as lunch-sized.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The radius of the cookie is 8 units. Based on a reasonable threshold, this is a lunch-sized cookie.
