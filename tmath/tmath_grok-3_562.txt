### Problem Restatement
The Cookie Monster has a cookie with a boundary defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \). To determine if it is a lunch-sized or snack-sized cookie, we need to find the radius of the cookie. This requires identifying the geometric shape of the cookie and calculating its radius.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the radius, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the geometric shape of the cookie by rewriting the equation in standard form.
2. Identify the radius from the standard form.
3. Interpret the radius to classify the cookie size (if applicable).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \) into the standard form of a circle.
How to Achieve: Complete the square for \( x \) and \( y \) terms to transform the equation into the form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \]

Move all terms to one side:
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 21 = 0 \]

Group \( x \) and \( y \) terms:
\[ (x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 18y) + 21 = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):
- Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-4\), divide by 2 to get \(-2\), and square it: \((-2)^2 = 4\).
- Add and subtract 4 inside the \( x \)-term group:
  \[ x^2 - 4x = (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4 = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \]

Complete the square for \( y \):
- Take the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(-18\), divide by 2 to get \(-9\), and square it: \((-9)^2 = 81\).
- Add and subtract 81 inside the \( y \)-term group:
  \[ y^2 - 18y = (y^2 - 18y + 81) - 81 = (y - 9)^2 - 81 \]

Substitute back into the equation:
\[ (x - 2)^2 - 4 + (y - 9)^2 - 81 + 21 = 0 \]

Simplify the constants:
\[ -4 - 81 + 21 = -64 \]
So:
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 - 64 = 0 \]

Move the constant:
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 64 \]

This is the standard form of a circle, \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), with center \( (h, k) = (2, 9) \) and radius \( r^2 = 64 \), so \( r = \sqrt{64} = 8 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the standard form and radius calculation.
How to Achieve: Expand the standard form back to the original equation to confirm correctness and check the radius value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 64 \):
\[ (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]
\[ (y - 9)^2 = y^2 - 18y + 81 \]
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 18y + 81) = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 \]

Set equal to 64:
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 = 64 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 85 - 64 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 21 = 0 \]

This matches the original equation after moving terms:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 18y + 21 = 0 \]

The radius is \( r = \sqrt{64} = 8 \), which is consistent.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the radius of the cookie to determine if it is lunch-sized or snack-sized.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the geometric shape (completed: circle).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the radius (completed: \( r = 8 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Interpret the radius to classify cookie size (pending).
Current Goal: Interpret the radius to classify the cookie size.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Interpret the radius to classify the cookie as lunch-sized or snack-sized.
How to Achieve: Since the problem does not provide specific criteria for lunch-sized vs. snack-sized, assume a reasonable threshold (e.g., radius > 5 for lunch-sized) or state the radius clearly for Cookie Monster’s context.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The radius of the cookie is 8 units. Without specific size criteria from Cookie Monster, a radius of 8 is relatively large for a cookie, suggesting it is likely a lunch-sized cookie. For context, a typical snack-sized cookie might have a smaller radius (e.g., 3–5 units), while a lunch-sized cookie could be larger (e.g., >5 units). Thus, this cookie is likely lunch-sized.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The radius of the cookie is 8 units, and it is likely a lunch-sized cookie based on its size.
