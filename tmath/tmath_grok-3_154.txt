**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a two-digit number \( N \) such that \( N = P(N) + S(N) \), where \( P(N) \) is the product of the digits of \( N \), and \( S(N) \) is the sum of the digits of \( N \). The task is to determine the units digit of \( N \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Represent the two-digit number \( N \) in terms of its digits.  
2. Set up the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) using the digit representation.  
3. Solve for \( N \) by finding values that satisfy the equation.  
4. Determine the units digit of the resulting \( N \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to represent the two-digit number \( N \) and set up the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \). Achieve this by expressing \( N \) as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit (1 to 9) and \( b \) is the units digit (0 to 9), then forming the equation based on the definitions of \( P(N) = a \cdot b \) and \( S(N) = a + b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( N \) be a two-digit number with tens digit \( a \) (where \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \)) and units digit \( b \) (where \( 0 \leq b \leq 9 \)). Then:  
- \( N = 10a + b \),  
- \( P(N) = a \cdot b \),  
- \( S(N) = a + b \).  

The given condition is:  
\[ N = P(N) + S(N) \]  
Substituting the expressions:  
\[ 10a + b = (a \cdot b) + (a + b) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 10a + b = a \cdot b + a + b \]  
\[ 10a + b - a - b = a \cdot b \]  
\[ 9a = a \cdot b \]  
\[ b \cdot a - 9a = 0 \]  
\[ a (b - 9) = 0 \]  
Since \( a \neq 0 \) (as \( a \) is the tens digit of a two-digit number, so \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \)), we have:  
\[ b - 9 = 0 \]  
\[ b = 9 \]  
Thus, the units digit \( b \) must be 9.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( b = 9 \) by checking if numbers of the form \( N = 10a + 9 \) satisfy \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) for \( a \) from 1 to 9, and confirm the units digit.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( N = 10a + 9 \), where \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \):  
- \( P(N) = a \cdot 9 = 9a \),  
- \( S(N) = a + 9 \),  
- Compute \( P(N) + S(N) = 9a + (a + 9) = 10a + 9 \).  

Check if \( N = P(N) + S(N) \):  
\[ 10a + 9 = 10a + 9 \]  
This holds for all \( a \) from 1 to 9.  

Examples:  
- If \( a = 1 \), \( N = 19 \), then \( P(19) = 1 \cdot 9 = 9 \), \( S(19) = 1 + 9 = 10 \), and \( 9 + 10 = 19 \).  
- If \( a = 2 \), \( N = 29 \), then \( P(29) = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \), \( S(29) = 2 + 9 = 11 \), and \( 18 + 11 = 29 \).  

The units digit of \( N = 10a + 9 \) is always 9, as \( b = 9 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
List all goals in a nested format, integrating recent planning information, and state the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the units digit of a two-digit number \( N \) such that \( N = P(N) + S(N) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Represent \( N \) in terms of its digits (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the units digit of \( N \) (current).  

**Current Goal**: Determine the units digit of \( N \).  

From the previous steps, \( N = 10a + 9 \), so the units digit is 9 for all valid \( N \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the units digit of \( N \). Since the units digit is consistently 9 across all valid solutions, state the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The units digit of \( N \) is 9, as derived from the equation and validated for all \( a \) from 1 to 9.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The units digit of \( N \) is \( \boxed{9} \).
