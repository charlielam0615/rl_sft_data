**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a two-digit number \( N \) such that \( N = P(N) + S(N) \), where \( P(N) \) is the product of the digits of \( N \), and \( S(N) \) is the sum of the digits of \( N \). The goal is to determine the units digit of \( N \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Represent \( N \) as a two-digit number in terms of its digits.  
2. Set up the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) using the digits.  
3. Solve for \( N \) by finding values that satisfy the equation.  
4. Determine the units digit of the resulting \( N \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to represent \( N \) as a two-digit number and set up the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \). Achieve this by expressing \( N \) as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit (from 1 to 9) and \( b \) is the units digit (from 0 to 9), then formulate the equation based on the definitions of \( P(N) = a \cdot b \) and \( S(N) = a + b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( N \) be a two-digit number with tens digit \( a \) (where \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \)) and units digit \( b \) (where \( 0 \leq b \leq 9 \)). Thus, \( N = 10a + b \).  
The product of the digits is \( P(N) = a \cdot b \), and the sum of the digits is \( S(N) = a + b \).  
The given condition is:  
\[ N = P(N) + S(N) \]  
Substituting the expressions:  
\[ 10a + b = (a \cdot b) + (a + b) \]  
Simplify the right-hand side:  
\[ 10a + b = a \cdot b + a + b \]  
Move all terms to one side to form the equation:  
\[ 10a + b - a - b - a \cdot b = 0 \]  
\[ 9a - a \cdot b = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ a (9 - b) = 0 \]  
Since \( a \neq 0 \) (as \( a \) is the tens digit of a two-digit number, so \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \)), we have:  
\[ 9 - b = 0 \]  
\[ b = 9 \]  
Thus, the units digit \( b = 9 \). We now need to verify if this satisfies the original condition for possible values of \( a \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( b = 9 \) by substituting \( b = 9 \) back into the equation \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) for all possible values of \( a \) (from 1 to 9) and checking if the resulting \( N \) is a two-digit number that satisfies the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have \( b = 9 \). Let’s substitute \( b = 9 \) into the equation and test for each possible \( a \) (tens digit from 1 to 9).  
The equation is:  
\[ N = 10a + b = (a \cdot b) + (a + b) \]  
With \( b = 9 \):  
\[ N = 10a + 9 \]  
\[ P(N) = a \cdot 9 = 9a \]  
\[ S(N) = a + 9 \]  
So:  
\[ N = P(N) + S(N) = 9a + (a + 9) = 10a + 9 \]  
The right-hand side equals the left-hand side:  
\[ 10a + 9 = 10a + 9 \]  
This identity holds for any \( a \), suggesting all values of \( a \) from 1 to 9 may be valid. Let’s compute \( N \) for each \( a \):  
- For \( a = 1 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 1 + 9 = 19 \). Check: \( P(19) = 1 \cdot 9 = 9 \), \( S(19) = 1 + 9 = 10 \), \( 9 + 10 = 19 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 2 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 2 + 9 = 29 \). Check: \( P(29) = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \), \( S(29) = 2 + 9 = 11 \), \( 18 + 11 = 29 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 3 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 3 + 9 = 39 \). Check: \( P(39) = 3 \cdot 9 = 27 \), \( S(39) = 3 + 9 = 12 \), \( 27 + 12 = 39 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 4 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 4 + 9 = 49 \). Check: \( P(49) = 4 \cdot 9 = 36 \), \( S(49) = 4 + 9 = 13 \), \( 36 + 13 = 49 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 5 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 5 + 9 = 59 \). Check: \( P(59) = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \), \( S(59) = 5 + 9 = 14 \), \( 45 + 14 = 59 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 6 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 6 + 9 = 69 \). Check: \( P(69) = 6 \cdot 9 = 54 \), \( S(69) = 6 + 9 = 15 \), \( 54 + 15 = 69 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 7 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 7 + 9 = 79 \). Check: \( P(79) = 7 \cdot 9 = 63 \), \( S(79) = 7 + 9 = 16 \), \( 63 + 16 = 79 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 8 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 8 + 9 = 89 \). Check: \( P(89) = 8 \cdot 9 = 72 \), \( S(89) = 8 + 9 = 17 \), \( 72 + 17 = 89 \). Valid.  
- For \( a = 9 \): \( N = 10 \cdot 9 + 9 = 99 \). Check: \( P(99) = 9 \cdot 9 = 81 \), \( S(99) = 9 + 9 = 18 \), \( 81 + 18 = 99 \). Valid.  
All numbers \( N = 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99 \) satisfy the condition, and all have units digit \( b = 9 \).

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the units digit of a two-digit number \( N \) such that \( N = P(N) + S(N) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Represent \( N \) as a two-digit number and set up the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation to find possible \( N \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions to ensure they satisfy the condition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the units digit of \( N \) (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Determine the units digit of \( N \). From the validation step, all valid \( N \) (19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99) have a units digit of 9.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the units digit of \( N \). Since all valid \( N \) have been computed and all share the same units digit, state the units digit as the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
All valid two-digit numbers \( N \) satisfying \( N = P(N) + S(N) \) are 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, and 99. Each has a units digit of 9. Therefore, the units digit of \( N \) is 9.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The units digit of \( N \) is 9.
