### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the probability problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Identify the appropriate probability model for coin flips.  
2. Determine the formula for calculating the probability of exactly k successes in n trials.  
3. Apply the formula with n=10 and k=8.  
4. Compute the numerical result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the probability model for coin flips.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that flipping a fair coin multiple times follows a binomial distribution, where each flip is independent, with a probability of heads p=0.5 and tails 1-p=0.5.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The problem involves flipping a fair coin 10 times, with each flip having two equally likely outcomes: heads (p=0.5) or tails (1-p=0.5). This scenario fits a binomial distribution, where the number of heads in n trials follows a binomial random variable X ~ Bin(n, p). Here, n=10 (number of flips) and p=0.5 (probability of heads).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the formula for the probability of exactly k successes in n trials.  
How to Achieve: Use the binomial probability formula to compute the probability of exactly k heads in n flips.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a binomial distribution, the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by the formula:  
P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)  
where:  
- C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.  
- p is the probability of success (heads).  
- 1-p is the probability of failure (tails).  
For this problem:  
- n = 10 (total flips)  
- k = 8 (desired heads)  
- p = 0.5 (probability of heads)  
- 1-p = 0.5 (probability of tails)  
Thus, the formula becomes:  
P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^(10-8)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the formula with n=10 and k=8.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(10, 8), compute the probability terms (0.5)^8 and (0.5)^2, and multiply them together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let’s compute each part of the formula P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^2:  

1. **Binomial Coefficient**:  
   C(10, 8) = C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 90 / 2 = 45  

2. **Probability Terms**:  
   (0.5)^8 = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1 / 2^8 = 1 / 256 = 0.00390625  
   (0.5)^2 = 0.5 * 0.5 = 1 / 4 = 0.25  

3. **Combine**:  
   P(X = 8) = 45 * (0.00390625) * (0.25)  
   First, compute 0.00390625 * 0.25 = 0.00390625 / 4 = 0.0009765625  
   Then, 45 * 0.0009765625 = 45 * (1 / 1024) = 45 / 1024 = 0.0439453125  

Thus, P(X = 8) = 0.0439453125.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculation.  
How to Achieve: Verify the binomial coefficient, recompute key steps, and ensure the result is reasonable for a binomial probability.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let’s validate:  
- **Binomial Coefficient**: C(10, 8) = 45, as calculated as (10, 2) = 45. Alternatively, compute directly: C(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 90 / 2 = 45. Correct.  
- **Powers of 0.5**:  
   (0.5)^8 = 1 / 256 ≈ 0.00390625 (correct).  
   (0.5)^2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25 (correct).  
- **Multiplication**:  
   0.00390625 * 0.25 = 0.0009765625  
   45 * 0.0009765625 = 45 / 1024 = 0.0439453125 (matches).  
- **Reasonableness**: The probability is small (0.0439453125), which is reasonable for getting exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips, as binomial probabilities for extreme k values (close to 0 or n) are typically low.  
The calculation appears valid.
