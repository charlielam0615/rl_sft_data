**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Identify the appropriate probability model for coin flips.
2. Determine the formula for calculating the probability of exactly k successes in n trials.
3. Apply the formula with n = 10 and k = 8.
4. Compute the numerical result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to identify the probability model for coin flips. This can be achieved by recognizing that each flip is independent with a success probability of 0.5, suggesting a binomial distribution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the coin is fair, the probability of heads or tails is 0.5. Each flip is independent, and we are counting the number of heads in 10 flips. This scenario fits the binomial distribution model, where the probability of k successes in n trials is given by P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), with p = 0.5, n = 10, and k = 8.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to determine the formula for the probability of exactly 8 heads in 10 flips. This can be achieved by applying the binomial probability formula identified in the previous step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The binomial probability formula is P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where:
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- p is the probability of success (heads, p = 0.5).
- n is the number of trials (10).
- k is the number of successes (8).
Thus, the probability is P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^(10-8).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute the numerical probability using the binomial formula with n = 10, k = 8, and p = 0.5. This can be achieved by calculating C(10, 8), evaluating the probability terms, and multiplying the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate each component:
- Combinations: C(10, 8) = C(10, 2) = 10!/(2! * 8!) = (10 * 9)/(2 * 1) = 45.
- Probability of heads: (0.5)^8 = 1/256 = 0.00390625.
- Probability of tails: (0.5)^(10-8) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.
- Total probability: P(X = 8) = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 = 45 * 0.0009765625 = 0.0439453125.

Thus, the probability is approximately 0.043945.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the calculated probability. This can be achieved by checking the combination calculation, verifying the probability terms, and ensuring the arithmetic is correct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Verify C(10, 8): C(10, 8) = 10!/(8! * 2!) = (10 * 9)/(2 * 1) = 45. Correct.
- Verify (0.5)^8: 0.5^8 = (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 * 0.0625 = 0.00390625. Correct.
- Verify (0.5)^2: 0.5^2 = 0.25. Correct.
- Verify multiplication: 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 = 45 * (1/256) * (1/4) = 45/(256 * 4) = 45/1024 ≈ 0.0439453125. Correct.
The calculations are consistent, and the result aligns with expected values for a binomial distribution.
