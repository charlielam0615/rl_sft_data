**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the common ratio of the geometric series.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the first term of the series.  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the common ratio by computing the ratio between consecutive terms.  
- Subgoal 3: Verify the common ratio across multiple terms to ensure consistency.  
- Subgoal 4: Express the final answer clearly.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first term of the series. This can be achieved by examining the given series and selecting the first term provided.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first term of the series is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the common ratio by computing the ratio between consecutive terms. This can be achieved by dividing the second term by the first term and the third term by the second term to check for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the common ratio \(r\), compute the ratio of consecutive terms:  
- Second term divided by first term: \(\frac{-\frac{4}{9}}{\frac{5}{6}} = -\frac{4}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{5} = -\frac{4 \cdot 6}{9 \cdot 5} = -\frac{24}{45} = -\frac{8}{15}\).  
- Third term divided by second term: \(\frac{\frac{32}{135}}{-\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{32}{135} \cdot \frac{-9}{4} = \frac{32 \cdot (-9)}{135 \cdot 4} = \frac{-288}{540} = -\frac{8}{15}\).  

The ratio is consistent at \(-\frac{8}{15}\).
