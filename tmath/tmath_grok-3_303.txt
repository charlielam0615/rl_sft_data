**Problem Restatement**: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series given by the terms \(\frac{5}{6}\), \(-\frac{4}{9}\), \(\frac{32}{135}\), and continuing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the common ratio of the geometric series, break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the first term of the series.
2. Compute the ratio between consecutive terms (e.g., second term divided by first term, third term divided by second term).
3. Verify if the ratio is constant across terms to confirm it as the common ratio.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the first term of the series.
How to Achieve: Examine the given series and extract the first term directly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The first term of the series is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the ratio between consecutive terms.
How to Achieve: Calculate the ratio of the second term to the first term and the third term to the second term using the formula \( r = \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given terms: \( a_1 = \frac{5}{6} \), \( a_2 = -\frac{4}{9} \), \( a_3 = \frac{32}{135} \).

- Ratio between second and first term:
  \[
  r_1 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-\frac{4}{9}}{\frac{5}{6}} = -\frac{4}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{5} = -\frac{4 \cdot 6}{9 \cdot 5} = -\frac{24}{45} = -\frac{8}{15}
  \]

- Ratio between third and second term:
  \[
  r_2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{\frac{32}{135}}{-\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{32}{135} \cdot \left(-\frac{9}{4}\right) = -\frac{32 \cdot 9}{135 \cdot 4} = -\frac{288}{540} = -\frac{8}{15}
  \]

Both ratios are \(-\frac{8}{15}\), suggesting a constant common ratio.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify if the ratio is constant across terms.
How to Achieve: Compare the computed ratios to ensure they are identical. Check additional terms if necessary to confirm the pattern.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The ratios calculated are:
- \( r_1 = -\frac{8}{15} \)
- \( r_2 = -\frac{8}{15} \)

Since \( r_1 = r_2 \), the common ratio appears to be \(-\frac{8}{15}\). To further validate, compute the next term using the ratio and check consistency:
- Expected third term: \( a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = \left(-\frac{4}{9}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{8}{15}\right) = \frac{4 \cdot 8}{9 \cdot 15} = \frac{32}{135} \), which matches the given term.

The ratio is consistent.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term (Completed: First term is \(\frac{5}{6}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the ratio between consecutive terms (Completed: Ratios are \(-\frac{8}{15}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify if the ratio is constant (Completed: Ratio is consistent at \(-\frac{8}{15}\)).

Current Goal: Conclude the common ratio based on completed subgoals.

The common ratio of the series is \(-\frac{8}{15}\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The common ratio of the infinite geometric series is \(-\frac{8}{15}\).
