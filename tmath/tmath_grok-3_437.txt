**Problem Statement**: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series given by the terms \(\frac{-3}{5}, -\frac{5}{3}, -\frac{125}{27}, \dots\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the common ratio of the geometric series, break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the first few terms of the series.  
2. Compute the ratio between consecutive terms.  
3. Verify if the ratio is constant to confirm it as the common ratio.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first few terms of the series and compute the ratio between consecutive terms. Achieve this by listing the given terms and dividing each term by the previous term to find the potential common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The given terms are:  
- First term (\(a_1\)): \(\frac{-3}{5}\)  
- Second term (\(a_2\)): \(-\frac{5}{3}\)  
- Third term (\(a_3\)): \(-\frac{125}{27}\)  

Compute the ratio between consecutive terms:  
- Ratio between second and first term: \(r_1 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-\frac{5}{3}}{\frac{-3}{5}} = -\frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{-3} = \frac{25}{9}\).  
- Ratio between third and second term: \(r_2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{-\frac{125}{27}}{-\frac{5}{3}} = -\frac{125}{27} \cdot \frac{-3}{5} = \frac{125 \cdot 3}{27 \cdot 5} = \frac{375}{135} = \frac{25}{9}\).  

Both ratios are \(\frac{25}{9}\), suggesting a possible common ratio.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if the ratio \(\frac{25}{9}\) is constant by checking if it holds for additional terms or confirming the pattern. Since only three terms are provided, validate by ensuring the calculations are consistent and checking for any signs of an alternating or non-geometric pattern.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the ratios to ensure accuracy:  
- \(r_1 = \frac{-\frac{5}{3}}{\frac{-3}{5}} = \frac{5 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 3} = \frac{25}{9}\).  
- \(r_2 = \frac{-\frac{125}{27}}{-\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{125 \cdot 3}{27 \cdot 5} = \frac{375}{135} = \frac{25}{9}\).  

The ratios are consistent. Notice the negative signs in the terms: \(\frac{-3}{5}\), \(-\frac{5}{3}\), \(-\frac{125}{27}\). The ratios \(\frac{25}{9}\) are positive, indicating the series may not alternate due to the common ratio itself but rather due to the initial negative term propagating. The series appears geometric with a constant ratio of \(\frac{25}{9}\).  

To further validate, consider the pattern in the terms:  
- Numerators: 3, 5, 125.  
- Denominators: 5, 3, 27.  
The ratio \(\frac{25}{9}\) applied to \(\frac{-3}{5}\) gives: \(\frac{-3}{5} \cdot \frac{25}{9} = -\frac{3 \cdot 25}{5 \cdot 9} = -\frac{5}{3}\), matching the second term.  
Applying again: \(-\frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{25}{9} = -\frac{5 \cdot 25}{3 \cdot 9} = -\frac{125}{27}\), matching the third term.  

The calculations are consistent, confirming the common ratio.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first few terms of the series (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the ratio between consecutive terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify if the ratio is constant (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution by stating the common ratio, as all subgoals are completed.  

The common ratio has been identified as \(\frac{25}{9}\) through calculations and validation.

### Final Answer
The common ratio of the infinite geometric series is \(\frac{25}{9}\).
