**Problem Statement**: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series given by the terms \(-\frac{3}{5}, -\frac{5}{3}, -\frac{125}{27}, \dots\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the common ratio of the geometric series, break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the first few terms of the series.  
2. Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms to determine if it is constant.  
3. Verify the common ratio across multiple pairs of terms.  
4. Confirm the series is geometric by checking the consistency of the ratio.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the ratio between consecutive terms. This will be achieved by dividing the second term by the first term and the third term by the second term to check for a constant ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given the terms:  
- First term (\(a_1\)) = \(-\frac{3}{5}\)  
- Second term (\(a_2\)) = \(-\frac{5}{3}\)  
- Third term (\(a_3\)) = \(-\frac{125}{27}\)  

Calculate the ratio \(r\) between consecutive terms:  
- Ratio between second and first term:  
  \[
  r = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-\frac{5}{3}}{-\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{25}{9}
  \]  
- Ratio between third and second term:  
  \[
  r = \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{-\frac{125}{27}}{-\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{125}{27} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{125 \cdot 3}{27 \cdot 5} = \frac{375}{135} = \frac{25}{9}
  \]  

The ratio is \(\frac{25}{9}\) for both pairs of terms, suggesting a common ratio.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the common ratio by checking additional terms or confirming the pattern. This will be achieved by ensuring the ratio remains consistent and aligns with the geometric series definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The ratios calculated are:  
- \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{25}{9} \)  
- \( \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{25}{9} \)  

Since the ratios are equal, the series appears to be geometric with a common ratio of \(\frac{25}{9}\). To further validate, consider the general form of a geometric series: \( a, ar, ar^2, \dots \).  
- First term: \( a = -\frac{3}{5} \)  
- Second term: \( ar = -\frac{5}{3} \)  
- Common ratio: \( r = \frac{-\frac{5}{3}}{-\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{25}{9} \)  
- Expected third term: \( ar^2 = \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{25}{9}\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) \cdot \frac{625}{81} = -\frac{1875}{405} = -\frac{125}{27} \), which matches the given third term.  

The consistency across terms confirms the common ratio.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the common ratio of the infinite geometric series.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first few terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms (completed, ratio = \(\frac{25}{9}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the common ratio across multiple pairs (completed, consistent ratio).  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the series is geometric (completed, terms follow \( ar^{n-1} \)).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the common ratio has been identified and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The common ratio of the infinite geometric series is \(\frac{25}{9}\).
