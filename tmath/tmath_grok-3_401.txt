### Problem Restatement
We are given the ratio of the areas of two squares as \(\frac{192}{80}\). We need to find the ratio of their side lengths in the simplified form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers, and then compute the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given area ratio \(\frac{192}{80}\).  
2. Determine the relationship between the area ratio and the side length ratio of the squares.  
3. Rationalize the denominator of the side length ratio to express it in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\).  
4. Identify the integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the simplified form.  
5. Compute the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given area ratio \(\frac{192}{80}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor to simplify the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To simplify \(\frac{192}{80}\), find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 192 and 80.  
- Prime factorization of 192: \(192 = 2^6 \cdot 3\).  
- Prime factorization of 80: \(80 = 2^4 \cdot 5\).  
- GCD: \(2^4 = 16\).  

Divide numerator and denominator by 16:  
\[
\frac{192 \div 16}{80 \div 16} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
Thus, the simplified area ratio is \(\frac{12}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the relationship between the area ratio and the side length ratio.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the fact that the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the side lengths.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the side lengths of the two squares be \(s_1\) and \(s_2\). The areas are \(s_1^2\) and \(s_2^2\), and their ratio is given as:  
\[
\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
Therefore, the ratio of the side lengths is:  
\[
\frac{s_1}{s_2} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
Simplify \(\sqrt{12}\):  
\[
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = 2\sqrt{3}.
\]
Thus, the side length ratio is:  
\[
\frac{s_1}{s_2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rationalize the denominator of the side length ratio \(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\) to express it in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\) to eliminate the square root in the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with the side length ratio:  
\[
\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):  
\[
\frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}.
\]
The ratio is now \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\), which is in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\) with:  
- \(a = 2\),  
- \(b = 15\),  
- \(c = 5\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the ratio \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) is correct and simplified.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the square of the side length ratio matches the given area ratio and ensure the form is simplified.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Square the side length ratio to confirm it matches the area ratio:  
\[
\left( \frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{4 \cdot 15}{25} = \frac{60}{25} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
This matches the simplified area ratio \(\frac{12}{5}\), confirming correctness.  
Next, check if \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) is simplified:  
- \(a = 2\) and \(c = 5\) have no common factors (GCD is 1).  
- \(\sqrt{15}\) is simplified since 15 = 3 \(\cdot\) 5, and neither 3 nor 5 is a perfect square.  
Thus, the form \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) is simplified and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum \(a + b + c\).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the ratio \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the ratio \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\):  
- \(a = 2\),  
- \(b = 15\),  
- \(c = 5\).  
Compute the sum:  
\[
a + b + c = 2 + 15 + 5 = 22.
\]
[/IMP]
