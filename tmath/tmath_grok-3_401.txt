### Problem Statement
We need to find the ratio of the side lengths of two squares given that the ratio of their areas is \(\frac{192}{80}\). After rationalizing the denominator of this ratio, the side length ratio should be expressed in the simplified form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers. Finally, we compute the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Simplify the given area ratio \(\frac{192}{80}\).  
2. Determine the relationship between the areas and side lengths of the squares.  
3. Find the ratio of the side lengths.  
4. Rationalize the denominator of the side length ratio to express it as \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\).  
5. Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and compute \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the area ratio \(\frac{192}{80}\). This will be achieved by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).  

[IMP]  
To simplify \(\frac{192}{80}\), find the GCD of 192 and 80:  
- Prime factorization of 192: \(192 = 2^6 \cdot 3\).  
- Prime factorization of 80: \(80 = 2^4 \cdot 5\).  
- GCD: \(2^4 = 16\).  

Divide numerator and denominator by 16:  
\[
\frac{192 \div 16}{80 \div 16} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
Thus, the simplified area ratio is \(\frac{12}{5}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the ratio of the side lengths of the two squares, given that the area ratio is \(\frac{12}{5}\). Since the area of a square is the square of its side length, we take the square root of the area ratio to find the side length ratio.  

[IMP]  
Let the side lengths of the two squares be \(s_1\) and \(s_2\). The area of a square is \(s^2\), so the ratio of the areas is:  
\[
\frac{\text{Area}_1}{\text{Area}_2} = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
Thus, the ratio of the side lengths is:  
\[
\frac{s_1}{s_2} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
Simplify \(\sqrt{12}\):  
\[
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}.
\]
So, the side length ratio is:  
\[
\frac{s_1}{s_2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rationalize the denominator of the side length ratio \(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\) to express it in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers. This will be achieved by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\) to eliminate the square root in the denominator.  

[IMP]  
To rationalize \(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\), multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):  
\[
\frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}.
\]
The ratio is now \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\), which is in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\), with:  
- \(a = 2\),  
- \(b = 15\),  
- \(c = 5\).  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) is the correct side length ratio and that it is fully simplified. This will be done by checking if the square of the side length ratio matches the area ratio and ensuring the expression is in simplest form.  

[IMP]  
To validate, square the side length ratio to check if it yields the area ratio:  
\[
\left(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{(2\sqrt{15})^2}{5^2} = \frac{4 \cdot 15}{25} = \frac{60}{25} = \frac{12}{5}.
\]
This matches the simplified area ratio \(\frac{12}{5}\), confirming correctness.  

Next, check if \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\) is simplified:  
- Numerator: \(2\sqrt{15}\), where 15 is square-free (\(15 = 3 \cdot 5\)).  
- Denominator: 5 is an integer.  
- GCD of coefficients (2 and 5) is 1, and \(\sqrt{15}\) cannot be simplified further.  

The expression is in simplest form, and \(a = 2\), \(b = 15\), \(c = 5\) are integers as required.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum \(a + b + c\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = 15\), and \(c = 5\).  

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[
a + b + c = 2 + 15 + 5 = 22.
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one:  
- Main goal: Find the sum \(a + b + c\) for the side length ratio in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the area ratio \(\frac{192}{80}\). (Completed: \(\frac{12}{5}\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the side length ratio from the area ratio. (Completed: \(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Rationalize the denominator to get \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\). (Completed: \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the side length ratio. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \(a + b + c\). (Completed: 22)  
**Current goal**: Review the hierarchy of goals to ensure all steps are complete.  

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is:  
- **Main goal**: Find \(a + b + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(\frac{192}{80}\) → \(\frac{12}{5}\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute side length ratio → \(\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Rationalize to \(\frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\), giving \(a = 2\), \(b = 15\), \(c = 5\).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the ratio by squaring and checking against \(\frac{12}{5}\).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \(2 + 15 + 5 = 22\).  
All subgoals are complete, and the main goal is achieved. The current goal (reviewing the hierarchy) confirms the solution process is consistent.

### Final Answer
The value of the sum \(a + b + c\) is \(22\).
