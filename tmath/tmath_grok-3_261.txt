**Problem Statement**: A tree doubles its height every year and reaches a height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years. We need to determine the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the tree's height at the end of 3 years, work backward from the known height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years. Since the tree doubles its height each year, we can define the height at year 6 as \( H_6 = 32 \), and each previous year's height is half of the next year's height. Thus, we can compute the height at year 3 by halving the height at year 6 three times (i.e., \( H_3 = H_6 / 2^3 \)).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the tree's height at the end of 3 years. This will be achieved by dividing the height at year 6 (32 feet) by \( 2^3 \), as the height doubles each year, implying a geometric sequence where each year's height is half of the next year's height when moving backward.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the height at the end of 6 years, \( H_6 = 32 \) feet:  
- At the end of 5 years, \( H_5 = H_6 / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 \) feet.  
- At the end of 4 years, \( H_4 = H_5 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 \) feet.  
- At the end of 3 years, \( H_3 = H_4 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 \) feet.  
Alternatively, we can compute directly: \( H_3 = H_6 / 2^3 = 32 / 8 = 4 \) feet.  
Thus, the height at the end of 3 years is 4 feet.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculated height of 4 feet at the end of 3 years. This will be achieved by working forward from the height at year 3 to confirm that doubling the height each year from year 3 to year 6 results in 32 feet, ensuring consistency with the problem's conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the height at the end of 3 years as 4 feet:  
- At the end of 4 years, \( H_4 = H_3 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8 \) feet.  
- At the end of 5 years, \( H_5 = H_4 \times 2 = 8 \times 2 = 16 \) feet.  
- At the end of 6 years, \( H_6 = H_5 \times 2 = 16 \times 2 = 32 \) feet.  
This matches the given height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years, confirming that the height of 4 feet at the end of 3 years is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the tree's height at the end of 3 years.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the height at year 6 and work backward to year 3 using the doubling rule.  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the height at year 3 by dividing the height at year 6 by \( 2^3 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculated height by working forward from year 3 to year 6.  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align with the problem's requirements.  
The calculations in Subgoals 2 and 3 are consistent, yielding a height of 4 feet at the end of 3 years, which satisfies the condition that the height doubles each year to reach 32 feet at the end of 6 years.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The height of the tree at the end of 3 years is 4 feet.
