**Problem Restatement**: A tree doubles its height every year and reaches a height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years. We need to determine the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Model the tree’s height growth based on the doubling pattern.  
2. Use the given information (32 feet at the end of 6 years) to find the initial height.  
3. Calculate the height at the end of 3 years using the model.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Model the tree’s height growth and find the initial height.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the tree doubles its height every year, the height follows a geometric sequence. Let the initial height be \( h_0 \). After 6 years (6 doublings), the height is \( h_0 \cdot 2^6 = 32 \). Solve for \( h_0 \), then compute the height after 3 years as \( h_0 \cdot 2^3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The height after \( n \) years is given by \( h_n = h_0 \cdot 2^n \). At the end of 6 years (\( n = 6 \)), the height is 32 feet:  
\[ h_0 \cdot 2^6 = 32 \]  
Since \( 2^6 = 64 \), we have:  
\[ h_0 \cdot 64 = 32 \]  
\[ h_0 = \frac{32}{64} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]  

Now, calculate the height at the end of 3 years (\( n = 3 \)):  
\[ h_3 = h_0 \cdot 2^3 = 0.5 \cdot 8 = 4 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated height at the end of 3 years.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the model and calculations align with the problem’s conditions by computing the height for all years up to 6 and confirming the result at year 3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the initial height \( h_0 = 0.5 \) feet:  
- Year 1: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^1 = 1 \) foot  
- Year 2: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 = 2 \) feet  
- Year 3: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^3 = 0.5 \cdot 8 = 4 \) feet  
- Year 4: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^4 = 0.5 \cdot 16 = 8 \) feet  
- Year 5: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^5 = 0.5 \cdot 32 = 16 \) feet  
- Year 6: \( 0.5 \cdot 2^6 = 0.5 \cdot 64 = 32 \) feet  

The height at year 6 matches the given 32 feet, confirming the model. The height at the end of 3 years is 4 feet.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the tree’s height at the end of 3 years.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the tree’s height growth (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the initial height using the 6-year data (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the height at 3 years (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the height at 3 years is calculated and validated.  
**Result**: The tree’s height at the end of 3 years is 4 feet.

**Final Answer**: The height of the tree at the end of 3 years is 4 feet.
