Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: The entire solution process for evaluating $\lfloor{\sqrt{12}}\rfloor^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Square root calculation**: $\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464$ is correct, as $3.464^2 \approx 12$.  
2. **Floor function application**: $\lfloor 3.464 \rfloor = 3$ aligns with the definition of the floor function (greatest integer â‰¤ input).  
3. **Squaring the result**: $3^2 = 9$ is a basic arithmetic fact.  
4. **Logical flow**: The steps follow the required order of operations (first compute the square root, then apply the floor function, then square).  
5. **No tool dependencies**: The solution relies solely on mathematical definitions and approximations, which are validated here.  

All critical aspects are consistent with mathematical principles. No errors detected.
