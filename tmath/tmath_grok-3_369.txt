**Problem Restatement**: We need to find \( f(f(f(2))) \) for the piecewise function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) if \( x > 4 \), and \( f(x) = x^2 \) if \( x \leq 4 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve \( f(f(f(2))) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(2) \).  
2. Compute \( f(f(2)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(f(f(2))) \).  
Each step involves evaluating the function \( f \) based on the input and the piecewise definition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \). Since \( 2 \leq 4 \), use the piecewise definition \( f(x) = x^2 \). Calculate \( f(2) = 2^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 2 \), since \( 2 \leq 4 \), we have \( f(2) = 2^2 = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Since \( 4 \leq 4 \), use the piecewise definition \( f(x) = x^2 \). Calculate \( f(4) = 4^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 4 \), since \( 4 \leq 4 \), we have \( f(4) = 4^2 = 16 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(16) \). Since \( 16 > 4 \), use the piecewise definition \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \). Calculate \( f(16) = \sqrt{16} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 16 \), since \( 16 > 4 \), we have \( f(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(2))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) \) = 4 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \) = 16 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(16) \) = 4 (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(f(f(2))) \), which has been achieved as \( f(16) = 4 \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by recomputing each step to ensure correctness. Re-evaluate \( f(2) \), \( f(4) \), and \( f(16) \) using the piecewise function.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \( f(2) \): Since \( 2 \leq 4 \), \( f(2) = 2^2 = 4 \).  
- For \( f(4) \): Since \( 4 \leq 4 \), \( f(4) = 4^2 = 16 \).  
- For \( f(16) \): Since \( 16 > 4 \), \( f(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \).  
The sequence is consistent: \( f(2) = 4 \), \( f(4) = 16 \), \( f(16) = 4 \). Thus, \( f(f(f(2))) = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \( f(f(f(2))) = 4 \).
