**Problem Statement**: We need to find \( f(f(f(2))) \) for the piecewise function defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\sqrt{x} & \text{if } x > 4, \\
x^2 & \text{if } x \le 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

We will solve this by applying the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(f(f(2))) \), we need to compute the function composition step-by-step. Break this down into subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(2) \).  
2. Compute \( f(f(2)) \), using the result from step 1.  
3. Compute \( f(f(f(2))) \), using the result from step 2.  
Each step requires evaluating the piecewise function based on the input value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \). Since 2 is the input, determine which piece of the function applies by checking if \( 2 > 4 \) or \( 2 \le 4 \), then apply the appropriate rule.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 2 \le 4 \), use the rule \( f(x) = x^2 \).  
\[ f(2) = 2^2 = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Using the result from the previous step (\( f(2) = 4 \)), evaluate \( f(4) \) by checking if \( 4 > 4 \) or \( 4 \le 4 \), then apply the appropriate rule.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 4 \le 4 \), use the rule \( f(x) = x^2 \).  
\[ f(4) = 4^2 = 16 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(16) \). Using the result from the previous step (\( f(4) = 16 \)), evaluate \( f(16) \) by checking if \( 16 > 4 \) or \( 16 \le 4 \), then apply the appropriate rule.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 16 > 4 \), use the rule \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \).  
\[ f(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(2))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) \) → Completed: \( f(2) = 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \) → Completed: \( f(4) = 16 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(2))) = f(16) \) → Completed: \( f(16) = 4 \).  
**Current Goal**: The final computation of \( f(f(f(2))) \) has been completed, yielding \( f(16) = 4 \).  
The goal hierarchy is fully resolved, and the answer is consistent with the subgoals.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[ f(f(f(2))) = 4 \]
