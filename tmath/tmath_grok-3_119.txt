### Problem Restatement
We need to find positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that the equation \( ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \) holds, and determine the minimal possible value of \( |a - b| \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the minimal \( |a - b| \) into subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation to isolate terms and explore possible forms.  
2. Identify constraints for \( a \) and \( b \) as positive integers.  
3. Find pairs \( (a, b) \) that satisfy the equation.  
4. Compute \( |a - b| \) for each pair and select the minimal value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation to a more manageable form to facilitate finding solutions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Manipulate the equation \( ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \) algebraically to express it in a form that allows us to test integer pairs or derive relationships between \( a \) and \( b \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:  
\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \]  
Group terms involving \( b \):  
\[ ab + 4b - 3a = 137 \]  
Factor out \( b \):  
\[ b(a + 4) - 3a = 137 \]  
Rearrange:  
\[ b(a + 4) = 137 + 3a \]  
Thus:  
\[ b = \frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \]  
For \( b \) to be an integer, \( a + 4 \) must divide \( 137 + 3a \). Alternatively, rewrite the equation as:  
\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \]  
Add and subtract 12:  
\[ ab - 3a + 4b - 12 + 12 = 137 \]  
\[ (ab - 3a + 4b - 12) = 137 - 12 \]  
\[ (ab - 3a + 4b - 12) = 125 \]  
Notice that:  
\[ ab - 3a + 4b - 12 = a(b - 3) + 4(b - 3) = (a + 4)(b - 3) \]  
Thus:  
\[ (a + 4)(b - 3) = 125 \]  
Since 125 is a positive integer, \( a + 4 \) and \( b - 3 \) are integers, and we need \( b - 3 > 0 \) (so \( b \geq 4 \)) and \( a + 4 > 0 \) (automatic since \( a \geq 1 \)). This form is promising as 125 has a finite number of factor pairs.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find all positive integer pairs \( (a, b) \) that satisfy \( (a + 4)(b - 3) = 125 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify all positive factor pairs of 125, assign them to \( a + 4 \) and \( b - 3 \), and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), the positive divisors of 125 are \( 1, 5, 25, 125 \). The factor pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( m \cdot n = 125 \) are:  
\[ (1, 125), (5, 25), (25, 5), (125, 1) \]  
Let \( a + 4 = m \) and \( b - 3 = n \). Then:  
\[ a = m - 4, \quad b = n + 3 \]  
We need \( a \geq 1 \), so \( m - 4 \geq 1 \implies m \geq 5 \). Thus, consider pairs where \( m \geq 5 \):  
- **Pair (5, 25)**:  
  \[ a + 4 = 5 \implies a = 5 - 4 = 1 \]  
  \[ b - 3 = 25 \implies b = 25 + 3 = 28 \]  
  Pair: \( (a, b) = (1, 28) \).  
- **Pair (25, 5)**:  
  \[ a + 4 = 25 \implies a = 25 - 4 = 21 \]  
  \[ b - 3 = 5 \implies b = 5 + 3 = 8 \]  
  Pair: \( (a, b) = (21, 8) \).  
- **Pair (125, 1)**:  
  \[ a + 4 = 125 \implies a = 125 - 4 = 121 \]  
  \[ b - 3 = 1 \implies b = 1 + 3 = 4 \]  
  Pair: \( (a, b) = (121, 4) \).  
The pair \( (1, 125) \) gives \( a + 4 = 1 \implies a = -3 \), which is not a positive integer. Thus, the valid pairs are:  
\[ (1, 28), (21, 8), (121, 4) \]  
Verify each pair in the original equation \( ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \):  
- For \( (1, 28) \):  
  \[ 1 \cdot 28 - 3 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 28 = 28 - 3 + 112 = 137 \]  
  Valid.  
- For \( (21, 8) \):  
  \[ 21 \cdot 8 - 3 \cdot 21 + 4 \cdot 8 = 168 - 63 + 32 = 137 \]  
  Valid.  
- For \( (121, 4) \):  
  \[ 121 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 121 + 4 \cdot 4 = 484 - 363 + 16 = 137 \]  
  Valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute \( |a - b| \) for each valid pair and find the minimal value.  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate the absolute difference \( |a - b| \) for the pairs \( (1, 28), (21, 8), (121, 4) \), and identify the smallest result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( |a - b| \):  
- For \( (1, 28) \):  
  \[ |1 - 28| = 27 \]  
- For \( (21, 8) \):  
  \[ |21 - 8| = 13 \]  
- For \( (121, 4) \):  
  \[ |121 - 4| = 117 \]  
Compare: \( 27, 13, 117 \). The minimal value is \( 13 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate that no other pairs yield a smaller \( |a - b| \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Reconsider the factor pairs and check if any other configurations or missed pairs satisfy the equation with \( |a - b| < 13 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-examine the factor pairs of 125. We considered all positive divisors \( 1, 5, 25, 125 \). The pair \( (1, 125) \) was invalid (\( a < 1 \)). Negative divisors are irrelevant since \( a + 4 \) and \( b - 3 \) must yield positive \( a \) and \( b \). Alternatively, test the equation \( b = \frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \). For small \( |a - b| \), assume \( a \approx b \). Let \( a = b + k \), where \( k \) is small, but this leads back to the factor pair approach. Test values of \( a \) around \( b \):  
For \( |a - b| = 1 \), try \( a = b + 1 \):  
\[ (b + 1)b - 3(b + 1) + 4b = b^2 + b - 3b - 3 + 4b = b^2 + 2b - 3 = 137 \]  
\[ b^2 + 2b - 140 = 0 \]  
Discriminant: \( 4 + 560 = 564 \), not a perfect square. No integer solutions.  
Since \( |a - b| = 13 \) was the smallest from valid pairs, and other approaches confirm the factor pair method, the solution is likely complete.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the minimal \( |a - b| \) for positive integers \( a, b \) satisfying \( ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation to a manageable form. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify constraints and find valid \( (a, b) \) pairs. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( |a - b| \) for each pair and select the minimal value. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate that no smaller \( |a - b| \) exists. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the minimal \( |a - b| = 13 \) and finalize the solution.  
The minimal \( |a - b| = 13 \) was found using the pair \( (21, 8) \), and validation suggests no smaller value exists.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The minimal possible value of \( |a - b| \) is \( 13 \).

\[ \boxed{13} \]
