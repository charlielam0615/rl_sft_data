### Problem Restatement
We need to find the domain of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\). The domain consists of all real numbers \(x\) for which the expression is defined, meaning:
- The expressions inside the square roots (\(x-2\) and \(5-x\)) must be non-negative (since we consider real-valued square roots).
- The denominator \(\sqrt{5-x}\) must not be zero to avoid division by zero.

Let’s solve this step by step using the meta-cognitive action set.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the domain, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine the conditions for the numerator \(\sqrt{x-2}\) to be defined.
2. Determine the conditions for the denominator \(\sqrt{5-x}\) to be defined and non-zero.
3. Combine these conditions to find the intersection of valid \(x\) values.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to determine the condition for the numerator \(\sqrt{x-2}\) to be defined. Achieve this by ensuring the expression inside the square root is non-negative, i.e., solve \(x-2 \geq 0\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \(\sqrt{x-2}\) to be defined, the radicand must be non-negative:
\[
x - 2 \geq 0
\]
\[
x \geq 2
\]
Thus, the numerator requires \(x \geq 2\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to determine the conditions for the denominator \(\sqrt{5-x}\) to be defined and non-zero. Achieve this by ensuring the expression inside the square root is non-negative (\(5-x \geq 0\)) and not zero (\(5-x \neq 0\)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \(\sqrt{5-x}\) to be defined, the radicand must be non-negative:
\[
5 - x \geq 0
\]
\[
x \leq 5
\]
Additionally, to avoid division by zero, the denominator \(\sqrt{5-x} \neq 0\), so:
\[
5 - x \neq 0
\]
\[
x \neq 5
\]
However, since \(\sqrt{5-x} = 0\) when \(5-x = 0\), we check the square root condition:
\[
5 - x > 0
\]
\[
x < 5
\]
Thus, the denominator requires \(x < 5\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Find the domain of \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Numerator condition (\(\sqrt{x-2}\)) → Achieved: \(x \geq 2\).
  - Subgoal 2: Denominator condition (\(\sqrt{5-x}\)) → Achieved: \(x < 5\).
  - Subgoal 3: Combine conditions to find the domain (pending).
Current goal: Combine the conditions \(x \geq 2\) and \(x < 5\) to determine the domain.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to combine the conditions \(x \geq 2\) and \(x < 5\) to find the domain. Achieve this by finding the intersection of the two inequalities.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The conditions are:
- From the numerator: \(x \geq 2\)
- From the denominator: \(x < 5\)

Combine these inequalities:
\[
x \geq 2 \text{ and } x < 5
\]
This can be written as:
\[
2 \leq x < 5
\]
In interval notation, the domain is \([2, 5)\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the domain \([2, 5)\) by checking boundary points and a point within the interval to ensure the expression is defined. Test \(x = 2\), \(x = 5\), and an interior point like \(x = 3\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\) at key points:
- At \(x = 2\):
  \[
  \frac{\sqrt{2-2}}{\sqrt{5-2}} = \frac{\sqrt{0}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{3}} = 0
  \]
  The expression is defined.
- At \(x = 3\):
  \[
  \frac{\sqrt{3-2}}{\sqrt{5-3}} = \frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
  The expression is defined.
- At \(x = 5\):
  \[
  \frac{\sqrt{5-2}}{\sqrt{5-5}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{0}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{0}
  \]
  The expression is undefined (division by zero).

The tests confirm that the expression is defined for \(x \in [2, 5)\) and undefined at \(x = 5\), validating the domain.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: The current goal is to summarize all conditions and results related to the domain to ensure completeness. Retrieve information from previous steps about the numerator, denominator, and combined conditions.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Summary of relevant information:
- Numerator condition (Step 2): \(\sqrt{x-2}\) requires \(x-2 \geq 0\), so \(x \geq 2\).
- Denominator condition (Step 3): \(\sqrt{5-x}\) requires \(5-x > 0\), so \(x < 5\).
- Combined conditions (Step 5): Intersection of \(x \geq 2\) and \(x < 5\) gives the domain \(2 \leq x < 5\), or \([2, 5)\).
- Validation (Step 6): Boundary tests confirm the expression is defined for \(x \in [2, 5)\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The domain of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\) is \([2, 5)\).
