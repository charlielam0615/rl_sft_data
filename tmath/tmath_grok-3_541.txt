**Problem Statement**: Find the domain of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\).

The domain consists of all real numbers \(x\) for which the expression is defined. This requires both square roots to be defined (i.e., their arguments must be non-negative) and the denominator to be non-zero.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the problem into subgoals to determine the domain:
1. Ensure the argument of the numerator’s square root, \(x-2\), is non-negative.
2. Ensure the argument of the denominator’s square root, \(5-x\), is non-negative.
3. Ensure the denominator, \(\sqrt{5-x}\), is not zero.
4. Combine these conditions to find the set of valid \(x\) values.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the conditions for the numerator’s square root to be defined. This requires solving \(x-2 \geq 0\) to ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Solve the inequality:
\[
x-2 \geq 0
\]
\[
x \geq 2
\]
Thus, for the numerator \(\sqrt{x-2}\) to be defined, \(x \geq 2\).

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the conditions for the denominator’s square root to be defined. This requires solving \(5-x \geq 0\) to ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Solve the inequality:
\[
5-x \geq 0
\]
\[
x \leq 5
\]
Thus, for the denominator \(\sqrt{5-x}\) to be defined, \(x \leq 5\).

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the denominator is not zero. This requires checking when \(\sqrt{5-x} \neq 0\), which occurs when \(5-x \neq 0\).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Solve the equation:
\[
5-x \neq 0
\]
\[
x \neq 5
\]
Since the square root is zero when its argument is zero, \(\sqrt{5-x} = 0\) when \(x = 5\). Thus, \(x \neq 5\) ensures the denominator is non-zero.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find the domain of \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure \(\sqrt{x-2}\) is defined (\(x \geq 2\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure \(\sqrt{5-x}\) is defined (\(x \leq 5\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure \(\sqrt{5-x} \neq 0\) (\(x \neq 5\)).

**Current Goal**: Combine the conditions \(x \geq 2\), \(x \leq 5\), and \(x \neq 5\) to determine the domain.

[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the conditions \(x \geq 2\), \(x \leq 5\), and \(x \neq 5\) to find the domain. This involves finding the intersection of these constraints and expressing the result in interval notation.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Combine the inequalities:
- From Subgoal 1: \(x \geq 2\).
- From Subgoal 2: \(x \leq 5\).
- From Subgoal 3: \(x \neq 5\).

The inequality \(x \geq 2\) and \(x \leq 5\) gives:
\[
2 \leq x \leq 5
\]
This corresponds to the interval \([2, 5]\). Excluding \(x = 5\) (since \(x \neq 5\)) modifies the interval to include all points from 2 to 5, but not 5 itself:
\[
[2, 5)
\]
Thus, the domain is \(x \in [2, 5)\).

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the domain \(x \in [2, 5)\) by checking if the expression is defined for values within this interval and undefined outside it or at the boundary point \(x = 5\).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

- **Test inside the interval**: At \(x = 3\):
  - Numerator: \(\sqrt{3-2} = \sqrt{1} = 1\), defined.
  - Denominator: \(\sqrt{5-3} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), non-zero.
  - Expression: \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), defined.
- **Test at lower boundary**: At \(x = 2\):
  - Numerator: \(\sqrt{2-2} = \sqrt{0} = 0\), defined.
  - Denominator: \(\sqrt{5-2} = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), non-zero.
  - Expression: \(\frac{0}{\sqrt{3}} = 0\), defined.
- **Test at upper boundary**: At \(x = 5\):
  - Numerator: \(\sqrt{5-2} = \sqrt{3}\), defined.
  - Denominator: \(\sqrt{5-5} = \sqrt{0} = 0\), causes division by zero.
  - Expression: Undefined, confirming \(x = 5\) is excluded.
- **Test outside interval**: At \(x = 1\):
  - Numerator: \(\sqrt{1-2} = \sqrt{-1}\), undefined.
  - Expression: Undefined.
- **Test outside interval**: At \(x = 6\):
  - Denominator: \(\sqrt{5-6} = \sqrt{-1}\), undefined.
  - Expression: Undefined.

The domain \(x \in [2, 5)\) is valid, as the expression is defined for all \(x\) in \([2, 5)\) and undefined at \(x = 5\) or outside this interval.

**Final Answer**

The domain of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}\) is \(x \in [2, 5)\).
