**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number of terms \( n \) in the infinite geometric sequence \( \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\} \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms equals \( \frac{63}{128} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( n \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
2. Write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence.  
3. Set up the equation using the given sum \( \frac{63}{128} \).  
4. Solve the equation to find \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence. This will be achieved by analyzing the given sequence terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sequence is \( \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\} \).  
- The first term \( a = \frac{1}{4} \).  
- The common ratio \( r \) is found by dividing consecutive terms:  
  \( \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{2} \).  
  Similarly, \( \frac{\frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{8}} = \frac{1}{16} \cdot 8 = \frac{1}{2} \).  
Thus, the common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the geometric sequence, using the first term \( a = \frac{1}{4} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:  
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]  
Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \):  
\[ S_n = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2^n}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^n}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^n}\right) \]  
Thus, the sum formula is:  
\[ S_n = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^n}\right) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation using the given sum \( \frac{63}{128} \) and solve for \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( S_n = \frac{63}{128} \), set up the equation:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^n}\right) = \frac{63}{128} \]  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{63}{128} \cdot 2 = \frac{126}{128} = \frac{63}{64} \]  
Subtract from 1:  
\[ \frac{1}{2^n} = 1 - \frac{63}{64} = \frac{1}{64} \]  
Since \( \frac{1}{64} = \frac{1}{2^6} \), we have:  
\[ \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^6} \]  
Thus, \( 2^n = 2^6 \), so \( n = 6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( n = 6 \) produces the sum \( \frac{63}{128} \) using the sum formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 6 \) into the sum formula:  
\[ S_6 = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^6}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{64}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{63}{64} = \frac{63}{128} \]  
The calculated sum matches the given sum, confirming \( n = 6 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]
