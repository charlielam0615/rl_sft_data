### Problem Statement
We need to find the number of terms \( n \) in the infinite geometric sequence \( \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\} \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \( \frac{63}{128} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution.  
- Identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
- Use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence.  
- Set up an equation using the given sum \( \frac{63}{128} \).  
- Solve for \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence. This will be achieved by analyzing the given sequence terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is \( \left\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\} \).  
- The first term \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \).  
- The second term is \( \frac{1}{8} \), and the third term is \( \frac{1}{16} \).  
- The common ratio \( r \) is calculated as the ratio of consecutive terms:  
  \( r = \frac{\text{second term}}{\text{first term}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \).  
  Verify with the next pair: \( \frac{\frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{8}} = \frac{1}{16} \cdot \frac{8}{1} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2} \).  
Thus, the first term is \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \), and the common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for the sum of the first \( n \) terms using the geometric series sum formula and the given sum \( \frac{63}{128} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:  
\[ S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]  
Given: \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \), \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( S_n = \frac{63}{128} \).  
Substitute into the formula:  
\[ \frac{63}{128} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n)}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]  
Simplify the denominator:  
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{63}{128} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n)}{\frac{1}{2}} \]  
Simplify the right-hand side:  
\[ \frac{\frac{1}{4} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n)}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) \cdot \frac{2}{1} = \frac{2}{4} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) \]  
Thus, the equation is:  
\[ \frac{63}{128} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{63}{128} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) \) for \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:  
\[ \frac{63}{128} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n) \]  
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{63}{128} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \]  
\[ \frac{126}{128} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \]  
Simplify \( \frac{126}{128} \):  
\[ \frac{126}{128} = \frac{126 \div 2}{128 \div 2} = \frac{63}{64} \]  
So:  
\[ \frac{63}{64} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \]  
Rearrange to isolate the exponential term:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 1 - \frac{63}{64} = \frac{64}{64} - \frac{63}{64} = \frac{1}{64} \]  
Since \( \frac{1}{64} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \), we have:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \]  
Equate the exponents:  
\[ n = 6 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( n = 6 \) satisfies the equation \( S_6 = \frac{63}{128} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the sum of the first 6 terms:  
\[ S_6 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]  
Compute \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).  
Then:  
\[ 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 1 - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{64}{64} - \frac{1}{64} = \frac{63}{64} \]  
\[ S_6 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\frac{63}{64}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{63}{64} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{126}{64} = \frac{126}{256} \]  
Simplify:  
\[ \frac{126}{256} = \frac{126 \div 2}{256 \div 2} = \frac{63}{128} \]  
The calculated sum matches the given sum \( \frac{63}{128} \), so \( n = 6 \) is correct.
