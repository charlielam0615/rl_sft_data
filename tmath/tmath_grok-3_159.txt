### Problem Restatement
We need to find a sequence of three real numbers that form an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9. After adding 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, the resulting numbers form a geometric progression. The goal is to determine the smallest possible value for the third term of the resulting geometric progression.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the arithmetic progression with the first term as 9.  
2. Express the second and third terms after the given modifications.  
3. Set up the condition for the modified terms to form a geometric progression.  
4. Solve for the terms that satisfy the geometric progression condition.  
5. Identify the third term of the geometric progression and find its smallest possible value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Define the arithmetic progression and express the modified terms.  
- **How to Achieve:** Assume the arithmetic progression has first term 9 and common difference \( d \). Write the terms, apply the modifications (add 2 to the second term, 20 to the third term), and prepare to set up the geometric progression condition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the arithmetic progression be \( 9, 9 + d, 9 + 2d \), where \( d \) is the common difference.  
After modifications:  
- First term remains \( 9 \).  
- Second term becomes \( (9 + d) + 2 = 9 + d + 2 \).  
- Third term becomes \( (9 + 2d) + 20 = 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d \).  

Thus, the modified sequence is \( 9, 9 + d + 2, 29 + 2d \).  
This sequence must form a geometric progression, where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant:  
\[
\frac{9 + d + 2}{9} = \frac{29 + 2d}{9 + d + 2}
\]
Simplify the left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{9 + d + 2}{9} = \frac{11 + d}{9}
\]
The equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{11 + d}{9} = \frac{29 + 2d}{11 + d}
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the equation from the geometric progression condition to find possible values of \( d \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Cross-multiply the equation \( \frac{11 + d}{9} = \frac{29 + 2d}{11 + d} \), simplify, and solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( d \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with:  
\[
\frac{11 + d}{9} = \frac{29 + 2d}{11 + d}
\]
Cross-multiply:  
\[
(11 + d)(11 + d) = 9 (29 + 2d)
\]
Left-hand side:  
\[
(11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2
\]
Right-hand side:  
\[
9 (29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d
\]
Equate:  
\[
121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d
\]
Move all terms to one side:  
\[
d^2 + 22d - 18d + 121 - 261 = 0
\]
\[
d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1, b = 4, c = -140 \):  
\[
d = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-140)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
d = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 24}{2}
\]
\[
d = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad d = \frac{-28}{2} = -14
\]
So, \( d = 10 \) or \( d = -14 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the geometric progression terms for each value of \( d \) and identify the third term.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( d = 10 \) and \( d = -14 \) into the modified sequence \( 9, 9 + d + 2, 29 + 2d \), and calculate the third term \( 29 + 2d \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Case 1: \( d = 10 \)**  
Modified sequence:  
- First term: \( 9 \)  
- Second term: \( 9 + 10 + 2 = 21 \)  
- Third term: \( 29 + 2 \cdot 10 = 29 + 20 = 49 \)  
Sequence: \( 9, 21, 49 \).  
Verify geometric progression:  
\[
\frac{21}{9} = \frac{7}{3}, \quad \frac{49}{21} = \frac{7}{3}
\]
The sequence \( 9, 21, 49 \) is geometric with common ratio \( \frac{7}{3} \).  
Third term of the geometric progression: \( 49 \).

**Case 2: \( d = -14 \)**  
Modified sequence:  
- First term: \( 9 \)  
- Second term: \( 9 + (-14) + 2 = 9 - 14 + 2 = -3 \)  
- Third term: \( 29 + 2 \cdot (-14) = 29 - 28 = 1 \)  
Sequence: \( 9, -3, 1 \).  
Verify geometric progression:  
\[
\frac{-3}{9} = -\frac{1}{3}, \quad \frac{1}{-3} = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
The sequence \( 9, -3, 1 \) is geometric with common ratio \( -\frac{1}{3} \).  
Third term of the geometric progression: \( 1 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the arithmetic progression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express modified terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve the geometric progression condition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the third term for each solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify the smallest third term (current).  

**Current Goal:** Identify the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression.  
From previous steps:  
- For \( d = 10 \), third term = 49.  
- For \( d = -14 \), third term = 1.  
The third terms are 49 and 1.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the third terms (49 and 1) and select the smallest value, ensuring both solutions are valid.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The third terms of the geometric progressions are:  
- 49 (when \( d = 10 \))  
- 1 (when \( d = -14 \))  

Both sequences satisfy the arithmetic and geometric progression conditions, so both are valid.  
Compare: \( 1 < 49 \).  
Thus, the smallest possible value for the third term is \( 1 \).

**Final Verification:**  
- Arithmetic progression for \( d = -14 \): \( 9, 9 + (-14) = -5, 9 + 2(-14) = -19 \).  
- Modified sequence: \( 9, -5 + 2 = -3, -19 + 20 = 1 \).  
- Geometric progression: \( 9, -3, 1 \) with ratio \( -\frac{1}{3} \), confirmed.  
The solution is consistent.

### Final Answer
The smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is \( \boxed{1} \).
