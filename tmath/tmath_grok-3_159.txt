### Problem Restatement
We need to find a sequence of three real numbers forming an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9. After adding 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, the resulting numbers form a geometric progression. The goal is to determine the smallest possible value for the third term of the resulting geometric progression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Define the arithmetic progression and express its terms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Since the first term is 9, represent the arithmetic progression with a common difference \( d \). The terms are \( 9 \), \( 9 + d \), and \( 9 + 2d \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the arithmetic progression be \( 9 \), \( 9 + d \), \( 9 + 2d \), where \( d \) is the common difference.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the modifications to the second and third terms.  
- **How to Achieve**: Add 2 to the second term (\( 9 + d + 2 \)) and 20 to the third term (\( 9 + 2d + 20 \)).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The modified terms are:  
- First term: \( 9 \) (unchanged).  
- Second term: \( 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d \).  
- Third term: \( 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the condition for the modified terms to form a geometric progression.  
- **How to Achieve**: For numbers \( a, b, c \) to form a geometric progression, the ratio satisfies \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b} \), or equivalently, \( b^2 = a \cdot c \). Apply this to the modified terms \( 9, 11 + d, 29 + 2d \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( 9, 11 + d, 29 + 2d \) to form a geometric progression, we use:  
\[ (11 + d)^2 = 9 \cdot (29 + 2d) \]  
Expand both sides:  
- Left: \( (11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2 \).  
- Right: \( 9 \cdot (29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d \).  
Equate:  
\[ 121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d \]  
Simplify:  
\[ d^2 + 22d - 18d + 121 - 261 = 0 \]  
\[ d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve for the common difference \( d \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Solve the quadratic equation \( d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0 \]  
Using the quadratic formula \( d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1, b = 4, c = -140 \):  
\[ d = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-140)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 24}{2} \]  
\[ d = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad d = \frac{-28}{2} = -14 \]  
So, \( d = 10 \) or \( d = -14 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the third term of the geometric progression for each value of \( d \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( d = 10 \) and \( d = -14 \) into the third term of the geometric progression, \( 29 + 2d \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \( d = 10 \):  
  Third term = \( 29 + 2 \cdot 10 = 29 + 20 = 49 \).  
- For \( d = -14 \):  
  Third term = \( 29 + 2 \cdot (-14) = 29 - 28 = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the modified terms form a geometric progression for both values of \( d \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if \( (11 + d)^2 = 9 \cdot (29 + 2d) \) holds for \( d = 10 \) and \( d = -14 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \( d = 10 \):  
  - Terms: \( 9, 11 + 10 = 21, 29 + 2 \cdot 10 = 49 \).  
  - Check: \( 21^2 = 441 \), and \( 9 \cdot 49 = 441 \). Equal, so valid.  
- For \( d = -14 \):  
  - Terms: \( 9, 11 - 14 = -3, 29 + 2 \cdot (-14) = 1 \).  
  - Check: \( (-3)^2 = 9 \), and \( 9 \cdot 1 = 9 \). Equal, so valid.  
Both solutions satisfy the geometric progression condition.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest third term of the geometric progression.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the arithmetic progression (completed: terms are \( 9, 9 + d, 9 + 2d \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply modifications (completed: terms become \( 9, 11 + d, 29 + 2d \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up geometric progression condition (completed: \( (11 + d)^2 = 9 \cdot (29 + 2d) \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for \( d \) (completed: \( d = 10, -14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate third term (completed: 49 for \( d = 10 \), 1 for \( d = -14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 6: Verify solutions (completed: both valid).  
  - Subgoal 7: Identify smallest third term (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the smallest third term.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compare the third terms calculated for \( d = 10 \) and \( d = -14 \), and select the smaller value. Consider if other solutions exist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The third terms are:  
- For \( d = 10 \): 49.  
- For \( d = -14 \): 1.  
Comparing, \( 1 < 49 \), so the smallest value is 1.  
To ensure completeness, note that the quadratic equation \( d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0 \) has only two real roots (\( d = 10, -14 \)), and no other values of \( d \) satisfy the geometric progression condition. Thus, no other third terms are possible.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is **1**.
