**Problem Restatement**: Given that \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution to the equation \( 56x^2 + 27 = 89x - 8 \), find the other value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation, expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the other solution into subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
2. Use the given solution \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) to find the quadratic's factors or apply the quadratic formula.  
3. Identify the other solution and express it as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form. Achieve this by moving all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 56x^2 + 27 = 89x - 8 \]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ 56x^2 + 27 - 89x + 8 = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard form: \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution to the quadratic equation \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \). Achieve this by substituting \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) into the equation and checking if it equals zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) into \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \):  
- Compute \( x^2 \):  
  \[ \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{49} \]  
- Compute \( 56x^2 \):  
  \[ 56 \cdot \frac{25}{49} = \frac{56 \cdot 25}{49} = \frac{1400}{49} = \frac{200}{7} \]  
- Compute \( -89x \):  
  \[ -89 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{-445}{7} \]  
- Compute the expression:  
  \[ 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = \frac{200}{7} - \frac{445}{7} + 35 = \frac{200 - 445 + 245}{7} = \frac{0}{7} = 0 \]  
Since the equation holds, \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a valid solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the other value of \( x \) that solves \( 56x^2 + 27 = 89x - 8 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (completed: \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the given solution \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the other solution using the quadratic equation or factoring.  
**Current Goal**: Find the other solution to the quadratic equation \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the other solution to \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \). Achieve this by applying the quadratic formula, since \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is one root, and the quadratic formula will provide both roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the quadratic formula is:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Identify coefficients: \( a = 56 \), \( b = -89 \), \( c = 35 \).  
- Compute the discriminant:  
  \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-89)^2 - 4 \cdot 56 \cdot 35 = 7921 - 7840 = 81 \]  
- Apply the quadratic formula:  
  \[ x = \frac{-(-89) \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 56} = \frac{89 \pm 9}{112} \]  
- First solution:  
  \[ x = \frac{89 + 9}{112} = \frac{98}{112} = \frac{7}{8} \]  
- Second solution:  
  \[ x = \frac{89 - 9}{112} = \frac{80}{112} = \frac{5}{7} \]  
Since \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is the given solution, the other solution is \( x = \frac{7}{8} \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) is a solution to \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \). Achieve this by substituting \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) into the equation and checking if it equals zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{7}{8} \):  
- Compute \( x^2 \):  
  \[ \left( \frac{7}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{49}{64} \]  
- Compute \( 56x^2 \):  
  \[ 56 \cdot \frac{49}{64} = \frac{56 \cdot 49}{64} = \frac{2744}{64} = \frac{343}{8} \]  
- Compute \( -89x \):  
  \[ -89 \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{-623}{8} \]  
- Compute the expression:  
  \[ 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = \frac{343}{8} - \frac{623}{8} + 35 = \frac{343 - 623 + 280}{8} = \frac{0}{8} = 0 \]  
Since the equation holds, \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) is a valid solution.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The other value of \( x \) that solves the equation is \( \frac{7}{8} \).
