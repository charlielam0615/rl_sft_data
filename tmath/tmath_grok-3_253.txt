[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other value of \( x \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)).  
2. Verify that \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution.  
3. Use the fact that the equation is quadratic to find the second root using either factoring, the quadratic formula, or the sum and product of roots.  
4. Express the second root as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form and verify \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side to form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), then substitute \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) to confirm it satisfies the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation \( 56x^2 + 27 = 89x - 8 \):  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ 56x^2 + 27 - 89x + 8 = 0 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \]  

Verify \( x = \frac{5}{7} \):  
Substitute \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) into \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \):  
- Compute \( 56x^2 = 56 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^2 = 56 \cdot \frac{25}{49} = \frac{1400}{49} = \frac{200}{7} \).  
- Compute \( -89x = -89 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = -\frac{445}{7} \).  
- Constant term: \( +35 = \frac{245}{7} \).  
- Sum: \( \frac{200}{7} - \frac{445}{7} + \frac{245}{7} = \frac{200 - 445 + 245}{7} = \frac{0}{7} = 0 \).  

Since the equation holds, \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the other value of \( x \) that solves \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \), given \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is one solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed: \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify \( x = \frac{5}{7} \) is a solution (completed: verified).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the second root using an appropriate method.  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the second root as a common fraction.  

**Current Goal**: Find the second root of the quadratic equation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find the second root of the quadratic equation \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since one root is \( x = \frac{5}{7} \), use the sum and product of roots for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). The sum of roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \), and the product is \( \frac{c}{a} \). Compute the second root using the sum of roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 56 \), \( b = -89 \), \( c = 35 \).  
- Sum of roots: \( x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-89}{56} = \frac{89}{56} \).  
- Given \( x_1 = \frac{5}{7} \), find \( x_2 \):  
  \[ x_2 = \frac{89}{56} - \frac{5}{7} \]  
- Common denominator is 56:  
  \[ \frac{5}{7} = \frac{5 \cdot 8}{7 \cdot 8} = \frac{40}{56} \]  
  \[ x_2 = \frac{89}{56} - \frac{40}{56} = \frac{89 - 40}{56} = \frac{49}{56} \]  
- Simplify: \( \frac{49}{56} = \frac{49 \div 7}{56 \div 7} = \frac{7}{8} \).  

Thus, the second root is \( x = \frac{7}{8} \).

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) is a solution to \( 56x^2 - 89x + 35 = 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) into the equation and check if it equals zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{7}{8} \):  
- Compute \( 56x^2 = 56 \cdot \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^2 = 56 \cdot \frac{49}{64} = \frac{56 \cdot 49}{64} = \frac{2744}{64} = \frac{343}{8} \).  
- Compute \( -89x = -89 \cdot \frac{7}{8} = -\frac{623}{8} \).  
- Constant term: \( +35 = \frac{280}{8} \).  
- Sum: \( \frac{343}{8} - \frac{623}{8} + \frac{280}{8} = \frac{343 - 623 + 280}{8} = \frac{0}{8} = 0 \).  

Since the equation holds, \( x = \frac{7}{8} \) is a valid solution.
