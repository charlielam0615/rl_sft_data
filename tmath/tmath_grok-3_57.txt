**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the sum of the x-coordinates of all points where the function \( y = f(x) \), represented by a piecewise linear graph consisting of five line segments, equals 1.8. The graph is defined by the points \((-4, -5)\), \((-2, -1)\), \((-1, -2)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((4, 5)\), with grid lines spaced 1 unit apart.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the line segments of the graph.  
**How to Achieve**: Extract the line segments from the Asymptote code, which connects the points \((-4, -5)\), \((-2, -1)\), \((-1, -2)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((4, 5)\).  

[IMP]  
The Asymptote code specifies the graph as a sequence of line segments:  
- Segment 1: From \((-4, -5)\) to \((-2, -1)\).  
- Segment 2: From \((-2, -1)\) to \((-1, -2)\).  
- Segment 3: From \((-1, -2)\) to \((1, 2)\).  
- Segment 4: From \((1, 2)\) to \((2, 1)\).  
- Segment 5: From \((2, 1)\) to \((4, 5)\).  
These segments define the piecewise linear function \( f(x) \).

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the equation of each line segment.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the slope and equation of each line segment using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( m \) is the slope between two points.  

[IMP]  
For each segment, compute the slope and derive the equation:  

- **Segment 1**: \((-4, -5)\) to \((-2, -1)\).  
  Slope: \( m = \frac{-1 - (-5)}{-2 - (-4)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).  
  Equation: \( y - (-5) = 2(x - (-4)) \implies y + 5 = 2(x + 4) \implies y = 2x + 3 \).  
  Domain: \( x \in [-4, -2] \).  

- **Segment 2**: \((-2, -1)\) to \((-1, -2)\).  
  Slope: \( m = \frac{-2 - (-1)}{-1 - (-2)} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1 \).  
  Equation: \( y - (-1) = -1(x - (-2)) \implies y + 1 = -(x + 2) \implies y = -x - 3 \).  
  Domain: \( x \in [-2, -1] \).  

- **Segment 3**: \((-1, -2)\) to \((1, 2)\).  
  Slope: \( m = \frac{2 - (-2)}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).  
  Equation: \( y - (-2) = 2(x - (-1)) \implies y + 2 = 2(x + 1) \implies y = 2x \).  
  Domain: \( x \in [-1, 1] \).  

- **Segment 4**: \((1, 2)\) to \((2, 1)\).  
  Slope: \( m = \frac{1 - 2}{2 - 1} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1 \).  
  Equation: \( y - 2 = -1(x - 1) \implies y = -x + 3 \).  
  Domain: \( x \in [1, 2] \).  

- **Segment 5**: \((2, 1)\) to \((4, 5)\).  
  Slope: \( m = \frac{5 - 1}{4 - 2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).  
  Equation: \( y - 1 = 2(x - 2) \implies y = 2x - 3 \).  
  Domain: \( x \in [2, 4] \).  

Thus, the function is:  
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x + 3 & \text{if } -4 \leq x \leq -2, \\ 
-x - 3 & \text{if } -2 < x \leq -1, \\ 
2x & \text{if } -1 < x \leq 1, \\ 
-x + 3 & \text{if } 1 < x \leq 2, \\ 
2x - 3 & \text{if } 2 < x \leq 4.
\end{cases} \]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the x-coordinates where \( f(x) = 1.8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve \( f(x) = 1.8 \) for each segment by setting the segment equation equal to 1.8 and checking if the solution lies within the segment’s domain.  

[IMP]  
Solve for \( x \) where \( f(x) = 1.8 \):  

- **Segment 1**: \( y = 2x + 3 \), \( x \in [-4, -2] \).  
  \( 2x + 3 = 1.8 \implies 2x = -1.2 \implies x = -0.6 \).  
  Check: \( -0.6 \notin [-4, -2] \). No solution.  

- **Segment 2**: \( y = -x - 3 \), \( x \in [-2, -1] \).  
  \( -x - 3 = 1.8 \implies -x = 4.8 \implies x = -4.8 \).  
  Check: \( -4.8 \notin [-2, -1] \). No solution.  

- **Segment 3**: \( y = 2x \), \( x \in [-1, 1] \).  
  \( 2x = 1.8 \implies x = 0.9 \).  
  Check: \( 0.9 \in [-1, 1] \). Solution: \( x = 0.9 \).  

- **Segment 4**: \( y = -x + 3 \), \( x \in [1, 2] \).  
  \( -x + 3 = 1.8 \implies -x = -1.2 \implies x = 1.2 \).  
  Check: \( 1.2 \in [1, 2] \). Solution: \( x = 1.2 \).  

- **Segment 5**: \( y = 2x - 3 \), \( x \in [2, 4] \).  
  \( 2x - 3 = 1.8 \implies 2x = 4.8 \implies x = 2.4 \).  
  Check: \( 2.4 \in [2, 4] \). Solution: \( x = 2.4 \).  

The x-coordinates where \( f(x) = 1.8 \) are \( x = 0.9 \), \( x = 1.2 \), and \( x = 2.4 \).

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the x-coordinates where \( f(x) = 1.8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 0.9 \), \( 1.2 \), and \( 2.4 \) to confirm \( f(x) = 1.8 \), and ensure no other solutions exist by checking segment endpoints and continuity.  

[IMP]  
Verify:  
- At \( x = 0.9 \), Segment 3: \( y = 2x = 2 \cdot 0.9 = 1.8 \). Correct.  
- At \( x = 1.2 \), Segment 4: \( y = -x + 3 = -1.2 + 3 = 1.8 \). Correct.  
- At \( x = 2.4 \), Segment 5: \( y = 2x - 3 = 2 \cdot 2.4 - 3 = 4.8 - 3 = 1.8 \). Correct.  

Check endpoints for continuity (since \( f(x) \) is piecewise linear and continuous at segment boundaries):  
- At \( x = -2 \): Segment 1: \( y = 2(-2) + 3 = -1 \). Segment 2: \( y = -(-2) - 3 = -1 \). Continuous.  
- At \( x = -1 \): Segment 2: \( y = -(-1) - 3 = -2 \). Segment 3: \( y = 2(-1) = -2 \). Continuous.  
- At \( x = 1 \): Segment 3: \( y = 2(1) = 2 \). Segment 4: \( y = -1 + 3 = 2 \). Continuous.  
- At \( x = 2 \): Segment 4: \( y = -2 + 3 = 1 \). Segment 5: \( y = 2(2) - 3 = 1 \). Continuous.  

Evaluate \( f(x) \) at endpoints to ensure no additional solutions:  
- \( x = -4 \): \( y = 2(-4) + 3 = -5 \).  
- \( x = -2 \): \( y = -1 \).  
- \( x = -1 \): \( y = -2 \).  
- \( x = 1 \): \( y = 2 \).  
- \( x = 2 \): \( y = 1 \).  
- \( x = 4 \): \( y = 2(4) - 3 = 5 \).  

Since \( y = 1.8 \) lies between the y-values of segments 3, 4, and 5, and we’ve checked all segments, no other solutions exist.

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the x-coordinates where \( f(x) = 1.8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Add the valid x-coordinates: \( 0.9 \), \( 1.2 \), and \( 2.4 \).  

[IMP]  
Sum: \( 0.9 + 1.2 + 2.4 = 4.5 \).
