Goal of this step: Determine the coordinates of point $ B $ using the given slope and point $ A $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The slope of a line between two points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ is given by the formula:  

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

Given point $ A = (0, 0) $, point $ B = (x, y) $, and the slope $ \frac{2}{3} $, we can substitute these into the formula:  

$$
\frac{y - 0}{x - 0} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

Simplify:  

$$
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

This equation implies that $ y = \frac{2}{3}x $.  

Additionally, point $ B $ lies on the line $ y = 4 $. Substituting $ y = 4 $ into the equation $ y = \frac{2}{3}x $, we get:  

$$
4 = \frac{2}{3}x
$$

Solving for $ x $:  

$$
x = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
$$

Therefore, point $ B $ has coordinates $ (6, 4) $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the coordinates of point B and the sum calculation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Slope calculation verification**:
   - Given points A(0,0) and B(x,4), the slope formula is (4-0)/(x-0) = 4/x.
   - The problem states this slope equals 2/3. Thus, 4/x = 2/3.
   - Solving for x: Cross-multiplying gives 2x = 12 â‡’ x = 6. This confirms B(6,4).

2. **Line constraint verification**:
   - Point B(6,4) satisfies y = 4, as required.

3. **Sum calculation verification**:
   - x + y = 6 + 4 = 10. This is an arithmetic check with no errors.

All steps are consistent with the problem constraints and mathematical rules. No contradictions or errors detected.
