**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( n \) in the equation \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n = 81^4 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( n \).  
1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining the terms.  
2. Express both sides of the equation with the same base to compare exponents.  
3. Set up an equation based on the exponents.  
4. Solve the resulting equation for \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the left-hand side of the equation \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \). This can be achieved by using the property of exponents, where multiplying terms with the same base adds the exponents.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The left-hand side is \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \). Since there are four terms, we can combine them:  
\[ 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n = 9^{n + n + n + n} = 9^{4n} \].  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 9^{4n} = 81^4 \].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express both sides of the equation \( 9^{4n} = 81^4 \) with the same base. Since \( 9 = 3^2 \) and \( 81 = 3^4 \), rewrite both sides in terms of base 3 to compare exponents.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( 9^{4n} \):  
\[ 9 = 3^2 \implies 9^{4n} = (3^2)^{4n} = 3^{2 \cdot 4n} = 3^{8n} \].  
Rewrite \( 81^4 \):  
\[ 81 = 3^4 \implies 81^4 = (3^4)^4 = 3^{4 \cdot 4} = 3^{16} \].  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 3^{8n} = 3^{16} \].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 3^{8n} = 3^{16} \) for \( n \). Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents and solve the resulting linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 3^{8n} = 3^{16} \), and the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents:  
\[ 8n = 16 \].  
Solve for \( n \):  
\[ n = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \].  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( n = 2 \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 2 \) into the left-hand side:  
\[ 9^2 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 9^2 = (9^2)^4 = 81^4 \].  
The right-hand side is \( 81^4 \).  
Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, the solution \( n = 2 \) is correct.  
Alternatively, check using the simplified equation \( 9^{4n} = 81^4 \):  
\[ 9^{4 \cdot 2} = 9^8 = (3^2)^8 = 3^{16} \], and \( 81^4 = (3^4)^4 = 3^{16} \].  
Both sides match, confirming the solution.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( n \) in \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n = 81^4 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the left-hand side (completed: \( 9^{4n} \)).

  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( n \) (completed: \( n = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: \( n = 2 \) satisfies the equation).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the problem is solved.
