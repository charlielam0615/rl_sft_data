**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the property of exponents that states \( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \) to combine the four \( 9^n \) terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The left-hand side is \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \). Since there are four identical terms, apply the exponent rule:  
\[ 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n = 9^{n+n+n+n} = 9^{4n} \].  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 9^{4n} = 81^4 \].

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express both sides of the equation \( 9^{4n} = 81^4 \) with the same base.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite 9 and 81 as powers of 3, since \( 9 = 3^2 \) and \( 81 = 3^4 \), then simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the bases:  
- Left-hand side: \( 9^{4n} = (3^2)^{4n} = 3^{2 \cdot 4n} = 3^{8n} \).  
- Right-hand side: \( 81^4 = (3^4)^4 = 3^{4 \cdot 4} = 3^{16} \).  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 3^{8n} = 3^{16} \].  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 8n = 16 \].  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( 8n = 16 \) for \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve for \( n \):  
\[ 8n = 16 \]  
\[ n = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \].  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( n = 2 \) by substituting back into the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 2 \) into \( 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \cdot 9^n \) and check if it equals \( 81^4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 2 \):  
Left-hand side: \( 9^2 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 9^2 = 81 \cdot 81 \cdot 81 \cdot 81 = 81^4 \).  
Right-hand side: \( 81^4 \).  
Since \( 81^4 = 81^4 \), the solution is correct.
