**Problem Statement**: Find the positive real number \( x \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \)), and express \( x \) as a decimal.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the positive real number \( x \).  
1. Understand the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is an integer \( n \) such that \( n \leq x < n+1 \).  
2. Rewrite the equation using \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), so \( n \cdot x = 70 \), implying \( x = \frac{70}{n} \).  
3. Ensure \( x \) lies within the interval \( n \leq x < n+1 \).  
4. Identify constraints: \( n \) is a positive integer (since \( x \) is positive), and solve for \( x \) as a decimal.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( x \) using the equation \( x = \frac{70}{n} \), where \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), and ensure \( n \leq x < n+1 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = \frac{70}{n} \) into the inequality \( n \leq \frac{70}{n} < n+1 \), solving for possible integer values of \( n \), and computing the corresponding \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( \lfloor x \rfloor = n \), the equation becomes \( n \cdot x = 70 \), so \( x = \frac{70}{n} \). Since \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), we need \( n \leq x < n+1 \). Substituting \( x = \frac{70}{n} \), we get:  
\[ n \leq \frac{70}{n} < n+1 \]  
This gives two inequalities:  
1. \( n \leq \frac{70}{n} \)  
2. \( \frac{70}{n} < n+1 \)  

**Solve the first inequality**:  
\[ n \leq \frac{70}{n} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( n \) (since \( n > 0 \)):  
\[ n^2 \leq 70 \]  
\[ n \leq \sqrt{70} \approx 8.366 \]  
Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( n \leq 8 \). Thus, possible values for \( n \) are \( \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 8\} \).  

**Solve the second inequality**:  
\[ \frac{70}{n} < n+1 \]  
Multiply both sides by \( n \):  
\[ 70 < n(n+1) \]  
Test integer values from 1 to 8:  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( n(n+1) = 1 \cdot 2 = 2 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( n(n+1) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( n(n+1) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 4 \): \( n(n+1) = 4 \cdot 5 = 20 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 5 \): \( n(n+1) = 5 \cdot 6 = 30 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 6 \): \( n(n+1) = 6 \cdot 7 = 42 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 7 \): \( n(n+1) = 7 \cdot 8 = 56 < 70 \) (does not satisfy).  
- For \( n = 8 \): \( n(n+1) = 8 \cdot 9 = 72 > 70 \) (satisfies).  

Thus, \( n = 8 \) satisfies the second inequality. Now, check if \( n = 8 \) satisfies the first inequality:  
\[ n \leq \frac{70}{n} \]  
\[ 8 \leq \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \] (True).  

Compute \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \]  
Verify \( \lfloor x \rfloor \):  
\[ \lfloor 8.75 \rfloor = 8 \]  
Check the original equation:  
\[ \lfloor 8.75 \rfloor \cdot 8.75 = 8 \cdot 8.75 = 70 \] (Satisfies).  

Test \( n = 9 \):  
\[ x = \frac{70}{9} \approx 7.7778 \]  
\[ \lfloor 7.7778 \rfloor = 7 \]  
\[ 7 \cdot 7.7778 \approx 54.4444 \neq 70 \] (Does not satisfy).  
Also, check the second inequality:  
\[ 70 < 9 \cdot 10 = 90 \] (True).  
First inequality:  
\[ 9 \leq \frac{70}{9} \approx 7.7778 \] (False).  

Thus, \( n = 9 \) does not work. Higher \( n \) values yield smaller \( x \), making \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) even smaller, so no other solutions exist.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 8.75 \) by ensuring it satisfies both the original equation and the floor function constraints, and confirm no other solutions exist by rechecking the constraints for other possible \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-verify \( x = 8.75 \):  
- \( \lfloor 8.75 \rfloor = 8 \).  
- \( 8 \cdot 8.75 = 70 \), which satisfies the equation.  
- Check constraints: \( n = 8 \), \( x = \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \).  
- \( 8 \leq 8.75 < 9 \), which holds.  

Recheck other \( n \):  
- For \( n = 7 \): \( x = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \), \( \lfloor 10 \rfloor = 10 \), \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \neq 70 \).  
- For \( n = 6 \): \( x = \frac{70}{6} \approx 11.6667 \), \( \lfloor 11.6667 \rfloor = 11 \), \( 11 \cdot 11.6667 \approx 128.3334 \neq 70 \).  
- Lower \( n \) values were already tested and failed the second inequality.  

No other \( n \) satisfies both constraints and the equation. Thus, \( x = 8.75 \) is the only solution.
