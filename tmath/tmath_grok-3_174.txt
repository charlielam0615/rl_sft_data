**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a positive real number \( x \) such that the product of its floor value \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) and \( x \) equals 70. The result should be expressed as a decimal.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to identify the value of \( x \). First, I will determine possible integer values for \( \lfloor x \rfloor \), since it's the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Then, for each possible integer value of \( \lfloor x \rfloor \), I will solve for \( x \) using the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \). Finally, I will check which solution fits the condition that \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is indeed the floor of the computed \( x \).

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify possible integer values for \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) and solve for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Since \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is an integer and \( x \) is positive, I will consider positive integers for \( \lfloor x \rfloor \). For each integer \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), I can write \( x = \frac{70}{n} \). Then, I will verify if \( n \leq x < n+1 \), which ensures \( n \) is the floor of \( x \).

[IMP]  
I will start by testing positive integers for \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \). Since \( x = \frac{70}{n} \), and \( x \) must satisfy \( n \leq x < n+1 \), this translates to \( n \leq \frac{70}{n} < n+1 \). I will multiply through by \( n \) (since \( n > 0 \)) to get \( n^2 \leq 70 < n(n+1) \).  

- For \( n = 8 \): \( n^2 = 64 \leq 70 \), and \( n(n+1) = 8 \cdot 9 = 72 > 70 \). So, \( 64 \leq 70 < 72 \), which holds. Compute \( x = \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \). Check if \( 8 \leq 8.75 < 9 \), which is true. Thus, \( n = 8 \) and \( x = 8.75 \) is a potential solution.  
- For \( n = 9 \): \( n^2 = 81 > 70 \), which does not satisfy \( n^2 \leq 70 \), so this is invalid.  
- For \( n = 7 \): \( n^2 = 49 \leq 70 \), and \( n(n+1) = 7 \cdot 8 = 56 < 70 \), which does not satisfy \( 70 < 56 \), so invalid.  
- For smaller \( n \), \( n^2 \) will be even smaller, and \( n(n+1) \) will be less than 70, so they won't work.  

Thus, \( n = 8 \) with \( x = 8.75 \) is the only solution so far.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify if \( x = 8.75 \) satisfies the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 8.75 \) into the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \) and check if it holds true.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \( x = 8.75 \), compute \( \lfloor x \rfloor = 8 \). Then, \( 8 \cdot 8.75 = 70 \), which matches the given condition. Therefore, \( x = 8.75 \) is indeed a solution.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the positive real number \( x \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine possible integer values for \( \lfloor x \rfloor \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) using \( x = \frac{70}{\lfloor x \rfloor} \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking the floor condition and equation.  

Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved with \( x = 8.75 \), and validation is complete.

**Final Answer**: The positive real number \( x \) that satisfies \( \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot x = 70 \) is \( 8.75 \).
