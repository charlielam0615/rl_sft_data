### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the minimum value of the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \), we can break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the method to find the minimum of a quadratic function (e.g., vertex formula, completing the square, or calculus).
2. Apply the chosen method to compute the value of \( x \) that gives the minimum.
3. Verify the result to ensure it is the minimum.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the method to find the minimum of the quadratic function.
How to Achieve: Since \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient (1), the minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). We will use this formula to find the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex.

[IMP]
For the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \), identify the coefficients:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 11 \)
- \( c = -5 \)

The x-coordinate of the vertex is:
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{11}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{11}{2} = -5.5 \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) that gives the minimum is \( x = -5.5 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = -5.5 \) gives the minimum value.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -5.5 \) into the function to compute the minimum value and check if values around \( x = -5.5 \) yield higher function values, confirming a minimum. Alternatively, confirm the parabola opens upward (since \( a > 0 \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, confirm the parabola opens upward:
- Since \( a = 1 > 0 \), the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is a parabola opening upward, so the vertex is indeed the minimum.

Next, compute \( f(-5.5) \):
\[ f(-5.5) = (-5.5)^2 + 11(-5.5) - 5 \]
\[ = 30.25 - 60.5 - 5 \]
\[ = 30.25 - 65.5 = -35.25 \]

Now, test values around \( x = -5.5 \), e.g., \( x = -5 \) and \( x = -6 \):
- For \( x = -5 \):
\[ f(-5) = (-5)^2 + 11(-5) - 5 = 25 - 55 - 5 = -35 \]
- For \( x = -6 \):
\[ f(-6) = (-6)^2 + 11(-6) - 5 = 36 - 66 - 5 = -35 \]

Since \( f(-5) = -35 \) and \( f(-6) = -35 \) are both greater than \( f(-5.5) = -35.25 \), and the parabola opens upward, \( x = -5.5 \) gives the minimum.

Alternatively, we can use the second derivative test (calculus approach):
- First derivative: \( f'(x) = 2x + 11 \)
- Set \( f'(x) = 0 \): \( 2x + 11 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{11}{2} = -5.5 \)
- Second derivative: \( f''(x) = 2 > 0 \), indicating a local minimum at \( x = -5.5 \).

Both methods confirm \( x = -5.5 \) is the minimum.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the method to find the minimum (completed: chose vertex formula).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the method to compute \( x \) (completed: found \( x = -5.5 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed: confirmed minimum using function values and second derivative test).

Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, as we have determined that \( x = -5.5 \) minimizes the function.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) that gives the minimum value for \( x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is \( x = -5.5 \).
