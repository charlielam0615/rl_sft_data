**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the minimum value of the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of function and its properties.  
2. Determine the method to find the minimum point (e.g., vertex of a parabola).  
3. Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex.  
4. Verify the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of function and its properties. Since \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is a quadratic function, it forms a parabola. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (1), so the parabola opens upward, indicating a minimum at the vertex.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 11 \), and \( c = -5 \). Since \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, and the minimum value occurs at the vertex.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex. For a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). We will compute this using the coefficients \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 11 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 11 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{11}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{11}{2} = -5.5 \]  
Thus, the value of \( x \) that minimizes the function is \( x = -5.5 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = -5.5 \) gives the minimum value. We can validate by computing the function value at \( x = -5.5 \) and checking nearby points or using the second derivative to confirm a minimum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, first compute \( f(x) \) at \( x = -5.5 \):  
\[ f(-5.5) = (-5.5)^2 + 11(-5.5) - 5 = 30.25 - 60.5 - 5 = -35.25 \]  
Next, test nearby points, e.g., \( x = -5 \) and \( x = -6 \):  
- For \( x = -5 \):  
  \[ f(-5) = (-5)^2 + 11(-5) - 5 = 25 - 55 - 5 = -35 \]  
- For \( x = -6 \):  
  \[ f(-6) = (-6)^2 + 11(-6) - 5 = 36 - 66 - 5 = -35 \]  
Since \( f(-5.5) = -35.25 < -35 = f(-5) = f(-6) \), the value at \( x = -5.5 \) is lower.  
Alternatively, the second derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is:  
\[ f''(x) = 2 \]  
Since \( f''(x) = 2 > 0 \), the function is concave up at \( x = -5.5 \), confirming a minimum.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the function type (completed: quadratic, opens upward).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the method to find the minimum (completed: vertex formula).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex (completed: \( x = -5.5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed: confirmed minimum at \( x = -5.5 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) that gives the minimum value for \( x^2 + 11x - 5 \) is \( x = -5.5 \).
