### Problem Statement
We need to find the smallest possible value of \( d \) such that the point \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) is \( 3d \) units away from the origin \( (0, 0) \). The distance from a point \( (x, y) \) to the origin is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Thus, the distance from \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) to the origin is \( \sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2} \), and this must equal \( 3d \). Since distance is non-negative, we interpret \( 3d \) as the distance, implying \( 3d \geq 0 \), so \( d \geq 0 \). Our goal is to solve for \( d \) and identify the smallest possible value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the distance equation. We will use the distance formula to express that the point \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) is \( 3d \) units from the origin, then solve for \( d \).

Using the distance formula, the distance from \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) to \( (0, 0) \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2} = 3d
\]
Since \( 3d \) represents distance, and distance is non-negative, we assume \( 3d \geq 0 \), so \( d \geq 0 \). Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
(3\sqrt{5})^2 = 9 \cdot 5 = 45
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{45 + (d+3)^2} = 3d
\]
To eliminate the square root, square both sides:
\[
45 + (d+3)^2 = (3d)^2
\]
Expand both sides:
\[
(d+3)^2 = d^2 + 6d + 9
\]
\[
(3d)^2 = 9d^2
\]
So the equation is:
\[
45 + d^2 + 6d + 9 = 9d^2
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
d^2 + 6d + 54 = 9d^2
\]
Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[
d^2 + 6d + 54 - 9d^2 = 0
\]
\[
-8d^2 + 6d + 54 = 0
\]
Multiply through by \(-1\) for simplicity:
\[
8d^2 - 6d - 54 = 0
\]
Divide by 2 to simplify:
\[
4d^2 - 3d - 27 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \( d \). Solve using the quadratic formula \( d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = -3 \), \( c = -27 \):
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-27) = 9 + 432 = 441
\]
\[
\sqrt{441} = 21
\]
\[
d = \frac{3 \pm 21}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{3 \pm 21}{8}
\]
Calculate the two solutions:
\[
d_1 = \frac{3 + 21}{8} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
\]
\[
d_2 = \frac{3 - 21}{8} = \frac{-18}{8} = -\frac{9}{4}
\]
The possible values of \( d \) are \( d = 3 \) and \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \). Since \( d \geq 0 \) (as \( 3d \geq 0 \)), we discard \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \). Thus, \( d = 3 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( d = 3 \) satisfies the distance condition and check if other values of \( d \geq 0 \) could yield a smaller valid solution. We will substitute \( d = 3 \) back into the distance equation and consider the nature of the quadratic to confirm the smallest \( d \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( d = 3 \):
\[
x = 3\sqrt{5}, \quad y = d + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
\]
Distance from \( (3\sqrt{5}, 6) \) to \( (0, 0) \):
\[
\sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{45 + 36} = \sqrt{81} = 9
\]
Check if this equals \( 3d \):
\[
3d = 3 \cdot 3 = 9
\]
The equation holds, so \( d = 3 \) is valid. To ensure it’s the smallest, note that the quadratic \( 4d^2 - 3d - 27 = 0 \) has only two roots, and \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \) is negative, hence invalid. For \( d \geq 0 \), test if smaller positive \( d \) (e.g., \( d = 2 \)) works:
\[
y = 2 + 3 = 5, \quad 3d = 3 \cdot 2 = 6
\]
\[
\sqrt{45 + 5^2} = \sqrt{45 + 25} = \sqrt{70} \approx 8.367 \neq 6
\]
Since \( \sqrt{70} > 6 \), smaller \( d \) values increase the left-hand side relative to \( 3d \). The quadratic’s parabola opens upward (\( a = 4 > 0 \)), and \( d = 3 \) is the positive root. Testing larger \( d \) (e.g., \( d = 4 \)) yields a larger distance mismatch, confirming \( d = 3 \) as the smallest positive solution.
