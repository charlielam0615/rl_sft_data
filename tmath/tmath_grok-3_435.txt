### Problem Statement
We need to find the smallest possible value of \( d \) such that the point \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) is \( 3d \) units away from the origin \( (0, 0) \). The distance from a point \( (x, y) \) to the origin is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), so we set up the equation based on the given distance and solve for \( d \), seeking the smallest positive value.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:
1. Formulate the distance equation using the coordinates \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) and the distance \( 3d \).
2. Simplify the equation to isolate terms involving \( d \).
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( d \).
4. Determine the smallest possible value of \( d \) by analyzing the solutions, considering constraints like \( d > 0 \) since distance is positive.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to formulate the distance equation. Achieve this by applying the distance formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \text{distance} \) with coordinates \( x = 3\sqrt{5} \), \( y = d+3 \), and distance \( 3d \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the distance formula, the distance from \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) to \( (0, 0) \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2} = 3d
\]
Since \( 3d \) represents distance, assume \( 3d > 0 \), so \( d > 0 \). Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[
(3\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2 = (3d)^2
\]
Calculate each term:
- \( (3\sqrt{5})^2 = 9 \cdot 5 = 45 \)
- \( (d+3)^2 = d^2 + 6d + 9 \)
- \( (3d)^2 = 9d^2 \)

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
45 + d^2 + 6d + 9 = 9d^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
d^2 + 6d + 54 = 9d^2
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to simplify and solve the equation \( d^2 + 6d + 54 = 9d^2 \) for \( d \). Achieve this by rearranging terms to form a quadratic equation and solving it using the quadratic formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rearrange the equation:
\[
d^2 + 6d + 54 - 9d^2 = 0
\]
\[
-8d^2 + 6d + 54 = 0
\]
Multiply by \(-1\) for standard form:
\[
8d^2 - 6d - 54 = 0
\]
Divide by 2 to simplify:
\[
4d^2 - 3d - 27 = 0
\]
Solve using the quadratic formula \( d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = -3 \), \( c = -27 \):
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-27) = 9 + 432 = 441 \)
- \( \sqrt{441} = 21 \)
- \( d = \frac{-(-3) \pm 21}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{3 \pm 21}{8} \)

Calculate solutions:
- \( d = \frac{3 + 21}{8} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \)
- \( d = \frac{3 - 21}{8} = \frac{-18}{8} = -\frac{9}{4} \)
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the solutions \( d = 3 \) and \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \). Achieve this by checking if both satisfy the original distance equation and considering the constraint \( d > 0 \) since \( 3d \) is a distance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Check \( d = 3 \):**
- Point: \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) = (3\sqrt{5}, 3+3) = (3\sqrt{5}, 6) \)
- Distance: \( 3d = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \)
- Calculate: \( \sqrt{(3\sqrt{5})^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{45 + 36} = \sqrt{81} = 9 \)
- Matches, so \( d = 3 \) is valid.

**Check \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \):**
- Point: \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) = (3\sqrt{5}, -\frac{9}{4} + 3) = (3\sqrt{5}, -\frac{9}{4} + \frac{12}{4}) = (3\sqrt{5}, \frac{3}{4}) \)
- Distance: \( 3d = 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{9}{4}\right) = -\frac{27}{4} \)
- Since distance cannot be negative, \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \) is invalid.

Thus, \( d = 3 \) is the only valid solution given \( d > 0 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the smallest possible value of \( d \) such that the point \( (3\sqrt{5}, d+3) \) is \( 3d \) units from the origin.
  - Subgoal 1: Formulate the distance equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( d \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions and identify the smallest \( d \) (completed).

Current goal: Conclude by identifying the smallest valid \( d \).
Based on validation, \( d = 3 \) is valid, and \( d = -\frac{9}{4} \) is not. Since \( d = 3 \) is the only positive solution, it is the smallest possible value.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The smallest possible value of \( d \) is \( 3 \).
