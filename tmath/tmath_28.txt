Goal of this step: Subtract the simplified values from step 1 and step 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From step 1, we found that $16^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4$.  
From step 2, we found that $625^{\frac{1}{2}} = 25$.  

Now, subtract the values:  

$$
4 - 25 = -21
$$

Scope of this verification: All steps in simplifying $16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}}$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Step 1: Simplify $16^{\frac{1}{2}}$**  
   - $16^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4$ is correct because $4^2 = 16$.  
2. **Step 2: Simplify $625^{\frac{1}{2}}$**  
   - $625^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{625} = 25$ is correct because $25^2 = 625$.  
3. **Step 3: Subtraction**  
   - $4 - 25 = -21$ follows standard arithmetic rules.  
4. **Final Result**  
   - The intermediate steps are logically consistent, and no errors are detected in the calculations.  
Conclusion: The reasoning and computations are valid.
