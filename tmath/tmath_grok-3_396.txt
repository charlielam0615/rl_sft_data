**Problem Restatement**:  
We need to determine the number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in 1987, assuming a linear decrease in cases from 450,000 in 1960 to 500 in 1996. This involves calculating the rate of decrease over the period and interpolating the number of cases for 1987.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the time span between 1960 and 1996.  
2. Determine the total decrease in measles cases over this period.  
3. Compute the annual rate of decrease, assuming a linear trend.  
4. Use the rate to estimate the number of cases in 1987.  
5. Validate the result to ensure it aligns with a linear decrease.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time span and total decrease in measles cases.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the years (1996 - 1960) to find the time span. Subtract the number of cases in 1996 (500) from the number of cases in 1960 (450,000) to find the total decrease.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time span: 1996 - 1960 = 36 years.  
Total decrease in cases: 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the annual rate of decrease in measles cases.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the total decrease in cases (449,500) by the time span (36 years) to find the average annual decrease.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Annual rate of decrease = 449,500 cases / 36 years ≈ 12,486.11 cases per year.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Estimate the number of cases in 1987 using the linear decrease rate.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the number of years from 1960 to 1987. Multiply this by the annual rate of decrease to find the total decrease by 1987. Subtract this from the 1960 case count (450,000).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Years from 1960 to 1987: 1987 - 1960 = 27 years.  
Total decrease by 1987: 27 years × 12,486.11 cases/year ≈ 337,124.97 cases.  
Cases in 1987: 450,000 - 337,124.97 ≈ 112,875.03.  
Since case counts are typically whole numbers, round to 112,875 cases.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated number of cases for 1987 aligns with a linear decrease.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the linear equation derived from the data points (1960, 450,000) and (1996, 500) to confirm the 1987 estimate. The linear equation is of the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope (rate of decrease) and b is the y-intercept. Calculate the expected cases for 1987 using this equation and compare with the previous result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Slope (m) = (500 - 450,000) / (1996 - 1960) = -449,500 / 36 ≈ -12,486.11 cases/year.  
Using 1960 as x = 0, the 1960 case count is the y-intercept (b = 450,000).  
Linear equation: y = -12,486.11x + 450,000.  
For 1987, x = 1987 - 1960 = 27 years:  
y = -12,486.11 × 27 + 450,000 ≈ -337,124.97 + 450,000 ≈ 112,875.03.  
This matches the previous result (112,875 cases), confirming the calculation is consistent with a linear decrease.
