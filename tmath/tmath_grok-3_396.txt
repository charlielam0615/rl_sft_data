**Problem Statement**: We need to determine the number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in 1987, assuming a linear decrease from 450,000 cases in 1960 to 500 cases in 1996.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the rate of decrease in measles cases per year from 1960 to 1996.  
2. Use the rate to find the number of cases in 1987, which is a specific year between 1960 and 1996.  
3. Ensure the calculation accounts for the linear decrease assumption.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the annual rate of decrease in measles cases from 1960 to 1996.  
**How to Achieve**: Determine the total decrease in cases over the time period and divide by the number of years between 1960 and 1996 to find the annual rate of change.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To calculate the annual rate of decrease:  
- In 1960, cases = 450,000; in 1996, cases = 500.  
- Total decrease = 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases.  
- Time span = 1996 - 1960 = 36 years.  
- Annual rate of decrease = 449,500 / 36 ≈ 12,486.11 cases per year.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of measles cases in 1987 using the linear decrease rate.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the rate of decrease to compute the number of cases in 1987 by starting from 1960 and applying the annual decrease for the number of years between 1960 and 1987.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Years from 1960 to 1987 = 1987 - 1960 = 27 years.  
- Total decrease from 1960 to 1987 = 27 × 12,486.11 ≈ 337,124.97 cases.  
- Cases in 1987 = 450,000 - 337,124.97 ≈ 112,875.03.  
Since the number of cases must be a whole number, round to the nearest integer: 112,875.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation by checking if the linear model correctly predicts the number of cases in 1996 and ensures consistency for 1987.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the rate of decrease from 1960 to 1996 and confirm it matches the given 500 cases, then validate the 1987 result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For 1996: Decrease over 36 years = 36 × 12,486.11 ≈ 449,499.96 cases.  
- Cases in 1996 = 450,000 - 449,499.96 ≈ 500.04, which rounds to 500, matching the given data.  
- The calculation for 1987 (112,875 cases) is consistent with the linear model, as it lies between 450,000 (1960) and 500 (1996).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of measles cases in 1987 assuming a linear decrease from 1960 to 1996.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the annual rate of decrease (completed: 12,486.11 cases/year).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate cases in 1987 using the rate (completed: 112,875 cases).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the linear model and 1987 result (completed: model matches 1996 data and 1987 result is consistent).  
**Current Goal**: Completed, as all subgoals are addressed, and the result is validated.  
**Final Answer**: The number of measles cases reported in 1987, assuming a linear decrease, is approximately 112,875.
