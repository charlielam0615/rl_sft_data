**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to achieve the final goal of finding the coefficient of \( x^2 \).  
1. Multiply the two polynomials to obtain the resulting polynomial.  
2. Identify and combine the terms with \( x^2 \) in the resulting polynomial.  
3. Extract the coefficient of \( x^2 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the polynomials \( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \) and \( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \). This will be achieved by distributing each term of the first polynomial with each term of the second polynomial, then collecting all resulting terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute each term of \( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \) with each term of \( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \):

- **First term**: \( -5x^3 \cdot (-x^2) = 5x^5 \), \( -5x^3 \cdot (-6x) = 30x^4 \), \( -5x^3 \cdot 1 = -5x^3 \).
- **Second term**: \( -5x^2 \cdot (-x^2) = 5x^4 \), \( -5x^2 \cdot (-6x) = 30x^3 \), \( -5x^2 \cdot 1 = -5x^2 \).
- **Third term**: \( -7x \cdot (-x^2) = 7x^3 \), \( -7x \cdot (-6x) = 42x^2 \), \( -7x \cdot 1 = -7x \).
- **Fourth term**: \( 1 \cdot (-x^2) = -x^2 \), \( 1 \cdot (-6x) = -6x \), \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).

Combine all terms:  
\( 5x^5 + 30x^4 - 5x^3 + 5x^4 + 30x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x^3 + 42x^2 - 7x - x^2 - 6x + 1 \).

Now, combine like terms:  
- \( x^5 \): \( 5x^5 \).  
- \( x^4 \): \( 30x^4 + 5x^4 = 35x^4 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -5x^3 + 30x^3 + 7x^3 = 32x^3 \).  
- \( x^2 \): \( -5x^2 + 42x^2 - x^2 = 36x^2 \).  
- \( x \): \( -7x - 6x = -13x \).  
- Constant: \( 1 \).

Resulting polynomial: \( 5x^5 + 35x^4 + 32x^3 + 36x^2 - 13x + 1 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the resulting polynomial \( 5x^5 + 35x^4 + 32x^3 + 36x^2 - 13x + 1 \). This will be achieved by examining the term with \( x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The term with \( x^2 \) in the polynomial is \( 36x^2 \). The coefficient is \( 36 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the coefficient of \( x^2 \) by checking the polynomial multiplication and combination of \( x^2 \) terms. This will be achieved by re-examining the \( x^2 \) terms from the multiplication step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-check the \( x^2 \) terms from Step 2:  
- \( -5x^2 \cdot 1 = -5x^2 \).  
- \( -7x \cdot (-6x) = 42x^2 \).  
- \( 1 \cdot (-x^2) = -x^2 \).  

Combine: \( -5x^2 + 42x^2 - x^2 = (42 - 5 - 1)x^2 = 36x^2 \).  
The coefficient is \( 36 \), which matches the result from Step 3.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the product of the polynomials.
