### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the polynomials \( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \) and \( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \). This will be achieved by distributing each term of the first polynomial across each term of the second polynomial, resulting in a new polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To multiply the polynomials, distribute each term of \( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \) across each term of \( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \):

- First polynomial terms: \( -5x^3, -5x^2, -7x, 1 \)
- Second polynomial terms: \( -x^2, -6x, 1 \)

Compute each combination:

1. **\( -5x^3 \cdot (-x^2 - 6x + 1) \)**:  
   - \( -5x^3 \cdot (-x^2) = 5x^5 \)  
   - \( -5x^3 \cdot (-6x) = 30x^4 \)  
   - \( -5x^3 \cdot 1 = -5x^3 \)

2. **\( -5x^2 \cdot (-x^2 - 6x + 1) \)**:  
   - \( -5x^2 \cdot (-x^2) = 5x^4 \)  
   - \( -5x^2 \cdot (-6x) = 30x^3 \)  
   - \( -5x^2 \cdot 1 = -5x^2 \)

3. **\( -7x \cdot (-x^2 - 6x + 1) \)**:  
   - \( -7x \cdot (-x^2) = 7x^3 \)  
   - \( -7x \cdot (-6x) = 42x^2 \)  
   - \( -7x \cdot 1 = -7x \)

4. **\( 1 \cdot (-x^2 - 6x + 1) \)**:  
   - \( 1 \cdot (-x^2) = -x^2 \)  
   - \( 1 \cdot (-6x) = -6x \)  
   - \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)

Combine all terms:  
\( 5x^5 + 30x^4 - 5x^3 + 5x^4 + 30x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x^3 + 42x^2 - 7x - x^2 - 6x + 1 \)
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine like terms in the polynomial \( 5x^5 + 30x^4 - 5x^3 + 5x^4 + 30x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x^3 + 42x^2 - 7x - x^2 - 6x + 1 \). This will be achieved by grouping terms with the same degree and summing their coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Group terms by degree:

- \( x^5 \): \( 5x^5 \)
- \( x^4 \): \( 30x^4 + 5x^4 = 35x^4 \)
- \( x^3 \): \( -5x^3 + 30x^3 + 7x^3 = 32x^3 \)
- \( x^2 \): \( -5x^2 + 42x^2 - x^2 = 36x^2 \)
- \( x \): \( -7x - 6x = -13x \)
- Constant: \( 1 \)

Resulting polynomial:  
\( 5x^5 + 35x^4 + 32x^3 + 36x^2 - 13x + 1 \)
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term from the polynomial \( 5x^5 + 35x^4 + 32x^3 + 36x^2 - 13x + 1 \). This will be achieved by identifying the term with \( x^2 \) and noting its coefficient.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The polynomial is \( 5x^5 + 35x^4 + 32x^3 + 36x^2 - 13x + 1 \).  
The term with \( x^2 \) is \( 36x^2 \), so the coefficient is 36.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term by checking the multiplication and combination of terms, focusing on contributions to \( x^2 \). This will be achieved by recomputing the \( x^2 \) terms from the original multiplication.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute contributions to \( x^2 \):  
- \( -5x^2 \cdot 1 = -5x^2 \)  
- \( -7x \cdot (-6x) = 42x^2 \)  
- \( 1 \cdot (-x^2) = -x^2 \)  
Sum: \( -5x^2 + 42x^2 - x^2 = 36x^2 \).  
The coefficient is 36, matching the previous result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the product of the polynomials.  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply the polynomials.  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms.  
  - Subgoal 3: Extract the \( x^2 \) coefficient.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result.  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 36, as determined in Subgoal 3 and validated in Subgoal 4.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 36.
