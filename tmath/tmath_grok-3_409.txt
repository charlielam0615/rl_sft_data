**Problem Statement**: Determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor} \), where the domain consists of all real numbers \( x \) for which \( f(x) \) is defined.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the domain, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the conditions for \( f(x) \) to be defined.  
2. Analyze the expression inside the floor function, \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \).  
3. Determine the values of \( x \) for which the denominator \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor \neq 0 \).  
4. Ensure the floor function is well-defined for all real \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate the expression \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) to understand its behavior and ensure the floor function is defined. This will be achieved by computing the expression and checking if it is real-valued for all \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression inside the floor function is \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \). This is a quadratic polynomial, which is defined for all real numbers \( x \). Since the floor function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) takes any real number \( y \) and returns an integer, the expression \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor \) is well-defined for all real \( x \). No restrictions arise from the floor function itself.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine when the denominator \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor \neq 0 \). This will be achieved by finding the values of \( x \) for which \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) lies in intervals where its floor is zero (i.e., \( 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \)) and excluding those from the domain.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor} \) is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor = 0 \). The floor function equals zero when \( 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \). Thus, we need to solve the inequality:  
\[ 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \]

**Step 1**: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \):  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 13 - 1 < 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 < 0 \]  
Factorize the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \]  
The roots are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \). Since the parabola opens upward (coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), test the interval between the roots:  
- At \( x = 3.5 \): \( (3.5 - 3)(3.5 - 4) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0 \).  
- Outside the roots, e.g., at \( x = 2 \): \( (2 - 3)(2 - 4) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0 \).  
Thus, \( x^2 - 7x + 12 < 0 \) for \( 3 < x < 4 \).

**Step 2**: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \geq 0 \):  
Compute the discriminant of \( x^2 - 7x + 13 = 0 \):  
\[ \Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 13 = 49 - 52 = -3 \]  
Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) is always positive (as the parabola opens upward). Thus, \( x^2 - 7x + 13 > 0 \) for all \( x \), satisfying \( 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 \).

**Combine**: The inequality \( 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \) reduces to \( 0 < x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \), which is equivalent to \( x^2 - 7x + 12 < 0 \), so the denominator is zero when \( 3 < x < 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) can produce other integer values for the floor function that equal zero, beyond the interval \( 3 < x < 4 \). This will be achieved by checking the range of \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To ensure no other intervals produce \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor = 0 \), find the minimum value of \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \). Complete the square:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 13 = \left( x - \frac{7}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{49}{4} + 13 = \left( x - \frac{7}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3}{4} \]  
The minimum value is \( \frac{3}{4} \) at \( x = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \). Since \( \frac{3}{4} < 1 \), check if \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) can be in \( [0, 1) \) elsewhere:  
- We already solved \( x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \), which gives \( 3 < x < 4 \).  
- For other integer intervals, e.g., \( -1 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 0 \), this is impossible since \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \geq \frac{3}{4} > 0 \).  
Thus, only \( 0 \leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \) (i.e., \( 3 < x < 4 \)) causes the denominator to be zero.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure the expression \( x^2 - 7x + 13 \) is defined (completed: defined for all real \( x \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find when \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor = 0 \) (completed: when \( 3 < x < 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate no other intervals cause the denominator to be zero (completed: minimum value is \( \frac{3}{4} \), only \( 3 < x < 4 \) satisfies).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the domain by excluding \( x \) where the denominator is zero.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to state the domain of \( f(x) \), which is all real numbers except where \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor = 0 \). This will be achieved by combining results to express the domain in set notation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The function is undefined when \( \lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor = 0 \), which occurs for \( 3 < x < 4 \). Thus, the domain is all real numbers except the open interval \( (3, 4) \):  
\[ \text{Domain} = \mathbb{R} \setminus (3, 4) \]  
In interval notation: \( (-\infty, 3] \cup [4, \infty) \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \rfloor} \) is \( \mathbb{R} \setminus (3, 4) \), or in interval notation, \( (-\infty, 3] \cup [4, \infty) \).
