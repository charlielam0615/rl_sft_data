### Problem Statement
We are given two linear functions, \( f(x) = Ax + B \) and \( g(x) = Bx + A \), where \( A \neq B \). The condition provided is that \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \). Our goal is to find the value of \( A + B \).

I will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( A + B \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Compute the composition \( f(g(x)) \).  
2. Compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \).  
3. Form the expression \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \).  
4. Set the expression equal to \( B - A \) and solve for the relationship between \( A \) and \( B \).  
5. Determine \( A + B \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(x)) \). To achieve this, substitute \( g(x) = Bx + A \) into \( f(x) = Ax + B \), replacing \( x \) in \( f(x) \) with \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( f(g(x)) \):  
Given \( g(x) = Bx + A \), we have:  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(Bx + A) = A(Bx + A) + B = ABx + A^2 + B. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(x)) \). To achieve this, substitute \( f(x) = Ax + B \) into \( g(x) = Bx + A \), replacing \( x \) in \( g(x) \) with \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
Given \( f(x) = Ax + B \), we have:  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(Ax + B) = B(Ax + B) + A = BAx + B^2 + A. \]  
Since multiplication is commutative, \( AB = BA \), so:  
\[ g(f(x)) = ABx + B^2 + A. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to form the expression \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \) and set it equal to \( B - A \). Use the results from the previous steps to compute the difference and equate it to the given condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, \( f(g(x)) = ABx + A^2 + B \).  
From Step 3, \( g(f(x)) = ABx + B^2 + A \).  
Now compute:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (ABx + A^2 + B) - (ABx + B^2 + A). \]  
Subtract term by term:  
- Coefficients of \( x \): \( ABx - ABx = 0 \).  
- Constant terms: \( (A^2 + B) - (B^2 + A) = A^2 + B - B^2 - A = A^2 - B^2 + B - A \).  
Thus:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = A^2 - B^2 + B - A. \]  
The problem states this equals \( B - A \):  
\[ A^2 - B^2 + B - A = B - A. \]  
Simplify:  
\[ A^2 - B^2 + B - A - (B - A) = 0, \]  
\[ A^2 - B^2 = 0, \]  
\[ A^2 = B^2. \]  
Since \( A^2 = B^2 \), we have \( A = B \) or \( A = -B \). However, the problem specifies \( A \neq B \), so:  
\[ A = -B. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( A + B \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(g(x)) \) (completed: \( f(g(x)) = ABx + A^2 + B \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(f(x)) \) (completed: \( g(f(x)) = ABx + B^2 + A \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Form \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \) (completed: derived \( A = -B \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine \( A + B \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Determine \( A + B \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( A + B \). Use the relationship \( A = -B \) from Step 4 to compute \( A + B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 4, we have \( A = -B \). Therefore:  
\[ A + B = -B + B = 0. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( A + B = 0 \). Substitute \( A = -B \) back into the original condition \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \) to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( A = -B \) into the functions:  
- \( f(x) = Ax + B = (-B)x + B = -Bx + B \).  
- \( g(x) = Bx + A = Bx + (-B) = Bx - B \).  
Compute \( f(g(x)) \):  
\[ g(x) = Bx - B, \]  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(Bx - B) = -B(Bx - B) + B = -B^2x + B^2 + B. \]  
Compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ f(x) = -Bx + B, \]  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(-Bx + B) = B(-Bx + B) - B = -B^2x + B^2 - B. \]  
Now compute:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (-B^2x + B^2 + B) - (-B^2x + B^2 - B) = (-B^2x + B^2x) + (B^2 + B - B^2 + B) = 0 + 2B = 2B. \]  
The problem states this should equal \( B - A \):  
\[ B - A = B - (-B) = B + B = 2B. \]  
Thus:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = 2B = B - A, \]  
which is satisfied. The solution is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by recalling all relevant information related to \( A + B \). Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure no alternative solutions were missed, especially considering the constraint \( A \neq B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- Step 4: Derived \( A^2 = B^2 \), leading to \( A = -B \) (since \( A \neq B \)).  
- Step 6: Computed \( A + B = 0 \) using \( A = -B \).  
- Step 7: Validated that \( A = -B \) satisfies \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \).  
No other solutions were found for \( A^2 = B^2 \) given \( A \neq B \). The constraint \( A \neq B \) eliminates \( A = B \), leaving \( A = -B \) as the only solution, consistently yielding \( A + B = 0 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[ A + B = 0 \]
