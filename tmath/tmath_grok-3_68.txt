### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( A + B \) given the functions \( f(x) = Ax + B \) and \( g(x) = Bx + A \), where \( A \neq B \), and the condition \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( A + B \):  
1. Compute the composition \( f(g(x)) \).  
2. Compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \).  
3. Form the expression \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \).  
4. Set the resulting expression equal to \( B - A \) and simplify.  
5. Solve for \( A + B \) using the resulting equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(g(x)) \) and \( g(f(x)) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \) to find \( f(g(x)) \), and substitute \( f(x) \) into \( g(x) \) to find \( g(f(x)) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(x) \):  
\[ g(x) = Bx + A \]  

Compute \( f(g(x)) \):  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(Bx + A) = A(Bx + A) + B = ABx + A^2 + B \]  

Compute \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(x) = Ax + B \]  

Compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(Ax + B) = B(Ax + B) + A = BAx + B^2 + A \]  
Since \( AB = BA \), we have:  
\[ g(f(x)) = ABx + B^2 + A \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Form the expression \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \) and set it equal to \( B - A \).  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract \( g(f(x)) \) from \( f(g(x)) \), simplify the resulting expression, and equate it to \( B - A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2:  
\[ f(g(x)) = ABx + A^2 + B \]  
\[ g(f(x)) = ABx + B^2 + A \]  

Compute:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (ABx + A^2 + B) - (ABx + B^2 + A) \]  
\[ = ABx + A^2 + B - ABx - B^2 - A \]  
\[ = (A^2 - B^2) + (B - A) \]  
\[ = (A - B)(A + B) - (A - B) \]  
Factorize:  
\[ = (A - B)(A + B - 1) \]  

Set equal to the given condition:  
\[ (A - B)(A + B - 1) = B - A \]  
Since \( B - A = -(A - B) \), rewrite the right-hand side:  
\[ (A - B)(A + B - 1) = -(A - B) \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( (A - B)(A + B - 1) = -(A - B) \) for \( A + B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the equation by considering cases where \( A - B \neq 0 \) (since \( A \neq B \)) and solve for \( A + B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3:  
\[ (A - B)(A + B - 1) = -(A - B) \]  

Since \( A \neq B \), \( A - B \neq 0 \), so divide both sides by \( A - B \):  
\[ A + B - 1 = -1 \]  
\[ A + B = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( A + B = 0 \) by substituting back into the original condition.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( A + B = 0 \) (i.e., \( B = -A \)) into \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \) and check if it equals \( B - A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
If \( A + B = 0 \), then \( B = -A \). Redefine the functions:  
\[ f(x) = Ax + B = Ax - A \]  
\[ g(x) = Bx + A = -Ax + A \]  

Compute \( f(g(x)) \):  
\[ g(x) = -Ax + A \]  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(-Ax + A) = A(-Ax + A) - A = -A^2x + A^2 - A \]  

Compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ f(x) = Ax - A \]  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(Ax - A) = -A(Ax - A) + A = -A^2x + A^2 + A \]  

Compute:  
\[ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (-A^2x + A^2 - A) - (-A^2x + A^2 + A) \]  
\[ = (-A^2x + A^2 - A) + (A^2x - A^2 - A) \]  
\[ = (A^2 - A^2) + (-A - A) \]  
\[ = -2A \]  

Check the right-hand side:  
\[ B - A = -A - A = -2A \]  

Since \( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = -2A = B - A \), the solution is valid.
