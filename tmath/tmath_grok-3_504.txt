### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( a + b \), where \( f(x) = ax + b \), \( a \) and \( b \) are real constants, and \( g(x) = 2x - 5 \). The condition given is that \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \) for all \( x \). This means we need to compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \), set it equal to \( 3x + 4 \), and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( a + b \), we need to break down the problem into manageable subgoals. The main goal is to determine \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \). Subgoals include:  
1. Compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \).  
2. Set the result equal to \( 3x + 4 \) and form equations by comparing coefficients.  
3. Solve the resulting system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \).  
4. Compute \( a + b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \). To achieve this, substitute \( f(x) = ax + b \) into \( g(x) = 2x - 5 \), and simplify the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x) = ax + b \), we compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(ax + b) = 2(ax + b) - 5 = 2ax + 2b - 5. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \) and form equations by comparing coefficients. Since \( g(f(x)) = 2ax + 2b - 5 \), equate it to \( 3x + 4 \), and compare the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms to create a system of equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We have:  
\[ 2ax + 2b - 5 = 3x + 4. \]  
For this to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( x \) must be equal:  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2a = 3 \).  
- Constant term: \( 2b - 5 = 4 \).  

This gives the system of equations:  
1. \( 2a = 3 \),  
2. \( 2b - 5 = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( 2a = 3 \) and \( 2b - 5 = 4 \) to find \( a \) and \( b \). Solve each equation independently.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the first equation:  
\[ 2a = 3 \implies a = \frac{3}{2}. \]  

Solve the second equation:  
\[ 2b - 5 = 4 \implies 2b = 9 \implies b = \frac{9}{2}. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a + b \). Using the values \( a = \frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{9}{2} \), add them to find the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[ a + b = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by substituting \( a = \frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{9}{2} \) into \( g(f(x)) \) and checking if it equals \( 3x + 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = \frac{9}{2} \) into \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}. \]  
Compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ g(f(x)) = g\left(\frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}\right) - 5 = 3x + 9 - 5 = 3x + 4. \]  
This matches \( 3x + 4 \), confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]
