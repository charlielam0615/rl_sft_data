**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( a + b \), where \( f(x) = ax + b \), \( g(x) = 2x - 5 \), and the composition \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \) holds for all \( x \). This means \( g(f(x)) = 2f(x) - 5 = 3x + 4 \). We will solve this by determining the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( a + b \), we need to determine \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \). Letâ€™s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Express \( f(x) \) explicitly as \( f(x) = ax + b \).  
2. Compute the composition \( g(f(x)) \) by substituting \( f(x) \) into \( g(x) \).  
3. Set the resulting expression equal to \( 3x + 4 \) and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).  
4. Compute \( a + b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(x)) \) and set it equal to \( 3x + 4 \). We will substitute \( f(x) = ax + b \) into \( g(x) = 2x - 5 \), simplify the expression, and equate it to \( 3x + 4 \) to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with \( f(x) = ax + b \). Then, compute the composition:  
\[ g(f(x)) = g(ax + b) = 2(ax + b) - 5 = 2ax + 2b - 5. \]  
We are given that \( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \). Thus, equate the expressions:  
\[ 2ax + 2b - 5 = 3x + 4. \]  
For this equality to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( x \) and the constant terms must be equal. Comparing coefficients:  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2a = 3 \).  
- Constant term: \( 2b - 5 = 4 \).  

Solve for \( a \):  
\[ 2a = 3 \implies a = \frac{3}{2}. \]  

Solve for \( b \):  
\[ 2b - 5 = 4 \implies 2b = 9 \implies b = \frac{9}{2}. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the values \( a = \frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{9}{2} \). We will substitute these into \( f(x) \), compute \( g(f(x)) \), and verify that it equals \( 3x + 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = \frac{9}{2} \), we have:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}. \]  
Now compute \( g(f(x)) \):  
\[ g(f(x)) = g\left( \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2} \right) - 5. \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}x = 3x, \quad 2 \cdot \frac{9}{2} = 9, \quad \text{so } 2 \left( \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{9}{2} \right) = 3x + 9. \]  
\[ g(f(x)) = 3x + 9 - 5 = 3x + 4. \]  
This matches \( 3x + 4 \), confirming that \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = \frac{9}{2} \) are correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a + b \). Using the validated values \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = \frac{9}{2} \), we will add them to find the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ a + b = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6. \]
