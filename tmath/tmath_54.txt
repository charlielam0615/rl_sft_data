Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers be $x - 2$, $x$, and $x + 2$, where $x$ is the middle integer.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the sum of the three integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The sum of the three integers is:  
$$
(x - 2) + x + (x + 2) = 3x.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the product of the three integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The product of the three integers is:  
$$
(x - 2) \cdot x \cdot (x + 2) = x(x^2 - 4) = x^3 - 4x.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up the equation based on the given condition.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
According to the problem, the sum of the three integers is one-seventh of the product of the same three integers. This gives the equation:  
$$
3x = \frac{1}{7}(x^3 - 4x).
$$

[REVIEW]
I am focusing on the current in progress subgoal: Solve the equation to find the integers.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $3x = \frac{1}{7}(x^3 - 4x)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve the equation $3x = \frac{1}{7}(x^3 - 4x)$, first multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to eliminate the fraction:  
$$
7 \cdot 3x = x^3 - 4x.
$$  
This simplifies to:  
$$
21x = x^3 - 4x.
$$  
Bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:  
$$
x^3 - 25x = 0.
$$  
Factor the left-hand side:  
$$
x(x^2 - 25) = 0.
$$  
This gives three possible solutions:  
$$
x = 0, \quad x = 5, \quad x = -5.
$$  
Since we are looking for **positive** one-digit odd integers, we discard $x = 0$ and $x = -5$, leaving $x = 5$ as the only valid solution.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the middle integer when the three integers are listed in ascending order.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, the middle integer is $x = 5$. Therefore, the three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers are $3$, $5$, and $7$. The middle integer is $5$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution from problem setup to final answer.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Problem setup verification**:
   - Choosing $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$ as consecutive odd integers is valid because odd numbers differ by 2.
   - Sum calculation: $(x-2) + x + (x+2) = 3x$ is correct.

2. **Product calculation verification**:
   - $(x-2)(x)(x+2) = x(x^2 - 4) = x^3 - 4x$ is algebraically correct.

3. **Equation setup verification**:
   - The problem states $3x = \frac{1}{7}(x^3 - 4x)$. This is correctly derived from the given condition.

4. **Equation solving verification**:
   - Multiplying both sides by 7 gives $21x = x^3 - 4x$, which simplifies to $x^3 - 25x = 0$.
   - Factoring yields $x(x^2 - 25) = 0$, leading to roots $x = 0$, $x = 5$, and $x = -5$.
   - Discarding non-positive and non-one-digit solutions correctly leaves $x = 5$.

5. **Final answer verification**:
   - For $x = 5$, the integers are $3$, $5$, and $7$.
   - Sum: $3 + 5 + 7 = 15$.
   - Product: $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 105$.
   - $15 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 105$ confirms the condition is satisfied.

6. **Uniqueness check**:
   - Testing other possible triplets (e.g., $1, 3, 5$ and $5, 7, 9$) shows they do not satisfy the condition.
   - $x = 5$ is the only valid solution.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically sound. The final answer is correct.
