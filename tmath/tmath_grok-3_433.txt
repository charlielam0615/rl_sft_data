**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of the composite function \( f(f(x)) \), where \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the domain of \( f(x) \).  
2. Determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \), which requires the output of \( f(x) \) to be in the domain of \( f \).  
3. Identify the smallest \( x \) that satisfies the domain of \( f(f(x)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \). To achieve this, ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative, as the square root function is defined for real numbers only when its argument is greater than or equal to zero.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \), the expression inside the square root must satisfy:  
\[ x - 3 \geq 0 \]  
\[ x \geq 3 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is \( x \geq 3 \), or in interval notation, \( [3, \infty) \).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). Since \( f(f(x)) = f(\sqrt{x - 3}) \), we need the output of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \) to be in the domain of \( f \). This means \( \sqrt{x - 3} \geq 3 \), as the input to \( f \) must satisfy the domain condition \( x \geq 3 \).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( f(f(x)) \):  
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\sqrt{x - 3}) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x - 3} - 3} \]  
For \( f(f(x)) \) to be defined:  
1. The inner function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \) requires \( x - 3 \geq 0 \), so \( x \geq 3 \).  
2. The outer function \( f(\sqrt{x - 3}) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x - 3} - 3} \) requires the argument of the outer square root to be non-negative:  
\[ \sqrt{x - 3} - 3 \geq 0 \]  
\[ \sqrt{x - 3} \geq 3 \]  
Since the square root is non-negative, square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[ (\sqrt{x - 3})^2 \geq 3^2 \]  
\[ x - 3 \geq 9 \]  
\[ x \geq 12 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( x \geq 12 \), or in interval notation, \( [12, \infty) \).  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). Check if \( x \geq 12 \) satisfies all conditions for \( f(f(x)) \) to be defined and ensure no smaller \( x \) values work.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the domain \( x \geq 12 \):  
- For \( x \geq 12 \), check the inner function: \( x - 3 \geq 12 - 3 = 9 \geq 0 \), so \( \sqrt{x - 3} \) is defined.  
- Check the outer function: \( \sqrt{x - 3} \geq \sqrt{9} = 3 \), so \( \sqrt{x - 3} - 3 \geq 3 - 3 = 0 \), satisfying the condition for the outer square root.  
Test a boundary point, \( x = 12 \):  
\[ f(12) = \sqrt{12 - 3} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]  
\[ f(f(12)) = f(3) = \sqrt{3 - 3} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]  
This is defined, confirming \( x = 12 \) is in the domain.  
Test a value less than 12, say \( x = 11 \):  
\[ f(11) = \sqrt{11 - 3} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828 \]  
\[ f(f(11)) = f(\sqrt{8}) = \sqrt{\sqrt{8} - 3} \approx \sqrt{2.828 - 3} = \sqrt{-0.172} \]  
This is undefined for real numbers, as the argument is negative. Thus, \( x < 12 \) does not satisfy the domain.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the domain of \( f(x) \) (completed: \( x \geq 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) (completed: \( x \geq 12 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the smallest \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the smallest \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \).  
From the previous step, the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( x \geq 12 \). The smallest \( x \) in this domain is \( x = 12 \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). Based on the domain \( x \geq 12 \), the smallest \( x \) is 12.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( x \geq 12 \), so the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain is \( x = 12 \).  

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( 12 \).
