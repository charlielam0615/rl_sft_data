**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of the composite function \( f(f(x)) \), where \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \). The domain of \( f(f(x)) \) consists of all \( x \) such that \( f(x) \) is defined and \( f(x) \) is in the domain of \( f \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the domain of \( f(x) \).  
2. Determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \), ensuring \( f(x) \) is in the domain of \( f \).  
3. Identify the smallest real number \( x \) that satisfies these conditions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \). To achieve this, ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative, as the square root function is defined for real numbers only when its argument is non-negative.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \) to be defined, the argument of the square root must satisfy:  
\[ x - 3 \geq 0 \]  
\[ x \geq 3 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is \( x \geq 3 \), or in interval notation, \( [3, \infty) \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). This requires that \( f(x) \) is defined (i.e., \( x \) is in the domain of \( f \)) and that \( f(x) \) is in the domain of \( f \). Use the domain of \( f(x) \) from the previous step and compute \( f(f(x)) \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \), we have:  
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\sqrt{x - 3}) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x - 3} - 3} \]  
For \( f(f(x)) \) to be defined:  
1. \( x \) must be in the domain of \( f \), so \( x \geq 3 \).  
2. The input to the outer \( f \), which is \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \), must be in the domain of \( f \). Since the domain of \( f \) is \( z \geq 3 \), we need:  
\[ \sqrt{x - 3} \geq 3 \]  
Square both sides (noting that \( \sqrt{x - 3} \geq 0 \), so squaring preserves the inequality):  
\[ (\sqrt{x - 3})^2 \geq 3^2 \]  
\[ x - 3 \geq 9 \]  
\[ x \geq 12 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( x \geq 12 \), or in interval notation, \( [12, \infty) \).  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) by checking if \( x \geq 12 \) satisfies all conditions and ensures \( f(f(x)) \) is defined. Test boundary points and confirm the mathematical derivation.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, test the boundary point \( x = 12 \):  
\[ f(12) = \sqrt{12 - 3} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]  
\[ f(f(12)) = f(3) = \sqrt{3 - 3} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]  
This is defined, confirming \( x = 12 \) is in the domain.  
For \( x < 12 \), try \( x = 3 \) (the smallest in the domain of \( f(x) \)):  
\[ f(3) = \sqrt{3 - 3} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]  
\[ f(f(3)) = f(0) = \sqrt{0 - 3} = \sqrt{-3} \]  
This is undefined for real numbers, as the square root of a negative number is not real. Thus, \( x < 12 \) fails to satisfy the domain condition for \( f(f(x)) \).  
The derivation \( \sqrt{x - 3} \geq 3 \implies x \geq 12 \) is consistent.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the domain of \( f(x) \). (Completed: Domain is \( x \geq 3 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). (Completed: Domain is \( x \geq 12 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). (Pending)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \).  
From the domain \( [12, \infty) \), the smallest real number is \( x = 12 \).

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \). Based on the domain \( x \geq 12 \), select the boundary point.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( [12, \infty) \). The smallest real number in this interval is \( x = 12 \).

**Final Answer**: The smallest real number \( x \) in the domain of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( 12 \).
