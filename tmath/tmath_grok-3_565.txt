**Problem Statement**: Given the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 + 1 & \text{if } x > 5, \\ 2x - 3 & \text{if } -5 \leq x \leq 5, \\ 3 & \text{if } x < -5, \end{cases} \) we need to compute \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the value of \( f(-7) \).  
2. Determine the value of \( f(0) \).  
3. Determine the value of \( f(7) \).  
4. Sum the results to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(-7) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify which piece of the function applies by checking the condition for \( x = -7 \), then evaluate the corresponding expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( -7 < -5 \), the function definition for \( x < -5 \) applies: \( f(x) = 3 \). Thus, \( f(-7) = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(0) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify which piece of the function applies by checking the condition for \( x = 0 \), then evaluate the corresponding expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( -5 \leq 0 \leq 5 \), the function definition for \( -5 \leq x \leq 5 \) applies: \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). Thus, \( f(0) = 2(0) - 3 = -3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(7) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify which piece of the function applies by checking the condition for \( x = 7 \), then evaluate the corresponding expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( 7 > 5 \), the function definition for \( x > 5 \) applies: \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \). Thus, \( f(7) = 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-7) \) (completed: \( f(-7) = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(0) \) (completed: \( f(0) = -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(7) \) (completed: \( f(7) = 50 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the results (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values obtained from previous steps (\( f(-7) = 3 \), \( f(0) = -3 \), \( f(7) = 50 \)) and add them together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the values: \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 3 + (-3) + 50 = 3 - 3 + 50 = 50 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 50 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute each function value and the sum to ensure no errors were made in the calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Recheck \( f(-7) \): Since \( -7 < -5 \), \( f(-7) = 3 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( f(0) \): Since \( -5 \leq 0 \leq 5 \), \( f(0) = 2(0) - 3 = -3 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( f(7) \): Since \( 7 > 5 \), \( f(7) = 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 \). Correct.  
- Recheck sum: \( 3 + (-3) + 50 = 50 \). Correct.  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 50 \).
