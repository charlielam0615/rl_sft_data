### Problem Statement
We need to evaluate the piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x^2 + 1 & \text{if } x > 5, \\
2x - 3 & \text{if } -5 \le x \le 5, \\
3 & \text{if } x < -5.
\end{array}
\right.
\]
at the points \( x = -7 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = 7 \), and compute the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine \( f(-7) \) by identifying the correct piece of the function based on \( x = -7 \).
2. Determine \( f(0) \) by identifying the correct piece of the function based on \( x = 0 \).
3. Determine \( f(7) \) by identifying the correct piece of the function based on \( x = 7 \).
4. Compute the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(-7) \).
How to Achieve: Check which condition \( x = -7 \) satisfies in the piecewise function and apply the corresponding expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( -7 < -5 \), use the piece \( f(x) = 3 \).
Thus, \( f(-7) = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(0) \).
How to Achieve: Check which condition \( x = 0 \) satisfies in the piecewise function and apply the corresponding expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( -5 \le 0 \le 5 \), use the piece \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \).
Thus, \( f(0) = 2(0) - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(7) \).
How to Achieve: Check which condition \( x = 7 \) satisfies in the piecewise function and apply the corresponding expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( 7 > 5 \), use the piece \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \).
Thus, \( f(7) = 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 \).

Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-7) \) (Completed: \( f(-7) = 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(0) \) (Completed: \( f(0) = -3 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(7) \) (Completed: \( f(7) = 50 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \) (Pending).

Current Goal: Compute the sum \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) \).
How to Achieve: Add the computed values \( f(-7) = 3 \), \( f(0) = -3 \), and \( f(7) = 50 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute the sum:
\[ f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 3 + (-3) + 50 = 3 - 3 + 0 = 50. \]

Thus, \( f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 50 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations for \( f(-7) \), \( f(0) \), \( f(7) \), and their sum.
How to Achieve: Recheck each function evaluation and the sum for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Re-evaluate \( f(-7) \): Since \( -7 < -5 \), \( f(x) = 3 \), so \( f(-7) = 3 \). (Corrected: \( f(-7) = 3 \)).
- Re-evaluate \( f(0) \): Since \( -5 \le 0 \le 5 \), \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \), so \( f(0) = 2(0) - 3 = -3 \). (Correct).
- Re-evaluate \( f(7) \): Since \( 7 > 5 \), \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \), so \( f(7) = 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 \). (Correct).
- Recompute sum: \( 3 + (-3) + 50 = 0 + 50 = 50 \). (Correct).

All calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
\[ f(-7) + f(0) + f(7) = 50 \]
