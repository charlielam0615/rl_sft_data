Goal of this step: Multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first polynomial is $ ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x $ and the second polynomial is $ bx^2 - 7x - 4 $. We multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

1. $ ax^3 \cdot bx^2 = abx^5 $
2. $ ax^3 \cdot (-7x) = -7ax^4 $
3. $ ax^3 \cdot (-4) = -4ax^3 $

4. $ 3x^2 \cdot bx^2 = 3bx^4 $
5. $ 3x^2 \cdot (-7x) = -21x^3 $
6. $ 3x^2 \cdot (-4) = -12x^2 $

7. $ -2x \cdot bx^2 = -2bx^3 $
8. $ -2x \cdot (-7x) = 14x^2 $
9. $ -2x \cdot (-4) = 8x $

Now we combine like terms to find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the $x^2$ term in the expanded expression.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the expanded terms, the $x^2$ terms are:
1. $ -12x^2 $ from $ 3x^2 \cdot (-4) $
2. $ 14x^2 $ from $ -2x \cdot (-7x) $

Adding these terms together:
$$ -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2 $$

Therefore, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $2$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify that the calculation of the x² term's coefficient is correct.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
To verify, let's re-examine all steps of the calculation:

1. **Term Identification**:
   - The x² term arises from the product of terms where the exponents of x add to 2. This occurs when:
     - $3x^2$ (from the first polynomial) is multiplied by $-4$ (from the second polynomial):  
       $3x^2 \cdot (-4) = -12x^2$.
     - $-2x$ (from the first polynomial) is multiplied by $-7x$ (from the second polynomial):  
       $-2x \cdot (-7x) = 14x^2$.

2. **Combining Terms**:
   - The two x² terms are $-12x^2$ and $14x^2$.  
   - Adding them: $-12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2$.

3. **Absence of Other Contributions**:
   - No other terms in the expansion (e.g., those involving $a$ or $b$) contribute to the x² term because:
     - $ax^3$ multiplied by any term results in $x^5$, $x^4$, or $x^3$.
     - $3x^2$ multiplied by $bx^2$ results in $3bx^4$ (not x²).
     - $-2x$ multiplied by $bx^2$ results in $-2bx^3$ (not x²).

4. **Final Coefficient**:
   - The combined coefficient of $x^2$ is $2$.  
   - This matches the arithmetic and aligns with the logic of polynomial multiplication.

**Conclusion**: The calculation is correct and consistent.  
\boxed{correct}
