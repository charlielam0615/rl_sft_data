### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(g(-5)) \), where \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \). This requires computing \( g(-5) \) first and then applying the function \( f \) to that result.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve \( f(g(-5)) \), break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(-5) \) using the function \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \).  
2. Use the result of \( g(-5) \) as the input to \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \).  
3. Evaluate \( f \) at the computed value to obtain \( f(g(-5)) \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(-5) \). To achieve this, substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \):  
\[ g(-5) = 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 = -25 + 2 \cdot 25 = -25 + 50 = 25 \]  
So, \( g(-5) = 25 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(-5)) \), which is \( f(25) \), using \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \). Substitute \( x = 25 \) into \( f(x) \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 25 \) into \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \):  
\[ f(25) = 3 - \sqrt{25} = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
So, \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation of \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \). Recalculate \( g(-5) \) and \( f(25) \) to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute \( g(-5) \):  
\[ g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \]  
\[ g(-5) = 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 = -25 + 2 \cdot 25 = -25 + 50 = 25 \]  
Recompute \( f(25) \):  
\[ f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \]  
\[ f(25) = 3 - \sqrt{25} = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
The calculations are consistent: \( g(-5) = 25 \), and \( f(25) = -2 \). Additionally, check the domain of \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \), which requires \( x \geq 0 \). Since \( g(-5) = 25 \geq 0 \), the input is valid. The result \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \) is correct.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(-5)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(-5) \). (Completed: \( g(-5) = 25 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(25) \). (Completed: \( f(25) = -2 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result. (Completed: Calculations validated)  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \). No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
\[ f(g(-5)) = -2 \]
