**Problem Statement**: We need to find \( f(g(-5)) \), where \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(g(-5)) \), break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(-5) \).  
2. Use the result as the input to \( f(x) \), i.e., compute \( f(g(-5)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(-5) \), where \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = -5 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \) and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \):  
\[ g(-5) = 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 = -25 + 2(25) = -25 + 50 = 25 \]  
So, \( g(-5) = 25 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(-5)) \), which is \( f(25) \), since \( g(-5) = 25 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 25 \) into \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \) and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 25 \) into \( f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \):  
\[ f(25) = 3 - \sqrt{25} = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
So, \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(g(-5)) \). This will be achieved by reviewing the steps: recomputing \( g(-5) \), checking the input to \( f(x) \), and verifying the final result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute \( g(-5) \):  
\[ g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \implies g(-5) = 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 = -25 + 2(25) = -25 + 50 = 25 \]  
Confirmed \( g(-5) = 25 \).  
Now, recompute \( f(25) \):  
\[ f(x) = 3 - \sqrt{x} \implies f(25) = 3 - \sqrt{25} = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
The calculations are consistent, and the domain is valid (\( \sqrt{25} \) is defined since \( 25 \geq 0 \)). Thus, \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \) is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(-5)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(-5) \) (completed: \( g(-5) = 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(-5)) = f(25) \) (completed: \( f(25) = -2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed: calculations confirmed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The final answer is \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(-5)) = -2 \)
