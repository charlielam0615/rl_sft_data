**Problem Statement**: Jenna's original bill was $400. A 1% late charge was added on the 30th day past the due date, and the resulting total was increased by another 1% because she did not pay in the next 30 days. We need to calculate the final bill amount.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the first late charge (1% of the original bill).  
2. Add the first late charge to the original bill to get the new total.  
3. Calculate the second late charge (1% of the new total).  
4. Add the second late charge to the new total to get the final bill amount.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the first late charge, which is 1% of the original bill ($400). This will be achieved by multiplying $400 by 0.01.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first late charge is 1% of $400:  
$400 \times 0.01 = 4$.  
So, the first late charge is $4.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the first late charge to the original bill to get the new total. This will be achieved by adding the $4 late charge to the original $400 bill.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The new total after the first late charge is:  
$400 + 4 = 404$.  
So, the bill after the first late charge is $404.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the second late charge, which is 1% of the new total ($404). This will be achieved by multiplying $404 by 0.01.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The second late charge is 1% of $404:  
$404 \times 0.01 = 4.04$.  
So, the second late charge is $4.04.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the second late charge to the new total to get the final bill amount. This will be achieved by adding the $4.04 late charge to the $404 bill.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The final bill amount is:  
$404 + 4.04 = 408.04$.  
So, the final bill is $408.04.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations to ensure the final bill amount is correct. This will be achieved by reviewing the steps and recalculating to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Original bill: $400.  
- First late charge: $400 \times 0.01 = 4$, so new total = $400 + 4 = 404$.  
- Second late charge: $404 \times 0.01 = 4.04$, so final total = $404 + 4.04 = 408.04$.  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the final bill is $408.04.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the final bill amount after two 1% late charges.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the first late charge (1% of $400). [Completed: $4]  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the first late charge to the original bill. [Completed: $404]  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the second late charge (1% of $404). [Completed: $4.04]  
  - Subgoal 4: Add the second late charge to get the final bill. [Completed: $408.04]  
**Current Goal**: The current goal was to calculate the final bill amount, which has been achieved and validated as $408.04.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The bill is now $408.04.
