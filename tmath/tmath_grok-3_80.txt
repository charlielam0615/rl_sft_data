### Problem Restatement
Jenna's original bill was $400. A 1% late charge was added on the 30th day past the due date. The resulting total was then increased by another 1% because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days. We need to calculate the final amount of the bill.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the first late charge (1% of the original bill).  
2. Add the first late charge to the original bill to get the new total.  
3. Calculate the second late charge (1% of the new total).  
4. Add the second late charge to the new total to get the final bill amount.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the first late charge (1% of the original $400 bill). This will be achieved by multiplying $400 by 0.01.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The first late charge is 1% of $400:  
$400 \times 0.01 = 4$.  
So, the first late charge is $4.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the first late charge to the original bill to get the new total. This will be achieved by adding the $4 late charge to the original $400.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The new total after the first late charge is:  
$400 + 4 = 404$.  
So, the bill after the first late charge is $404.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the second late charge (1% of the new total, $404). This will be achieved by multiplying $404 by 0.01.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second late charge is 1% of $404:  
$404 \times 0.01 = 4.04$.  
So, the second late charge is $4.04.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the second late charge to the new total to get the final bill amount. This will be achieved by adding the $4.04 late charge to $404.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The final bill amount is:  
$404 + 4.04 = 408.04$.  
So, the bill is now $408.04.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations by recomputing the steps to ensure accuracy. This will be achieved by recalculating each step and confirming the final result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Letâ€™s verify:  
1. First late charge: $400 \times 0.01 = 4$.  
2. New total: $400 + 4 = 404$.  
3. Second late charge: $404 \times 0.01 = 4.04$.  
4. Final total: $404 + 4.04 = 408.04$.  
The calculations are consistent. Alternatively, we can compute using the compound interest formula for two periods:  
Final amount = $400 \times (1 + 0.01)^2 = 400 \times 1.01^2 = 400 \times 1.0201 = 408.04$.  
The result matches, confirming the final bill is $408.04.

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the final bill amount after two 1% late charges.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the first late charge (completed: $4).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the first late charge to the original bill (completed: $404).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the second late charge (completed: $4.04).  
  - Subgoal 4: Add the second late charge to get the final bill (completed: $408.04).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the calculations (completed: confirmed $408.04).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final bill amount, which has been calculated as $408.04.  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The bill is now $408.04.
