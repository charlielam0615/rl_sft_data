Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Distribute each coefficient to the terms inside the parentheses.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Distributing each coefficient to the terms inside the parentheses, we get:
$$ -3(x^4 - x^3 + x) + 7(x^4 + 2) - 4(2x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) $$
$$ = -3x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x + 7x^4 + 14 - 8x^4 - 8x^2 - 4 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Combining like terms in the polynomial:  
$$ -3x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x + 7x^4 + 14 - 8x^4 - 8x^2 - 4 $$  

Group the $x^4$ terms:  
$$ (-3x^4 + 7x^4 - 8x^4) = -4x^4 $$  

Group the $x^3$ terms:  
$$ 3x^3 $$  

Group the $x^2$ terms:  
$$ -8x^2 $$  

Group the $x$ terms:  
$$ -3x $$  

Group the constant terms:  
$$ 14 - 4 = 10 $$  

So, the simplified polynomial is:  
$$ -4x^4 + 3x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 10 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the term with the highest degree and determine the leading coefficient.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The simplified polynomial is:  
$$ -4x^4 + 3x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 10 $$  

The term with the highest degree is $-4x^4$, and its coefficient is $-4$. Therefore, the leading coefficient is $-4$.

1. Distribution verification:
   - First term: -3(x⁴ - x³ + x) = -3x⁴ + 3x³ - 3x (correct)
   - Second term: 7(x⁴ + 2) = 7x⁴ + 14 (correct)
   - Third term: -4(2x⁴ + 2x² + 1) = -8x⁴ - 8x² - 4 (correct)

2. Combining like terms verification:
   - x⁴ terms: -3x⁴ + 7x⁴ - 8x⁴ = (-3 + 7 - 8)x⁴ = -4x⁴ (correct)
   - x³ terms: 3x³ (no other x³ terms, correct)
   - x² terms: -8x² (no other x² terms, correct)
   - x terms: -3x (no other x terms, correct)
   - Constants: 14 - 4 = 10 (correct)

3. Leading coefficient verification:
   - Final simplified polynomial: -4x⁴ + 3x³ - 8x² - 3x + 10
   - Highest degree term is x⁴ with coefficient -4 (correct)
   
All steps are mathematically consistent and error-free. The leading coefficient is correctly identified as -4.
