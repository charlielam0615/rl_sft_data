**Problem Statement**: Find the distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the distance between two points:  
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.  
2. Recall the formula for the distance between two points in a 2D plane.  
3. Apply the formula using the given coordinates.  
4. Compute the numerical result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coordinates of the two points. This will be achieved by extracting the coordinates from the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The coordinates of the two points are (0,4) and (3,0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to recall the formula for the distance between two points in a 2D plane. Retrieve the standard distance formula used in coordinate geometry.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a 2D plane is:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  
This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by the horizontal and vertical distances between the points.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the distance formula using the coordinates (0,4) and (3,0). Substitute the coordinates into the formula and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the distance formula \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\):  
- Let \((x_1, y_1) = (0,4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (3,0)\).  
- Substitute: \(\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\).  
The distance is 5 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed distance. This will be achieved by rechecking the coordinate substitution and calculations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recheck the coordinates: (0,4) and (3,0).  
Recompute:  
- \(x_2 - x_1 = 3 - 0 = 3\), so \(3^2 = 9\).  
- \(y_2 - y_1 = 0 - 4 = -4\), so \((-4)^2 = 16\).  
- Sum: \(9 + 16 = 25\).  
- Square root: \(\sqrt{25} = 5\).  
The calculation is correct, confirming the distance is 5 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the distance between points (0,4) and (3,0).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the coordinates (completed: (0,4) and (3,0)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recall the distance formula (completed: \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula (completed: distance = 5).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: calculation confirmed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is 5 units.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is 5 units.
