**Problem Statement**: Find the distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the distance between two points, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.
2. Recall the formula for the distance between two points.
3. Apply the formula using the coordinates.
4. Simplify the result to obtain the final distance.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the coordinates of the two points and recall the distance formula.
How to Achieve: Extract the coordinates from the problem statement and retrieve the standard distance formula for two points in a Cartesian plane.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The coordinates of the points are (0,4) and (3,0). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the distance between points (0,4) and (3,0).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the coordinates of the two points (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Recall the distance formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula using the coordinates.
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the result to obtain the final distance.
Current Goal: Apply the formula using the coordinates.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the distance formula using the coordinates (0,4) and (3,0).
How to Achieve: Substitute the coordinates into the distance formula and compute the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the distance formula \(d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\), where \((x_1, y_1) = (0,4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (3,0)\):
\[
d = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]
The distance is 5 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculated distance.
How to Achieve: Recheck the coordinate substitution and calculations in the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute to validate:
- Coordinates: (0,4) and (3,0).
- Formula: \(d = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2}\).
- Calculation: \(3^2 = 9\), \((-4)^2 = 16\), \(9 + 16 = 25\), \(\sqrt{25} = 5\).
The result is consistent: the distance is 5 units.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is 5 units.
