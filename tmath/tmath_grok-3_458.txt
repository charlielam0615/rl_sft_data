**Problem Restatement**: We need to find two positive integers that are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), each less than 20, such that their product plus their sum equals 103. The goal is to determine the sum of these two integers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to identify the two integers.  
1. Define variables for the two positive integers, say \(x\) and \(y\), where \(1 \leq x, y < 20\).  
2. Set up the equation based on the problem: \(x \cdot y + x + y = 103\).  
3. Ensure \(x\) and \(y\) are relatively prime (GCD(\(x, y\)) = 1).  
4. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) by testing possible values or factoring the equation.  
5. Compute the sum \(x + y\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and simplify the equation \(x \cdot y + x + y = 103\) to find possible values of \(x\) and \(y\). This can be achieved by rewriting the equation and testing integer pairs that satisfy the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = 103 \]  
This can be factored as:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 = 103 \]  
Thus:  
\[ (x + 1)(y + 1) = 104 \]  
Now, find pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = x + 1\), \(b = y + 1\), and \(a \cdot b = 104\), then compute \(x = a - 1\), \(y = b - 1\). Ensure \(x, y < 20\) and GCD(\(x, y\)) = 1.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find factor pairs of 104 for \((a, b)\) such that \(a = x + 1\), \(b = y + 1\), and verify that \(x, y\) are positive integers less than 20 and relatively prime.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Find factor pairs of 104:  
\[ 104 = 1 \cdot 104, 2 \cdot 52, 4 \cdot 26, 8 \cdot 13, 13 \cdot 8, 26 \cdot 4, 52 \cdot 2, 104 \cdot 1 \]  
For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(x = a - 1\), \(y = b - 1\):  
- \( (a, b) = (2, 52) \): \( x = 1, y = 51 \). Since \( y = 51 > 20 \), discard.  
- \( (a, b) = (4, 26) \): \( x = 3, y = 25 > 20 \), discard.  
- \( (a, b) = (8, 13) \): \( x = 7, y = 12 \). Check: \( 7 \cdot 12 + 7 + 12 = 84 + 19 = 103 \). Valid.  
- \( (a, b) = (13, 8) \): \( x = 12, y = 7 \). Same pair as above.  
- \( (a, b) = (26, 4) \): \( x = 25 > 20 \), discard.  
- \( (a, b) = (52, 2) \): \( x = 51 > 20 \), discard.  
- Other pairs (e.g., \(1 \cdot 104\)) yield invalid or negative values.  
Check GCD(\(7, 12\)): Factors of 7 are \{1, 7\}, of 12 are \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\}. GCD = 1, so they are relatively prime.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find two positive integers \(x, y\) such that \(x \cdot y + x + y = 103\), \(x, y < 20\), GCD(\(x, y\)) = 1, and compute their sum.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \((x + 1)(y + 1) = 104\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find factor pairs of 104 and compute corresponding \(x, y\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify \(x, y < 20\) and GCD(\(x, y\)) = 1.  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the integers \(x = 7, y = 12\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the integers \(x = 7\) and \(y = 12\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the sum:  
\[ x + y = 7 + 12 = 19 \]  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the two integers is 19.
