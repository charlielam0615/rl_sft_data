### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
1. Define the variables and equation based on the problem statement.  
2. Identify constraints: integers are positive, relatively prime, and less than 20.  
3. Solve the equation while ensuring the constraints are met.  
4. Compute the sum of the integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the equation and constraints.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let the integers be \(a\) and \(b\). The problem states \(a \cdot b + a + b = 103\), which can be rewritten as \(a \cdot b + a + b = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 = 103\), so \((a + 1)(b + 1) = 104\). Additionally, \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers less than 20, and relatively prime (\(\gcd(a, b) = 1\)).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the given condition:  
\[ a \cdot b + a + b = 103 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ a \cdot b + a + b = a(b + 1) + b = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 \]  
Thus:  
\[ (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 = 103 \implies (a + 1)(b + 1) = 104 \]  
Constraints:  
- \(a, b\) are positive integers, \(1 \leq a, b < 20\).  
- \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\).  
- \((a + 1)(b + 1) = 104\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find pairs \((a + 1, b + 1)\) that multiply to 104, then derive \(a\) and \(b\).  
- **How to Achieve**: List the factor pairs of 104, compute corresponding \(a = m - 1\) and \(b = n - 1\), and check if \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy the constraints (\(1 \leq a, b < 20\), \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\)).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Find factor pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(m \cdot n = 104\), where \(m = a + 1\), \(n = b + 1\).  
Prime factorization of 104:  
\[ 104 = 2^3 \cdot 13 \]  
Positive factor pairs \((m, n)\):  
\[ (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13), (13, 8), (26, 4), (52, 2), (104, 1) \]  

For each pair, compute \(a = m - 1\), \(b = n - 1\), and check constraints:  
1. \((1, 104)\): \(a = 1 - 1 = 0\), \(b = 104 - 1 = 103\). Invalid: \(a = 0\) is not positive, \(b \geq 20\).  
2. \((2, 52)\): \(a = 2 - 1 = 1\), \(b = 52 - 1 = 51\). Invalid: \(b \geq 20\).  
3. \((4, 26)\): \(a = 4 - 1 = 3\), \(b = 26 - 1 = 25\). Invalid: \(b \geq 20\).  
4. \((8, 13)\): \(a = 8 - 1 = 7\), \(b = 13 - 1 = 12\).  
   - Check: \(1 \leq 7, 12 < 20\), compute \(\gcd(7, 12) = 1\) (since 7 is prime, no common factors with 12). Valid candidate.  
5. \((13, 8)\): \(a = 13 - 1 = 12\), \(b = 8 - 1 = 7\). Same as above, valid.  
6. \((26, 4)\): \(a = 26 - 1 = 25\), \(b = 4 - 1 = 3\). Invalid: \(a \geq 20\).  
7. \((52, 2)\): \(a = 52 - 1 = 51\), \(b = 2 - 1 = 1\). Invalid: \(a \geq 20\).  
8. \((104, 1)\): \(a = 104 - 1 = 103\), \(b = 1 - 1 = 0\). Invalid: \(a \geq 20\), \(b = 0\).  

Valid pair: \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\) (or vice versa).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\) satisfies the original equation and constraints.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\) into the equation \(a \cdot b + a + b = 103\), confirm \(\gcd(7, 12) = 1\), and ensure \(a, b < 20\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\):  
\[ 7 \cdot 12 + 7 + 12 = 84 + 7 + 12 = 103 \]  
Equation holds.  
Check constraints:  
- \(1 \leq 7, 12 < 20\): Satisfied.  
- \(\gcd(7, 12) = 1\): 7 is prime, 12 = \(2^2 \cdot 3\), no common factors. Satisfied.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.

**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 2: Find factor pairs of 104 and derive \(a, b\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\). (Completed)  
  - **Current Subgoal**: Compute the sum of the integers \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the integers \(a = 7\), \(b = 12\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Add the integers \(7 + 12\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ 7 + 12 = 19 \]  
The sum of the integers is 19.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the two integers is 19.
