**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( k \) in the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \), given that its nonzero roots are in the ratio \( 2:1 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the roots in terms of the given ratio \( 2:1 \).  
2. Use the properties of the roots (sum and product) for the quadratic equation to form equations.  
3. Solve for \( k \) using these equations.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the roots using the ratio and set up equations based on the quadratic equation's properties.  
**How to Achieve**: Assume the roots are \( r \) and \( 2r \) (based on the ratio \( 2:1 \)). Use the sum of roots (\( -b/a \)) and product of roots (\( c/a \)) for the quadratic \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = k \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \):  
- Sum of roots: \( r + 2r = 3r = -b/a = -6/1 = -6 \).  
  Thus, \( 3r = -6 \), so \( r = -2 \).  
- Roots are \( r = -2 \) and \( 2r = -4 \).  
- Product of roots: \( r \cdot 2r = 2r^2 = k/a = k/1 = k \).  
  Substitute \( r = -2 \): \( 2(-2)^2 = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \).  
  Thus, \( k = 8 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the roots of the equation \( x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 \) are in the ratio \( 2:1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the quadratic equation with \( k = 8 \), find the roots, and check their ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \( x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 \):  
Factorize: \( x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 \).  
Roots are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = -4 \).  
Check the ratio: \( -4 / -2 = 2 \), which satisfies the \( 2:1 \) ratio.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( k \) such that the roots of \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \) are in the ratio \( 2:1 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express roots in terms of the ratio \( 2:1 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Use sum and product of roots to find \( k \). (Completed, \( k = 8 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the roots satisfy the ratio. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: Completed, as \( k = 8 \) is validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( k \) is \( 8 \).
