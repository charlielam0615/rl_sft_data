**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( k \).  
1. Define the roots based on the given ratio \( 2:1 \).  
2. Use the properties of the roots (sum and product) for a quadratic equation.  
3. Set up equations based on these properties.  
4. Solve for \( k \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the roots based on the ratio \( 2:1 \) and use the quadratic formula’s properties to form equations. Assume the roots are \( r \) and \( 2r \), where \( r \neq 0 \). Use the sum of roots (\( -b/a \)) and product of roots (\( c/a \)) for the quadratic \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = k \).  
- **Sum of roots**: If the roots are \( r \) and \( 2r \), their sum is \( r + 2r = 3r \). For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -b/a \). Thus:  
  \[
  3r = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{6}{1} = -6 \implies r = -2
  \]
- **Roots**: If \( r = -2 \), the roots are \( r = -2 \) and \( 2r = 2 \cdot (-2) = -4 \).  
- **Product of roots**: The product of roots is \( r \cdot 2r = 2r^2 \), and for the quadratic, it is \( c/a = k/1 = k \). Thus:  
  \[
  2r^2 = k
  \]
  Substitute \( r = -2 \):  
  \[
  2(-2)^2 = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \implies k = 8
  \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( k = 8 \) produces roots in the ratio \( 2:1 \). Substitute \( k = 8 \) into the equation, find the roots, and check their ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( k = 8 \) into \( x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 \). Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = 8 \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = 36 - 32 = 4 \).  
- Roots:  
  \[
  x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm 2}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x_1 = \frac{-6 + 2}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2, \quad x_2 = \frac{-6 - 2}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
  \]
- **Check ratio**: The roots are \( -2 \) and \( -4 \). Compute the ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{-4}{-2} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{-2}{-4} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  This gives the ratio \( 2:1 \), as required.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( k \) such that the roots of \( x^2 + 6x + k = 0 \) are in the ratio \( 2:1 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define roots as \( r \) and \( 2r \), and use sum and product of roots. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( k \) using the product of roots. (Completed, \( k = 8 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate by checking the roots’ ratio for \( k = 8 \). (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution is complete and correct.  
The solution \( k = 8 \) satisfies the condition, as the roots \( -2 \) and \( -4 \) are in the ratio \( 2:1 \).

**Final Answer**: \( k = 8 \)
