**Problem Statement**: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers. A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive, with digits from 0 to 9, where the hundreds digit cannot be 0.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the number of three-digit numbers. Subgoals:  
1. Define the range of three-digit numbers.  
2. Determine the choices for each digit (hundreds, tens, units).  
3. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers by multiplying the choices for each digit.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the range of three-digit numbers and identify the valid digits for each position. This will be achieved by analyzing the structure of a three-digit number (hundreds, tens, units) and specifying the constraints for each digit.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive. It has the form ABC, where:  
- A (hundreds digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since the number cannot start with 0).  
- B (tens digit) can be any digit from 0 to 9.  
- C (units digit) can be any digit from 0 to 9.  
Thus, there are:  
- 9 choices for the hundreds digit (1–9).  
- 10 choices for the tens digit (0–9).  
- 10 choices for the units digit (0–9).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers by multiplying the number of choices for each digit position (hundreds, tens, units). This will be achieved using the multiplication principle for independent choices.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of three-digit numbers is calculated by multiplying the choices for each digit:  
- Choices: 9 (hundreds) × 10 (tens) × 10 (units) = 9 × 10 × 10 = 900.  
Thus, there are 900 three-digit numbers.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking the range of three-digit numbers using an alternative method (subtracting the count of numbers less than 100 from those less than or equal to 999). This ensures the result is correct.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, consider the range of numbers:  
- Three-digit numbers are from 100 to 999.  
- The total count of numbers from 1 to 999 is 999.  
- Subtract the numbers from 1 to 99 (which are one- and two-digit numbers): 999 − 99 = 900.  
This confirms there are 900 three-digit numbers, matching the previous calculation.
