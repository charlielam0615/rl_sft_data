**Problem Restatement**: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers. A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive, with each digit being an integer from 0 to 9, except that the first digit cannot be 0.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Define the range of three-digit numbers.  
2. Determine the possible values for each digit.  
3. Calculate the total number of valid three-digit numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the range of three-digit numbers.  
How to Achieve: Identify that three-digit numbers are integers from 100 to 999, inclusive, and confirm the constraints on the digits.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999, inclusive. Each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. The hundreds digit must be non-zero (1 to 9), while the tens and units digits can be any digit (0 to 9).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the possible values for each digit.  
How to Achieve: Analyze the constraints for each digit position in a three-digit number.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a three-digit number:  
- Hundreds digit: Can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (9 options).  
- Tens digit: Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (10 options).  
- Units digit: Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (10 options).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of valid three-digit numbers.  
How to Achieve: Use the counting principle by multiplying the number of options for each digit position.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total three-digit numbers = (Options for hundreds digit) × (Options for tens digit) × (Options for units digit)  
= 9 × 10 × 10  
= 900.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation.  
How to Achieve: Cross-check the result using an alternative method, such as calculating the total numbers from 100 to 999 inclusively.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alternative method:  
Three-digit numbers are all integers from 100 to 999, inclusive.  
Total count = 999 − 100 + 1 = 900.  
This matches the previous calculation (9 × 10 × 10 = 900), confirming the result is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the range of three-digit numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the possible values for each digit (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total number of valid three-digit numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (completed).  
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The final answer is 900 three-digit numbers.
