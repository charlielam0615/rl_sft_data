**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that at least one woman is selected when three people are chosen at random from a group of seven men and three women. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the probability problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 people from 10 (7 men + 3 women).
2. Calculate the number of ways to select 3 people with no women (all men).
3. Find the number of ways to select at least one woman by subtracting the no-women case from the total.
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 people from 10.
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n = 10 and k = 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute C(10, 3):
C(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 720 / 6 = 120.
Total ways to select 3 people = 120.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 people with no women (all men).
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula C(n, k), where n = 7 (number of men) and k = 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute C(7, 3):
C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 210 / 6 = 35.
Ways to select 3 men = 35.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the number of ways to select at least one woman.
How to Achieve: Subtract the number of ways to select no women from the total number of ways to select 3 people.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total ways to select 3 people = 120 (from Step 2).
Ways to select no women = 35 (from Step 3).
Ways to select at least one woman = 120 - 35 = 85.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the probability of selecting at least one woman.
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (at least one woman) by the total number of outcomes and express as a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Favorable outcomes = 85 (from Step 4).
Total outcomes = 120 (from Step 2).
Probability = 85 / 120.
Simplify: 85 ÷ 5 = 17, 120 ÷ 5 = 24, so 85 / 120 = 17 / 24.
The fraction 17/24 is in simplest form since 17 is prime and 24 has no common factors with 17.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recheck the combination calculations and the subtraction step, and confirm the fraction is simplified.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck C(10, 3): (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 720 / 6 = 120. Correct.
Recheck C(7, 3): (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 210 / 6 = 35. Correct.
Recheck subtraction: 120 - 35 = 85. Correct.
Recheck fraction: 85 / 120 = 17 / 24, and 17 and 24 have no common factors. Correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the probability that at least one woman is selected.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total ways to select 3 people (completed: 120).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate ways to select no women (completed: 35).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate ways to select at least one woman (completed: 85).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability (completed: 17/24).
  - Subgoal 5: Validate calculations (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.

**Final Answer**: The probability that at least one woman is selected is 17/24.
