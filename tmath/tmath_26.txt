Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the problem: Sixteen is 64% of what number?
2. Set up the equation: 16 = 0.64 * x
3. Solve for x: x = 16 / 0.64
4. Verify the solution
[/PLANNING]

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for x in the equation x = 16 / 0.64
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve for x, we will divide 16 by 0.64.
$$ x = \frac{16}{0.64} $$
$$ x = 25 $$

1. **Equation Setup**: The problem "Sixteen is 64% of what number?" translates to 16 = 0.64 * x. This is correct because "is" implies equality, "of" implies multiplication, and 64% = 0.64.

2. **Solving the Equation**: 
   - Rearranging to solve for x: x = 16 / 0.64. This step is valid because dividing both sides by 0.64 isolates x.
   - Calculation: 16 / 0.64 = 25. 
     - Verification of division: 0.64 * 25 = 16 (0.64 * 20 = 12.8; 0.64 * 5 = 3.2; 12.8 + 3.2 = 16).
     - Alternative verification: 0.64 = 16/25, so 16 / (16/25) = 25.

3. **Final Answer**: 25. This satisfies the original equation (16 = 0.64 * 25) and aligns with all verification steps. No inconsistencies or errors detected in the process.
