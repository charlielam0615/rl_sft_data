**Problem Restatement**: Given two polynomials \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \), where the degree of \( g(z) \) is less than the degree of \( f(z) \), and the degree of \( f(z) \) is two, we need to determine the degree of the polynomial \( f(z) + g(z) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the properties of polynomial degrees.  
2. Determine the possible degrees of \( g(z) \) given that its degree is less than that of \( f(z) \).  
3. Analyze how the degree of the sum \( f(z) + g(z) \) is determined based on the degrees of \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \).  
4. Conclude the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the properties of polynomial degrees, particularly how the degree of a polynomial sum is determined. This can be achieved by recalling the rule for the degree of the sum of two polynomials and considering the given degree constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For two polynomials \( p(z) \) and \( q(z) \), the degree of their sum \( p(z) + q(z) \) is generally the maximum of their degrees, unless the leading terms cancel out. Since \( f(z) \) has degree 2, and \( g(z) \) has degree less than 2 (i.e., degree 0 or 1, or possibly the zero polynomial with degree \(-\infty\)), we need to consider whether the leading terms of \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \) could cancel out when added.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the possible degrees of \( g(z) \) given that its degree is less than that of \( f(z) \), which is 2. This can be achieved by listing the possible degrees of \( g(z) \) and considering their impact on the sum \( f(z) + g(z) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the degree of \( f(z) \) is 2, the degree of \( g(z) \) must be less than 2. Thus, \( g(z) \) can have:  
- Degree 1 (e.g., \( g(z) = az + b \)),  
- Degree 0 (e.g., \( g(z) = c \), a constant polynomial),  
- Or be the zero polynomial (degree \(-\infty\)).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to analyze how the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is determined based on the degrees of \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \). This can be achieved by examining the sum \( f(z) + g(z) \) for each possible degree of \( g(z) \), focusing on the leading terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \), where \( a \neq 0 \), so the degree of \( f(z) \) is 2. Consider the possible cases for \( g(z) \):  
- **Case 1: Degree of \( g(z) = 1 \)**  
  Suppose \( g(z) = dz + e \). Then:  
  \[
  f(z) + g(z) = az^2 + bz + c + dz + e = az^2 + (b + d)z + (c + e).
  \]  
  The leading term is \( az^2 \), so the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is 2, as \( a \neq 0 \).  
- **Case 2: Degree of \( g(z) = 0 \)**  
  Suppose \( g(z) = e \). Then:  
  \[
  f(z) + g(z) = az^2 + bz + c + e = az^2 + bz + (c + e).
  \]  
  The leading term is still \( az^2 \), so the degree is 2.  
- **Case 3: \( g(z) \) is the zero polynomial**  
  If \( g(z) = 0 \), then:  
  \[
  f(z) + g(z) = f(z) = az^2 + bz + c,
  \]  
  and the degree is 2.  
In all cases, the leading term of \( f(z) \), which is \( az^2 \), remains non-zero since \( a \neq 0 \), and \( g(z) \) has no \( z^2 \) term to cancel it. Thus, the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is 2.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the properties of polynomial degrees (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the possible degrees of \( g(z) \) (completed: degrees 0, 1, or \(-\infty\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Analyze the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) (completed: degree is 2 in all cases).  
  - Subgoal 4: Conclude the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \). This can be achieved by summarizing the findings from the analysis of the sumâ€™s degree in all possible cases for \( g(z) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Based on the analysis, for all possible degrees of \( g(z) \) (0, 1, or \(-\infty\)), the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is 2, as the leading term of \( f(z) \), which is of degree 2, is never canceled by \( g(z) \). Therefore, the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is 2.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is 2.
