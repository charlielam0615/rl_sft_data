### Problem Restatement
Given that \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \) are polynomials in \( z \), with the degree of \( g(z) \) less than the degree of \( f(z) \), and the degree of \( f(z) \) is two, we need to determine the degree of the polynomial \( f(z) + g(z) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the degrees of \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \).  
- Subgoal 2: Apply the rule for the degree of the sum of two polynomials.  
- Subgoal 3: Consider special cases where the degree of the sum might differ from the expected degree.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the degree of \( f(z) \) based on the problem statement.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the given information that the degree of \( f(z) \) is two and the degree of \( g(z) \) is less than that of \( f(z) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the problem states that the degree of \( f(z) \) is two, we have \( \deg(f(z)) = 2 \). The degree of \( g(z) \) is less than the degree of \( f(z) \), so \( \deg(g(z)) < 2 \), meaning \( \deg(g(z)) = 0 \) (a constant polynomial) or \( \deg(g(z)) = 1 \) (a linear polynomial).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the rule for the degree of the sum of two polynomials to find \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the polynomial degree addition rule, which states that the degree of the sum of two polynomials is typically the maximum of their degrees, unless leading coefficients cancel out.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For polynomials \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \), the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is generally \( \max(\deg(f(z)), \deg(g(z))) \). Since \( \deg(f(z)) = 2 \) and \( \deg(g(z)) \leq 1 \), we expect \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) = 2 \), provided the leading coefficient of \( f(z) + g(z) \) does not vanish.  
Let \( f(z) = a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0 \), where \( a_2 \neq 0 \), and consider cases for \( g(z) \):  
- If \( \deg(g(z)) = 1 \), then \( g(z) = b_1 z + b_0 \), and \( f(z) + g(z) = a_2 z^2 + (a_1 + b_1) z + (a_0 + b_0) \). The leading term is \( a_2 z^2 \), so \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) = 2 \).  
- If \( \deg(g(z)) = 0 \), then \( g(z) = b_0 \), and \( f(z) + g(z) = a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + (a_0 + b_0) \). The leading term is still \( a_2 z^2 \), so \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check if there are cases where the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) could be less than 2 due to coefficient cancellation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze whether the leading coefficient of \( f(z) + g(z) \) can become zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) could be less than 2 only if the coefficient of the \( z^2 \) term in \( f(z) + g(z) \) is zero. Since \( f(z) = a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0 \) with \( a_2 \neq 0 \), and \( g(z) \) has degree at most 1 (so no \( z^2 \) term), the coefficient of \( z^2 \) in \( f(z) + g(z) \) is \( a_2 \). As \( a_2 \neq 0 \), the leading term cannot cancel out, ensuring \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the degrees of \( f(z) \) and \( g(z) \) (completed: \( \deg(f(z)) = 2 \), \( \deg(g(z)) \leq 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the rule for the degree of the sum of two polynomials (completed: expected degree is 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Consider special cases where the degree might differ (completed: no coefficient cancellation possible).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer based on completed subgoals.  
The analysis shows that \( \deg(f(z) + g(z)) = 2 \) in all cases.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The degree of \( f(z) + g(z) \) is **2**.
