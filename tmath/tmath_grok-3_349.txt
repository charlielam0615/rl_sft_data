**Problem Statement**: Simplify the fraction \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{108} + 2\sqrt{12} + 2\sqrt{27}}\) by rationalizing the denominator.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the terms in the denominator: \(\sqrt{108}\), \(2\sqrt{12}\), and \(2\sqrt{27}\).
2. Combine the simplified terms in the denominator.
3. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate.
4. Simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the terms in the denominator (\(\sqrt{108}\), \(2\sqrt{12}\), \(2\sqrt{27}\)).
How to Achieve: Factor each square root term into its prime factors, simplify the radicals, and combine like terms if possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Simplify \(\sqrt{108}\):
  \[
  \sqrt{108} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}.
  \]
- Simplify \(2\sqrt{12}\):
  \[
  \sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}, \quad 2\sqrt{12} = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}.
  \]
- Simplify \(2\sqrt{27}\):
  \[
  \sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}, \quad 2\sqrt{27} = 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}.
  \]
- Combine the terms in the denominator:
  \[
  \sqrt{108} + 2\sqrt{12} + 2\sqrt{27} = 6\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{3} = (6 + 4 + 6)\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}.
  \]
The fraction is now:
\[
\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Simplify the fraction \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{108} + 2\sqrt{12} + 2\sqrt{27}}\) by rationalizing the denominator.
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the terms in the denominator (Completed: Denominator simplified to \(16\sqrt{3}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Combine the simplified terms in the denominator (Completed: Combined to \(16\sqrt{3}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Rationalize the denominator.
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms.
Current Goal: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}\).
How to Achieve: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\) to eliminate the square root in the denominator.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The fraction is:
\[
\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}.
\]
Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\frac{4 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{16\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{16 \cdot 3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{48}.
\]
Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (4):
\[
\frac{4 \div 4 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{48 \div 4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}.
\]
The fraction is now:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}.
\]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}\) is the simplified form of the original fraction.
How to Achieve: Check if the denominator is rationalized and if the fraction is in its simplest form. Optionally, numerically compare the original and simplified fractions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- The denominator of \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}\) is 12, which is a rational number, confirming the denominator is rationalized.
- Check for further simplification: The numerator \(\sqrt{3}\) is irrational and cannot be simplified further, and 12 has no common factors with \(\sqrt{3}\).
- Numerical verification (optional):
  - Original denominator: \(\sqrt{108} \approx 10.392\), \(2\sqrt{12} \approx 2 \cdot 3.464 = 6.928\), \(2\sqrt{27} \approx 2 \cdot 5.196 = 10.392\). Total: \(10.392 + 6.928 + 10.392 \approx 27.712\). Fraction: \(\frac{4}{27.712} \approx 0.1443\).
  - Simplified fraction: \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12} \approx \frac{1.732}{12} \approx 0.1443\). The values match approximately.
The fraction \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}\) is simplified and correct.
