### Problem Restatement
We need to find the smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \), break it into subgoals:
1. Understand the absolute value equation and set up cases based on the definition of absolute value.
2. Solve each case to find all possible values of \( x \).
3. Identify the smallest value of \( x \) among the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up and solve the cases for the absolute value equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).
Description: The absolute value \( |y| = a \) implies \( y = a \) or \( y = -a \). Apply this to \( 3x + 7 = 26 \) and \( 3x + 7 = -26 \), then solve each equation for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( |3x + 7| = 26 \), consider two cases:

**Case 1: \( 3x + 7 = 26 \)**
\[
3x = 26 - 7 = 19
\]
\[
x = \frac{19}{3}
\]

**Case 2: \( 3x + 7 = -26 \)**
\[
3x = -26 - 7 = -33
\]
\[
x = \frac{-33}{3} = -11
\]

The solutions are \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \).
Description: Substitute each solution back into the original equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \) to confirm they satisfy it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verify \( x = \frac{19}{3} \):**
\[
3 \cdot \frac{19}{3} + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26
\]
\[
|26| = 26
\]
This satisfies the equation.

**Verify \( x = -11 \):**
\[
3 \cdot (-11) + 7 = -33 + 7 = -26
\]
\[
|-26| = 26
\]
This satisfies the equation.

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and set up cases for the absolute value equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve each case to find all possible values of \( x \) (completed: \( x = \frac{19}{3}, -11 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solutions (completed: both valid).
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the smallest value of \( x \) (current).

Current Goal: Identify the smallest value of \( x \) from \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the smallest value of \( x \) from \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \).
Description: Compare the numerical values of \( \frac{19}{3} \) and \( -11 \) to determine which is smaller.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( \frac{19}{3} \):
\[
\frac{19}{3} \approx 6.333
\]
Compare:
- \( \frac{19}{3} \approx 6.333 \) (positive).
- \( -11 \) (negative).

Since \( -11 < 6.333 \), the smallest value is \( x = -11 \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |3x + 7| = 26 \) is \( -11 \).
