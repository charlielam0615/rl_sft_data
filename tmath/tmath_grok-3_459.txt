**Problem Statement**: Find the smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \), break it into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Understand that the absolute value equation \( |3x + 7| = 26 \) implies two cases: \( 3x + 7 = 26 \) or \( 3x + 7 = -26 \).  
2. Solve each case to find possible values of \( x \).  
3. Compare the solutions to identify the smallest value of \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the two cases derived from \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).  
How to Achieve: For the first case, solve \( 3x + 7 = 26 \). For the second case, solve \( 3x + 7 = -26 \). Use algebraic methods to isolate \( x \) in each equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the first case: \( 3x + 7 = 26 \)  
Subtract 7 from both sides:  
\( 3x = 26 - 7 \)  
\( 3x = 19 \)  
Divide by 3:  
\( x = \frac{19}{3} \approx 6.333 \)  

For the second case: \( 3x + 7 = -26 \)  
Subtract 7 from both sides:  
\( 3x = -26 - 7 \)  
\( 3x = -33 \)  
Divide by 3:  
\( x = \frac{-33}{3} = -11 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the solutions \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \) satisfy the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute both values of \( x \) back into \( |3x + 7| \) and check if the result equals 26.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = \frac{19}{3} \):  
\( 3x = 3 \cdot \frac{19}{3} = 19 \)  
\( 3x + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 \)  
\( |3x + 7| = |26| = 26 \), which satisfies the equation.  

For \( x = -11 \):  
\( 3x = 3 \cdot (-11) = -33 \)  
\( 3x + 7 = -33 + 7 = -26 \)  
\( |3x + 7| = |-26| = 26 \), which satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |3x + 7| = 26 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the two cases \( 3x + 7 = 26 \) and \( 3x + 7 = -26 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the solutions. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compare solutions to find the smallest \( x \). (Current)  

Current Goal: Compare the solutions \( x = \frac{19}{3} \) and \( x = -11 \) to identify the smallest value.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compare the solutions to find the smallest value of \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Numerically or logically compare \( x = \frac{19}{3} \approx 6.333 \) and \( x = -11 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = \frac{19}{3} \approx 6.333 \) and \( x = -11 \). Comparing these values, \( -11 < 6.333 \). Therefore, the smallest value of \( x \) is \( -11 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The smallest value of \( x \) that satisfies \( |3x + 7| = 26 \) is \( x = -11 \).
