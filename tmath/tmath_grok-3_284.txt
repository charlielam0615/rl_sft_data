**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the expression. The goal is to compute the product of the terms. Since all terms have the same base (10), combine the exponents to form a single power of 10, then evaluate.  
Subgoals:  
1. Combine the exponents using exponent rules.  
2. Simplify the resulting exponent.  
3. Compute the final value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine the exponents of the terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the exponent rule for multiplication: when multiplying powers with the same base, add the exponents. The expression is \((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\), so add the exponents: \(0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the sum of the exponents:  
\(0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8\)  
\(0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0\)  
\(1.0 + 0.1 = 1.1\)  
\(1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0\)  
The expression becomes \(10^{0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9} = 10^{2.0}\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the resulting exponent and compute the final value.  
**How to Achieve**: Evaluate \(10^{2.0}\), which is a straightforward computation since the exponent is a whole number.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression is now \(10^{2.0}\). Since \(10^{2.0} = 10^2\), compute:  
\(10^2 = 100\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\) and find its value.  
  - Subgoal 1: Combine the exponents (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting exponent and compute the value (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”final value computed as 100.
