**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\) and find its value.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of simplifying the expression into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Combine the exponents using exponent rules.  
2. Simplify the resulting expression.  
3. Compute the final value.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the exponents. Use the exponent rule \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\) to add the exponents of the same base (10).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The expression is \((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\).  
Using the rule \(10^{m} \cdot 10^{n} = 10^{m+n}\), combine the exponents:  
\(0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9 = 2.0\).  
Thus, the expression simplifies to \(10^{2.0}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the exponent sum. Recalculate the sum of the exponents to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the exponent sum:  
\(0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8\),  
\(0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0\),  
\(1.0 + 0.1 = 1.1\),  
\(1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0\).  
The sum is correct, confirming the expression simplifies to \(10^{2.0}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the value of the simplified expression \(10^{2.0}\). Evaluate \(10^{2.0}\) directly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The simplified expression is \(10^{2.0}\).  
Since \(10^{2.0} = 10^2 = 100\), the value is 100.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify and find the value of \((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Combine the exponents (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final value (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The expression has been simplified to \(10^{2.0}\), and its value is 100.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The simplified value of the expression is \(100\).
