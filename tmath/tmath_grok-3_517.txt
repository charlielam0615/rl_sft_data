**Problem Statement**: Given a quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \) with two real solutions, find the average of these two solutions.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the average of the two real solutions of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the quadratic equation’s coefficients.  
2. Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.  
3. Compute the average of the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation.  
How to Achieve: Compare the given equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \) to the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) to extract the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic equation is \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \). In standard form, \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the coefficients are:  
- \( a = a \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)),  
- \( b = -2a \) (coefficient of \( x \)),  
- \( c = b \) (constant term).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.  
How to Achieve: Apply the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) using the coefficients identified in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \). Substituting \( a = a \), \( b = -2a \), and \( c = b \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-2a)^2 - 4(a)(b) = 4a^2 - 4ab \).  
- Roots: \( x = \frac{-(-2a) \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 4ab}}{2a} = \frac{2a \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 4ab}}{2a} = \frac{2a \pm 2\sqrt{a^2 - ab}}{2a} = 1 \pm \sqrt{a^2 - ab}/a \).  
Thus, the roots are \( x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{a^2 - ab}/a \) and \( x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{a^2 - ab}/a \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the equation has two real solutions.  
How to Achieve: Check if the discriminant is non-negative, as this ensures the quadratic equation has real roots.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The discriminant is \( b^2 - 4ac = 4a^2 - 4ab \). For real solutions, \( 4a^2 - 4ab \geq 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - ab \geq 0 \). Factoring, \( a(a - b) \geq 0 \). Since the problem states there are two real solutions, we assume \( a^2 - ab \geq 0 \), and for distinct roots, \( a^2 - ab > 0 \), so the discriminant condition holds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the average of the two roots.  
How to Achieve: Use the sum of the roots divided by 2, leveraging the quadratic formula’s sum of roots property, \( x_1 + x_2 = -b/a \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is \( x_1 + x_2 = -b/a \). Here, \( a = a \), \( b = -2a \), so:  
\[ x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-(-2a)}{a} = \frac{2a}{a} = 2. \]  
The average of the roots is:  
\[ \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]  
Alternatively, using the roots from Step 3:  
\[ x_1 + x_2 = \left(1 + \sqrt{a^2 - ab}/a\right) + \left(1 - \sqrt{a^2 - ab}/a\right) = 1 + 1 = 2, \]  
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]  
Both methods confirm the average is 1.
