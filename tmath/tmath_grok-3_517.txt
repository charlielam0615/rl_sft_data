### Problem Restatement
We need to find the average of the two real solutions of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \), where the equation is given to have two real solutions.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the average of the two solutions into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or another method.  
2. Compute the average of the two roots.  
3. Ensure the solution accounts for the condition that the roots are real.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the roots of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where the coefficients are \( a = a \), \( b = -2a \), and \( c = b \). Simplify the formula to find the roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \). For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the roots are given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Identify the coefficients:
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( a = a \)
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( b = -2a \)
- Constant term: \( c = b \)

Substitute into the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-(-2a) \pm \sqrt{(-2a)^2 - 4(a)(b)}}{2a} \]
\[ x = \frac{2a \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 4ab}}{2a} \]
\[ x = \frac{2a \pm 2\sqrt{a^2 - ab}}{2a} \]
\[ x = \frac{2a \pm 2\sqrt{a(a - b)}}{2a} \]
\[ x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}} \]

The roots are:
\[ x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}}, \quad x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}} \]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the roots are real and correctly derived.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the discriminant to confirm the roots are real and ensure the derived roots satisfy the original equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The discriminant of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). Substitute the coefficients \( a = a \), \( b = -2a \), \( c = b \):
\[ \Delta = (-2a)^2 - 4(a)(b) = 4a^2 - 4ab = 4a(a - b) \]

Since the equation has two real solutions, the discriminant must be positive:
\[ 4a(a - b) > 0 \]
\[ a(a - b) > 0 \]

This condition depends on the signs of \( a \) and \( a - b \). For example:
- If \( a > 0 \), then \( a - b > 0 \), so \( b < a \).
- If \( a < 0 \), then \( a - b < 0 \), so \( b > a \).

To verify the roots, substitute \( x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}} \) into the original equation (this is complex, so let’s try an alternative approach to confirm correctness later if needed).

Instead, note that the discriminant confirms real roots when \( a(a - b) > 0 \), which aligns with the problem’s condition. The roots’ form suggests they are real if \( \frac{a - b}{a} \geq 0 \), but we’ll proceed and revisit if necessary.

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The previous step’s complexity in verifying roots suggests a simpler approach may exist. Adjust the subgoals:  
1. Use Vieta’s formulas to find the sum of the roots directly, as the average is half the sum.  
2. Confirm the roots are real using the discriminant.  
3. Compute the average based on the sum.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find the sum of the roots using Vieta’s formulas.  
- **How to Achieve:** For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Apply this to find the sum, then compute the average.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \), rewrite in standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):
- \( a = a \)
- \( b = -2a \)
- \( c = b \)

By Vieta’s formulas, the sum of the roots is:
\[ \text{Sum of roots} = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-2a}{a} = \frac{2a}{a} = 2 \]

The average of the two roots is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of roots}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm the average is correct and accounts for real roots.  
- **How to Achieve:** Recompute the sum using the roots from Step 2 and check the discriminant again to ensure real roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the roots from Step 2:
\[ x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}}, \quad x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}} \]

Sum of the roots:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = \left(1 + \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}}\right) + \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Average:
\[ \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

This matches the result from Vieta’s formulas. For real roots, the discriminant \( 4a(a - b) > 0 \) ensures \( \sqrt{\frac{a - b}{a}} \) is real when \( \frac{a - b}{a} > 0 \), or adjusted based on \( a \)'s sign, confirming consistency.

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Find the average of the two real solutions of \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \).
  - Subgoal 1 (Initial, Adjusted): Identify the roots of the quadratic equation.
  - Subgoal 2 (Initial): Compute the average of the two roots.
  - Subgoal 1 (Adjusted): Use Vieta’s formulas to find the sum of the roots.
  - Subgoal 2 (Adjusted): Confirm real roots using the discriminant.
  - Subgoal 3 (Adjusted): Compute the average based on the sum.

**Current Goal:** Completed the main goal by computing the average.

The average of the two roots has been computed as 1 using both Vieta’s formulas and direct root summation, with validation ensuring real roots via the discriminant.

### Final Answer
The average of the two real solutions of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0 \) is **1**.
