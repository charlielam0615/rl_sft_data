**Problem Statement**: We need to find all values of \( x \) for which the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} -x - 3 & \text{if } x \leq 1, \\ \frac{x}{2} + 1 & \text{if } x > 1 \end{cases} \) equals zero, and then compute their sum.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the values of \( x \) where \( f(x) = 0 \) for each piece of the piecewise function.  
2. Solve for \( x \) in the first piece (\( x \leq 1 \)) by setting \( -x - 3 = 0 \).  
3. Solve for \( x \) in the second piece (\( x > 1 \)) by setting \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \).  
4. Verify that each solution satisfies the corresponding domain condition.  
5. Sum the valid \( x \)-values.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( x \) in the first piece of the function (\( x \leq 1 \)) where \( f(x) = -x - 3 = 0 \). This will be achieved by solving the linear equation algebraically and checking if the solution lies within the domain \( x \leq 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set \( -x - 3 = 0 \):  
\[ -x - 3 = 0 \]  
\[ -x = 3 \]  
\[ x = -3 \]  

Check the domain: Since \( x = -3 \leq 1 \), the solution is valid for this piece.  
Thus, \( x = -3 \) is a solution where \( f(-3) = -(-3) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( x \) in the second piece of the function (\( x > 1 \)) where \( f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \). This will be achieved by solving the linear equation algebraically and checking if the solution lies within the domain \( x > 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \):  
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \]  
\[ \frac{x}{2} = -1 \]  
\[ x = -2 \]  

Check the domain: Since \( x = -2 \not> 1 \), the solution does not satisfy the domain condition for this piece.  
Thus, \( x = -2 \) is not a valid solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( -x - 3 = 0 \) for \( x \leq 1 \). (Completed: Solution \( x = -3 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \) for \( x > 1 \). (Completed: No valid solution)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions against domain conditions. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the valid \( x \)-values. (Pending)  

**Current Goal**: Sum the valid \( x \)-values.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of all valid \( x \)-values where \( f(x) = 0 \). From previous steps, the only valid solution is \( x = -3 \). The sum will be calculated directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The valid solution is \( x = -3 \).  
Since there is only one solution, the sum is:  
\[ -3 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The sum of all values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( -3 \).  
\[ \boxed{-3} \]
