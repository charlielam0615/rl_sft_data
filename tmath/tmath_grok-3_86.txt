**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all values of \( x \) for which the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} -x - 3 & \text{if } x \leq 1, \\ \frac{x}{2} + 1 & \text{if } x > 1 \end{cases} \) equals zero, and compute their sum.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for each piece of the piecewise function, respecting their domains.  
2. Verify the solutions are valid within their respective domains.  
3. Sum the valid solutions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for the first piece, \( -x - 3 = 0 \), where \( x \leq 1 \).  
How to Achieve: Set the equation \( -x - 3 = 0 \), solve for \( x \), and check if the solution satisfies \( x \leq 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve \( -x - 3 = 0 \):  
\[ -x = 3 \]  
\[ x = -3 \]  
Check domain: \( x = -3 \leq 1 \), which is true.  
Thus, \( x = -3 \) is a valid solution for the first piece.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for the second piece, \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \), where \( x > 1 \).  
How to Achieve: Set the equation \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \), solve for \( x \), and check if the solution satisfies \( x > 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve \( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \):  
\[ \frac{x}{2} = -1 \]  
\[ x = -2 \]  
Check domain: \( x = -2 > 1 \), which is false.  
Thus, \( x = -2 \) is not a valid solution for the second piece.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for each piece (completed).  
    - First piece (\( -x - 3 = 0 \), \( x \leq 1 \)): Solution \( x = -3 \).  
    - Second piece (\( \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \), \( x > 1 \)): No valid solution.  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the valid solutions (pending).  
Current Goal: Sum the valid solutions.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the valid solutions where \( f(x) = 0 \).  
How to Achieve: Identify all valid solutions from previous steps and compute their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Valid solution from Step 2: \( x = -3 \).  
No valid solutions from Step 3.  
Sum of solutions: \( -3 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) is \(-3\).
