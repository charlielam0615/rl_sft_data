**Problem Statement**: We are given the equation \( x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + 8 \), and we need to find the value of \( xy \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( xy \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation to express it in a form that isolates terms involving \( xy \).  
2. Identify or derive an expression for \( xy \).  
3. Solve for the numerical value of \( xy \), if possible.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the given equation to isolate terms involving \( xy \).  
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side of the equation \( x \cdot (x + y) \), equate it to the right-hand side \( x^2 + 8 \), and rearrange to find a relationship involving \( xy \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\[ x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + xy \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8 \]  
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:  
\[ xy = 8 \]  
This gives a direct expression for \( xy \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the derived expression \( xy = 8 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( xy = 8 \) back into the simplified equation and check consistency, or re-derive the equation to confirm no errors.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-check the simplification:  
Starting from \( x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8 \), subtracting \( x^2 \) yields \( xy = 8 \).  
Alternatively, consider the original equation:  
\[ x (x + y) = x^2 + 8 \]  
If \( xy = 8 \), then \( y = \frac{8}{x} \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)). Substitute into the equation:  
\[ x \left( x + \frac{8}{x} \right) = x \cdot \frac{x^2 + 8}{x} = x^2 + 8 \]  
This satisfies the original equation, confirming \( xy = 8 \).

### Step 4

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( xy \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation to isolate terms involving \( xy \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify or derive an expression for \( xy \) (completed: \( xy = 8 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the numerical value of \( xy \) (completed).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as \( xy = 8 \).
