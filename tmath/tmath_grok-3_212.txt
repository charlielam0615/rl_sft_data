**Problem Statement**: Given the equation \( x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + 8 \), find the value of \( xy \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( xy \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the given equation to isolate terms involving \( y \).
2. Express \( xy \) in terms of the simplified equation.
3. Determine if additional information or assumptions are needed to find a numerical value for \( xy \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the given equation to isolate terms involving \( y \).
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side of the equation \( x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + 8 \), simplify, and rearrange to express \( y \) or \( xy \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the left-hand side:
\[ x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + xy \]
The equation becomes:
\[ x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8 \]
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[ xy = 8 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the simplified equation \( xy = 8 \).
How to Achieve: Check the algebraic steps and consider whether the solution accounts for all possible cases (e.g., \( x \neq 0 \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review the steps:
- Starting equation: \( x \cdot (x + y) = x^2 + 8 \).
- Expanded to: \( x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8 \).
- Subtracted \( x^2 \): \( xy = 8 \).
The algebra is correct. Note that if \( x = 0 \), the original equation becomes \( 0 \cdot (0 + y) = 0^2 + 8 \), or \( 0 = 8 \), which is inconsistent. Thus, \( x \neq 0 \), but this does not affect \( xy = 8 \), as no division by \( x \) was performed.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( xy \).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation to isolate terms involving \( y \) (completed: \( xy = 8 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the solution (completed: algebraic steps confirmed, \( x \neq 0 \)).
Current Goal: Conclude the value of \( xy \).
The simplified equation \( xy = 8 \) directly provides the value of \( xy \).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( xy \) is \( 8 \).
