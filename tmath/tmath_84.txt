Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The method for completing the square for a quadratic expression.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
To find the smallest possible value of a quadratic expression like $x^2 + 8x$, we use the method of completing the square. This involves rewriting the expression in the form $(x + a)^2 + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The minimum value of the expression is then determined by the constant $b$, since the square term $(x + a)^2$ is always non-negative.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Complete the square for $x^2 + 8x$ to find its minimum value.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We want to express $x^2 + 8x$ in the form $(x + a)^2 + b$. To do this, we complete the square:

1. Take the coefficient of $x$, which is 8, and halve it: $8/2 = 4$.  
2. Square the result: $4^2 = 16$.  
3. Add and subtract this square to the expression:  
   $$
   x^2 + 8x = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16.
   $$

Thus, the expression $x^2 + 8x$ becomes $(x + 4)^2 - 16$. The square term $(x + 4)^2$ is always non-negative, and its minimum value is 0 when $x = -4$. At this point, the value of the entire expression is $-16$. Therefore, the smallest possible real value of $x^2 + 8x$ is $-16$.

Self-Verification (Verification)

[VERIFY]
1. **Step 1: Coefficient halving**  
   - Original coefficient of $x$ is $8$. Halving gives $4$. This is correct.  

2. **Step 2: Squaring the halved coefficient**  
   - $4^2 = 16$. This is mathematically valid.  

3. **Step 3: Adding and subtracting 16**  
   - The expression becomes $(x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16$. This maintains equivalence to the original $x^2 + 8x$ because $+16 -16 = 0$.  

4. **Step 4: Perfect square formation**  
   - $x^2 + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)^2$. This is correct because $(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16$.  

5. **Step 5: Minimum value determination**  
   - $(x + 4)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$. The minimum occurs when $(x + 4)^2 = 0$ (i.e., $x = -4$), giving $-16$. This aligns with the properties of squares.  

**Conclusion**: All algebraic transformations are valid, and the logic for determining the minimum value is sound.
