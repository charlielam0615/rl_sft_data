### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7\). To achieve this, multiply both sides by \(r + 4\) to eliminate the denominator, then simplify and solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[
\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7
\]  
Multiply both sides by \(r + 4\) (noting that \(r \neq -4\) to avoid division by zero):  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = (2r + 7)(r + 4)
\]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
(2r + 7)(r + 4) = 2r^2 + 8r + 7r + 28 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28
\]  
The equation becomes:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28
\]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 - (2r^2 + 15r + 28) = 0
\]  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 - 2r^2 - 15r - 28 = 0
\]  
Combine like terms:  
\[
(r^2 - 2r^2) + (-3r - 15r) + (-17 - 28) = -r^2 - 18r - 45 = 0
\]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) for simplicity:  
\[
r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0
\]  
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 18\), \(c = 45\):  
\[
\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = 18^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 45 = 324 - 180 = 144
\]  
\[
r = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-18 \pm 12}{2}
\]  
\[
r_1 = \frac{-18 + 12}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad r_2 = \frac{-18 - 12}{2} = \frac{-30}{2} = -15
\]  
Check for extraneous solutions by substituting back into the original equation, as \(r = -4\) is not allowed:  
- For \(r = -3\): Left side: \(\frac{(-3)^2 - 3(-3) - 17}{-3 + 4} = \frac{9 + 9 - 17}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1\). Right side: \(2(-3) + 7 = -6 + 7 = 1\). Equal.  
- For \(r = -15\): Left side: \(\frac{(-15)^2 - 3(-15) - 17}{-15 + 4} = \frac{225 + 45 - 17}{-11} = \frac{253}{-11} = -23\). Right side: \(2(-15) + 7 = -30 + 7 = -23\). Equal.  
Both solutions are valid, and neither is \(r = -4\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solutions \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\) by checking the domain and ensuring no extraneous roots were introduced.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solutions \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\) were checked in the previous step and satisfy the original equation. The denominator \(r + 4 \neq 0\) implies \(r \neq -4\), which neither solution violates. The quadratic equation was derived without introducing extraneous roots, as multiplication by \(r + 4\) is reversible for \(r \neq -4\). Thus, the solutions are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the positive difference between the solutions \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\). Compute \(|r_1 - r_2|\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solutions are \(r_1 = -3\) and \(r_2 = -15\). The positive difference is:  
\[
|-3 - (-15)| = |-3 + 15| = |12| = 12
\]  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 2: Verify the solutions (completed: both are valid).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the positive difference (completed: difference is 12).
