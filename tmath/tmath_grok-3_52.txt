**Problem Statement**: Find the positive difference between the solutions of the equation \(\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the positive difference between the solutions into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the equation \(\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7\) to find the values of \(r\).  
2. Identify the solutions (roots) of the resulting equation.  
3. Compute the positive difference between the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7\). To achieve this, eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(r + 4\), simplify the resulting equation, and solve for \(r\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[
\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7
\]  
Multiply both sides by \(r + 4\) (noting that \(r \neq -4\) to avoid division by zero):  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = (2r + 7)(r + 4)
\]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
(2r + 7)(r + 4) = 2r^2 + 8r + 7r + 28 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28
\]  
The equation becomes:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28
\]  
Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 - (2r^2 + 15r + 28) = 0
\]  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 - 2r^2 - 15r - 28 = 0
\]  
Combine like terms:  
\[
(r^2 - 2r^2) + (-3r - 15r) + (-17 - 28) = -r^2 - 18r - 45 = 0
\]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) for simplicity:  
\[
r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0
\]  
Solve the quadratic equation \(r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 18\), \(c = 45\):  
\[
\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = 18^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 45 = 324 - 180 = 144
\]  
\[
r = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-18 \pm 12}{2}
\]  
\[
r_1 = \frac{-18 + 12}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad r_2 = \frac{-18 - 12}{2} = \frac{-30}{2} = -15
\]  
The solutions are \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\). Verify that neither solution makes the denominator zero (\(r + 4 \neq 0\)):  
- For \(r = -3\), \(-3 + 4 = 1 \neq 0\).  
- For \(r = -15\), \(-15 + 4 = -11 \neq 0\).  
Both solutions are valid.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\) satisfy the original equation. Substitute each solution into \(\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7\) to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(r = -3\):  
Left-hand side:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = (-3)^2 - 3(-3) - 17 = 9 + 9 - 17 = 1, \quad \frac{1}{-3 + 4} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]  
Right-hand side:  
\[
2(-3) + 7 = -6 + 7 = 1
\]  
\(1 = 1\), so \(r = -3\) is correct.  

Substitute \(r = -15\):  
Left-hand side:  
\[
r^2 - 3r - 17 = (-15)^2 - 3(-15) - 17 = 225 + 45 - 17 = 253, \quad \frac{253}{-15 + 4} = \frac{253}{-11} = -23
\]  
Right-hand side:  
\[
2(-15) + 7 = -30 + 7 = -23
\]  
\(-23 = -23\), so \(r = -15\) is correct.  
Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the positive difference between the solutions \(r = -3\) and \(r = -15\). The positive difference is the absolute value of the difference between the two solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solutions are \(r_1 = -3\) and \(r_2 = -15\). The positive difference is:  
\[
|r_1 - r_2| = |-3 - (-15)| = |-3 + 15| = |12| = 12
\]  
Alternatively:  
\[
|-15 - (-3)| = |-15 + 3| = |-12| = 12
\]  
The positive difference between the solutions is 12.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The positive difference between the solutions of the equation is 12.
