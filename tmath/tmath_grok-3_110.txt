### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \(\triangle\) given the equations:
1. \(\triangle + q = 59\)
2. \((\triangle + q) + q = 106\)

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \(\triangle\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the second equation using the first equation.
2. Solve for \(q\) using the simplified equations.
3. Substitute \(q\) back into the first equation to find \(\triangle\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the second equation using the first equation.
How to Achieve: The first equation is \(\triangle + q = 59\). The second equation is \((\triangle + q) + q = 106\). Substitute \(\triangle + q = 59\) into the second equation to express it in terms of \(q\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(\triangle + q = 59\), the second equation becomes:
\[
59 + q = 106
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve for \(q\) using the simplified second equation.
How to Achieve: From the equation \(59 + q = 106\), isolate \(q\) by subtracting 59 from both sides.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
59 + q = 106
\]
\[
q = 106 - 59 = 47
\]
So, \(q = 47\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Substitute \(q\) back into the first equation to find \(\triangle\).
How to Achieve: Use \(q = 47\) in the first equation \(\triangle + q = 59\) to solve for \(\triangle\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\triangle + q = 59
\]
\[
\triangle + 47 = 59
\]
\[
\triangle = 59 - 47 = 12
\]
So, \(\triangle = 12\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking both equations.
How to Achieve: Substitute \(\triangle = 12\) and \(q = 47\) into both equations to ensure they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first equation:
\[
\triangle + q = 12 + 47 = 59
\]
This satisfies \(\triangle + q = 59\).

Check the second equation:
\[
(\triangle + q) + q = (12 + 47) + 47 = 59 + 47 = 106
\]
This satisfies \((\triangle + q) + q = 106\).

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is valid.
