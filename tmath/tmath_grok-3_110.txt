### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of $\triangle$ given the equations:
1. $\triangle + q = 59$
2. $(\triangle + q) + q = 106$

Letâ€™s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and formatting the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find $\triangle$:
- Subgoal 1: Understand and simplify the given equations.
- Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find $q$ and $\triangle$.
- Subgoal 3: Isolate $\triangle$ and verify the solution.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equations to make them easier to solve.

**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the second equation using the first equation and simplify the expressions to form a system of equations that can be solved for $q$ and $\triangle$.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The first equation is:
\[
\triangle + q = 59
\]

The second equation is:
\[
(\triangle + q) + q = 106
\]

Since $\triangle + q = 59$ from the first equation, substitute this into the second equation:
\[
59 + q = 106
\]

Solve for $q$:
\[
q = 106 - 59 = 47
\]

Now, use $q = 47$ in the first equation to find $\triangle$:
\[
\triangle + 47 = 59
\]
\[
\triangle = 59 - 47 = 12
\]

So, $\triangle = 12$ and $q = 47$.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that the values $\triangle = 12$ and $q = 47$ satisfy both equations.

**How to Achieve**: Substitute $\triangle = 12$ and $q = 47$ into both equations and check if they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first equation:
\[
\triangle + q = 12 + 47 = 59
\]
This satisfies $\triangle + q = 59$.

Check the second equation:
\[
(\triangle + q) + q = 59 + 47 = 106
\]
This satisfies $(\triangle + q) + q = 106$.

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that $\triangle = 12$ and $q = 47$ are correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the value of $\triangle$.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and simplify the given equations (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find $q$ and $\triangle$ (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Isolate $\triangle$ and verify the solution (completed).

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer for $\triangle$, which has been calculated as $\triangle = 12$ and verified.

The goal hierarchy is complete, and all subgoals have been addressed.
