**Problem Restatement**: Express the expression \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\) as a complex number in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Distribute the multiplication in the term \(-2(3 + 6i)\).
2. Subtract the result from the complex number \(5 - 4i\).
3. Simplify the expression to obtain the real and imaginary parts in the form \(a + bi\).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Distribute the multiplication in \(-2(3 + 6i)\).
How to Achieve: Multiply \(-2\) by each term inside the parentheses, handling the real and imaginary parts separately.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute \(-2\) across \(3 + 6i\):
\[
-2 \cdot 3 = -6, \quad -2 \cdot 6i = -12i
\]
So, \(-2(3 + 6i) = -6 - 12i\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Subtract the result \(-6 - 12i\) from \(5 - 4i\).
How to Achieve: Combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the subtraction:
\[
(5 - 4i) - (-6 - 12i) = 5 - 4i + 6 + 12i
\]
Combine real parts: \(5 + 6 = 11\)
Combine imaginary parts: \(-4i + 12i = 8i\)
Result: \(11 + 8i\)
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the result \(11 + 8i\).
How to Achieve: Redo the calculation step-by-step to ensure accuracy and check if the result is in the form \(a + bi\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate:
1. Distribute: \(-2(3 + 6i) = -6 - 12i\).
2. Subtract: \((5 - 4i) - (-6 - 12i) = 5 - 4i + 6 + 12i = 11 + 8i\).
The result is consistent and in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a = 11\) and \(b = 8\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Express \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\) as a complex number.
  - Subgoal 1: Distribute \(-2(3 + 6i)\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Subtract the result from \(5 - 4i\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify to obtain the form \(a + bi\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result. (Completed)

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, solution achieved).
The final result is \(11 + 8i\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The complex number is \(11 + 8i\).
