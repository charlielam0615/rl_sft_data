### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression by distributing and combining like terms.  
2. Identify the real and imaginary parts to express the result as a complex number in the form \(a + bi\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\). This will be achieved by distributing the \(-2\) to the second complex number, combining like terms, and expressing the result in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the expression: \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\).  

1. Distribute the \(-2\) to the second complex number:  
   \(-2(3 + 6i) = -2 \cdot 3 + (-2) \cdot 6i = -6 - 12i\).  

2. Rewrite the expression:  
   \(5 - 4i - 6 - 12i\).  

3. Combine like terms:  
   - Real parts: \(5 - 6 = -1\).  
   - Imaginary parts: \(-4i - 12i = -16i\).  

Thus, the expression simplifies to: \(-1 - 16i\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the simplified expression \(-1 - 16i\). This will be achieved by rechecking the calculations and ensuring the result is in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Original expression: \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\).  
- Recalculate:  
  - Distribute: \(-2(3 + 6i) = -6 - 12i\).  
  - Combine: \(5 - 4i - 6 - 12i = (5 - 6) + (-4i - 12i) = -1 - 16i\).  
- The result \(-1 - 16i\) is in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a = -1\) and \(b = -16\).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the result is correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Express \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\) as a complex number.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by distributing and combining like terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the result in the form \(a + bi\) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the simplified expression (completed in Step 3).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the expression has been simplified to \(-1 - 16i\), which is a complex number in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The expression \((5 - 4i) - 2(3 + 6i)\) simplifies to the complex number \(-1 - 16i\).
