Goal of this step: Use the given equations to solve for $ q $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given two equations:  

1. $ \triangle + q = 59 $  
2. $ (\triangle + q) + q = 106 $  

From the first equation, substitute $ \triangle + q = 59 $ into the second equation:  
$$
59 + q = 106
$$  

Now, solve for $ q $:  
$$
q = 106 - 59 = 47
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the value of $ q $ back into one of the equations to solve for $ \triangle $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know from the first equation that:  
$$
\triangle + q = 59
$$  

Substitute $ q = 47 $ into this equation:  
$$
\triangle + 47 = 59
$$  

Solve for $ \triangle $:  
$$
\triangle = 59 - 47 = 12
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the consistency of the solution with both original equations.

[VERIFY]
1. First equation verification:  
   Given $\triangle = 12$ and $q = 47$,  
   $\triangle + q = 12 + 47 = 59$ ✓ matches the first equation.  

2. Second equation verification:  
   $(\triangle + q) + q = 59 + 47 = 106$ ✓ matches the second equation.  

3. Algebraic consistency:  
   Substitution of $\triangle + q = 59$ into the second equation is valid because the left-hand side $(\triangle + q) + q$ explicitly includes the $\triangle + q$ term defined in the first equation. The arithmetic operations $106 - 59 = 47$ and $59 - 47 = 12$ are correct.  

Both equations are satisfied, and no contradictions exist in the reasoning.
