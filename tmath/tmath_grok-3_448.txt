### Problem Statement
We need to compute the sum \( i^{600} + i^{599} + \cdots + i + 1 \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \). This is a sum of the powers of \( i \) from the 0th power (\( i^0 = 1 \)) to the 600th power (\( i^{600} \)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum efficiently.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the pattern in the powers of \( i \). Achieve this by calculating the first few powers of \( i \) and identifying their periodicity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), compute the powers of \( i \):
- \( i^0 = 1 \)
- \( i^1 = i \)
- \( i^2 = -1 \)
- \( i^3 = i^2 \cdot i = -1 \cdot i = -i \)
- \( i^4 = i^3 \cdot i = -i \cdot i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1 \)
- \( i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i \)

The powers repeat every 4 terms: \( 1, i, -1, -i \). Thus, the sequence is periodic with period 4. For any exponent \( n \), the value of \( i^n \) depends on \( n \mod 4 \):
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( i^n = 1 \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( i^n = i \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( i^n = -1 \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( i^n = -i \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the sum \( i^{600} + i^{599} + \cdots + i + 1 \) as a geometric series. Achieve this by rewriting the sum in a form that matches the geometric series formula \( \sum_{k=0}^n ar^k \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum is \( \sum_{k=0}^{600} i^k \). This is a geometric series with:
- First term \( a = i^0 = 1 \),
- Common ratio \( r = i \),
- Number of terms \( n + 1 = 601 \) (from \( k = 0 \) to \( k = 600 \)), so \( n = 600 \).

The sum of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S = \sum_{k=0}^n ar^k = a \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r} \]
For our series:
- \( a = 1 \),
- \( r = i \),
- \( n = 600 \).

Thus, the sum is:
\[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{600} i^k = \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} \]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum using the geometric series formula \( \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} \). Achieve this by calculating \( i^{601} \), simplifying the denominator, and computing the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, compute \( i^{601} \):
- Since the powers of \( i \) are periodic with period 4, find \( 601 \mod 4 \):
  \[ 601 \div 4 = 150 \text{ remainder } 1 \quad \text{(since } 4 \cdot 150 = 600, \text{ and } 601 - 600 = 1\text{)} \]
- Thus, \( 601 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( i^{601} = i^1 = i \).

Now, substitute into the formula:
\[ S = \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \]

This suggests the sum is 1, but let’s validate, as the denominator \( 1 - i = 0 \) when \( i = 1 \), which is not the case here. The geometric series formula \( \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r} \) assumes \( r \neq 1 \). Since \( i \neq 1 \), the formula is valid, but let’s confirm the result.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the sum \( \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} = 1 \). Achieve this by computing the sum for a smaller number of terms to check the pattern and ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test the sum for the first few terms to confirm the pattern:
- For \( n = 0 \): \( i^0 = 1 \). Formula: \( \frac{1 - i^{0+1}}{1 - i} = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \). Matches.
- For \( n = 3 \): Sum \( i^0 + i^1 + i^2 + i^3 = 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 1 + i - 1 - i = 0 \).
  Formula: \( i^{3+1} = i^4 = 1 \), so \( \frac{1 - i^4}{1 - i} = \frac{1 - 1}{1 - i} = \frac{0}{1 - i} = 0 \). Matches.
- For \( n = 4 \): Sum \( 1 + i - 1 - i + 1 = 1 \).
  Formula: \( i^{4+1} = i^5 = i \), so \( \frac{1 - i^5}{1 - i} = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \). Matches.

The formula seems correct. For \( n = 600 \), we have \( i^{601} = i \), so:
\[ S = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \]
To ensure accuracy, simplify the expression by rationalizing the denominator:
- Denominator: \( 1 - i \). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate \( 1 + i \):
  \[ \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} \cdot \frac{1 + i}{1 + i} = \frac{(1 - i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{1 - i^2}{1 - i^2} = \frac{1 - (-1)}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{1 + 1}{1 + 1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
This confirms the sum is 1.

**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 1: Understand the pattern in the powers of \( i \) (completed).

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the result and provide the final answer. Achieve this by confirming the sum and presenting it clearly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{600} i^k = \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \), as validated. To further confirm, consider the periodicity:
- The sum includes 601 terms (from \( k = 0 \) to \( k = 600 \)).
- Group terms in sets of 4: \( 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0 \).
- Number of complete sets: \( \lfloor 600 / 4 \rfloor = 150 \). Each set sums to 0, so 150 sets contribute \( 150 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- Remaining term: \( k = 600 \), where \( i^{600} = (i^4)^{150} = 1^{150} = 1 \).
- Total sum: \( 0 + i^{600} = 0 + 1 = 1 \).

Both methods (geometric series and periodicity) yield the sum as 1. Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]
