### Problem Statement
We need to compute the sum \( i^{600} + i^{599} + \cdots + i + 1 \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \). This is a sum of powers of \( i \) from exponent 0 to 600, inclusive.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Understand the pattern of powers of \( i \).
2. Express the sum as a geometric series or identify a pattern to simplify it.
3. Compute the sum using an appropriate method.
4. Verify the result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Understand the pattern of powers of \( i \).
Description: Since \( i^2 = -1 \), compute the first few powers of \( i \) to identify any repeating pattern that can simplify the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The powers of \( i \) follow a cyclic pattern:
- \( i^0 = 1 \)
- \( i^1 = i \)
- \( i^2 = -1 \)
- \( i^3 = i \cdot i^2 = -i \)
- \( i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 \)

The pattern repeats every 4 terms: \( 1, i, -1, -i \). Thus, \( i^n \) depends on \( n \mod 4 \):
- If \( n \mod 4 = 0 \), \( i^n = 1 \).
- If \( n \mod 4 = 1 \), \( i^n = i \).
- If \( n \mod 4 = 2 \), \( i^n = -1 \).
- If \( n \mod 4 = 3 \), \( i^n = -i \).

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Based on the cyclic pattern identified, adjust the subgoals to focus on leveraging the periodicity:
1. Group the terms in the sum by their values based on the exponent modulo 4.
2. Count the number of terms for each value (1, i, -1, -i).
3. Compute the sum by multiplying the count of each value by the corresponding power.
4. Verify the final sum.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Group the terms and count occurrences of each power.
Description: The sum has terms from \( i^0 \) to \( i^{600} \), inclusive. There are \( 600 + 1 = 601 \) terms. Group them by their value (1, i, -1, -i) based on the exponent modulo 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The exponents range from 0 to 600. Since the powers repeat every 4 terms:
- Exponents \( n \mod 4 = 0 \): \( i^n = 1 \). Exponents are \( 0, 4, 8, \ldots, 600 \).
  - Sequence: \( 0, 4, 8, \ldots, 600 \).
  - Number of terms: \( 600 \div 4 + 1 = 150 + 1 = 151 \).
- Exponents \( n \mod 4 = 1 \): \( i^n = i \). Exponents are \( 1, 5, 9, \ldots, 597 \).
  - Sequence: \( 1, 5, 9, \ldots, 597 \).
  - Number of terms: First term is 1, last term is 597. Solve \( 1 + 4k = 597 \Rightarrow 4k = 596 \Rightarrow k = 149 \). Number of terms: \( 149 + 1 = 150 \).
- Exponents \( n \mod 4 = 2 \): \( i^n = -1 \). Exponents are \( 2, 6, 10, \ldots, 598 \).
  - Sequence: \( 2, 6, 10, \ldots, 598 \).
  - Number of terms: \( 598 \div 4 = 149.5 \), so up to \( 596 \): \( 596 \div 4 + 1 = 149 + 1 = 150 \).
- Exponents \( n \mod 4 = 3 \): \( i^n = -i \). Exponents are \( 3, 7, 11, \ldots, 599 \).
  - Sequence: \( 3, 7, 11, \ldots, 599 \).
  - Number of terms: \( 599 \div 4 = 149.75 \), so up to \( 599 \): \( (599 - 3) \div 4 + 1 = 596 \div 4 + 1 = 149 + 1 = 150 \).

Total terms: \( 151 + 150 + 150 + 150 = 601 \), which matches the number of terms.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum using the counts.
Description: Multiply the count of each power by its value and sum the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the counts:
- \( 151 \cdot 1 = 151 \)
- \( 150 \cdot i = 150i \)
- \( 150 \cdot (-1) = -150 \)
- \( 150 \cdot (-i) = -150i \)

Total sum:
\[ 151 + 150i - 150 - 150i = (151 - 150) + (150i - 150i) = 1 + 0i = 1 \]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the sum.
Description: Use an alternative method, such as the geometric series formula, to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum is \( S = 1 + i + i^2 + \cdots + i^{600} \). This is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \), common ratio \( r = i \), and \( n = 601 \) terms. The sum of a geometric series is:
\[ S = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]
Substitute:
\[ S = 1 \cdot \frac{1 - i^{601}}{1 - i} \]
Since \( i^4 = 1 \), compute \( i^{601} \):
\[ 601 \div 4 = 150 \text{ remainder } 1 \Rightarrow i^{601} = i^{4 \cdot 150 + 1} = (i^4)^{150} \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i \]
So:
\[ S = \frac{1 - i}{1 - i} = 1 \]
This matches the previous result.
