### Problem Restatement
We need to express the quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and then find the value of \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) by completing the square.  
2. Identify the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the resulting expression.  
3. Compute \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\). This can be achieved by factoring out the leading coefficient and completing the square inside the parentheses.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the quadratic:  
\[ 10x^2 + 100x + 1000 \]

Factor out the leading coefficient (10) from the first two terms:  
\[ 10(x^2 + 10x) + 1000 \]

To complete the square for \(x^2 + 10x\), take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is 10), divide by 2 to get 5, and square it to get 25. Add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses:  
\[ x^2 + 10x = x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25 \]

So,  
\[ 10(x^2 + 10x) = 10((x + 5)^2 - 25) = 10(x + 5)^2 - 250 \]

Now include the constant term:  
\[ 10x^2 + 100x + 1000 = 10(x + 5)^2 - 250 + 1000 = 10(x + 5)^2 + 750 \]

The quadratic is now in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where:  
- \(a = 10\)  
- \(b = 5\) (since the expression is \(x + 5\), where \(b\) is the constant inside the parentheses)  
- \(c = 750\)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(10(x + 5)^2 + 750\) is equivalent to \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\). This can be done by expanding the expression and comparing it to the original quadratic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \(10(x + 5)^2 + 750\):  
\[ (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \]  
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 = 10(x^2 + 10x + 25) = 10x^2 + 100x + 250 \]  
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 + 750 = 10x^2 + 100x + 250 + 750 = 10x^2 + 100x + 1000 \]

This matches the original quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\), confirming the expression is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals:  
- Main goal: Find \(a + b + c\) for the quadratic expressed as \(a(x + b)^2 + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (completed: \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 750\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + c\) (pending).  
**Current goal**: Compute \(a + b + c\).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals has been updated to reflect the completion of subgoals 1 and 2. The current goal is to compute \(a + b + c\) using the identified values \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 750\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b + c\). This can be achieved by adding the identified constants \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 750\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[ a + b + c = 10 + 5 + 750 = 765 \]

Thus, \(a + b + c = 765\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \(765\).
