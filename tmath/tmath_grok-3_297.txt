### Problem Statement
We need to express the quadratic polynomial \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and then compute the value of \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Rewrite the quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) by completing the square.
2. Identify the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the resulting expression.
3. Compute the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) by completing the square.
How to Achieve: Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms, complete the square inside the parentheses, and adjust the constant term to match the given form.

[IMP]
Start with the quadratic:
\[ 10x^2 + 100x + 1000 \]

Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) (which is 10) from the first two terms:
\[ 10(x^2 + 10x) + 1000 \]

Focus on the expression inside the parentheses, \(x^2 + 10x\). To complete the square, take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is 10), divide by 2 to get 5, and square it to get 25. Add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses:
\[ x^2 + 10x = x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25 \]

Substitute back:
\[ 10((x + 5)^2 - 25) + 1000 \]

Distribute the 10:
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 - 10 \cdot 25 + 1000 = 10(x + 5)^2 - 250 + 1000 \]

Simplify the constant terms:
\[ -250 + 1000 = 750 \]
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 + 750 \]

The quadratic is now in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where:
- \(a = 10\)
- \(b = 5\) (since \(x + b = x + 5\))
- \(c = 750\)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the expression \(10(x + 5)^2 + 750\) is equivalent to \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\).
How to Achieve: Expand the expression \(10(x + 5)^2 + 750\) and compare it to the original quadratic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \(10(x + 5)^2 + 750\):
\[ (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \]
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 = 10(x^2 + 10x + 25) = 10x^2 + 100x + 250 \]
\[ 10(x + 5)^2 + 750 = 10x^2 + 100x + 250 + 750 = 10x^2 + 100x + 1000 \]

This matches the original quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\), confirming the expression is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b + c\) using the identified constants.
How to Achieve: Use the values \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 750\) and calculate their sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[ a + b + c = 10 + 5 + 750 = 765 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \(a + b + c\) for the quadratic \(10x^2 + 100x + 1000\) written as \(a(x + b)^2 + c\).
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (completed: \(a = 10\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 750\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + c\) (completed: \(765\)).

Current Goal: The current goal is to confirm the solution, but since the computation is complete and verified, no further action is needed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \(765\).
