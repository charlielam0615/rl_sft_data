### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the count of three-digit numbers that are neither multiples of 5 nor 7. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers.  
2. Find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 5.  
3. Find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 7.  
4. Account for numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (to avoid double-counting).  
5. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7.  
6. Subtract the result from the total to get numbers divisible by neither.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers. This can be achieved by determining the range of three-digit numbers (100 to 999) and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999, inclusive.  
Total count = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.  
So, there are 900 three-digit numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 5. This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 5 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Smallest three-digit multiple of 5: 100 (since 5 × 20 = 100).  
- Largest three-digit multiple of 5: 995 (since 5 × 199 = 995).  
- Sequence of multiples: 100, 105, ..., 995.  
- This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 100, common difference 5, and last term 995.  
- Number of terms: Solve 100 + (n-1) × 5 = 995.  
  => (n-1) × 5 = 895 => n-1 = 179 => n = 180.  
Alternatively, number of multiples = floor(995/5) - floor(99/5) = 199 - 19 = 180.  
So, 180 three-digit numbers are divisible by 5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 7. This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 7 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Smallest three-digit multiple of 7: 105 (since 7 × 15 = 105).  
- Largest three-digit multiple of 7: 994 (since 7 × 142 = 994).  
- Sequence of multiples: 105, 112, ..., 994.  
- Number of terms: Solve 105 + (n-1) × 7 = 994.  
  => (n-1) × 7 = 889 => n-1 = 127 => n = 128.  
Alternatively, number of multiples = floor(994/7) - floor(99/7) = 142 - 14 = 128.  
So, 128 three-digit numbers are divisible by 7.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of their least common multiple, 35). This can be achieved by identifying the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 35 and computing the count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Smallest three-digit multiple of 35: 105 (since 35 × 3 = 105).  
- Largest three-digit multiple of 35: 980 (since 35 × 28 = 980).  
- Sequence of multiples: 105, 140, ..., 980.  
- Number of terms: Solve 105 + (n-1) × 35 = 980.  
  => (n-1) × 35 = 875 => n-1 = 25 => n = 26.  
Alternatively, number of multiples = floor(999/35) - floor(99/35) = 28 - 2 = 26.  
So, 26 three-digit numbers are divisible by both 5 and 7.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total three-digit numbers (completed: 900).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find numbers divisible by 5 (completed: 180).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find numbers divisible by 7 (completed: 128).  
  - Subgoal 4: Find numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (completed: 26).  
  - Subgoal 5: Use inclusion-exclusion to find numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 (pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Subtract from total to get numbers divisible by neither (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the number of three-digit numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 using inclusion-exclusion.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 using the inclusion-exclusion principle. This can be achieved by combining the counts of numbers divisible by 5, by 7, and subtracting those divisible by both.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using inclusion-exclusion:  
- Numbers divisible by 5: 180.  
- Numbers divisible by 7: 128.  
- Numbers divisible by both (5 and 7): 26.  
- Numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 = 180 + 128 - 26 = 282.  
So, 282 three-digit numbers are divisible by at least one of 5 or 7.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of three-digit numbers that are neither divisible by 5 nor 7. This can be achieved by subtracting the count of numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total three-digit numbers: 900.  
- Numbers divisible by at least one of 5 or 7: 282.  
- Numbers divisible by neither 5 nor 7 = 900 - 282 = 618.  
So, 618 three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking the logic and ensuring no errors in the counts or inclusion-exclusion process. This can be achieved by reviewing the steps and performing an alternative calculation if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Verify counts:  
  - Total numbers: 999 - 100 + 1 = 900 (correct).  
  - Multiples of 5: floor(999/5) - floor(99/5) = 199 - 19 = 180 (correct).  
  - Multiples of 7: floor(994/7) - floor(99/7) = 142 - 14 = 128 (correct).  
  - Multiples of 35: floor(999/35) - floor(99/35) = 28 - 2 = 26 (correct).  
  - Inclusion-exclusion: 180 + 128 - 26 = 282 (correct).  
  - Final subtraction: 900 - 282 = 618 (correct).  
- Alternative check: The numbers divisible by neither 5 nor 7 should not end in 0 or 5 (for 5) and should not be divisible by 7. The calculations align with expected number theory principles.  
The result appears consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
There are 618 three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.
