### Problem Restatement
The 2007 AMC 10 has 25 problems, scored as follows: 6 points for each correct response, 0 points for each incorrect response, and 1.5 points for each problem left unanswered. Sarah plans to attempt the first 22 problems and leave the last 3 unanswered. We need to determine how many of the first 22 problems she must solve correctly to score at least 100 points.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the number of correct answers needed:  
1. Calculate the points from unanswered problems.  
2. Set up an equation for the total score based on correct and incorrect answers among the attempted problems.  
3. Solve for the minimum number of correct answers to achieve at least 100 points.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the points from the 3 unanswered problems.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the number of unanswered problems (3) by the points awarded for each unanswered problem (1.5).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The 3 unanswered problems contribute:  
\[ 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ points} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up an equation for the total score based on the number of correct answers among the 22 attempted problems.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( x \) be the number of correct answers out of the 22 attempted problems. The remaining \( 22 - x \) problems are incorrect. Calculate the total score, including the 4.5 points from unanswered problems, and set it to at least 100 points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( x \) be the number of correct answers. Then:  
- Correct answers contribute: \( 6x \) points.  
- Incorrect answers (\( 22 - x \)) contribute: \( 0 \times (22 - x) = 0 \) points.  
- Unanswered problems contribute: 4.5 points (from Step 2).  
The total score is:  
\[ 6x + 4.5 \]  
We need the total score to be at least 100:  
\[ 6x + 4.5 \geq 100 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality to find the minimum number of correct answers.  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the inequality \( 6x + 4.5 \geq 100 \) for \( x \), ensuring \( x \) is a non-negative integer since it represents the number of correct answers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[ 6x + 4.5 \geq 100 \]  
Subtract 4.5 from both sides:  
\[ 6x \geq 95.5 \]  
Divide by 6:  
\[ x \geq \frac{95.5}{6} \approx 15.9167 \]  
Since \( x \) must be an integer (as partial correct answers are not possible), round up to the nearest integer:  
\[ x \geq 16 \]  
Thus, Sarah needs at least 16 correct answers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that 16 correct answers yield at least 100 points and that 15 correct answers do not.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the total score for \( x = 16 \) and \( x = 15 \), and check if the results align with the requirement of at least 100 points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 16 \):  
- Correct answers: \( 16 \times 6 = 96 \) points.  
- Incorrect answers: \( (22 - 16) \times 0 = 0 \) points.  
- Unanswered: 4.5 points.  
- Total score: \( 96 + 0 + 4.5 = 100.5 \) points.  
This is at least 100 points, satisfying the condition.  

For \( x = 15 \):  
- Correct answers: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) points.  
- Incorrect answers: \( (22 - 15) \times 0 = 0 \) points.  
- Unanswered: 4.5 points.  
- Total score: \( 90 + 0 + 4.5 = 94.5 \) points.  
This is less than 100 points, so 15 correct answers are insufficient.  

The minimum number of correct answers is indeed 16.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many of the first 22 problems Sarah must solve correctly to score at least 100 points.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate points from unanswered problems (completed: 4.5 points).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation for the total score based on correct answers (completed: \( 6x + 4.5 \geq 100 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the minimum number of correct answers (completed: \( x \geq 16 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: 16 correct answers yield 100.5 points, 15 yield 94.5 points).  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”minimum number of correct answers is 16.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Sarah must solve at least **16** of the first 22 problems correctly to score at least 100 points.
