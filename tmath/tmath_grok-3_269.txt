### Problem Restatement
The 2007 AMC 10 has 25 problems, scored as follows: 6 points for each correct response, 0 points for each incorrect response, and 1.5 points for each problem left unanswered. Sarah plans to attempt the first 22 problems and leave the last 3 unanswered. We need to determine how many of the first 22 problems she must solve correctly to score at least 100 points.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the minimum number of correct answers needed:  
1. Calculate the points from unanswered problems.  
2. Determine the total points needed from the attempted problems.  
3. Set up an equation to find the number of correct answers required.  
4. Solve for the minimum number of correct answers.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the points from the 3 unanswered problems and determine the points needed from the 22 attempted problems. This will be achieved by using the scoring rules to compute the contribution of unanswered problems and setting up the equation for the total score.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sarah leaves the last 3 problems unanswered, each contributing 1.5 points.  
Points from unanswered problems: \( 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5 \).  
To score at least 100 points, the first 22 problems must contribute at least:  
\( 100 - 4.5 = 95.5 \).  
Let \( x \) be the number of correct answers out of the 22 attempted problems. Each correct answer gives 6 points, and each incorrect answer gives 0 points. The score from the 22 problems is:  
\( 6x \).  
We need:  
\( 6x \geq 95.5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 6x \geq 95.5 \) to find the minimum number of correct answers \( x \), ensuring \( x \) is a whole number since partial correct answers are not possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
\( 6x \geq 95.5 \).  
Divide by 6:  
\( x \geq \frac{95.5}{6} \approx 15.9167 \).  
Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as Sarah cannot solve a fraction of a problem), take the smallest integer greater than or equal to 15.9167:  
\( x \geq 16 \).  
Thus, Sarah must solve at least 16 problems correctly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that 16 correct answers satisfy the condition of scoring at least 100 points and that 15 correct answers do not. This will be achieved by calculating the total score for both cases.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check with \( x = 16 \)**:  
- Correct answers: \( 16 \times 6 = 96 \) points.  
- Incorrect answers: \( 22 - 16 = 6 \), each worth 0 points, so \( 6 \times 0 = 0 \).  
- Unanswered problems: \( 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5 \) points.  
- Total score: \( 96 + 0 + 4.5 = 100.5 \).  
Since \( 100.5 \geq 100 \), this satisfies the condition.  

**Check with \( x = 15 \)**:  
- Correct answers: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) points.  
- Incorrect answers: \( 22 - 15 = 7 \), each worth 0 points, so \( 7 \times 0 = 0 \).  
- Unanswered problems: \( 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5 \) points.  
- Total score: \( 90 + 0 + 4.5 = 94.5 \).  
Since \( 94.5 < 100 \), this does not satisfy the condition.  

Thus, the minimum number of correct answers is 16.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the minimum number of correct answers Sarah needs out of 22 attempted problems to score at least 100 points.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate points from 3 unanswered problems (completed: 4.5 points).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine points needed from 22 attempted problems (completed: 95.5 points).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve the equation for correct answers (completed: \( x \geq 16 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: 16 correct answers yield 100.5 points, 15 yield 94.5 points).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution is complete and correct, which has been achieved through validation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Sarah must solve at least **16** of the first 22 problems correctly to score at least 100 points.
