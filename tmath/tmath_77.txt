Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $a^2 - b^2$ using the identity $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given $a + b = 6$ and $a - b = 2$, substitute these values into the identity:  
$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of identity application and arithmetic operations in calculating $a^2 - b^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Verifying the algebraic identity:  
   The expression $a^2 - b^2$ factors as $(a + b)(a - b)$ by the difference of squares identity. This is a fundamental algebraic identity that holds universally for all real numbers a and b.  
   
2. Verifying substitution of values:  
   Given $a + b = 6$ and $a - b = 2$, substituting these into the identity yields:  
   $$
   a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2
   $$  
   This substitution is valid because the identity directly uses the sum and difference of a and b.  

3. Verifying arithmetic computation:  
   $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ is a correct multiplication.  

4. Cross-check via solving for a and b:  
   Adding the equations $a + b = 6$ and $a - b = 2$ gives $2a = 8 \Rightarrow a = 4$. Substituting into $a + b = 6$ gives $b = 2$. Then:  
   $$
   a^2 - b^2 = 4^2 - 2^2 = 16 - 4 = 12
   $$  
   This matches the result from the identity, confirming consistency.  

All steps align with mathematical principles and cross-verification confirms the result.
