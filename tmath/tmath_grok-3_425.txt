### Problem Statement
We need to find the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 102) is divided by 5250.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers.
2. Determine the remainder when this sum is divided by 5250.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers. This can be achieved using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 102 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the formula \( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \):
- \( n = 102 \)
- \( S = \frac{102 \cdot 103}{2} \)
- \( 102 \cdot 103 = 10506 \)
- \( \frac{10506}{2} = 5253 \)

The sum of the first 102 counting numbers is 5253.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find the remainder when 5253 is divided by 5250. This can be achieved by performing the modulo operation: \( 5253 \mod 5250 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( 5253 \mod 5250 \):
- \( 5253 - 5250 = 3 \)
- Since \( 5253 = 5250 + 3 \), the remainder is 3.

Thus, \( 5253 \mod 5250 = 3 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the calculations by checking the sum and the modulo operation for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Verify the sum: The formula \( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for \( n = 102 \) gives \( \frac{102 \cdot 103}{2} = \frac{10506}{2} = 5253 \). This matches the previous calculation.
- Verify the remainder: \( 5253 \div 5250 = 1 \) with a remainder of \( 5253 - 5250 = 3 \). This confirms \( 5253 \mod 5250 = 3 \).

The calculations are consistent.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Find the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers (completed: sum = 5253).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the remainder when the sum is divided by 5250 (completed: remainder = 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations verified).

Current goal: The problem is solved, as all subgoals are completed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250 is **3**.
