### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers.  
2. Divide this sum by 5250 and find the remainder.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 102 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Apply the formula:  
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{102 \cdot 103}{2} \]  
Calculate:  
\[ 102 \cdot 103 = 10506 \]  
\[ \frac{10506}{2} = 5253 \]  
So, the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is 5253.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sum of the first 102 counting numbers (Completed: Sum = 5253).  
  - Subgoal 2: Divide the sum by 5250 and find the remainder (Pending).  
Current Goal: Divide the sum (5253) by 5250 and find the remainder.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Divide the sum (5253) by 5250 and find the remainder.  
How to Achieve: Perform the division \( 5253 \div 5250 \) to find the quotient and remainder using integer division or modular arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[ 5253 \div 5250 = 1 \text{ (quotient)} \]  
\[ \text{Remainder} = 5253 - (5250 \cdot 1) = 5253 - 5250 = 3 \]  
Alternatively, using modular arithmetic:  
\[ 5253 \mod 5250 = 3 \]  
Thus, the remainder is 3.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the remainder (3).  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the sum and remainder, and check if the sum satisfies the division equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recalculate the sum:  
\[ \frac{102 \cdot 103}{2} = \frac{10506}{2} = 5253 \]  
Recalculate the remainder:  
\[ 5253 = 5250 \cdot 1 + 3 \]  
\[ 5250 + 3 = 5253 \]  
The equation holds, confirming the sum is 5253 and the remainder is 3.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250 is **3**.
