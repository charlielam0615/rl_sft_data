Goal of this step: Determine the vertex $ A $ of the graph of the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the vertex $ A $ of the parabola $ y = x^2 - 2x + 3 $, we use the vertex formula $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $ for a quadratic equation $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $. Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = -2 $, and $ c = 3 $.  

$$
x = -\frac{(-2)}{2(1)} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
$$

Now substitute $ x = 1 $ back into the equation to find the $ y $-coordinate of vertex $ A $:  

$$
y = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2
$$

So, the vertex $ A $ is at $ (1, 2) $.

Goal of this step: Determine the vertex $ B $ of the graph of the equation $ y = x^2 + 4x + 10 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the vertex $ B $ of the parabola $ y = x^2 + 4x + 10 $, we use the vertex formula $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = 4 $, and $ c = 10 $.  

$$
x = -\frac{4}{2(1)} = -\frac{4}{2} = -2
$$

Now substitute $ x = -2 $ back into the equation to find the $ y $-coordinate of vertex $ B $:  

$$
y = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6
$$

So, the vertex $ B $ is at $ (-2, 6) $.

Goal of this step: Calculate the distance between the points $ A = (1, 2) $ and $ B = (-2, 6) $ using the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The distance $ d $ between two points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ is given by the formula:  

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

Substitute $ (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) = (-2, 6) $:  

$$
d = \sqrt{(-2 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

So, the distance between $ A $ and $ B $ is $ 5 $.
