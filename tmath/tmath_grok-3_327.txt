**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the ordered pair \((a, c)\) for the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + 8x + c = 0\), which has exactly one solution (i.e., a double root), given the conditions \(a + c = 10\) and \(a < c\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
2. Use the given condition \(a + c = 10\) to express one variable in terms of the other.  
3. Incorporate the constraint \(a < c\).  
4. Solve for \(a\) and \(c\) to find the ordered pair \((a, c)\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + 8x + c = 0\) to have exactly one solution. This can be achieved by using the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which must be zero for a double root.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the discriminant is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). For the equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0
\]  
Here, \(b = 8\), so:  
\[
8^2 - 4ac = 0 \implies 64 - 4ac = 0 \implies 4ac = 64 \implies ac = 16
\]  
Thus, the condition for exactly one solution is \(ac = 16\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the conditions \(a + c = 10\) and \(ac = 16\) to solve for \(a\) and \(c\), ensuring \(a < c\). This can be achieved by setting up a system of equations and solving for the variables.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
We have the system:  
1. \(a + c = 10\)  
2. \(ac = 16\)  

From the first equation, express \(c\) in terms of \(a\):  
\[
c = 10 - a
\]  
Substitute into the second equation:  
\[
a(10 - a) = 16
\]  
\[
10a - a^2 = 16 \implies a^2 - 10a + 16 = 0
\]  
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 16\):  
\[
\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = 100 - 64 = 36
\]  
\[
a = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10 \pm 6}{2}
\]  
\[
a = \frac{10 + 6}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{10 - 6}{2} = 2
\]  
For each value of \(a\), find \(c\):  
- If \(a = 8\), then \(c = 10 - 8 = 2\).  
- If \(a = 2\), then \(c = 10 - 2 = 8\).  

Now, apply the condition \(a < c\):  
- For \(a = 8\), \(c = 2\): \(8 < 2\) is false.  
- For \(a = 2\), \(c = 8\): \(2 < 8\) is true.  

Thus, the pair \((a, c) = (2, 8)\) satisfies \(a < c\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the solution \((a, c) = (2, 8)\) satisfies all conditions: the quadratic equation has exactly one solution, \(a + c = 10\), and \(a < c\). This can be achieved by substituting \(a = 2\) and \(c = 8\) into the discriminant and checking the constraints.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(a = 2\), \(c = 8\) into the discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 8^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = 64 - 64 = 0
\]  
The discriminant is zero, confirming the quadratic \(2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0\) has exactly one solution.  
Check \(a + c = 10\):  
\[
2 + 8 = 10
\]  
Check \(a < c\):  
\[
2 < 8
\]  
Both conditions are satisfied.  

To ensure completeness, verify the quadratic has one solution by solving:  
\[
2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0 \implies x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 \implies (x + 2)^2 = 0 \implies x = -2
\]  
The equation has a double root at \(x = -2\), confirming exactly one solution.
