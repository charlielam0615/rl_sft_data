**Problem Statement**: We need to find the positive value of \( n \) for which the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \) has exactly one solution in \( x \), where \( n \) is a real number.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the positive value of \( n \).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
- Subgoal 2: Apply this condition to the given equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve for \( n \) and identify the positive value.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Understand the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
How to Achieve: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), exactly one solution occurs when the discriminant is zero (\( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0 \)).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = 4 \)  
- \( b = n \)  
- \( c = 25 \)  
The discriminant is given by:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]  
For exactly one solution, set the discriminant to zero:  
\[ n^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 0 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \( n \) using the discriminant condition.  
How to Achieve: Compute the discriminant equation and solve for \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ n^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 0 \]  
\[ n^2 - 400 = 0 \]  
\[ n^2 = 400 \]  
\[ n = \pm \sqrt{400} = \pm 20 \]  
The possible values of \( n \) are \( n = 20 \) and \( n = -20 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( n = 20 \) and \( n = -20 \) produce exactly one solution and select the positive value.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 20 \) and \( n = -20 \) into the discriminant to confirm it equals zero, and check the problem’s requirement for the positive \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( n = 20 \):  
\[ \Delta = 20^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 400 - 400 = 0 \]  
This confirms one solution.  
For \( n = -20 \):  
\[ \Delta = (-20)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 400 - 400 = 0 \]  
This also confirms one solution.  
The problem asks for the positive value of \( n \), so we select \( n = 20 \).

### Step 5

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the positive value of \( n \) for which \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \) has exactly one solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for one solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the condition to the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( n \) and identify the positive value (completed).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution by confirming the positive value of \( n \).  
The positive value of \( n \) is 20, as it satisfies the discriminant condition and the problem’s requirement.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The positive value of \( n \) is \( 20 \).
