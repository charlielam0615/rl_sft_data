### Problem Statement
We need to find the positive value of \( n \) for which the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \) has exactly one solution in \( x \). A quadratic equation has exactly one solution when its discriminant is zero, meaning the roots are repeated (a double root).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the positive value of \( n \).  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
- Subgoal 2: Write the quadratic equation in standard form and compute its discriminant.  
- Subgoal 3: Set the discriminant equal to zero to find the value(s) of \( n \).  
- Subgoal 4: Determine which value of \( n \) is positive.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution. This requires understanding that a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) has exactly one solution when its discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0 \).

For the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \), the coefficients are:  
- \( a = 4 \)  
- \( b = n \)  
- \( c = 25 \)  
The discriminant is given by \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). For exactly one solution, we need \( \Delta = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the discriminant of the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \) and set it equal to zero to solve for \( n \). This involves substituting the coefficients into the discriminant formula and solving the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the coefficients \( a = 4 \), \( b = n \), and \( c = 25 \), the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = n^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = n^2 - 400 \]  
Set the discriminant equal to zero for exactly one solution:  
\[ n^2 - 400 = 0 \]  
\[ n^2 = 400 \]  
\[ n = \pm 20 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine which value of \( n \) is positive from the solutions \( n = \pm 20 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the solutions \( n = 20 \) and \( n = -20 \), the positive value is:  
\[ n = 20 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( n = 20 \) results in exactly one solution by substituting it back into the discriminant and checking the roots of the quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 20 \) into the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 20^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 400 - 400 = 0 \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), the equation \( 4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0 \) has exactly one solution.  
To confirm, solve the quadratic equation:  
\[ 4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0 \]  
Notice that this can be written as a perfect square:  
\[ (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 5 + 5^2 = (2x + 5)^2 = 0 \]  
\[ 2x + 5 = 0 \]  
\[ x = -\frac{5}{2} \]  
The equation has exactly one solution at \( x = -\frac{5}{2} \), confirming the correctness of \( n = 20 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the positive value of \( n \) for which \( 4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0 \) has exactly one solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for one solution (completed: discriminant \( \Delta = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the discriminant and set it to zero (completed: \( n^2 - 400 = 0 \), so \( n = \pm 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the positive \( n \) (completed: \( n = 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: \( n = 20 \) yields \( \Delta = 0 \) and one root).  
**Current Goal**: Completed validation; the problem is solved.
