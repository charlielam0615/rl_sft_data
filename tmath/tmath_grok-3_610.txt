### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the expected number of 1's when two standard six-sided dice are rolled. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Select Action - Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the expected number of 1's. Subgoals:  
1. Define the random variable for the number of 1's.  
2. Determine the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die.  
3. Calculate the expected number of 1's for each die.  
4. Sum the expected values for both dice to get the total expected number of 1's.  
5. Express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Select Action - Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Define the random variable and calculate the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die.  
- **How to Achieve:** Define a random variable for the number of 1's on each die. Since each die has six faces, compute the probability of rolling a 1 as 1 out of 6 possible outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( X_1 \) be the number of 1's rolled on the first die (0 or 1), and \( X_2 \) be the number of 1's on the second die (0 or 1). The total number of 1's is \( X = X_1 + X_2 \).  
For a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is:  
\[ P(\text{roll a 1}) = \frac{1}{6} \]  
The probability of not rolling a 1 is:  
\[ P(\text{not a 1}) = \frac{5}{6} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Select Action - Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the expected number of 1's for a single die.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the definition of expected value for a Bernoulli random variable, where success (rolling a 1) has probability \( \frac{1}{6} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a single die, \( X_i \) (where \( i = 1 \) or 2) is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability \( p = \frac{1}{6} \). The expected value is:  
\[ E[X_i] = P(\text{roll a 1}) = \frac{1}{6} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Select Action - Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the total expected number of 1's for two dice.  
- **How to Achieve:** Since the dice rolls are independent, use the linearity of expectation to sum the expected number of 1's from each die.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the dice are independent, the expected value of the total number of 1's is:  
\[ E[X] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Select Action - Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the calculated expected value.  
- **How to Achieve:** Consider an alternative approach by computing the expected value using the probability distribution of the number of 1's and check if it matches.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach: Define \( X \) as the number of 1's (0, 1, or 2). Compute probabilities:  
- \( P(X = 0) \): Both dice are not 1: \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36} \).  
- \( P(X = 1) \): One die is 1, the other is not: \( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{36} \).  
- \( P(X = 2) \): Both dice are 1: \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36} \).  
Expected value:  
\[ E[X] = 0 \cdot \frac{25}{36} + 1 \cdot \frac{10}{36} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{10 + 2}{36} = \frac{12}{36} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
This matches the previous result, confirming the solution.
