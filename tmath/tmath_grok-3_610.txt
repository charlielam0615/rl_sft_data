**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the expected number of 1's when two standard six-sided dice are rolled. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the expected number of 1's, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the random variable for the number of 1's.  
2. Determine the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die.  
3. Calculate the expected number of 1's for each die.  
4. Sum the expected values for both dice to get the total expected number.  
5. Express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Define the random variable and calculate the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let \( X \) be the number of 1's when rolling two dice. For each die, compute the probability of rolling a 1 (since each die has 6 faces, and 1 is one of them).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define \( X_1 \) as the number of 1's on the first die (0 or 1), and \( X_2 \) as the number of 1's on the second die (0 or 1). Thus, \( X = X_1 + X_2 \).  
For a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is:  
\[ P(\text{roll a 1}) = \frac{1}{6} \]  
The probability of not rolling a 1 is:  
\[ P(\text{not a 1}) = \frac{5}{6} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the expected number of 1's for each die.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the definition of expected value for a Bernoulli random variable, where \( X_i = 1 \) if the die shows a 1, and \( X_i = 0 \) otherwise.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each die, \( X_i \) (where \( i = 1, 2 \)) is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability \( p = \frac{1}{6} \). The expected value is:  
\[ E[X_i] = 1 \cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \]  
So, for each die, the expected number of 1's is \( \frac{1}{6} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Sum the expected values for both dice and express the result as a common fraction.  
- **How to Achieve**: Since the dice rolls are independent, the total expected number of 1's is the sum of the expected values for each die. Add the fractions and simplify if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the dice are independent, the expected value of the total number of 1's is:  
\[ E[X] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
The result is already a common fraction.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated expected value.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use an alternative method, such as listing possible outcomes for the number of 1's and computing the expected value directly, to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider the possible values of \( X \) (number of 1's): 0, 1, or 2.  
- **0 1's**: Both dice show non-1. Probability: \( \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36} \).  
- **1 1**: Exactly one die shows a 1. Cases: (1, non-1) or (non-1, 1). Probability: \( \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} + \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{36} + \frac{5}{36} = \frac{10}{36} \).  
- **2 1's**: Both dice show 1. Probability: \( \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} \).  
Expected value:  
\[ E[X] = 0 \cdot \frac{25}{36} + 1 \cdot \frac{10}{36} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{0 + 10 + 2}{36} = \frac{12}{36} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
This matches the previous result of \( \frac{1}{3} \).  
[/IMP]
