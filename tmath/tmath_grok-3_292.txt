### Problem Restatement
The sequence given is \(2048, 512, 128, x, y, 2, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots\), where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. We need to determine the values of \(x\) and \(y\) and compute \(x + y\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the constant multiplier by analyzing the given terms.
2. Use the constant to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
3. Compute \(x + y\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to identify the constant multiplier. This can be achieved by dividing each known term by its previous term to find the consistent ratio.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the constant multiplier, compute the ratio between consecutive terms:
- From \(2048\) to \(512\): \(\frac{512}{2048} = \frac{1}{4}\).
- From \(512\) to \(128\): \(\frac{128}{512} = \frac{1}{4}\).
- From \(2\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\): \(\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\).
- From \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(\frac{1}{8}\): \(\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4}\).

The constant multiplier is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the constant multiplier by checking if it applies consistently across the sequence, particularly for the terms involving \(x\) and \(y\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the multiplier \(\frac{1}{4}\):
- From \(128\) to \(x\): \(x = 128 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 32\).
- From \(x = 32\) to \(y\): \(y = 32 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 8\).
- From \(y = 8\) to \(2\): \(2 = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\), which holds true.

The constant \(\frac{1}{4}\) is consistent across the sequence.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \(x + y\) using the values of \(x\) and \(y\) found.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step:
- \(x = 32\).
- \(y = 8\).

Compute:
\[ x + y = 32 + 8 = 40. \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the value of \(x + y\).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the constant multiplier (completed: multiplier is \(\frac{1}{4}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Use the constant to find \(x\) and \(y\) (completed: \(x = 32\), \(y = 8\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(x + y\) (completed: \(x + y = 40\)).

Current goal: The main goal is achieved.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \(x + y\) is \(40\).
