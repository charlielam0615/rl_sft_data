### Problem Statement
We are given a sequence \(2048, 512, 128, x, y, 2, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots\), where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. We need to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) and compute \(x + y\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \(x\), \(y\), and their sum:  
1. Determine the constant multiplier between consecutive terms in the sequence.  
2. Use the constant to find the missing terms \(x\) and \(y\).  
3. Compute the sum \(x + y\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the constant multiplier between consecutive terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the ratio between pairs of known consecutive terms (e.g., \(512 \div 2048\), \(128 \div 512\), etc.) to identify the constant multiplier.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the constant multiplier, compute the ratios of consecutive terms:  
- From \(2048\) to \(512\): \(\frac{512}{2048} = \frac{1}{4}\).  
- From \(512\) to \(128\): \(\frac{128}{512} = \frac{1}{4}\).  
- From \(2\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\): \(\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\).  
- From \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(\frac{1}{8}\): \(\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{4}\).  

The constant multiplier is consistently \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the constant multiplier \(\frac{1}{4}\) holds across the sequence, especially for terms involving \(x\) and \(y\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the constant multiplier to compute \(x\) and \(y\) and check if the sequence progresses correctly to the known terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the constant multiplier \(\frac{1}{4}\):  
- The term before \(x\) is \(128\). Thus, \(x = 128 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 32\).  
- The term before \(y\) is \(x = 32\). Thus, \(y = 32 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 8\).  
- The term after \(y\) is \(2\). Check: \(y \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 2\), which matches.  
- The term after \(2\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Check: \(2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\), which matches.  

The constant multiplier \(\frac{1}{4}\) is valid across the sequence.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum \(x + y\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values of \(x = 32\) and \(y = 8\) from the previous step and add them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have \(x = 32\) and \(y = 8\).  
Compute: \(x + y = 32 + 8 = 40\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(x + y\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the constant multiplier (completed: \(\frac{1}{4}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find \(x\) and \(y\) (completed: \(x = 32\), \(y = 8\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(x + y\) (completed: \(40\)).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(x + y\) (achieved).  

The solution is complete, with \(x + y = 40\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \(x + y\) is \(40\).
