**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \( \log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2} \), we need to isolate \( r \). This involves the following subgoals:  
1. Convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form to eliminate the logarithm.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( r \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid in the context of the logarithm.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert the logarithmic equation \( \log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2} \) to its exponential form and solve for \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the logarithmic equation using the definition of logarithms (\( \log_b (a) = c \implies b^c = a \)), then isolate \( r \) by performing algebraic operations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( \log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2} \), we rewrite it in exponential form:  
\[ 81^{-\frac{1}{2}} = 2r - 1 \]  
Since \( 81 = 9^2 = (3^2)^2 = 3^4 \), we have:  
\[ 81^{-\frac{1}{2}} = (3^4)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9} \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 2r - 1 = \frac{1}{9} \]  
Add 1 to both sides:  
\[ 2r = \frac{1}{9} + 1 = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{9}{9} = \frac{10}{9} \]  
Divide by 2:  
\[ r = \frac{\frac{10}{9}}{2} = \frac{10}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9} \]  
So, \( r = \frac{5}{9} \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) satisfies the original equation and is valid in the context of the logarithm.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) back into the original equation and check if the left-hand side equals \(-\frac{1}{2}\). Also, ensure the argument of the logarithm (\( 2r - 1 \)) is positive, as logarithms are only defined for positive arguments.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) into \( \log_{81} (2r - 1) \):  
\[ 2r - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - \frac{9}{9} = \frac{1}{9} \]  
Now compute:  
\[ \log_{81} \left( \frac{1}{9} \right) \]  
Since \( \frac{1}{9} = 9^{-1} \) and \( 9 = 81^{\frac{1}{2}} = (3^4)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 3^2 \), we have:  
\[ \frac{1}{9} = (3^2)^{-1} = 3^{-2} \]  
Thus:  
\[ \log_{81} (3^{-2}) = \log_{(3^4)} (3^{-2}) = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2} \]  
This matches the right-hand side of the original equation, so \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) is correct.  
Next, check the domain: \( 2r - 1 = \frac{1}{9} > 0 \), which is satisfied.
