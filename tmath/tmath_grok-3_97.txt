**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \(\log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the logarithmic equation:
1. Convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form to eliminate the logarithm.
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( 2r - 1 \).
3. Isolate \( r \) to find its value.
4. Verify the solution by checking the domain and substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the logarithmic equation \(\log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2}\) to its exponential form and solve for \( 2r - 1 \). This will be achieved by applying the definition of logarithms: if \(\log_b (a) = c\), then \(b^c = a\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \(\log_{81} (2r - 1) = -\frac{1}{2}\), rewrite it in exponential form:
\[
81^{-\frac{1}{2}} = 2r - 1
\]
Since \(81 = 9^2 = (3^2)^2 = 3^4\), compute \(81^{-\frac{1}{2}}\):
\[
81^{-\frac{1}{2}} = (3^4)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{4 \cdot -\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}
\]
Thus:
\[
2r - 1 = \frac{1}{9}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(2r - 1 = \frac{1}{9}\) for \( r \). This will be achieved by isolating \( r \) through algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with:
\[
2r - 1 = \frac{1}{9}
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
2r = \frac{1}{9} + 1 = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{9}{9} = \frac{10}{9}
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
r = \frac{\frac{10}{9}}{2} = \frac{10}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9}
\]
So, \( r = \frac{5}{9} \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking the domain of the logarithm. The argument of \(\log_{81} (2r - 1)\) must be positive (\(2r - 1 > 0\)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, check the domain:
\[
2r - 1 > 0 \implies 2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - \frac{9}{9} = \frac{1}{9} > 0
\]
The domain condition is satisfied.

Now, substitute \( r = \frac{5}{9} \) into the original equation:
\[
2r - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - 1 = \frac{1}{9}
\]
Compute:
\[
\log_{81} \left( \frac{1}{9} \right)
\]
Since \(81 = 3^4\) and \(\frac{1}{9} = 9^{-1} = (3^2)^{-1} = 3^{-2}\), we have:
\[
\log_{81} (3^{-2}) = \log_{3^4} (3^{-2}) = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
This matches the right-hand side of the original equation, confirming the solution is correct.
