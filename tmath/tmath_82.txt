To determine the value of $ x $ when $ y = 0 $, substitute $ y = 0 $ into the equation $ x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 $:  

$$
x = 2(0)^2 - 3(0) + 7 = 0 - 0 + 7 = 7

The previous steps incorrectly equated finding y-intercepts with substituting y=0 into the equation. A y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis (x=0), not where y=0 (which would be an x-intercept). The correct approach is to set x=0 in the equation x = 2y² - 3y + 7 and solve for y:  
0 = 2y² - 3y + 7.  

Calculating the discriminant D = (-3)² - 4(2)(7) = 9 - 56 = -47. Since D < 0, there are no real solutions for y. This means the graph does not intersect the y-axis, resulting in **0 y-intercepts**.  

The prior reasoning incorrectly solved for x when y=0 (an x-intercept), which is a fundamental misunderstanding of intercept definitions. The correct number of y-intercepts is zero, not one.

Goal of this step: Set $ x = 0 $ in the equation $ x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 $ and solve for $ y $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the $ y $-intercept(s), we substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation $ x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 $:  

$$
0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7
$$  

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $ y $. To determine the number of real solutions, we calculate the discriminant $ D $ using the formula:  

$$
D = b^2 - 4ac
$$  

Here, $ a = 2 $, $ b = -3 $, and $ c = 7 $. Substituting these values:  

$$
D = (-3)^2 - 4(2)(7) = 9 - 56 = -47
$$  

Since the discriminant $ D $ is negative ($ D < 0 $), the quadratic equation has no real solutions. This means the graph does not intersect the $ y $-axis, and therefore, there are no $ y $-intercepts.

[VERIFY]
The verification focuses on the quadratic equation 0 = 2y² - 3y + 7 derived by setting x = 0. The discriminant calculation used a = 2, b = -3, c = 7. The computation D = (-3)² - 4(2)(7) = 9 - 56 = -47 is mathematically valid. A negative discriminant confirms no real solutions exist for y. Since y-intercepts require real solutions for y when x = 0, the conclusion of zero y-intercepts is logically sound. No errors detected in the reasoning chain.

The graph of the parabola has $\boxed{0}$ y-intercepts.
