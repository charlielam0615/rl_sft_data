### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem of finding the minimum value of the quadratic function into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of function and its properties (e.g., quadratic, parabola).  
2. Determine the vertex of the parabola, as the minimum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) with \( a > 0 \) occurs at the vertex.  
3. Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
4. Evaluate the function at the vertex to find the minimum value.  
5. Verify the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the type of function and its properties.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the given function \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \) to confirm it is a quadratic function and determine if it opens upward or downward based on the coefficient of \( x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The function \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 5 \), \( b = -20 \), and \( c = 1357 \). Since \( a = 5 > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, indicating that the vertex represents the minimum point of the function.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the x-coordinate of the vertex.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) for the quadratic function \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the function \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \), we have \( a = 5 \) and \( b = -20 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is calculated as:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-20}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{20}{10} = 2. \]  
Thus, the vertex occurs at \( x = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate the function at the vertex to find the minimum value.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the function \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \) and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the function:  
\[ f(2) = 5(2)^2 - 20(2) + 1357 = 5 \cdot 4 - 40 + 1357 = 20 - 40 + 1357 = 1337. \]  
The value of the function at \( x = 2 \) is 1337.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the minimum value by checking the calculation and considering an alternative method.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate \( f(2) \) to confirm the result and use the completed square form to verify the minimum value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Recalculation**:  
\[ f(2) = 5(2)^2 - 20(2) + 1357 = 20 - 40 + 1357 = 1337. \]  
The recalculation confirms the result.  

**Alternative Method (Completing the Square)**:  
Rewrite \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \):  
\[ f(x) = 5(x^2 - 4x) + 1357. \]  
Complete the square inside the parentheses:  
\[ x^2 - 4x = (x - 2)^2 - 4. \]  
Thus:  
\[ f(x) = 5[(x - 2)^2 - 4] + 1357 = 5(x - 2)^2 - 20 + 1357 = 5(x - 2)^2 + 1337. \]  
The minimum value occurs when \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), i.e., at \( x = 2 \), and the function value is:  
\[ f(2) = 5(0) + 1337 = 1337. \]  
This matches the previous result, confirming the minimum value is 1337.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the minimum value of \( f(x) = 5x^2 - 20x + 1357 \).
