Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Let the number of days Sam worked be $ x $, and the number of days he did not work be $ y $.
2. From the problem, $ x + y = 20 $ because the total period is 20 days.
3. Sam earns $ 60x $ dollars for the days he works and loses $ 30y $ dollars for the days he does not work.
4. His net earnings are $ 60x - 30y = 660 $.
5. Solve the system of equations to find $ x $ and $ y $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations $ x + y = 20 $ and $ 60x - 30y = 660 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with two equations:

1. $ x + y = 20 $
2. $ 60x - 30y = 660 $

From the first equation, we can express $ x $ in terms of $ y $:  
$ x = 20 - y $.

Now substitute $ x $ into the second equation:  
$ 60(20 - y) - 30y = 660 $.

Simplify the left-hand side:  
$ 1200 - 60y - 30y = 660 $  
$ 1200 - 90y = 660 $.

Solve for $ y $:  
$ 1200 - 660 = 90y $  
$ 540 = 90y $  
$ y = \frac{540}{90} $  
$ y = 6 $.

Thus, the number of days Sam did not work is $ y = 6 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the algebraic solution and its consistency with the problem constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Substitute $ y = 6 $ into $ x + y = 20 $:  
   $ x = 20 - 6 = 14 $.  
   Sam worked 14 days and did not work 6 days.  

2. Calculate earnings:  
   $ 14 \times 60 = 840 $ (earnings from work).  
   $ 6 \times 30 = 180 $ (deductions for days not worked).  
   Net earnings: $ 840 - 180 = 660 $, which matches the problem's statement.  

3. Check the substitution step in the second equation:  
   $ 60(20 - y) - 30y = 660 $.  
   Expanding: $ 1200 - 60y - 30y = 1200 - 90y $.  
   Solving $ 1200 - 90y = 660 $:  
   $ 90y = 540 \Rightarrow y = 6 $.  
   All algebraic steps are valid and consistent.  

4. Cross-verification with the problem's total days:  
   $ 14 + 6 = 20 $, satisfying the total period constraint.  

The solution is consistent and satisfies all equations and constraints.
