Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express both sides of the equation $2^8 = 16^x$ with the same base.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start by expressing $16$ as a power of $2$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we can rewrite the equation as:  

$$
2^8 = (2^4)^x
$$  

Using the property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$, the right-hand side becomes:  

$$
2^8 = 2^{4x}
$$  

Now, both sides are expressed with the same base, $2$.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$, and the current form of the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the current step: The equation has been rewritten as $2^8 = 2^{4x}$, and both sides now share the base $2$. The exponent property $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$ was used to simplify the right-hand side.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Equate the exponents of both sides of the equation $2^8 = 2^{4x}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since the bases are the same and the equation is now in the form $a^m = a^n$, we can equate the exponents:  

$$
8 = 4x
$$  

This simplifies the problem to a linear equation in $x$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the linear equation $8 = 4x$ for $x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve for $x$, divide both sides of the equation $8 = 4x$ by 4:  

$$
x = \frac{8}{4}
$$  

Simplify the fraction:  

$$
x = 2
$$  

Thus, the solution to the equation $2^8 = 16^x$ is $x = 2$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the entire solution process for correctness, including base conversion, exponent rules application, and algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Base conversion verification:  
   - 16 is correctly expressed as 2⁴ (2⁴ = 16).  
   - Substituting 16 with 2⁴ in the original equation yields 2⁸ = (2⁴)ˣ.  

2. Exponent rule application:  
   - The rule (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ is misapplied in the solution. The correct rule is (aᵐ)ⁿ = a^{m·n}.  
   - The solution correctly states (2⁴)ˣ = 2^{4x}, which aligns with the correct exponent rule.  

3. Equating exponents:  
   - With both sides as 2⁸ = 2^{4x}, equating exponents is valid since exponential functions are injective.  
   - 8 = 4x is a valid conclusion.  

4. Algebraic solution:  
   - Solving 8 = 4x by dividing both sides by 4 yields x = 2.  
   - Substituting x = 2 into the original equation:  
     Left side: 2⁸ = 256  
     Right side: 16² = 256  
     Both sides are equal, confirming the solution.  

The only minor issue is the exponent rule statement in step 2 of the solution, which incorrectly writes "a^{m·n}" as "a^{m+n}". However, the application of the rule in the calculation is correct. This is a documentation error, not a computational error. The final answer remains valid.
