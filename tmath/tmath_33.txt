Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Identify which piece of the piecewise function to use for $x = 3$.
2. Substitute $x = 3$ into the appropriate expression.
3. Calculate the value of the expression.
4. Perform self-verification to ensure the correctness of the result.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify which piece of the piecewise function to use for $ x = 3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The piecewise function is defined as follows:
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
2x + 9 & \text{if } x < -2, \\
5 - 2x & \text{if } x \ge -2.
\end{cases}
$$
We are given $ x = 3 $. Since $ 3 \ge -2 $, we use the second piece of the function, which is $ f(x) = 5 - 2x $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $ x = 3 $ into the appropriate expression $ f(x) = 5 - 2x $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = 3 $ into $ f(x) = 5 - 2x $:
$$
f(3) = 5 - 2(3) = 5 - 6 = -1.
$$

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The process and results of evaluating $ f(3) $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The process began by identifying the correct piece of the piecewise function for $ x = 3 $, which is $ f(x) = 5 - 2x $. Substituting $ x = 3 $ into this expression yields $ f(3) = 5 - 2(3) = -1 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of evaluating $ f(3) $ including piecewise function selection and arithmetic calculation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Function selection verification**: The piecewise function defines two cases. For $ x = 3 $, the condition $ x \ge -2 $ is satisfied (since $ 3 \ge -2 $). This correctly maps to the second case $ f(x) = 5 - 2x $. No ambiguity in condition evaluation.

2. **Arithmetic verification**: Substituting $ x = 3 $ into $ 5 - 2x $:
   - Multiplication: $ 2 \times 3 = 6 $
   - Subtraction: $ 5 - 6 = -1 $
   Both operations follow standard arithmetic rules with no calculation errors.

3. **Cross-check**: If $ x = 3 $ were mistakenly applied to the first case $ 2x + 9 $, the result would be $ 2(3) + 9 = 15 $, which is inconsistent with the function's definition. This confirms the correct case was selected.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No contradictions or errors detected.
