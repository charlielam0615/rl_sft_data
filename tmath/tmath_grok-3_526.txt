### Problem Statement
Solve for \( z \) in the equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \), and express the answer in standard form (\( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the terms involving \( z \) on one side of the equation.  
2. Solve for \( z \).  
3. Express \( z \) in standard form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to isolate the terms involving \( z \). To achieve this, move all terms with \( z \) to one side of the equation and constants to the other by performing algebraic operations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \]  

Add \( iz \) to both sides to eliminate \( -iz \) on the left:  
\[ 2 - iz + iz = -1 + 3iz + iz \]  
\[ 2 = -1 + 4iz \]  

Add 1 to both sides to isolate the term with \( z \):  
\[ 2 + 1 = -1 + 1 + 4iz \]  
\[ 3 = 4iz \]  

Divide both sides by \( 4i \):  
\[ \frac{3}{4i} = z \]  

Simplify \( \frac{3}{4i} \):  
Multiply numerator and denominator by \( -i \) to rationalize:  
\[ \frac{3}{4i} \cdot \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{3(-i)}{4i(-i)} = \frac{-3i}{4(-i^2)} = \frac{-3i}{4 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3i}{4} \]  
So,  
\[ z = -\frac{3}{4}i \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \). Substitute \( z \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \) into \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \):  

Left side:  
\[ 2 - i \left(-\frac{3}{4}i\right) = 2 - i \cdot -\frac{3}{4}i = 2 + \frac{3}{4}i^2 = 2 + \frac{3}{4}(-1) = 2 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]  

Right side:  
\[ -1 + 3i \left(-\frac{3}{4}i\right) = -1 + 3i \cdot -\frac{3}{4}i = -1 - \frac{9}{4}i^2 = -1 - \frac{9}{4}(-1) = -1 + \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{4}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]  

Since \( \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \), the solution is valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( z \) in \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \) and express in standard form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Isolate terms involving \( z \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( z \) (completed in Step 2, result: \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express \( z \) in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed in Step 3).  

**Current Goal**: Ensure the solution is in standard form and finalize the answer.  

The solution \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \) is equivalent to \( 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \), which is in standard form \( a + bi \) with \( a = 0 \), \( b = -\frac{3}{4} \).

### Final Answer
\[ z = 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \]  
In standard form:  
\[ \boxed{0 - \frac{3}{4}i} \]
