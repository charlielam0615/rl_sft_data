**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( z \) in the equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \), and express the answer in standard form (\( a + bi \)).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( z \).  
2. Solve for \( z \) by combining like terms and isolating the variable.  
3. Express the solution in standard form \( a + bi \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rearrange the equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \) to isolate terms involving \( z \). This will be achieved by moving all terms with \( z \) to one side and constants to the other side.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \]  

Add \( iz \) to both sides to eliminate \( -iz \) on the left:  
\[ 2 - iz + iz = -1 + 3iz + iz \]  
\[ 2 = -1 + 4iz \]  

Add 1 to both sides to isolate the term with \( z \):  
\[ 2 + 1 = -1 + 4iz + 1 \]  
\[ 3 = 4iz \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( z \) from the equation \( 3 = 4iz \). This will be achieved by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( z \) and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ 3 = 4iz \]  

Divide both sides by \( 4i \):  
\[ z = \frac{3}{4i} \]  

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( -i \) to eliminate \( i \) in the denominator:  
\[ z = \frac{3}{4i} \cdot \frac{-i}{-i} = \frac{3(-i)}{4i(-i)} = \frac{-3i}{4(-i^2)} \]  
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( -i^2 = -(-1) = 1 \):  
\[ z = \frac{-3i}{4 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3i}{4} = -\frac{3}{4}i \]  

The solution is \( z = 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( z \) in \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \) and express in standard form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( z \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( z \) by isolating the variable (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the solution in standard form (in progress).  

**Current Goal**: Express the solution \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \) in standard form \( a + bi \).  
The solution \( z = 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \) is already in standard form, with \( a = 0 \) and \( b = -\frac{3}{4} \).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( z = 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \) by substituting it back into the original equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \). This will confirm the solutionâ€™s correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \) into the original equation:  
Left side:  
\[ 2 - iz = 2 - i \left( -\frac{3}{4}i \right) = 2 - i \cdot \left( -\frac{3}{4}i \right) = 2 - \left( -\frac{3}{4}i^2 \right) \]  
Since \( i^2 = -1 \):  
\[ -\frac{3}{4}i^2 = -\frac{3}{4}(-1) = \frac{3}{4} \]  
\[ 2 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]  

Right side:  
\[ -1 + 3iz = -1 + 3i \left( -\frac{3}{4}i \right) = -1 + 3i \cdot \left( -\frac{3}{4}i \right) = -1 + 3 \cdot \left( -\frac{3}{4}i^2 \right) \]  
\[ -\frac{3}{4}i^2 = \frac{3}{4} \]  
\[ 3 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \]  
\[ -1 + \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{4}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]  

Both sides equal \( \frac{5}{4} \), so the solution is valid.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2 - iz = -1 + 3iz \) is:  
\[ z = 0 - \frac{3}{4}i \]  
In standard form: \( z = -\frac{3}{4}i \).
