Goal of this step: Determine the condition for the function to be real-valued.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The function $ f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} $ is real-valued only when the expression under the square root is non-negative. That is,  
$$
-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0.
$$  
This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, we first find the roots of the quadratic equation $ -10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0 $, and then determine the intervals where the expression is non-negative.

Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $ -10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve $ -10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0 $, we use the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
$$  
where $ a = -10 $, $ b = -11 $, and $ c = 6 $. Substituting these values:  
$$
x = \frac{-(-11) \pm \sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4(-10)(6)}}{2(-10)} = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{121 + 240}}{-20} = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{361}}{-20}.
$$  
Since $ \sqrt{361} = 19 $, we get:  
$$
x = \frac{11 \pm 19}{-20}.
$$  
This gives two solutions:  
$$
x = \frac{11 + 19}{-20} = \frac{30}{-20} = -\frac{3}{2}, \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{11 - 19}{-20} = \frac{-8}{-20} = \frac{2}{5}.
$$  
The roots are $ x = -\frac{3}{2} $ and $ x = \frac{2}{5} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is non-negative.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The quadratic expression $ -10x^2 - 11x + 6 $ is a downward-opening parabola (since the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is negative). Therefore, the expression is non-negative between the two roots $ x = -\frac{3}{2} $ and $ x = \frac{2}{5} $.  

Thus, the solution to the inequality $ -10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0 $ is:  
$$
x \in \left[ -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5} \right].
$$  
This is the domain of the function $ f(x) $.

1. **Quadratic solution verification**:  
   - Equation: $-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0$.  
   - Discriminant calculation: $b^2 - 4ac = (-11)^2 - 4(-10)(6) = 121 + 240 = 361$.  
   - Roots: $x = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{361}}{-20} = \frac{11 \pm 19}{-20}$.  
     - For $+19$: $\frac{30}{-20} = -\frac{3}{2}$.  
     - For $-19$: $\frac{-8}{-20} = \frac{2}{5}$.  
   - Correct application of the quadratic formula with proper sign handling.  

2. **Interval verification**:  
   - The quadratic opens downward ($a = -10 < 0$), so the expression is non-negative between the roots.  
   - Test point $x = 0$ (between $-\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$): $-10(0)^2 -11(0) +6 = 6 \geq 0$.  
   - Test point $x = -2$ (left of $-\frac{3}{2}$): $-10(-2)^2 -11(-2) +6 = -40 +22 +6 = -12 < 0$.  
   - Test point $x = 1$ (right of $\frac{2}{5}$): $-10(1)^2 -11(1) +6 = -10 -11 +6 = -15 < 0$.  
   - Confirms the interval $\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right]$ is correct.  

3. **Endpoint formatting**:  
   - Both endpoints are expressed as common fractions ($-\frac{3}{2}$, $\frac{2}{5}$) as required.  

No errors detected in the solution process, calculations, or reasoning.
