**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the product of two numbers whose sum is 19 and whose difference is 5.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the two numbers using the given conditions (sum and difference).  
2. Set up equations based on these conditions.  
3. Solve the equations to find the numbers.  
4. Calculate the product of the numbers.  
The first subgoal is to define the numbers and set up the equations.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the two numbers and set up equations based on their sum (19) and difference (5). This can be achieved by assigning variables to the numbers and translating the conditions into algebraic equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the larger number.  
From the problem:  
- Sum: \( x + y = 19 \)  
- Difference: \( x - y = 5 \)  
These equations represent the conditions provided.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( x + y = 19 \) and \( x - y = 5 \) to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \). This can be achieved by using algebraic methods, such as elimination or substitution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve the system:  
\[ x + y = 19 \]  
\[ x - y = 5 \]  
Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \):  
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 19 + 5 \]  
\[ 2x = 24 \]  
\[ x = 12 \]  
Substitute \( x = 12 \) into the first equation:  
\[ 12 + y = 19 \]  
\[ y = 19 - 12 = 7 \]  
So, the two numbers are \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the numbers \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 7 \) by checking if they satisfy both conditions (sum = 19, difference = 5). This can be achieved by substituting the values into the original equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the sum:  
\[ 12 + 7 = 19 \] (satisfied)  
Check the difference:  
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \] (satisfied)  
The numbers \( 12 \) and \( 7 \) satisfy both conditions, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the product of the two numbers, \( 12 \) and \( 7 \). This can be achieved by multiplying the numbers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The product of the numbers is:  
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the product of two numbers whose sum is 19 and difference is 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the numbers and set up equations (completed: \( x + y = 19 \), \( x - y = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find the numbers (completed: \( x = 12 \), \( y = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: numbers satisfy both conditions).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the product (completed: \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \)).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal was to calculate the product, which has been achieved.  
The main goal is now complete, with the product being 84.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The product of the two numbers is 84.
