### Problem Restatement
We need to find the product of two numbers whose sum is 19 and whose difference is 5.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the product of two numbers, we can first identify the numbers by setting up equations based on the given conditions (sum = 19, difference = 5). Then, we can calculate their product. Subgoals:
1. Define the two numbers and set up equations.
2. Solve the equations to find the numbers.
3. Calculate the product of the numbers.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to define the two numbers and set up equations based on the given conditions. We will represent the numbers as variables and create two equations: one for their sum (19) and one for their difference (5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the larger number. From the problem:
- Sum: \( x + y = 19 \)
- Difference: \( x - y = 5 \)
These equations represent the given conditions.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the equations \( x + y = 19 \) and \( x - y = 5 \) to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \). We will use the method of elimination or substitution to solve the system of equations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \):
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 19 + 5
\]
\[
2x = 24 \implies x = 12
\]
Substitute \( x = 12 \) into the first equation:
\[
12 + y = 19 \implies y = 19 - 12 = 7
\]
Thus, the two numbers are \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 7 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the numbers \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 7 \) satisfy both conditions (sum = 19, difference = 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Check the sum:
\[
12 + 7 = 19
\]
Check the difference:
\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the numbers are correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the product of the two numbers, \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 7 \).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Calculate the product:
\[
12 \times 7 = 84
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the product of two numbers whose sum is 19 and difference is 5.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the two numbers and set up equations (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find the numbers (completed: numbers are 12 and 7).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the product of the numbers (completed: product is 84).
Current goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The product of the two numbers is 84, and all goals have been achieved.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The product of the two numbers is \( 84 \).
