Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Calculate the amount after the first 1% late charge.
2. Calculate the amount after the second 1% late charge is added to the new total.
3. Provide the final amount of Jenna's bill.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the amount after the first 1% late charge.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The original bill is $400. A 1% late charge is added on the 30th day past its due date. This means the bill increases by 1% of $400, which is calculated as $400 * 1\% = $400 * 0.01 = $4. Therefore, the amount after the first 1% late charge is $400 + $4 = $404.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the amount after the second 1% late charge is added to the new total.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
After the first 1% late charge, the bill is $404. A second 1% late charge is added because Jenna did not pay the bill in the next 30 days. This means the bill increases by 1% of $404, which is calculated as $404 * 1\% = $404 * 0.01 = $4.04. Therefore, the amount after the second 1% late charge is $404 + $4.04 = $408.04.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of both 1% late charge calculations and the final total.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. First late charge calculation:  
Original bill = $400.  
1% of $400 = 400 * 0.01 = $4.  
New total = $400 + $4 = $404.  
This calculation is **correct** because 1% of 400 is indeed 4.

2. Second late charge calculation:  
New base amount = $404.  
1% of $404 = 404 * 0.01 = $4.04.  
Final total = $404 + $4.04 = $408.04.  
This calculation is **correct** because 1% of 404 is 4.04, and the summation aligns with standard percentage application rules.

3. Final total verification:  
The compounded charges are applied sequentially (not simultaneously), which is consistent with typical late fee policies.  
The final amount of $408.04 is **mathematically valid** given the sequential 1% increases.

\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The final bill is \$408.04.
