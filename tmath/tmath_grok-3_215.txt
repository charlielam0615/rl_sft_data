### Problem Restatement
We need to find positive integers \( a \) and \( b \), both \(\geq 2\), such that \( a \star b = a^b + ab = 15 \), and then compute \( a + b \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( a \) and \( b \). Since \( a \star b = a^b + ab = 15 \), and \( a, b \geq 2 \) are positive integers, we can:
1. Test small integer values for \( a \) and \( b \) to satisfy the equation.
2. Solve for \( a + b \) once valid pairs are found.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find positive integers \( a, b \geq 2 \) such that \( a^b + ab = 15 \). We will achieve this by systematically testing small integer values for \( a \) and \( b \), computing \( a^b + ab \), and checking if the result equals 15.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( a, b \geq 2 \) and the result is a small number (15), we start with small values for \( a \) and \( b \). The term \( a^b \) grows exponentially, so we prioritize smaller \( b \) to keep \( a^b \) manageable.

- Try \( a = 2 \):
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 = 8 \neq 15 \)
  - \( b = 3 \): \( 2^3 + 2 \cdot 3 = 8 + 6 = 14 \neq 15 \)
  - \( b = 4 \): \( 2^4 + 2 \cdot 4 = 16 + 8 = 24 \neq 15 \)
  - Higher \( b \) makes \( 2^b \) larger, exceeding 15.

- Try \( a = 3 \):
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15 \) (matches)
  - \( b = 3 \): \( 3^3 + 3 \cdot 3 = 27 + 9 = 36 \neq 15 \)
  - Higher \( b \) increases \( 3^b \), exceeding 15.

- Try \( a = 4 \):
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 4^2 + 4 \cdot 2 = 16 + 8 = 24 \neq 15 \)
  - \( b = 3 \): \( 4^3 + 4 \cdot 3 = 64 + 12 = 76 \neq 15 \)
  - Higher \( b \) makes \( 4^b \) too large.

- Try \( a = 5 \):
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 5^2 + 5 \cdot 2 = 25 + 10 = 35 \neq 15 \)
  - Higher \( b \) makes \( 5^b \) even larger.

Since \( a^b \) grows quickly, larger \( a \) or \( b \) values produce results far greater than 15. The only solution found is \( a = 3, b = 2 \).

Compute \( a + b \): \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( a = 3, b = 2 \) and check for other possible solutions to ensure correctness. We will verify the equation and test for completeness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Verify \( a = 3, b = 2 \):  
  \( 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15 \), which satisfies \( a \star b = 15 \).

- Check for other solutions:
  - From Step 2, we tested \( a = 2, 3, 4, 5 \) with \( b \geq 2 \). Larger \( a \) or \( b \) values make \( a^b + ab \) much larger than 15 due to the exponential term.
  - Consider if \( a = b \): \( a^a + a^2 = 15 \). For \( a = 2 \): \( 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \neq 15 \). For \( a = 3 \): \( 3^3 + 3 \cdot 3 = 36 \neq 15 \). Higher \( a \) yields larger values.
  - Check if swapping \( a \) and \( b \) works (e.g., \( a = 2, b = 3 \)): \( 2^3 + 2 \cdot 3 = 14 \neq 15 \).

No other pairs satisfy the equation. Thus, \( a = 3, b = 2 \) is the only solution, and \( a + b = 5 \).

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find positive integers \( a, b \geq 2 \) such that \( a \star b = a^b + ab = 15 \), and compute \( a + b \).
  - Subgoal 1: Test small integer values for \( a \) and \( b \) to satisfy \( a^b + ab = 15 \).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( a + b \) for valid pairs.
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution and ensure no other solutions exist.

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution \( a = 3, b = 2 \) and \( a + b = 5 \) is complete and correct.

The solution \( a = 3, b = 2 \) was found and validated, with \( a + b = 5 \). No other pairs satisfy the equation based on the systematic testing and validation performed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The only solution is \( a = 3, b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 5 \).

**Final Answer: 5**
