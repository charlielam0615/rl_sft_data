**Problem Statement**: Given the operation \( a \star b = a^b + ab \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers \(\geq 2\), find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \star b = 15 \), and compute \( a + b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the operation \( a \star b = a^b + ab \) and set up the equation \( a^b + ab = 15 \).  
- Subgoal 2: Since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers \(\geq 2\), test possible values for \( a \) and \( b \) to satisfy the equation.  
- Subgoal 3: Compute \( a + b \) for the valid pair(s).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( a^b + ab = 15 \) for positive integers \( a, b \geq 2 \). Achieve this by testing small integer values for \( a \) and \( b \), starting with the smallest possible values (\( a = 2, b = 2 \)) and incrementing systematically, as the exponential term \( a^b \) grows quickly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test possible values for \( a \) and \( b \):  
- For \( a = 2 \):  
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 = 8 \neq 15 \)  
  - \( b = 3 \): \( 2^3 + 2 \cdot 3 = 8 + 6 = 14 \neq 15 \)  
  - \( b = 4 \): \( 2^4 + 2 \cdot 4 = 16 + 8 = 24 > 15 \)  
  - Higher \( b \) will make \( 2^b \) even larger, so no solutions for \( a = 2 \).  

- For \( a = 3 \):  
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15 \) (This works!)  
  - \( b = 3 \): \( 3^3 + 3 \cdot 3 = 27 + 9 = 36 > 15 \)  
  - Higher \( b \) will make \( 3^b \) larger, so no further solutions for \( a = 3 \).  

- For \( a = 4 \):  
  - \( b = 2 \): \( 4^2 + 4 \cdot 2 = 16 + 8 = 24 > 15 \)  
  - Higher \( b \) will make \( 4^b \) even larger, so no solutions for \( a = 4 \).  

- For \( a \geq 5 \):  
  - Even for \( b = 2 \), \( a^b = 5^2 = 25 > 15 \), and adding \( ab \geq 10 \) makes the sum much larger than 15. No solutions for \( a \geq 5 \).  

The only solution is \( a = 3, b = 2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( a = 3, b = 2 \) and check for other possible solutions by considering if we missed any pairs, including the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are swapped (i.e., \( b \star a \)).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Validate \( a = 3, b = 2 \):  
  - \( 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15 \), which satisfies \( a \star b = 15 \).  
- Check if the operation is commutative (\( a \star b = b \star a \)):  
  - For \( b \star a \), compute \( b \star a = b^a + ba \).  
  - Test \( b = 3, a = 2 \): \( 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15 \). This also works, indicating \( (a, b) = (2, 3) \) is a solution.  
- Reconfirm other pairs: From Step 2, no other pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a, b \geq 2 \) satisfy \( a^b + ab = 15 \).  
- The solutions are \( (a, b) = (3, 2) \) and \( (a, b) = (2, 3) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( a + b \) such that \( a \star b = 15 \), where \( a \star b = a^b + ab \) and \( a, b \geq 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \( a^b + ab = 15 \). (Completed in Step 1)  
  - Subgoal 2: Test integer values for \( a \) and \( b \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions and check for completeness. (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( a + b \) for valid pairs. (Ongoing)  

**Current Goal**: Compute \( a + b \) for the valid pairs \( (a, b) = (3, 2) \) and \( (a, b) = (2, 3) \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a + b \) for the valid pairs \( (a, b) = (3, 2) \) and \( (a, b) = (2, 3) \). Since both pairs satisfy \( a \star b = 15 \), calculate \( a + b \) for each and determine if they yield the same sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \( (a, b) = (3, 2) \): \( a + b = 3 + 2 = 5 \).  
- For \( (a, b) = (2, 3) \): \( a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 \).  
Both pairs yield \( a + b = 5 \). Since the problem asks for \( a + b \), and both valid pairs give the same sum, the answer is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( a + b \) is \( \boxed{5} \).
