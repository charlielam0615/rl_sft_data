### Problem Statement
We need to solve the system of linear equations to find the value of \(a + b\):
1. \(a + 4b = 33\)
2. \(6a + 3b = 51\)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of finding \(a + b\) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Compute \(a + b\) using the solutions.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations \(a + 4b = 33\) and \(6a + 3b = 51\) to find \(a\) and \(b\).
How to Achieve: Use the elimination method to eliminate one variable and solve for the other, then substitute back to find the second variable.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve the system:
1. \(a + 4b = 33\)
2. \(6a + 3b = 51\)

First, simplify the second equation by dividing through by 3:
\[
6a + 3b = 51 \implies 2a + b = 17
\]

Now we have:
1. \(a + 4b = 33\)
2. \(2a + b = 17\)

Use elimination to eliminate \(b\). Multiply the second equation by 4:
\[
4 \cdot (2a + b) = 4 \cdot 17 \implies 8a + 4b = 68
\]

Now subtract the first equation from this:
\[
(8a + 4b) - (a + 4b) = 68 - 33
\]
\[
7a = 35 \implies a = 5
\]

Substitute \(a = 5\) into the first equation:
\[
5 + 4b = 33 \implies 4b = 28 \implies b = 7
\]

So, \(a = 5\), \(b = 7\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the values \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\) satisfy both equations.
How to Achieve: Substitute \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\) into both original equations to check their validity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first equation:
\[
a + 4b = 5 + 4 \cdot 7 = 5 + 28 = 33
\]
This satisfies \(a + 4b = 33\).

Check the second equation:
\[
6a + 3b = 6 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 7 = 30 + 21 = 51
\]
This satisfies \(6a + 3b = 51\).

The values \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\) are correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).
How to Achieve: Add the values of \(a\) and \(b\) obtained from the solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\):
\[
a + b = 5 + 7 = 12
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(a + b\).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations \(a + 4b = 33\) and \(6a + 3b = 51\) (Completed: \(a = 5\), \(b = 7\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(a + b\) (Completed: \(a + b = 12\)).

Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\) (achieved).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(a + b\) is 12.
