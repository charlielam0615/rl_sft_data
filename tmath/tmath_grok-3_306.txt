**Problem Statement**: We need to solve the system of linear equations \( a + 4b = 33 \) and \( 6a + 3b = 51 \) to find the value of \( a + b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \( a + b \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).  
2. Compute \( a + b \) using the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( a + 4b = 33 \) and \( 6a + 3b = 51 \) for \( a \) and \( b \). This can be achieved by using the elimination or substitution method to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve the system:  
\[ a + 4b = 33 \quad (1) \]  
\[ 6a + 3b = 51 \quad (2) \]  

Use the elimination method. First, simplify equation (2) by dividing through by 3:  
\[ 2a + b = 17 \quad (3) \]  

Now we have:  
\[ a + 4b = 33 \quad (1) \]  
\[ 2a + b = 17 \quad (3) \]  

Multiply equation (3) by 4 to align the coefficients of \( b \):  
\[ 8a + 4b = 68 \quad (4) \]  

Subtract equation (1) from equation (4) to eliminate \( b \):  
\[ (8a + 4b) - (a + 4b) = 68 - 33 \]  
\[ 7a = 35 \]  
\[ a = 5 \]  

Substitute \( a = 5 \) into equation (3):  
\[ 2(5) + b = 17 \]  
\[ 10 + b = 17 \]  
\[ b = 7 \]  

Thus, \( a = 5 \), \( b = 7 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 7 \) by substituting them into both original equations to ensure they satisfy \( a + 4b = 33 \) and \( 6a + 3b = 51 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check equation (1): \( a + 4b = 33 \)  
\[ 5 + 4(7) = 5 + 28 = 33 \] (Satisfied)  

Check equation (2): \( 6a + 3b = 51 \)  
\[ 6(5) + 3(7) = 30 + 21 = 51 \] (Satisfied)  

The solutions \( a = 5 \), \( b = 7 \) are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a + b \) using the validated values \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 7 \). This can be achieved by simple addition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[ a + b = 5 + 7 = 12 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( a + b \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations \( a + 4b = 33 \) and \( 6a + 3b = 51 \) (Completed: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( a + b \) (Completed: \( a + b = 12 \)).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer for \( a + b \), which has been computed as 12.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( a + b \) is 12.
