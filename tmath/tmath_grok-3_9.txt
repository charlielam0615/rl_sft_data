### Problem Restatement
We need to find the greatest integer value of \( b \) such that the expression \(\frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8}\) is defined for all real numbers. For a rational function to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must never be zero for any real \( x \). Thus, we need the quadratic equation \( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \) to have no real roots, and among all possible integer values of \( b \) that satisfy this condition, we must identify the greatest one.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for the denominator \( x^2 + bx + 8 \) to have no real roots.  
2. Derive the mathematical constraint on \( b \) based on this condition.  
3. Identify all integer values of \( b \) that satisfy the constraint.  
4. Select the greatest integer value of \( b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \) to have no real roots.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). The quadratic has no real roots if \( \Delta < 0 \). Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = b \), and \( c = 8 \). Compute the discriminant and set it less than zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \), the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = b^2 - 32 \]  
For the quadratic to have no real roots:  
\[ b^2 - 32 < 0 \]  
\[ b^2 < 32 \]  
\[ |b| < \sqrt{32} \]  
Since \( \sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = 4\sqrt{2} \approx 4 \cdot 1.414 \approx 5.656 \), we have:  
\[ -5.656 < b < 5.656 \]  
Thus, \( b \) must be a real number such that \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify all integer values of \( b \) that satisfy \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: List all integers \( b \) within the interval \( (-5.656, 5.656) \), considering that \( b \) must be an integer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the inequality \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \):  
- The greatest integer less than \( 5.656 \) is \( 5 \).  
- The smallest integer greater than \( -5.656 \) is \( -5 \).  
Thus, the possible integer values of \( b \) are:  
\[ b = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the integers \( b = -5, -4, \ldots, 4, 5 \) satisfy the condition \( b^2 < 32 \), and check boundary points if necessary.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute \( b^2 \) for the boundary values and confirm they meet \( b^2 < 32 \). Also, test values just outside the interval (e.g., \( b = 6, -6 \)) to ensure the condition fails.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the boundary integers:  
- For \( b = 5 \): \( 5^2 = 25 < 32 \), satisfies.  
- For \( b = -5 \): \( (-5)^2 = 25 < 32 \), satisfies.  
- For \( b = 6 \): \( 6^2 = 36 > 32 \), does not satisfy (discriminant is positive, so there are real roots).  
- For \( b = -6 \): \( (-6)^2 = 36 > 32 \), does not satisfy.  
Since the function \( b^2 \) is symmetric and increasing for \( |b| \), all integers \( |b| \leq 5 \) satisfy \( b^2 < 32 \), and \( |b| \geq 6 \) do not. Thus, the list \( b = -5, -4, \ldots, 4, 5 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Select the greatest integer value of \( b \) from the valid set.  
- **How to Achieve**: From the list of valid integers \( b = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \), identify the maximum value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The valid integer values are \( b = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \).  
The greatest integer is:  
\[ b = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest integer \( b \) such that \( \frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8} \) has a domain of all real numbers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for \( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \) to have no real roots (completed: discriminant \( b^2 - 32 < 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the constraint on \( b \) (completed: \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify all integer values of \( b \) (completed: \( b = -5, -4, \ldots, 4, 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the greatest integer \( b \) (completed: \( b = 5 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to ensure all steps align with the main goal.  
The current goal is to confirm the solution process is complete and correct, which it is based on the tracked subgoals.

### Final Answer
The greatest integer value of \( b \) for which the expression \( \frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8} \) has a domain of all real numbers is \( \boxed{5} \).
