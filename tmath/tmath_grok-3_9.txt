### Problem Statement
We need to find the greatest integer value of \( b \) such that the expression \(\frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8}\) has a domain of all real numbers. The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. Thus, we must ensure the denominator \( x^2 + bx + 8 \) is never zero for any real \( x \), and find the largest integer \( b \) that satisfies this condition.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals to find the greatest integer \( b \) that ensures the denominator has no real roots. Subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for the denominator \( x^2 + bx + 8 \) to have no real roots.  
2. Solve for the values of \( b \) that satisfy this condition.  
3. Identify the greatest integer \( b \) from the solution set.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for the quadratic denominator \( x^2 + bx + 8 \) to have no real roots. This can be achieved by ensuring the discriminant of the quadratic is negative, as a negative discriminant indicates no real solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 8 \), the discriminant is given by:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]  
Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = b \), and \( c = 8 \). Thus:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = b^2 - 32
\]  
For the quadratic to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative:  
\[
b^2 - 32 < 0
\]  
Solving this inequality:  
\[
b^2 < 32
\]  
\[
|b| < \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.656
\]  
Thus:  
\[
-5.656 < b < 5.656
\]  
Since we need the greatest integer \( b \), we consider all integers \( b \) such that \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \). The integers in this range are:  
\[
-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
\]  
The greatest integer is \( b = 5 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( b = 5 \) ensures the denominator has no real roots and that no larger integer \( b \) satisfies the condition. This can be achieved by checking the discriminant for \( b = 5 \) and testing \( b = 6 \) to confirm it does not work.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( b = 5 \):  
\[
\Delta = 5^2 - 32 = 25 - 32 = -7
\]  
Since \( \Delta = -7 < 0 \), the quadratic \( x^2 + 5x + 8 \) has no real roots, so the denominator is never zero, and the domain is all real numbers.  

For \( b = 6 \):  
\[
\Delta = 6^2 - 32 = 36 - 32 = 4
\]  
Since \( \Delta = 4 > 0 \), the quadratic \( x^2 + 6x + 8 \) has real roots. Solving:  
\[
x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 4)(x + 2) = 0
\]  
Roots are \( x = -4, -2 \), so the denominator is zero at these points, excluding them from the domain. Thus, \( b = 6 \) does not satisfy the condition.  

Since \( b = 5.656 \) is not an integer, we check the next lower integer, \( b = -6 \):  
\[
\Delta = (-6)^2 - 32 = 36 - 32 = 4
\]  
Again, \( \Delta > 0 \), so \( b = -6 \) has real roots. Thus, \( b = 5 \) is the largest integer that works.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest integer \( b \) such that the expression has a domain of all real numbers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for the denominator to have no real roots (completed: discriminant \( b^2 - 32 < 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( b \) (completed: \( -5.656 < b < 5.656 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest integer \( b \) (completed: \( b = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified \( b = 5 \) works, \( b = 6 \) does not).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution is complete and correct. The greatest integer \( b = 5 \) has been identified and validated.

### Final Answer
The greatest integer value of \( b \) for which the expression \(\frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8}\) has a domain of all real numbers is \( \boxed{5} \).
