**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all possible values of \( M \) such that the product of \( M \) and \( M - 6 \) equals \(-5\). Then, compute the sum of all such values of \( M \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Formulate the equation based on the given condition.  
2. Solve the equation to find all possible values of \( M \).  
3. Sum the possible values of \( M \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to formulate the equation based on the problem statement. This involves translating the phrase "the product of a number \( M \) and six less than \( M \) is \(-5\)" into a mathematical equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The product of \( M \) and six less than \( M \) is \(-5\). Six less than \( M \) is \( M - 6 \). Thus, the equation is:  
\[ M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ M^2 - 6M = -5 \]  
To form a standard quadratic equation, move all terms to one side:  
\[ M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \) to find all possible values of \( M \). This can be achieved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \( M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \).  
Try factoring: We need two numbers that multiply to 5 (the constant term) and add to \(-6\) (the coefficient of \( M \)). The numbers \(-1\) and \(-5\) satisfy this:  
\[ (-1) \cdot (-5) = 5, \quad (-1) + (-5) = -6 \]  
Thus, the equation factors as:  
\[ (M - 1)(M - 5) = 0 \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ M - 1 = 0 \implies M = 1 \]  
\[ M - 5 = 0 \implies M = 5 \]  
So, the possible values of \( M \) are \( M = 1 \) and \( M = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( M = 1 \) and \( M = 5 \) satisfy the original condition \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \). This involves substituting each value back into the product expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \( M = 1 \):  
\[ 1 \cdot (1 - 6) = 1 \cdot (-5) = -5 \]  
This satisfies the condition.  

Check \( M = 5 \):  
\[ 5 \cdot (5 - 6) = 5 \cdot (-1) = -5 \]  
This also satisfies the condition.  

Both values are valid solutions.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all possible values of \( M \) such that \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Formulate the equation (completed: \( M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( M \) (completed: \( M = 1, 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions (completed: both satisfy the condition).  
  - **Subgoal 4 (current)**: Compute the sum of all possible values of \( M \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is updated to reflect completed subgoals. The current goal is to sum the values \( M = 1 \) and \( M = 5 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of all possible values of \( M \), which are \( M = 1 \) and \( M = 5 \). This involves adding the values together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the values:  
\[ 1 + 5 = 6 \]  
The sum of all possible values of \( M \) is 6.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The sum of all possible values of \( M \) is \( 6 \).  
\[ \boxed{6} \]
