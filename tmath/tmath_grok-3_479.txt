**Problem Statement**: We need to find the number \( M \) such that the product of \( M \) and six less than \( M \) equals \(-5\). Then, compute the sum of all possible values of \( M \). Mathematically, this is expressed as \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \), and we need to find all solutions for \( M \) and sum them.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Formulate the equation from the problem statement.  
2. Solve the equation to find all possible values of \( M \).  
3. Compute the sum of all possible values of \( M \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to formulate and solve the equation \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \). To achieve this, expand the equation into a standard quadratic form, solve for \( M \) using the quadratic formula, and identify all real solutions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation is \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \).  
Expand: \( M^2 - 6M = -5 \).  
Rewrite in standard form: \( M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \).  
Solve using the quadratic formula, \( M = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), \( c = 5 \):  
Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5 = 36 - 20 = 16 \).  
Roots:  
\[ M = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm 4}{2} \].  
\[ M_1 = \frac{6 + 4}{2} = 5, \quad M_2 = \frac{6 - 4}{2} = 1 \].  
Thus, the possible values of \( M \) are 1 and 5.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( M = 1 \) and \( M = 5 \) satisfy the original equation \( M \cdot (M - 6) = -5 \). Substitute each value into the equation to confirm correctness.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( M = 1 \):  
\[ 1 \cdot (1 - 6) = 1 \cdot (-5) = -5 \].  
This satisfies the equation.  

For \( M = 5 \):  
\[ 5 \cdot (5 - 6) = 5 \cdot (-1) = -5 \].  
This also satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of all possible values of \( M \), which are 1 and 5. Add these values to find the final answer.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The possible values of \( M \) are 1 and 5.  
Sum: \( 1 + 5 = 6 \).
