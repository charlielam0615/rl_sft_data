**Problem Statement**: Find the leading coefficient of the polynomial \(-3(x^4 - x^3 + x) + 7(x^4 + 2) - 4(2x^4 + 2x^2 + 1)\) after simplification.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the leading coefficient, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the coefficients through each term in the polynomial.  
2. Collect like terms to simplify the polynomial.  
3. Identify the term with the highest degree and its coefficient.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to distribute the coefficients \(-3\), \(7\), and \(-4\) to each term within their respective parentheses. This will expand the polynomial into individual terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distribute each coefficient:  
- For \(-3(x^4 - x^3 + x)\):  
  \(-3 \cdot x^4 = -3x^4\), \(-3 \cdot (-x^3) = 3x^3\), \(-3 \cdot x = -3x\).  
  Result: \(-3x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x\).  
- For \(7(x^4 + 2)\):  
  \(7 \cdot x^4 = 7x^4\), \(7 \cdot 2 = 14\).  
  Result: \(7x^4 + 14\).  
- For \(-4(2x^4 + 2x^2 + 1)\):  
  \(-4 \cdot 2x^4 = -8x^4\), \(-4 \cdot 2x^2 = -8x^2\), \(-4 \cdot 1 = -4\).  
  Result: \(-8x^4 - 8x^2 - 4\).  

The expanded polynomial is:  
\(-3x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x + 7x^4 + 14 - 8x^4 - 8x^2 - 4\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to collect like terms in the expanded polynomial to simplify it into standard form. This involves combining terms with the same degree.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Combine like terms:  
- **\(x^4\) terms**: \(-3x^4 + 7x^4 - 8x^4 = (-3 + 7 - 8)x^4 = -4x^4\).  
- **\(x^3\) terms**: \(3x^3\).  
- **\(x^2\) terms**: \(-8x^2\).  
- **\(x\) terms**: \(-3x\).  
- **Constant terms**: \(14 - 4 = 10\).  

Simplified polynomial: \(-4x^4 + 3x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 10\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the leading coefficient of the simplified polynomial by finding the term with the highest degree and its coefficient.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The simplified polynomial is \(-4x^4 + 3x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 10\).  
The term with the highest degree is \(-4x^4\), so the leading coefficient is \(-4\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the simplification and identification of the leading coefficient are correct by rechecking the distribution and combination of terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recheck distribution:  
- \(-3(x^4 - x^3 + x) = -3x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x\).  
- \(7(x^4 + 2) = 7x^4 + 14\).  
- \(-4(2x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) = -8x^4 - 8x^2 - 4\).  

Recheck combination:  
- \(x^4\): \(-3x^4 + 7x^4 - 8x^4 = -4x^4\).  
- \(x^3\): \(3x^3\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-8x^2\).  
- \(x\): \(-3x\).  
- Constants: \(14 - 4 = 10\).  

The polynomial \(-4x^4 + 3x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 10\) is correct, and the leading coefficient is \(-4\).  
[/IMP]
