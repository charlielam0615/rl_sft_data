**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(x^3 + y^3\) into intermediate subgoals. To compute \(x^3 + y^3\), we can use algebraic identities or relationships derived from the given equations. A useful approach is to find expressions involving \(x\) and \(y\) (e.g., \(xy\) or \(x^2 + y^2\)) that can help us apply the identity for \(x^3 + y^3\). Subgoals include:  
1. Use the given equations to find \(xy\).  
2. Apply an identity for \(x^3 + y^3\) using \(x + y\), \(x^2 + y^2\), and \(xy\).  
3. Compute the final value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \(xy\) using the given equations \(x + y = 4\) and \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\). We can achieve this by leveraging the identity \((x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the identity \((x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\).  
Given \(x + y = 4\), we have:  
\((x + y)^2 = 4^2 = 16\).  
Given \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\), substitute into the identity:  
\(16 = 8 + 2xy\).  
Solve for \(xy\):  
\(2xy = 16 - 8 = 8 \implies xy = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).  
Thus, \(xy = 4\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(x^3 + y^3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find \(xy\) (completed: \(xy = 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply an identity for \(x^3 + y^3\) using \(x + y\), \(x^2 + y^2\), and \(xy\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final value.  
**Current Goal**: Apply an identity for \(x^3 + y^3\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(x^3 + y^3\) using the identity \(x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)\). We have \(x + y = 4\), \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\), and \(xy = 4\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use the identity \(x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)\).  
First, compute \(x^2 - xy + y^2\):  
Since \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\), we have:  
\(x^2 - xy + y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) - xy = 8 - 4 = 4\).  
Now, apply the identity:  
\(x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16\).  
Thus, \(x^3 + y^3 = 16\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(x^3 + y^3 = 16\). We can verify by finding possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking if they satisfy all given equations and the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, find \(x\) and \(y\) using the equations \(x + y = 4\) and \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\).  
From \(x + y = 4\), express \(y = 4 - x\).  
Substitute into \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\):  
\(x^2 + (4 - x)^2 = 8\).  
Expand:  
\(x^2 + 16 - 8x + x^2 = 8 \implies 2x^2 - 8x + 16 = 8 \implies 2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0 \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\).  
Solve the quadratic:  
\((x - 2)^2 = 0 \implies x = 2\).  
Then, \(y = 4 - x = 4 - 2 = 2\).  
Check \(x^2 + y^2\):  
\(2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8\), which satisfies the equation.  
Compute \(x^3 + y^3\):  
\(x = 2 \implies x^3 = 2^3 = 8\), \(y = 2 \implies y^3 = 2^3 = 8\).  
\(x^3 + y^3 = 8 + 8 = 16\).  
The result matches our computation.  
To ensure completeness, check for other solutions. The quadratic \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) has a double root at \(x = 2\), so \(x = 2, y = 2\) is the only real solution.  
Thus, \(x^3 + y^3 = 16\) is valid.

**Final Answer**:  
\(x^3 + y^3 = 16\).
