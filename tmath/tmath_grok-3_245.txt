### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x^3 + y^3 \) given the equations \( x + y = 4 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( x^3 + y^3 \) into intermediate subgoals. To compute \( x^3 + y^3 \), we can use the identity \( x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) \). We already know \( x + y = 4 \), so we need to find \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \). Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \) is given, we need to determine \( xy \) to compute \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \). Thus, the first subgoal is to find \( xy \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( xy \). We can achieve this by using the identity \( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \). Given \( x + y = 4 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \), we can compute \( 2xy \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the identity \( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \):  
\[ (x + y)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \]  
\[ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 8 + 2xy \]  
Equating:  
\[ 8 + 2xy = 16 \]  
\[ 2xy = 8 \]  
\[ xy = 4 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \). We know \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \) and \( xy = 4 \). We can rewrite \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \) as \( x^2 + y^2 - xy \) and substitute the known values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \):  
\[ x^2 - xy + y^2 = x^2 + y^2 - xy = 8 - 4 = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( x^3 + y^3 \). Using the identity \( x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) \), we can substitute \( x + y = 4 \) and \( x^2 - xy + y^2 = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the identity:  
\[ x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( x^3 + y^3 = 16 \). We can verify by finding the values of \( x \) and \( y \) from the given equations, computing \( x^3 + y^3 \), and checking if it matches.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve for \( x \) and \( y \):  
From \( x + y = 4 \), express \( y = 4 - x \). Substitute into \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \):  
\[ x^2 + (4 - x)^2 = 8 \]  
\[ x^2 + 16 - 8x + x^2 = 8 \]  
\[ 2x^2 - 8x + 16 = 8 \]  
\[ 2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 2 \]  
Then, \( y = 4 - x = 4 - 2 = 2 \).  
Compute \( x^3 + y^3 \):  
\[ x^3 = 2^3 = 8, \quad y^3 = 2^3 = 8 \]  
\[ x^3 + y^3 = 8 + 8 = 16 \]  
This matches our result. Alternatively, consider other possible solutions by solving the quadratic numerically or checking for complex roots, but since \( x = 2, y = 2 \) satisfies both equations and gives a real solution, the result is consistent.
