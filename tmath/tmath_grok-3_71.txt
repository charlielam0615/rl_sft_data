**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the time \( t \) in seconds when the height of a ball, given by the equation \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \), reaches 25 feet. This involves solving the equation \( 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \) for \( t \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the time when the ball reaches a height of 25 feet, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation by substituting \( h = 25 \) into the given height equation.  
2. Simplify the equation into a standard quadratic form.  
3. Solve the quadratic equation for \( t \).  
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they are physically meaningful (i.e., \( t \geq 0 \)).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and simplify the equation for \( h = 25 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( h = 25 \) into \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \), moving all terms to one side, and arranging the equation in standard quadratic form \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( h = 25 \):  
\[ 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ 25 - (45 - 7t - 6t^2) = 0 \]  
\[ 25 - 45 + 7t + 6t^2 = 0 \]  
\[ 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard quadratic form: \( 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \) for \( t \). This will be achieved by using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 6 \), \( b = 7 \), and \( c = -20 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \), identify coefficients:  
- \( a = 6 \)  
- \( b = 7 \)  
- \( c = -20 \)  

Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot (-20) = 49 + 480 = 529 \]  
\[ \sqrt{529} = 23 \]  

Compute the solutions:  
\[ t = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{12} \]  
- First solution:  
\[ t = \frac{-7 + 23}{12} = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333 \text{ seconds} \]  
- Second solution:  
\[ t = \frac{-7 - 23}{12} = \frac{-30}{12} = -\frac{5}{2} = -2.5 \text{ seconds} \]  

Since time cannot be negative in this context, discard \( t = -2.5 \). Thus, \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) seconds is a potential solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) seconds is a valid solution by substituting it back into the original equation \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \) and checking if the height equals 25 feet.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) into \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \):  
\[ h = 45 - 7 \cdot \frac{4}{3} - 6 \cdot \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( 7 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.333 \)  
- \( \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{16}{9} \approx 1.777 \)  
- \( 6 \cdot \frac{16}{9} = \frac{96}{9} = \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.667 \)  

Combine:  
\[ h = 45 - \frac{28}{3} - \frac{32}{3} = 45 - \frac{28 + 32}{3} = 45 - \frac{60}{3} = 45 - 20 = 25 \]  
The height is exactly 25 feet, confirming that \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) seconds is a valid solution.
