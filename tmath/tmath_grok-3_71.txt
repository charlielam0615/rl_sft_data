**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the time when the ball reaches a height of 25 feet, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation by substituting \( h = 25 \) into the given height equation.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( t \).  
3. Interpret the solutions to ensure they are physically meaningful (e.g., non-negative time).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation for when the height is 25 feet. This involves substituting \( h = 25 \) into \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \), rearranging it into a standard quadratic form, and solving for \( t \) using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( h = 25 \) into the equation:  
\[ 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form (\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \)):  
\[ -6t^2 - 7t + 45 - 25 = 0 \]  
\[ -6t^2 - 7t + 20 = 0 \]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) to simplify:  
\[ 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \]  

Use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 6 \), \( b = 7 \), \( c = -20 \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot (-20) = 49 + 480 = 529 \)  
- \( \sqrt{529} = 23 \)  
- \( t = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{12} \)  

Calculate the two solutions:  
- \( t_1 = \frac{-7 + 23}{12} = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333 \) seconds  
- \( t_2 = \frac{-7 - 23}{12} = \frac{-30}{12} = -2.5 \) seconds  

Since time cannot be negative, discard \( t = -2.5 \). Thus, \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) seconds.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) seconds by substituting it back into the original equation to confirm the height is 25 feet.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = \frac{4}{3} \) into \( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \):  
\[ t = \frac{4}{3}, \quad t^2 = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{9} \]  
\[ h = 45 - 7 \cdot \frac{4}{3} - 6 \cdot \frac{16}{9} \]  
\[ = 45 - \frac{28}{3} - \frac{96}{9} \]  
\[ = 45 - \frac{28}{3} - \frac{32}{3} \]  
\[ = 45 - \frac{28 + 32}{3} = 45 - \frac{60}{3} = 45 - 20 = 25 \]  

The height is 25 feet, confirming the solution is correct.
