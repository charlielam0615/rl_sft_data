**Problem Statement**: The probability that Kim has a math test today is \(\frac{4}{7}\). We need to find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The goal is to calculate the probability that Kim does not have a math test today. Since the probability of having a math test is given as \(\frac{4}{7}\), we can achieve this by using the fact that the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes equals 1. Subtract the probability of having a test from 1 to find the probability of not having a test.

The probability of Kim having a math test is \(\frac{4}{7}\). The probability of not having a math test is:

\[
1 - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{7}{7} - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{3}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is \(\frac{3}{7}\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The goal is to verify that the calculated probability \(\frac{3}{7}\) is correct. We can check this by ensuring the probabilities sum to 1 and confirming the calculation is mathematically sound.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, we check that the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events (having a math test and not having a math test) equals 1:

\[
\frac{4}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4 + 3}{7} = \frac{7}{7} = 1.
\]

The calculation is correct since the probabilities sum to 1. Additionally, the subtraction \(1 - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{3}{7}\) is straightforward and follows the rules of probability for complementary events. The answer \(\frac{3}{7}\) is a common fraction as requested.

**Final Answer**

The probability that Kim does not have a math test today is \(\frac{3}{7}\).
