### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of simplifying \(\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{2}}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Combine the fractions into a single expression.  
2. Simplify the resulting expression by rationalizing the denominator or recognizing patterns.  
3. Reduce the expression to its simplest form.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the fractions \(\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{2}}\) into a single expression. This can be achieved by multiplying the numerators and denominators directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is:  
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{1}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}.  
\]  
The denominator is a difference of squares: \((1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2}) = 1^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2 = -1\).  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{1}{-1} = -1.  
\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the simplified result \(-1\). This can be achieved by checking the computation or testing with numerical approximation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, recompute the denominator:  
\((1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2}) = 1 - \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2 = -1\).  
The numerator is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\), so:  
\[
\frac{1}{-1} = -1.  
\]  
Alternatively, approximate numerically:  
\(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), so \(1 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.414\), \(1 - \sqrt{2} \approx -0.414\).  
\[
\frac{1}{2.414} \approx 0.414, \quad \frac{1}{-0.414} \approx -2.415, \quad 0.414 \cdot (-2.415) \approx -1.  
\]  
The result \(-1\) is consistent.
