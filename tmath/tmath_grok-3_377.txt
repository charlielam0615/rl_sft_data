**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{2}}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Multiply the two fractions to form a single fraction.  
2. Simplify the resulting fraction by rationalizing the denominator.  
3. Verify the simplified result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the fractions \(\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{2}}\) to form a single fraction. This can be achieved by combining the numerators and denominators directly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Multiply the fractions:  
\[
\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{(1+\sqrt{2})(1-\sqrt{2})} = \frac{1}{(1+\sqrt{2})(1-\sqrt{2})}.  
\]  
The denominator is a difference of squares: \((1+\sqrt{2})(1-\sqrt{2}) = 1^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2 = -1\).  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{1}{-1} = -1.  
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the simplified result \(-1\). This can be achieved by checking the multiplication and denominator simplification, and optionally computing numerically to confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the denominator: \((1+\sqrt{2})(1-\sqrt{2}) = 1 - \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2 = -1\).  
The numerator is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\), so \(\frac{1}{-1} = -1\), confirming the simplification.  
For numerical validation, approximate \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\):  
- \(1 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.414\), so \(\frac{1}{2.414} \approx 0.414\).  
- \(1 - \sqrt{2} \approx -0.414\), so \(\frac{1}{-0.414} \approx -2.415\).  
- \(0.414 \cdot (-2.415) \approx -1\), which matches the result.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \(\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{2}}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply the fractions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting fraction (completed, result: \(-1\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the simplified result (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The simplified expression is \(-1\).

**Final Answer**: The simplified expression is \(-1\).
