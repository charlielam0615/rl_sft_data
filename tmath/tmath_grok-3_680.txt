### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of 3-letter words that can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D, where letters can be repeated, and each word must contain at least one A. A "word" is defined as any sequence of three letters.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the number of valid 3-letter words. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of possible 3-letter words with repetition allowed.  
2. Calculate the number of 3-letter words that do not contain the letter A.  
3. Subtract the number of words without A from the total to get the number of words with at least one A.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the total number of possible 3-letter words using letters A, B, C, and D with repetition allowed.  
- **How to Achieve:** For each of the 3 positions in the word, there are 4 choices (A, B, C, or D). Multiply the number of choices for each position: \(4 \times 4 \times 4\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the total number of 3-letter words:  
- Each position has 4 possible letters (A, B, C, D).  
- Number of words = \(4^3 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64\).  
Thus, there are 64 possible 3-letter words.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the number of 3-letter words that do not contain the letter A.  
- **How to Achieve:** For each of the 3 positions, use only the letters B, C, or D (3 choices). Multiply the number of choices for each position: \(3 \times 3 \times 3\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of 3-letter words without A:  
- Each position has 3 possible letters (B, C, D).  
- Number of words = \(3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).  
Thus, there are 27 words that do not contain A.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the number of 3-letter words that contain at least one A.  
- **How to Achieve:** Subtract the number of words without A (from Step 3) from the total number of words (from Step 2): \(64 - 27\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of words with at least one A:  
- Total words = 64 (from Step 2).  
- Words without A = 27 (from Step 3).  
- Words with at least one A = \(64 - 27 = 37\).  
Thus, there are 37 valid 3-letter words.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the correctness of the solution by checking the calculations and considering an alternative approach.  
- **How to Achieve:** Recalculate using a complementary method (e.g., count words with exactly 1, 2, or 3 A’s) and compare results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach: Count words with exactly 1, 2, or 3 A’s.  
- **Exactly 1 A:** Choose 1 position for A (\(\binom{3}{1} = 3\)). Other 2 positions have 3 choices (B, C, D): \(3^2 = 9\). Total = \(3 \times 9 = 27\).  
- **Exactly 2 A’s:** Choose 2 positions for A (\(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)). Other position has 3 choices: Total = \(3 \times 3 = 9\).  
- **Exactly 3 A’s:** Choose 3 positions for A (\(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)). Only A possible: Total = \(1 \times 1 = 1\).  
- Sum: \(27 + 9 + 1 = 37\).  

This matches the previous result (37), confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
List all goals and highlight the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of 3-letter words using A, B, C, D with at least one A.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total number of 3-letter words (completed: 64).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate number of words without A (completed: 27).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate number of words with at least one A (completed: 37).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: confirmed 37).  

**Current Goal:** None (problem solved).  
The final answer is 37 valid 3-letter words.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
There are 37 3-letter words that can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D with repetition allowed, containing at least one A.
