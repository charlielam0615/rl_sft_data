**Problem Restated**

We need to find the value of \( f(g(2)) \), where \( g(x) = x^2 \) and \( f(x) = 2 - 1 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve \( f(g(2)) \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute \( g(2) \) by applying the function \( g(x) = x^2 \).
2. Use the result from \( g(2) \) as the input to \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \) to find \( f(g(2)) \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( g(2) \).

Description: Apply the function \( g(x) = x^2 \) to the input \( x = 2 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

To compute \( g(2) \):

\[ g(x) = x^2 \]

\[ g(2) = 2^2 = 4 \]

So, \( g(2) = 4 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( f(g(2)) \).

Description: Use the result \( g(2) = 4 \) as the input to \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

To compute \( f(g(2)) \):

Since \( g(2) = 4 \), we need \( f(4) \).

\[ f(x) = 2x - 1 \]

\[ f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \]

So, \( f(g(2)) = 7 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]

Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(g(2)) \).

Description: Recompute \( g(2) \) and \( f(g(2)) \) to ensure correctness.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Recompute:

1. \( g(2) = 2^2 = 4 \).

2. \( f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \).

The result matches: \( f(g(2)) = 7 \).

[REVIEW]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \( f(g(2)) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(2) \). [Completed: \( g(2) = 4 \)]
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(2)) \). [Completed: \( f(g(2)) = 7 \)]
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the computation. [Completed: Verified \( f(g(2)) = 7 \)]

Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved.

Final Answer: \( f(g(2)) = 7 \).
