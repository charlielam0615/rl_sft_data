**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( f(g(2)) \), where \( g(x) = x^2 \) and \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(g(2)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(2) \) using the function \( g(x) = x^2 \).  
2. Use the result of \( g(2) \) as the input to the function \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \).  
3. Compute \( f(g(2)) \) to find the final value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(2) \). This involves substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function \( g(x) = x^2 \).

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( g(x) = x^2 \):  
\( g(2) = 2^2 = 4 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(2)) \), which is \( f(4) \), using the result from Step 2 and the function \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \):  
\( f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(2)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(2) \) (completed: \( g(2) = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(2)) \), i.e., \( f(4) \) (completed: \( f(4) = 7 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final value of \( f(g(2)) \).  
The calculations show \( f(g(2)) = 7 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(2)) = 7 \).
