Goal of this step: Understand the original graph and its minimum point.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The graph of the equation $ y = |x| - 3 $ is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the point $ (0, -3) $. This is because the absolute value function $ |x| $ has its vertex at $ (0, 0) $, and by subtracting 3, we shift the vertex down to $ (0, -3) $. 

The vertex is the minimum point of the graph since the absolute value function opens upwards.

Goal of this step: Determine the effect of translating the graph two units to the left and three units down.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To translate a graph two units to the left and three units down, we modify the equation accordingly:  

- Translating two units to the left involves replacing $ x $ with $ x + 2 $ in the equation.  
- Translating three units down involves subtracting 3 from the entire function.  

The original equation is $ y = |x| - 3 $. After translation, the new equation becomes:  
$$
y = |x + 2| - 3 - 3 = |x + 2| - 6.
$$

Goal of this step: Calculate the new coordinates of the minimum point after the translation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The vertex of the original graph $ y = |x| - 3 $ is at $ (0, -3) $.  

When we translate the graph two units to the left, the x-coordinate of the vertex becomes $ 0 - 2 = -2 $.  
When we translate the graph three units down, the y-coordinate of the vertex becomes $ -3 - 3 = -6 $.  

Thus, the new minimum point of the graph is at $ (-2, -6) $.

[VERIFY]
1. Original graph analysis: 
   - y = |x| - 3 has vertex at (0, -3) ✔️
   - Absolute value graphs have V-shape with minimum at vertex ✔️

2. Translation rules:
   - Left 2 units: x → x + 2 ✔️
   - Down 3 units: y → y - 3 ✔️
   - Combined transformation: y = |x + 2| - 6 ✔️

3. Vertex transformation:
   - Original vertex (0, -3) ✔️
   - Horizontal translation: 0 - 2 = -2 ✔️
   - Vertical translation: -3 - 3 = -6 ✔️
   - New vertex (-2, -6) ✔️

All mathematical operations and transformation rules have been applied correctly. The final coordinates satisfy the transformed equation y = |x + 2| - 6 when x = -2 yields y = |-2 + 2| - 6 = |0| - 6 = -6. The solution is consistent and logically sound.

\boxed{correct}
