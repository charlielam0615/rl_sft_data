**Problem Statement**: Krista deposits money into her bank daily, starting with 1 cent on Sunday, doubling the amount each subsequent day for two weeks (14 days). We need to determine the first day of the week when the total amount in her bank exceeds $2 (200 cents).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the day when the total amount exceeds 200 cents:  
1. Model the daily deposits as a geometric sequence.  
2. Calculate the total amount in the bank each day by summing the sequence.  
3. Identify the first day the total exceeds 200 cents.  
4. Determine the corresponding day of the week.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the daily deposits and calculate the total amount each day. This will be achieved by defining the deposit amounts as a geometric sequence and computing their cumulative sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The deposits form a geometric sequence where the deposit on day \( n \) (with Sunday as day 0) is \( 2^n \) cents. The total amount in the bank after \( n \) days is the sum of the geometric series:  
\[ S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1 \]  
We need \( S_n > 200 \). Solve:  
\[ 2^{n+1} - 1 > 200 \]  
\[ 2^{n+1} > 201 \]  
Calculate powers of 2:  
- For \( n = 7 \): \( 2^{8} = 256 \), so \( S_7 = 256 - 1 = 255 > 200 \).  
- For \( n = 6 \): \( 2^{7} = 128 \), so \( S_6 = 128 - 1 = 127 \leq 200 \).  
Thus, the total first exceeds 200 cents on day 7.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation that the total exceeds 200 cents on day 7. This will be achieved by recomputing the sum for days 6 and 7 and confirming the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the sums:  
- Day 6 (Saturday): \( S_6 = 2^{6+1} - 1 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 \) cents.  
- Day 7 (Sunday): \( S_7 = 2^{7+1} - 1 = 2^8 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255 \) cents.  
Confirm: 127 cents ≤ 200 cents, 255 cents > 200 cents. The calculation is correct; day 7 is the first day the total exceeds 200 cents.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the day of the week for day 7, given that day 0 is Sunday. This will be achieved by mapping the day numbers to days of the week.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The days cycle weekly:  
- Day 0: Sunday  
- Day 1: Monday  
- Day 2: Tuesday  
- Day 3: Wednesday  
- Day 4: Thursday  
- Day 5: Friday  
- Day 6: Saturday  
- Day 7: Sunday (since \( 7 \mod 7 = 0 \))  
Thus, day 7 corresponds to Sunday.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the first day of the week when the total amount exceeds $2.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the daily deposits as a geometric sequence (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total amount each day and find when it exceeds 200 cents (completed: day 7).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation (completed: confirmed day 7).  
  - Subgoal 4: Map day 7 to the day of the week (completed: Sunday).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer aligns with all subgoals.  
The total amount first exceeds 200 cents on day 7, which is a Sunday.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The total amount in Krista’s bank first exceeds $2 on **Sunday**.
