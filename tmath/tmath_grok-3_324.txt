### Problem Statement
We are given that \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\), and we need to find the value of \(\lceil x \rceil - x\). The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\), and the floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\). Our task is to determine the expression for \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) under the given condition.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, we need to understand the given condition \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) and use it to find \(\lceil x \rceil - x\). Let’s break this into subgoals:
1. Analyze the equation \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) to determine what it implies about \(x\).
2. Use the result from the first subgoal to express \(\lceil x \rceil - x\).
3. Simplify the expression if possible.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to analyze the equation \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\). We will achieve this by interpreting the equation mathematically to determine the nature of \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The given condition is \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\). This implies:
\[
\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
Since \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\), and \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\), their equality suggests that \(x\) is positioned such that the nearest integer above and below \(x\) is the same. This is only possible if \(x\) is an integer. For example:
- If \(x = 3\), then \(\lceil 3 \rceil = 3\) and \(\lfloor 3 \rfloor = 3\), so \(3 - 3 = 0\).
- If \(x = 3.5\), then \(\lceil 3.5 \rceil = 4\) and \(\lfloor 3.5 \rfloor = 3\), so \(4 - 3 = 1 \neq 0\).

Thus, \(\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x \rfloor\) holds only when \(x\) is an integer. Let’s denote \(x = n\), where \(n\) is an integer.

Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Find \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) given \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\).
  - Subgoal 1: Analyze \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) to determine what it implies about \(x\). (Completed: \(x\) is an integer.)
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(\lceil x \rceil - x\). (Pending)
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the expression if possible. (Pending)

Current goal: Express \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) using the result that \(x\) is an integer.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) given that \(x\) is an integer. We will achieve this by substituting \(x = n\), where \(n\) is an integer, into the expression \(\lceil x \rceil - x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(x = n\) is an integer, we compute:
\[
\lceil x \rceil = \lceil n \rceil = n
\]
Thus:
\[
\lceil x \rceil - x = n - n = 0
\]
So, \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) when \(x\) is an integer.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate that \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) is correct for all cases where \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\). We will achieve this by testing with a few integer values and considering whether non-integer values satisfy the given condition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s test with integer values:
- For \(x = 2\): \(\lceil 2 \rceil = 2\), \(\lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2\), so \(\lceil 2 \rceil - \lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2 - 2 = 0\). Then, \(\lceil 2 \rceil - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0\).
- For \(x = -1\): \(\lceil -1 \rceil = -1\), \(\lfloor -1 \rfloor = -1\), so \(\lceil -1 \rceil - \lfloor -1 \rfloor = -1 - (-1) = 0\). Then, \(\lceil -1 \rceil - (-1) = -1 - (-1) = 0\).

Now, consider a non-integer, e.g., \(x = 2.5\):
- \(\lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3\), \(\lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2\), so \(\lceil 2.5 \rceil - \lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 3 - 2 = 1 \neq 0\). This does not satisfy the given condition.

Since \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) only holds for integers, and for all integers \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\), our solution is consistent.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Find \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) given \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\).
  - Subgoal 1: Analyze \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) to determine what it implies about \(x\). (Completed: \(x\) is an integer.)
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(\lceil x \rceil - x\). (Completed: \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\).)
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the expression if possible. (Pending)

Current goal: Simplify the expression \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) if possible.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) if possible. We will check if the expression can be presented in a simpler form or if it is already in its simplest state.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) is a constant value, indicating that for any \(x\) satisfying \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) (i.e., \(x\) is an integer), the result is 0. This is already a simple and clear result, as it does not depend on the specific value of the integer \(x\). No further simplification is needed.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
Given \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\), we have determined that \(x\) must be an integer, and for any integer \(x\), \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\). Therefore:

\[
\lceil x \rceil - x = 0
\]
