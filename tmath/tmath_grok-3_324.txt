**Problem Restatement**: Given that \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\), find the value of \(\lceil x \rceil - x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Understand the given condition \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) and determine what it implies about \(x\).
2. Use the implication to express \(\lceil x \rceil\) in terms of \(x\).
3. Compute \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) based on the result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to interpret the condition \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\). Achieve this by analyzing the equation to determine the nature of \(x\), specifically whether it is an integer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The condition \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) implies \(\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x \rfloor\). Since \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the smallest integer at least \(x\) and \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the largest integer at most \(x\), their equality holds only when \(x\) is an integer. For an integer \(x = n\), \(\lceil n \rceil = n\) and \(\lfloor n \rfloor = n\), so \(\lceil n \rceil - \lfloor n \rfloor = n - n = 0\). If \(x\) is not an integer, say \(n < x < n+1\), then \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), \(\lceil x \rceil = n+1\), and \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = n+1 - n = 1 \neq 0\). Thus, \(x\) must be an integer.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) given that \(x\) is an integer. Achieve this by substituting \(\lceil x \rceil = x\) for integer \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(x\) is an integer, \(\lceil x \rceil = x\). Therefore, \(\lceil x \rceil - x = x - x = 0\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the solution \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\) by checking if it holds for any integer \(x\) and ensuring no other cases satisfy the given condition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For any integer \(x = n\), we have \(\lceil n \rceil = n\), so \(\lceil n \rceil - n = n - n = 0\), which is consistent. We already established that \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) only holds when \(x\) is an integer, so no other cases (non-integer \(x\)) need to be considered. The solution is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \(\lceil x \rceil - x\) given \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine what \(\lceil x \rceil - \lfloor x \rfloor = 0\) implies about \(x\). (Completed: \(x\) is an integer.)
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(\lceil x \rceil\) for integer \(x\). (Completed: \(\lceil x \rceil = x\).)
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(\lceil x \rceil - x\). (Completed: \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\).)
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution. (Completed: Solution is consistent for all integers.)
Current Goal: None (problem solved).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\lceil x \rceil - x = 0\).
