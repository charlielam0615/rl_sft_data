**Problem Restatement**: Given the equations \( x - y = 6 \) and \( x + y = 12 \), find the value of \( y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( y \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.  
2. Substitute the solution back to find \( y \).  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate \( x \) to solve for \( y \).  
Description: Add the two equations \( x - y = 6 \) and \( x + y = 12 \) to eliminate \( x \), then solve for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the equations:  
\[ (x - y) + (x + y) = 6 + 12 \]  
\[ 2x = 18 \]  
\[ x = 9 \]  
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( x + y = 12 \):  
\[ 9 + y = 12 \]  
\[ y = 3 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( y = 3 \).  
Description: Substitute \( x = 9 \) and \( y = 3 \) into both equations to check their validity.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check \( x - y = 6 \):  
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \] (True)  
Check \( x + y = 12 \):  
\[ 9 + 3 = 12 \] (True)  
The solution satisfies both equations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate one variable to solve for the other (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute to find \( y \) (Completed, \( y = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (Completed).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as \( y = 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( y = 3 \)
