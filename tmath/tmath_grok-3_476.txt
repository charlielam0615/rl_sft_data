**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( y \) given the system of equations \( x - y = 6 \) and \( x + y = 12 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( y \).  
- Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).  
- Subgoal 2: Isolate \( y \) from the equations.  
- Subgoal 3: Verify the solution for \( y \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( y \). This can be achieved by adding the two equations to eliminate \( x \), then solving for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given:  
\( x - y = 6 \)  
\( x + y = 12 \)  

Add the equations:  
\( (x - y) + (x + y) = 6 + 12 \)  
\( 2x = 18 \)  
\( x = 9 \)  

Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the second equation:  
\( 9 + y = 12 \)  
\( y = 12 - 9 \)  
\( y = 3 \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( y = 3 \) by checking both equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using \( x = 9 \) and \( y = 3 \):  
- Check \( x - y = 6 \):  
  \( 9 - 3 = 6 \), which is true.  
- Check \( x + y = 12 \):  
  \( 9 + 3 = 12 \), which is true.  

The solution \( y = 3 \) satisfies both equations.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate \( y \) (completed, \( y = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution valid).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, as all subgoals have been addressed.  
The value of \( y \) is \( 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( y = 3 \)
