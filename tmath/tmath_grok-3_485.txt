**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( x \) for a line segment that starts at the point \( (1, 3) \), is 5 units long, and ends at the point \( (4, x) \), with the condition that \( x > 0 \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( x \), we need to determine the coordinates of the endpoint \( (4, x) \) such that the distance between \( (1, 3) \) and \( (4, x) \) is 5 units. We can break this down into the following subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.  
2. Set up the distance equation using the given points and length.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
4. Verify that the solution satisfies \( x > 0 \).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the distance formula to find \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the distance formula between points \( (x_1, y_1) = (1, 3) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, x) \), set the distance equal to 5, and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The distance formula between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:  
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \text{distance}
\]  
Given points \( (1, 3) \) and \( (4, x) \) with a distance of 5 units, we set up the equation:  
\[
\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2} = 5
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\sqrt{3^2 + (x - 3)^2} = 5
\]  
\[
\sqrt{9 + (x - 3)^2} = 5
\]  
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[
9 + (x - 3)^2 = 25
\]  
Subtract 9 from both sides:  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = 16
\]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[
x - 3 = \pm 4
\]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[
x - 3 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = -4
\]  
\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
\]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -1 \) against the condition \( x > 0 \) and the distance requirement.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute both values of \( x \) into the distance formula to confirm the length is 5 units and check if \( x > 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = 7 \), the endpoint is \( (4, 7) \). Calculate the distance from \( (1, 3) \):  
\[
\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]  
The distance is 5 units, and \( x = 7 > 0 \), so this solution is valid.  

For \( x = -1 \), the endpoint is \( (4, -1) \). Calculate the distance:  
\[
\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (-1 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]  
The distance is 5 units, but \( x = -1 \not> 0 \), so this solution does not satisfy the condition.  

Thus, \( x = 7 \) is the valid solution.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) for the line segment from \( (1, 3) \) to \( (4, x) \) with length 5 and \( x > 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the distance formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the distance equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( x \) (completed, solutions: \( x = 7 \), \( x = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solutions against \( x > 0 \) and distance requirement (completed, \( x = 7 \) valid).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as \( x = 7 \).

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) is 7.
