**Problem Statement:** We have a line segment that starts at the point (1, 3) and ends at the point (4, x), with a length of 5 units. We need to find the value of x, given that x > 0.

**Step 1:**
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to solve for x. The main goal is to find the value of x such that the distance between the points (1, 3) and (4, x) is 5 units. My subgoals will be: (1) Recall the distance formula for two points in a coordinate plane, (2) Apply the formula to set up an equation with the given points and distance, and (3) Solve the equation for x.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Recall and apply the distance formula for two points.
Description: I will use the distance formula, which calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). I will plug in the given points (1, 3) and (4, x) into this formula and set the distance equal to 5 units to form an equation.

[IMP]
Using the distance formula, the distance between (1, 3) and (4, x) is sqrt((4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2). Since the distance is given as 5 units, I can set up the equation:
sqrt((4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2) = 5
Simplifying inside the square root, (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9, so the equation becomes:
sqrt(9 + (x - 3)^2) = 5
To eliminate the square root, I will square both sides:
9 + (x - 3)^2 = 25
[/IMP]

**Step 3:**
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation for x.
Description: I will solve the equation 9 + (x - 3)^2 = 25 by isolating the term with x, taking the square root of both sides, and considering the condition x > 0 to select the appropriate solution.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the equation 9 + (x - 3)^2 = 25, I subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the squared term:
(x - 3)^2 = 25 - 9
(x - 3)^2 = 16
Now, taking the square root of both sides, I get:
x - 3 = ±4
This gives two possible solutions:
x - 3 = 4  →  x = 7
x - 3 = -4  →  x = -1
Since the problem states that x > 0, I discard x = -1 and keep x = 7 as the valid solution.
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution for x.
Description: I will check if the distance between (1, 3) and (4, 7) is indeed 5 units by plugging the values back into the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the distance formula with points (1, 3) and (4, 7):
Distance = sqrt((4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 3)^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5
The distance is exactly 5 units, confirming that x = 7 is correct.
