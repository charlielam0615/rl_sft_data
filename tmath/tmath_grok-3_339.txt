### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the outer square root by squaring both sides.  
2. Isolate the inner square root term.  
3. Eliminate the inner square root by squaring again.  
4. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
5. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the outer square root.  
How to Achieve: Square both sides of the equation \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \) to remove the outer square root.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \), square both sides:  
\[ (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}})^2 = 3^2 \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ 2 + \sqrt{x} = 9 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Isolate the inner square root term.  
How to Achieve: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation \( 2 + \sqrt{x} = 9 \) to isolate \( \sqrt{x} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \( 2 + \sqrt{x} = 9 \), subtract 2 from both sides:  
\[ \sqrt{x} = 9 - 2 \]  
\[ \sqrt{x} = 7 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the inner square root.  
How to Achieve: Square both sides of \( \sqrt{x} = 7 \) to solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \( \sqrt{x} = 7 \), square both sides:  
\[ (\sqrt{x})^2 = 7^2 \]  
\[ x = 49 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 49 \) back into the original equation \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \) to check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 49 \) into \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} \):  
\[ \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{49}} = \sqrt{2 + 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]  
Since \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \), the left-hand side equals the right-hand side (3 = 3).  
Additionally, note that \( \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \), which is non-negative, and the outer square root \( \sqrt{2 + 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \), which is also valid. Thus, \( x = 49 \) satisfies the equation.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3 \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the outer square root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate the inner square root term (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Eliminate the inner square root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for \( x \) (completed, \( x = 49 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, solution found).

### Final Answer
\[ x = 49 \]
