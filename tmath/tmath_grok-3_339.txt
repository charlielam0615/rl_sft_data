**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3\) to find the value of \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Eliminate the outer square root by squaring both sides.
2. Isolate the inner square root term.
3. Eliminate the inner square root by squaring again.
4. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).
5. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Eliminate the outer square root.
Description: Square both sides of the equation \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3\) to remove the outer square root.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Square both sides:
\[
(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}})^2 = 3^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2 + \sqrt{x} = 9
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Isolate the inner square root term.
Description: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation \(2 + \sqrt{x} = 9\) to isolate \(\sqrt{x}\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[
2 + \sqrt{x} - 2 = 9 - 2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sqrt{x} = 7
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Eliminate the inner square root.
Description: Square both sides of the equation \(\sqrt{x} = 7\) to solve for \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Square both sides:
\[
(\sqrt{x})^2 = 7^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = 49
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution.
Description: Substitute \(x = 49\) back into the original equation \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3\) to check if it holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = 49\):
\[
\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{49}} = \sqrt{2 + 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]
Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side (3 = 3), the solution \(x = 49\) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Solve \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{x}} = 3\) for \(x\).
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the outer square root (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate the inner square root term (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Eliminate the inner square root (completed in Step 4).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed in Step 5).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution \(x = 49\) has been validated.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 49\)
