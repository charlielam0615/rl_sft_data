**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express all terms with the same base to simplify the equation.  
2. Solve for \( x \) by equating the exponents.  
3. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express all terms with the same base.  
How to Achieve: Rewrite \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( 4^x \) in terms of base 2, since \( 4 = 2^2 \), and then simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( \frac{1}{4} \):  
\[ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2^2} = 2^{-2} \]  

Rewrite \( 4^x \):  
\[ 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} \]  

Substitute into the equation \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \):  
\[ 2^{-2} \times 2^{30} = 2^{2x} \]  

Combine the exponents on the left-hand side using the property \( a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \):  
\[ 2^{-2 + 30} = 2^{2x} \]  
\[ 2^{28} = 2^{2x} \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \( x \) by equating the exponents.  
How to Achieve: Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other and solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( 2^{28} = 2^{2x} \), equate the exponents:  
\[ 28 = 2x \]  

Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 14 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 14 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Left-hand side:  
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 2^{-2} \times 2^{30} = 2^{28} \]  

Right-hand side:  
\[ 4^{14} = (2^2)^{14} = 2^{2 \times 14} = 2^{28} \]  

Since \( 2^{28} = 2^{28} \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve for \( x \) in \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express all terms with the same base (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) by equating exponents (completed).
