**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( x \).  
1. Express both sides of the equation in terms of the same base, if possible, to simplify the comparison.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Rewrite the equation \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \) using the same base.  
**How**: Express \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( 4^x \) in terms of base 2, since \( 4 = 2^2 \), and then simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite \( \frac{1}{4} \):  
\[ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2^2} = 2^{-2} \]  
Rewrite \( 4^x \):  
\[ 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} \]  
Substitute into the original equation:  
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 2^{-2} \times 2^{30} = 2^{-2 + 30} = 2^{28} \]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[ 2^{28} = 2^{2x} \]  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 28 = 2x \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Verify the solution \( x = 14 \) by substituting back into the original equation.  
**How**: Compute both sides of \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \) with \( x = 14 \) and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Left-hand side:  
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1,073,741,824 \] (since \( 2^{30} = 1,073,741,824 \))  
\[ = 268,435,456 \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ 4^{14} = (2^2)^{14} = 2^{28} = 268,435,456 \]  
Both sides are equal, confirming \( x = 14 \) is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Solve for \( x \) in \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2^{30} = 4^x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the equation in terms of the same base (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed, \( x = 14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution is correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the problem is solved.  
**Solution**: The value of \( x \) is 14.
