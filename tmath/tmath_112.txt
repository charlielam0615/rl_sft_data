The problem states that the sum of a negative integer $ N $ and its square is 6. Translating this into an algebraic equation:  

$$
N + N^2 = 6
$$

Rearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:  

$$
N^2 + N - 6 = 0
$$

This is the algebraic representation of the problem.

I am focusing on solving the quadratic equation $ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 $ by factoring it.

Goal of this step: Factor the quadratic equation $ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factor the quadratic equation $ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 $, we look for two numbers that multiply to $-6$ and add up to $1$.  

These numbers are $3$ and $-2$, because:  

$$
3 \cdot (-2) = -6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + (-2) = 1
$$

So, the quadratic factors as:  

$$
N^2 + N - 6 = (N + 3)(N - 2)
$$  

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:  

$$
N + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow N = -3  
$$
$$
N - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow N = 2  
$$  

Thus, the roots are $ N = -3 $ and $ N = 2 $.

Substitute $ N = -3 $ into the original equation $ N + N^2 = 6 $:  

$$
(-3) + (-3)^2 = -3 + 9 = 6
$$

Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, $ N = -3 $ satisfies the original equation.

[VERIFY]
1. Equation derivation: The problem states "sum of N and its square is 6" translates to $ N + N^2 = 6 $. Rearranged correctly to $ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 $. This step is valid.

2. Factoring the quadratic: The equation $ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 $ factors into $ (N + 3)(N - 2) = 0 $. The factors 3 and -2 multiply to -6 and add to 1, which is correct.

3. Roots identification: Solving $ N + 3 = 0 $ gives $ N = -3 $, and $ N - 2 = 0 $ gives $ N = 2 $. Both roots are mathematically valid solutions to the quadratic equation.

4. Negative integer selection: The problem specifies $ N $ is a negative integer. Among the roots $ -3 $ and $ 2 $, only $ -3 $ satisfies the negativity condition. This selection is justified.

5. Verification step: Substituting $ N = -3 $ into the original equation:  
   $ (-3) + (-3)^2 = -3 + 9 = 6 $, which matches the problem's requirement. The calculation is correct.

All steps are logically consistent, mathematically sound, and align with the problem constraints. No errors detected in reasoning or computation.
