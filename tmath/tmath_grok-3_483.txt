**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the greatest possible positive integer value of \( a \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 + ax = -14 \) has only integer solutions for \( x \). The equation can be rewritten as \( x^2 + ax + 14 = 0 \). We need to determine the value of \( a \) that results in integer roots for \( x \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form.  
2. Identify the condition for integer solutions by analyzing the roots of the quadratic equation.  
3. Use the quadratic formula to express the roots in terms of \( a \).  
4. Ensure the roots are integers by examining the discriminant.  
5. Find the greatest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies the integer root condition.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation in standard form and identify the condition for integer solutions. This can be achieved by transforming the given equation and analyzing the quadratic formula for integer roots.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation \( x^2 + ax = -14 \) by moving all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + ax + 14 = 0 \]  
This is a quadratic equation of the form \( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where the coefficients are:  
- \( b = a \)  
- \( c = 14 \)  

For the roots to be integers, apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = a \), and \( c = 14 \). Substituting these values:  
\[ x = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 14}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 56}}{2} \]  
For the roots \( x \) to be integers, the discriminant \( \Delta = a^2 - 56 \) must be a perfect square (to ensure the square root is an integer), and the numerator \( -a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 56} \) must be divisible by 2 (the denominator) to produce an integer.  

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the roots are integers by setting the discriminant as a perfect square and checking the divisibility condition. This involves solving for \( a \) such that \( a^2 - 56 \) is a perfect square and the resulting roots are integers.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the discriminant \( \Delta = a^2 - 56 \) be a perfect square, say \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is a non-negative integer:  
\[ a^2 - 56 = k^2 \]  
\[ a^2 - k^2 = 56 \]  
This is a difference of squares:  
\[ (a - k)(a + k) = 56 \]  
Since \( a \) is a positive integer, factor pairs of 56 (positive and negative) need to be considered, ensuring \( a - k \) and \( a + k \) are integers and \( a > 0 \). List the factor pairs of 56:  
- \( (1, 56) \), \( (2, 28) \), \( (4, 14) \), \( (7, 8) \), \( (8, 7) \), \( (14, 4) \), \( (28, 2) \), \( (56, 1) \)  
- Negative pairs: \( (-1, -56) \), \( (-2, -28) \), \( (-4, -14) \), \( (-7, -8) \), \( (-8, -7) \), \( (-14, -4) \), \( (-28, -2) \), \( (-56, -1) \)

For each pair \( (m, n) \) where \( m \cdot n = 56 \):  
- Solve:  
  \[ a - k = m, \quad a + k = n \]  
  Add the equations:  
  \[ 2a = m + n \implies a = \frac{m + n}{2} \]  
  Subtract the equations:  
  \[ (a + k) - (a - k) = n - m \implies 2k = n - m \implies k = \frac{n - m}{2} \]  
  For \( a \) and \( k \) to be integers, \( m + n \) and \( n - m \) must be even, so \( m \) and \( n \) must have the same parity (both odd or both even).

Test positive factor pairs:  
- Pair \( (1, 56) \):  
  \[ a = \frac{1 + 56}{2} = \frac{57}{2} = 28.5 \] (not an integer)  
- Pair \( (2, 28) \):  
  \[ a = \frac{2 + 28}{2} = 15, \quad k = \frac{28 - 2}{2} = 13 \]  
  Check: \( a^2 - k^2 = 15^2 - 13^2 = 225 - 169 = 56 \). Valid.  
- Pair \( (4, 14) \):  
  \[ a = \frac{4 + 14}{2} = 9, \quad k = \frac{14 - 4}{2} = 5 \]  
  Check: \( 9^2 - 5^2 = 81 - 25 = 56 \). Valid.  
- Pair \( (7, 8) \):  
  \[ a = \frac{7 + 8}{2} = 7.5 \] (not an integer)  
- Pair \( (8, 7) \): Same as \( (7, 8) \), not integer.  
- Pair \( (14, 4) \): Same as \( (4, 14) \), already tested.  
- Pair \( (28, 2) \): Same as \( (2, 28) \), already tested.  
- Pair \( (56, 1) \): Same as \( (1, 56) \), not integer.

Test negative pairs, e.g., \( (-1, -56) \):  
\[ a = \frac{-1 + (-56)}{2} = \frac{-57}{2} \] (not an integer)  
Similarly, other negative pairs yield non-integer or negative \( a \), which are invalid since \( a \) must be positive.

Possible \( a \): 9, 15 (from positive pairs). Now, verify the roots:  
- For \( a = 9 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 9^2 - 56 = 81 - 56 = 25 = 5^2 \]  
  Roots:  
  \[ x = \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{-9 \pm 5}{2} \]  
  \[ x = \frac{-9 + 5}{2} = -2, \quad x = \frac{-9 - 5}{2} = -7 \]  
  Both are integers.  
- For \( a = 15 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 15^2 - 56 = 225 - 56 = 169 = 13^2 \]  
  Roots:  
  \[ x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm 13}{2} \]  
  \[ x = \frac{-15 + 13}{2} = -1, \quad x = \frac{-15 - 13}{2} = -14 \]  
  Both are integers.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The previous step identified \( a = 9 \) and \( a = 15 \) as valid. Adjust the subgoal to test larger values of \( a \) to find the greatest possible integer \( a \). Since \( a^2 - 56 \) must be a perfect square, try larger \( a \) to maximize it while ensuring integer roots.  

[/PLANNING]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test larger values of \( a \) to find the greatest possible integer \( a \) such that \( a^2 - 56 \) is a perfect square and the roots are integers.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( a^2 - 56 = k^2 \), try larger \( a \):  
- Let \( a = 57 \) (from pair \( (1, 56) \) in reverse or next possible integer):  
  \[ \Delta = 57^2 - 56 = 3249 - 56 = 3193 \]  
  Check if 3193 is a perfect square: \( 56^2 = 3136 \), \( 57^2 = 3249 \). Since \( 3136 < 3193 < 3249 \), not a perfect square.  
- Try \( a = 16 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 16^2 - 56 = 256 - 56 = 200 \]  
  Not a perfect square (\( 14^2 = 196 \), \( 15^2 = 225 \)).  
- Try \( a = 25 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 25^2 - 56 = 625 - 56 = 569 \]  
  Not a perfect square (\( 23^2 = 529 \), \( 24^2 = 576 \)).  

Since factor pairs become sparse for larger \( a \), test larger \( k \):  
\[ a^2 - k^2 = 56 \implies (a - k)(a + k) = 56 \]  
For large \( a \), \( a - k \) and \( a + k \) are close to each other. Try \( a - k = 1 \), \( a + k = 56 \):  
\[ a = \frac{1 + 56}{2} = 28.5 \] (not integer).  
No larger integer pairs seem to work. Check the next possible \( k \):  
- \( k = 23 \), \( a^2 - 23^2 = 56 \), \( a^2 - 529 = 56 \), \( a^2 = 585 \), not a perfect square.  

Since no larger \( a \) yields a perfect square discriminant, the largest \( a \) from earlier is 15.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest positive integer \( a \) such that \( x^2 + ax + 14 = 0 \) has integer roots.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify conditions for integer roots using the quadratic formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( a \) such that the discriminant is a perfect square (completed, found \( a = 9, 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test larger \( a \) to maximize it (completed, no larger valid \( a \)).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the greatest possible \( a \) is 15.  

[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( a = 15 \) is the greatest possible integer \( a \) by confirming no larger \( a \) produces integer roots.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconfirm roots for \( a = 15 \):  
\[ x^2 + 15x + 14 = 0 \]  
Discriminant: \( 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 14 = 225 - 56 = 169 \). Roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-15 \pm 13}{2} = -1, -14 \] (integers).  
For \( a = 9 \):  
\[ x^2 + 9x + 14 = 0 \]  
Discriminant: \( 9^2 - 56 = 81 - 56 = 25 \). Roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-9 \pm 5}{2} = -2, -7 \] (integers).  
Test \( a = 16 \):  
\[ \Delta = 16^2 - 56 = 256 - 56 = 200 \] (not a perfect square).  
Larger \( a \) (e.g., 25, 57) already tested and failed. Thus, \( a = 15 \) is the largest.

**Final Answer**  
The greatest possible value of \( a \) is **15**.  

\[ \boxed{15} \]
