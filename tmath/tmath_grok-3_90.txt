### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the greatest product of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a + b = 1998\), break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Express one integer in terms of the other using the given sum.  
2. Formulate the product as a function of one variable.  
3. Maximize the product using mathematical techniques (e.g., calculus or completing the square).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it yields the maximum product.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express one integer in terms of the other and formulate the product. Since \(a + b = 1998\), express \(b = 1998 - a\). The product is \(P = a \cdot b = a \cdot (1998 - a)\). This will be achieved by writing the product as a function of \(a\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \(a + b = 1998\), let \(b = 1998 - a\). The product is:  
\[ P = a \cdot (1998 - a) = 1998a - a^2. \]  
This is a quadratic function in \(a\), which we need to maximize.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maximize the product \(P = 1998a - a^2\). Since this is a quadratic function, find the vertex of the parabola to determine the value of \(a\) that maximizes \(P\). This can be done using calculus (finding the derivative) or by recognizing the vertex of a quadratic function \(f(a) = -a^2 + 1998a\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the product:  
\[ P(a) = -a^2 + 1998a. \]  
This is a quadratic function of the form \(f(a) = -a^2 + ba + c\), where the vertex occurs at \(a = \frac{b}{2}\). Here, \(b = 1998\), so:  
\[ a = \frac{1998}{2} = 999. \]  
Thus, \(a = 999\), and since \(b = 1998 - a\), we have:  
\[ b = 1998 - 999 = 999. \]  
The product is:  
\[ P = 999 \cdot 999 = 999^2 = 998,001. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(a = 999\) and \(b = 999\) yield the maximum product. This can be achieved by checking the second derivative of the product function to confirm a maximum and testing nearby integer pairs to ensure no larger product exists.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To confirm the maximum, compute the second derivative of \(P(a) = -a^2 + 1998a\):  
- First derivative: \(P'(a) = -2a + 1998\).  
- Second derivative: \(P''(a) = -2\).  
Since \(P''(a) = -2 < 0\), the function has a maximum at \(a = 999\).  

Test nearby integer pairs to ensure no larger product:  
- For \(a = 998\), \(b = 1998 - 998 = 1000\):  
  \[ P = 998 \cdot 1000 = 998,000 < 998,001. \]  
- For \(a = 1000\), \(b = 1998 - 1000 = 998\):  
  \[ P = 1000 \cdot 998 = 998,000 < 998,001. \]  
- For \(a = 997\), \(b = 1998 - 997 = 1001\):  
  \[ P = 997 \cdot 1001 = 997,997 < 998,001. \]  

The product at \(a = 999\), \(b = 999\) is indeed the maximum.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest product of two integers whose sum is 1998.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express one integer in terms of the other (\(b = 1998 - a\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Formulate the product as a quadratic function (\(P = 1998a - a^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Maximize the product by finding the vertex (\(a = 999\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the maximum product.  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution and provide the final answer.  
The maximum product found is \(999 \cdot 999 = 998,001\), with integers \(a = 999\) and \(b = 999\).

### Final Answer
The greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is \(998,001\), achieved when both integers are 999.
