Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Remove the parentheses by distributing the negative sign.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given expression is:  
$$ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) $$  

Distribute the negative sign to all terms inside the parentheses:  
$$ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Identify and group like terms:  
- $ 3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2 $  
- $ 2x + 2x = 4x $  
- $ 1 - 6 = -5 $  

The expression becomes:  
$$ 6x^2 + 4x - 5 $$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of algebraic simplification steps
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Original expression: 2x + 3x² + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x²)

2. Distribution step verification:
   - Parentheses contents: 6 - 2x - 3x²
   - After distributing negative sign: -6 + 2x + 3x²
   - Combined with original terms: 2x + 3x² + 1 -6 + 2x + 3x²
   - This step is correct as the signs of all three terms inside parentheses were properly negated

3. Like terms combination verification:
   - x² terms: 3x² (original) + 3x² (distributed) = 6x² ✔
   - x terms: 2x (original) + 2x (distributed) = 4x ✔
   - Constant terms: 1 (original) - 6 (distributed) = -5 ✔
   
4. Final expression: 6x² + 4x - 5
   - All coefficients match expected values
   - Terms are ordered correctly (descending exponents)
   - No remaining parentheses
   - No like terms left uncombined

All operations follow algebraic rules and produce mathematically equivalent expressions at each step. The final simplified form is correct.
