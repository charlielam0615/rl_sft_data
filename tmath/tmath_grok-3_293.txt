### Problem Restatement
We are given \(\log_4 3 = x\) and \(\log_2 27 = kx\). Our goal is to find the value of \(k\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \(k\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express \(\log_2 27\) in terms of \(\log_4 3 = x\).
2. Relate the expression to \(kx\) to isolate \(k\).
3. Solve for \(k\).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Express \(\log_2 27\) in terms of \(\log_4 3 = x\).
- How to Achieve: Use logarithm properties (change of base and power rules) to rewrite \(\log_2 27\) using \(\log_4 3\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(\log_4 3 = x\), we have \(x = \frac{\log_b 3}{\log_b 4}\) for any base \(b\). Choose base 2 for convenience:
\[
x = \frac{\log_2 3}{\log_2 4}
\]
Since \(\log_2 4 = \log_2 (2^2) = 2\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{\log_2 3}{2}
\]
Now, express \(\log_2 27\). Since \(27 = 3^3\), we have:
\[
\log_2 27 = \log_2 (3^3) = 3 \log_2 3
\]
Substitute \(\log_2 3 = 2x\) (from \(x = \frac{\log_2 3}{2}\)):
\[
\log_2 27 = 3 \cdot (2x) = 6x
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Relate \(\log_2 27 = 6x\) to \(kx\) and solve for \(k\).
- How to Achieve: Equate the expression for \(\log_2 27\) to \(kx\) and solve for \(k\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \(\log_2 27 = kx\), and from Step 2, \(\log_2 27 = 6x\), we have:
\[
kx = 6x
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\) (since \(\log_4 3 \neq 0\)), divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
k = 6
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Verify the solution \(k = 6\).
- How to Achieve: Substitute \(k = 6\) back into the equation \(\log_2 27 = kx\) and check consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \(k = 6\), then \(\log_2 27 = 6x\). Since \(x = \log_4 3\), we need to confirm:
\[
\log_2 27 = 6 \cdot \log_4 3
\]
Compute the right-hand side:
\[
\log_4 3 = \frac{\log_2 3}{\log_2 4} = \frac{\log_2 3}{2}
\]
\[
6 \cdot \log_4 3 = 6 \cdot \frac{\log_2 3}{2} = 3 \log_2 3
\]
Compute the left-hand side:
\[
\log_2 27 = \log_2 (3^3) = 3 \log_2 3
\]
Both sides are equal, confirming \(k = 6\) is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \(k\) such that \(\log_2 27 = kx\), given \(\log_4 3 = x\).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(\log_2 27\) in terms of \(\log_4 3 = x\). (Completed in Step 2)
  - Subgoal 2: Relate the expression to \(kx\) and solve for \(k\). (Completed in Step 3)
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed in Step 4)
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved with \(k = 6\).

### Final Answer
\[
k = 6
\]
