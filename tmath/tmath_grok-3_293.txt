### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for \(k\), we need to express \(\log_{2}27\) in terms of \(\log_{4}3 = x\). This requires breaking down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express \(\log_{4}3\) and \(\log_{2}27\) using a common logarithmic base to relate them.
2. Use logarithmic properties to rewrite \(\log_{2}27\) in a form that includes \(\log_{4}3\).
3. Compare the resulting expression \(\log_{2}27 = kx\) to isolate \(k\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Express \(\log_{2}27\) in terms of \(\log_{4}3 = x\) using logarithmic properties.

**How to Achieve**: Use the change of base formula and properties of logarithms to rewrite \(\log_{2}27\). Since \(\log_{4}3 = x\), express both logarithms in terms of a common base (e.g., base 2 or natural log) and manipulate the expressions to find a relationship involving \(x\).

[IMP]
Let’s start with the given equations:
- \(\log_{4}3 = x\)
- \(\log_{2}27 = kx\)

First, express \(\log_{4}3\) in terms of base 2 logarithms using the change of base formula:
\[
\log_{4}3 = \frac{\log_{2}3}{\log_{2}4}
\]
Since \(4 = 2^2\), we have \(\log_{2}4 = \log_{2}(2^2) = 2\). Thus:
\[
\log_{4}3 = \frac{\log_{2}3}{2} = x
\]
Solving for \(\log_{2}3\):
\[
\log_{2}3 = 2x
\]

Next, express \(\log_{2}27\). Since \(27 = 3^3\), we have:
\[
\log_{2}27 = \log_{2}(3^3) = 3 \log_{2}3
\]
Substitute \(\log_{2}3 = 2x\):
\[
\log_{2}27 = 3 \cdot 2x = 6x
\]

We are given that \(\log_{2}27 = kx\). Equating the two expressions:
\[
kx = 6x
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\) (since \(\log_{4}3 \neq 0\)), divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
k = 6
\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that \(k = 6\) is correct by checking the relationship \(\log_{2}27 = kx\) using an alternative method.

**How to Achieve**: Use a different logarithmic base (e.g., natural logarithm) to confirm the relationship between \(\log_{2}27\) and \(\log_{4}3\), then recompute \(k\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s verify using natural logarithms. Rewrite \(\log_{4}3 = x\):
\[
\log_{4}3 = \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 4} = x
\]
Since \(4 = 2^2\), we have \(\ln 4 = \ln (2^2) = 2 \ln 2\), so:
\[
x = \frac{\ln 3}{2 \ln 2}
\]

Now express \(\log_{2}27\):
\[
\log_{2}27 = \frac{\ln 27}{\ln 2}
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we have \(\ln 27 = \ln (3^3) = 3 \ln 3\). Thus:
\[
\log_{2}27 = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\ln 2}
\]

We need \(\log_{2}27 = kx\). Substitute \(x = \frac{\ln 3}{2 \ln 2}\):
\[
kx = k \cdot \frac{\ln 3}{2 \ln 2}
\]
Set this equal to \(\log_{2}27\):
\[
k \cdot \frac{\ln 3}{2 \ln 2} = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\ln 2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \(\frac{2 \ln 2}{\ln 3}\):
\[
k = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\ln 2} \cdot \frac{2 \ln 2}{\ln 3} = 3 \cdot 2 = 6
\]
This confirms \(k = 6\), consistent with our previous result.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find \(k\) such that \(\log_{2}27 = kx\), given \(\log_{4}3 = x\).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(\log_{4}3\) and \(\log_{2}27\) using a common logarithmic base.
  - Subgoal 2: Rewrite \(\log_{2}27\) in terms of \(\log_{4}3 = x\).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \(k\) by comparing \(\log_{2}27 = kx\).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution using an alternative logarithmic base.

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution \(k = 6\) is complete and correct, as we have computed and validated it.

**Status**: The main goal is achieved. Subgoals 1–3 were addressed in Steps 1 and 2, and Subgoal 4 was addressed in Step 3. The solution \(k = 6\) was derived and verified using two different methods (base 2 and natural logarithms).
