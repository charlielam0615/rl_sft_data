**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that Alli rolls a standard 6-sided die twice, and the two numbers differ by exactly 2 (i.e., |a - b| = 2, where a and b are the outcomes of the first and second rolls). The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes for two die rolls.  
2. Identify the pairs of outcomes (a, b) where |a - b| = 2.  
3. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for two die rolls.  
How to Achieve: Since each die has 6 faces, and the rolls are independent, multiply the number of outcomes for each roll (6 × 6).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
A standard 6-sided die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). For two rolls, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
6 × 6 = 36.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the pairs of outcomes (a, b) where |a - b| = 2.  
How to Achieve: List all ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are integers from 1 to 6, and the absolute difference |a - b| = 2. This means b = a + 2 or b = a - 2, ensuring both a and b are valid die outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For |a - b| = 2, we consider two cases:  
1. **b = a + 2**:  
   - If a = 1, b = 1 + 2 = 3 → (1, 3).  
   - If a = 2, b = 2 + 2 = 4 → (2, 4).  
   - If a = 3, b = 3 + 2 = 5 → (3, 5).  
   - If a = 4, b = 4 + 2 = 6 → (4, 6).  
   - If a = 5, b = 5 + 2 = 7 (invalid, as b > 6).  
   - If a = 6, b = 6 + 2 = 8 (invalid).  
   Favorable pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6).  

2. **b = a - 2** (i.e., a = b + 2):  
   - If a = 3, b = 3 - 2 = 1 → (3, 1).  
   - If a = 4, b = 4 - 2 = 2 → (4, 2).  
   - If a = 5, b = 5 - 2 = 3 → (5, 3).  
   - If a = 6, b = 6 - 2 = 4 → (6, 4).  
   - If a = 1, b = 1 - 2 = -1 (invalid).  
   - If a = 2, b = 2 - 2 = 0 (invalid).  
   Favorable pairs: (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4).  

Total favorable pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4).  
Count: 4 (from b = a + 2) + 4 (from b = a - 2) = 8 pairs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the favorable pairs identified in the previous step.  
How to Achieve: Verify that all pairs satisfy |a - b| = 2 and that no valid pairs were missed by systematically checking each possible value of a.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the pairs:  
- (1, 3): |1 - 3| = 2.  
- (2, 4): |2 - 4| = 2.  
- (3, 5): |3 - 5| = 2.  
- (4, 6): |4 - 6| = 2.  
- (3, 1): |3 - 1| = 2.  
- (4, 2): |4 - 2| = 2.  
- (5, 3): |5 - 3| = 2.  
- (6, 4): |6 - 4| = 2.  
All pairs satisfy |a - b| = 2.  

To ensure completeness, check for missed pairs by testing each a from 1 to 6:  
- a = 1: b = 3 (1, 3), b = -1 (invalid).  
- a = 2: b = 4 (2, 4), b = 0 (invalid).  
- a = 3: b = 5 (3, 5), b = 1 (3, 1).  
- a = 4: b = 6 (4, 6), b = 2 (4, 2).  
- a = 5: b = 7 (invalid), b = 3 (5, 3).  
- a = 6: b = 8 (invalid), b = 4 (6, 4).  
All valid pairs are included, confirming 8 favorable outcomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (8) by the total number of outcomes (36), and simplify the resulting fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 8 / 36.  
Simplify: 8 ÷ 4 = 2, 36 ÷ 4 = 9. Thus, 8 / 36 = 2 / 9.  
Check if 2 / 9 is in simplest form: 2 and 9 share no common factors (2 is even, 9 is odd).  
Final probability: 2 / 9.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the two die rolls differ by 2, expressed as a common fraction.
