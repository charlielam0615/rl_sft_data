### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that three cards dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards, without replacement, result in the first card being a Jack, the second a Queen, and the third a King.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Determine the probability of drawing a Jack as the first card.
2. Determine the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card, given the first is a Jack.
3. Determine the probability of drawing a King as the third card, given the first two cards.
4. Multiply these probabilities to find the total probability.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of drawing a Jack as the first card.
How to Achieve: In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 Jacks. The probability is the number of Jacks divided by the total number of cards.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 Jacks (one for each suit). The probability of drawing a Jack as the first card is:

\[
P(\text{Jack first}) = \frac{\text{Number of Jacks}}{\text{Total cards}} = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card, given the first card is a Jack.
How to Achieve: After drawing a Jack, 51 cards remain, with 4 Queens. The probability is the number of Queens divided by the remaining cards.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After drawing a Jack, there are 51 cards left, and the number of Queens remains 4. The probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is:

\[
P(\text{Queen second} \mid \text{Jack first}) = \frac{\text{Number of Queens}}{\text{Remaining cards}} = \frac{4}{51}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of drawing a King as the third card, given the first card is a Jack and the second is a Queen.
How to Achieve: After drawing a Jack and a Queen, 50 cards remain, with 4 Kings. The probability is the number of Kings divided by the remaining cards.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
After drawing a Jack and a Queen, there are 50 cards left, and the number of Kings remains 4. The probability of drawing a King as the third card is:

\[
P(\text{King third} \mid \text{Jack first, Queen second}) = \frac{\text{Number of Kings}}{\text{Remaining cards}} = \frac{4}{50} = \frac{2}{25}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second is a Queen, and the third is a King.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate P(Jack first) = 4/52 = 1/13 [Completed].
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate P(Queen second | Jack first) = 4/51 [Completed].
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate P(King third | Jack first, Queen second) = 4/50 = 2/25 [Completed].
  - Subgoal 4: Multiply the probabilities to find the total probability [Current Goal].
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the probabilities to find the total probability.
How to Achieve: Since the draws are sequential and without replacement, multiply the probabilities from the previous steps: P(Jack first) × P(Queen second | Jack first) × P(King third | Jack first, Queen second).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total probability is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P = P(\text{Jack first}) \times P(\text{Queen second} \mid \text{Jack first}) \times P(\text{King third} \mid \text{Jack first, Queen second})
\]

\[
P = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{4}{51} \times \frac{4}{50}
\]

Simplify:

\[
P = \frac{4 \times 4 \times 4}{52 \times 51 \times 50} = \frac{64}{132600}
\]

Reduce the fraction. First, compute the numerator and denominator:

- Numerator: 64
- Denominator: \( 52 \times 51 \times 50 \)

Calculate the denominator:

\[
52 \times 50 = 2600
\]

\[
2600 \times 51 = 2600 \times 50 + 2600 \times 1 = 130000 + 2600 = 132600
\]

So:

\[
P = \frac{64}{132600}
\]

Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 64 and 132600 to simplify:

- 64 = \( 2^6 \)
- 132600 = \( 2^3 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 13 \times 17 \)

GCD is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

Divide numerator and denominator by 8:

\[
\frac{64 \div 8}{132600 \div 8} = \frac{8}{16575}
\]

Check if 8 and 16575 have common factors:

- 8 = \( 2^3 \)
- 16575 = \( 132600 \div 8 = \frac{2^3 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 13 \times 17}{2^3} = 3 \times 5^2 \times 13 \times 17 \)

No common factors exist. Thus, the fraction is in simplest form:

\[
P = \frac{8}{16575}
\]

To express as a decimal (approximate):

\[
\frac{8}{16575} \approx 0.0004826
\]

So, the probability is:

\[
\frac{8}{16575} \approx 0.000483
\]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculated probability.
How to Achieve: Recalculate the probability using the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes for drawing three cards in order without replacement.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes.

- Favorable outcomes:
  - Jacks: 4 choices.
  - Queens: 4 choices.
  - Kings: 4 choices.
  - Total favorable outcomes = \( 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \).

- Total outcomes (ordered sequences of 3 cards from 52 without replacement):
  - First card: 52 choices.
  - Second card: 51 choices.
  - Third card: 50 choices.
  - Total outcomes = \( 52 \times 51 \times 50 = 132600 \).

Probability:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{64}{132600} = \frac{8}{16575}
\]

This matches the previous result, confirming the calculation is correct.

Final Answer: The probability that the first card is a Jack, the second is a Queen, and the third is a King is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{16575}}
\]
