**Problem Restatement**: We need to find how many points lie at the intersection of at least two of the three lines given by the equations \(3y - 2x = 1\), \(x + 2y = 2\), and \(4x - 6y = 5\). This involves determining the points where any pair of lines intersect and checking if any point is common to all three lines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the intersection points of each pair of lines (Line 1: \(3y - 2x = 1\), Line 2: \(x + 2y = 2\), Line 3: \(4x - 6y = 5\)).  
2. Check if any intersection point lies on the third line to determine if all three lines intersect at a single point.  
3. Count the distinct intersection points.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)) and Line 2 (\(x + 2y = 2\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 1 and Line 2 simultaneously using substitution or elimination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \(3y - 2x = 1\) and \(x + 2y = 2\).  
From Line 2: \(x = 2 - 2y\).  
Substitute into Line 1:  
\(3y - 2(2 - 2y) = 1\)  
\(3y - 4 + 4y = 1\)  
\(7y - 4 = 1\)  
\(7y = 5\)  
\(y = \frac{5}{7}\).  
Substitute \(y = \frac{5}{7}\) into \(x = 2 - 2y\):  
\(x = 2 - 2 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = 2 - \frac{10}{7} = \frac{14}{7} - \frac{10}{7} = \frac{4}{7}\).  
Intersection point: \(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)) and Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 5\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 1 and Line 3 simultaneously using elimination or substitution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \(3y - 2x = 1\) and \(4x - 6y = 5\).  
Rewrite Line 1: \(-2x + 3y = 1\).  
Multiply Line 1 by 2 to align \(x\) coefficients: \(-4x + 6y = 2\).  
Now we have:  
\(-4x + 6y = 2\)  
\(4x - 6y = 5\).  
Add the equations:  
\(-4x + 4x + 6y - 6y = 2 + 5\)  
\(0 = 7\), which is a contradiction.  
Thus, Line 1 and Line 3 are parallel and do not intersect.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 2 (\(x + 2y = 2\)) and Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 5\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 2 and Line 3 simultaneously using substitution or elimination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \(x + 2y = 2\) and \(4x - 6y = 5\).  
From Line 2: \(x = 2 - 2y\).  
Substitute into Line 3:  
\(4(2 - 2y) - 6y = 5\)  
\(8 - 8y - 6y = 5\)  
\(8 - 14y = 5\)  
\(-14y = -3\)  
\(y = \frac{3}{14}\).  
Substitute \(y = \frac{3}{14}\) into \(x = 2 - 2y\):  
\(x = 2 - 2 \cdot \frac{3}{14} = 2 - \frac{6}{14} = 2 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{14}{7} - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{11}{7}\).  
Intersection point: \(\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14}\right)\).

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of points where at least two of the three lines intersect.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find intersection points of each pair of lines.  
    - Line 1 and Line 2 intersect at \(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\).  
    - Line 1 and Line 3 are parallel (no intersection).  
    - Line 2 and Line 3 intersect at \(\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14}\right)\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Check if any intersection point lies on the third line.  
  - Subgoal 3: Count distinct intersection points.  
Current Goal: Check if any intersection point lies on the third line to determine if all three lines intersect at one point.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check if the intersection point of Line 1 and Line 2 (\(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\)) lies on Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 6y = 5\)).  
How to Achieve: Substitute the point \(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\) into the equation of Line 3 and verify if it satisfies it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\) into Line 3: \(4x - 6y = 5\)):  
\(4 \cdot \frac{4}{7} - 6 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{30}{7} = \frac{-14}{7} = -2 \neq 5\).  
The point \(\left(\frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}\right)\) does not lie on Line 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check if the intersection point of Line 2 and Line 3 (\(\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14}\right)\)) lies on Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)).  
How to Achieve: Substitute the point \left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14}\right)\) into the equation of Line 1 and verify if it satisfies it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14}\right)\) into Line 1: (\(3y - 2x = 2x\)):  
\(3 \cdot \frac{3}{14} - \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{11}{7} = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{22}{7} = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{44}{14} = \frac{-35}{14} = \frac{-5}{2} \neq 1\).  
The point \(\left(\frac{11}{7}, \frac{14}{14}\right)\) does not lie on Line 1.
