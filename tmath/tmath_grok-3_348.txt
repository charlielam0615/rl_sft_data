**Problem Restatement**: We need to find how many points lie at the intersection of at least two of the three lines given by the equations \(3y - 2x = 1\), \(x + 2y = 2\), and \(4x - 6y = 5\). This requires determining the points where any pair of lines intersect and checking if any point is common to all three lines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the intersection points of each pair of lines (Line 1 with Line 2, Line 1 with Line 3, Line 2 with Line 3).  
2. Check if the intersection points are distinct or if some coincide.  
3. Determine if any point lies on all three lines (i.e., a common intersection).  
4. Count the total number of unique intersection points.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)) and Line 2 (\(x + 2y = 2\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 1 and Line 2 simultaneously using substitution or elimination to find the coordinates \((x, y)\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
- Line 1: \(3y - 2x = 1\)  
- Line 2: \(x + 2y = 2\)  

From Line 2, solve for \(x\):  
\[ x = 2 - 2y \]  

Substitute into Line 1:  
\[ 3y - 2(2 - 2y) = 1 \]  
\[ 3y - 4 + 4y = 1 \]  
\[ 7y - 4 = 1 \]  
\[ 7y = 5 \]  
\[ y = \frac{5}{7} \]  

Substitute \(y = \frac{5}{7}\) into \(x = 2 - 2y\):  
\[ x = 2 - 2 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = 2 - \frac{10}{7} = \frac{14}{7} - \frac{10}{7} = \frac{4}{7} \]  

Intersection point of Line 1 and Line 2: \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)) and Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 5\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 1 and Line 3 simultaneously using substitution or elimination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
- Line 1: \(3y - 2x = 1\)  
- Line 3: \(4x - 6y = 5\)  

Rewrite Line 1: \(3y = 2x + 1 \Rightarrow y = \frac{2x + 1}{3}\)  

Substitute into Line 3:  
\[ 4x - 6 \cdot \frac{2x + 1}{3} = 5 \]  
\[ 4x - 2(2x + 1) = 5 \]  
\[ 4x - 4x - 2 = 5 \]  
\[ -2 = 5 \]  

This is a contradiction, indicating that Line 1 and Line 3 are parallel and do not intersect.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of Line 2 (\(x + 2y = 2\)) and Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 5\)).  
How to Achieve: Solve the system of equations for Line 2 and Line 3 simultaneously using substitution or elimination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
- Line 2: \(x + 2y = 2\)  
- Line 3: \(4x - 6y = 5\)  

From Line 2: \(x = 2 - 2y\)  

Substitute into Line 3:  
\[ 4(2 - 2y) - 6y = 5 \]  
\[ 8 - 8y - 6y = 5 \]  
\[ 8 - 14y = 5 \]  
\[ -14y = -3 \]  
\[ y = \frac{3}{14} \]  

Substitute \(y = \frac{3}{14}\) into \(x = 2 - 2y\):  
\[ x = 2 - 2 \cdot \frac{3}{14} = 2 - \frac{6}{14} = 2 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{14}{7} - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \]  

Intersection point of Line 2 and Line 3: \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of points where at least two of the three lines intersect.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find intersection points of each pair of lines.  
    - Line 1 and Line 2: \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\).  
    - Line 1 and Line 3: No intersection (parallel).  
    - Line 2 and Line 3: \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Check if intersection points are distinct or coincide.  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine if any point lies on all three lines.  
  - Subgoal 4: Count unique intersection points.  

Current Goal: Check if the intersection points are distinct and if any point lies on all three lines.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if the intersection points \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\) and \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\) are distinct and check if either lies on the third line.  
How to Achieve: Compare the coordinates of the two points and substitute each into the equation of the non-intersecting line to check for a common point.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Compare points: \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\) and \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\).  
  The x-coordinates (\(\frac{4}{7} \neq \frac{11}{7}\)) and y-coordinates (\(\frac{5}{7} \neq \frac{3}{14}\)) differ, so the points are distinct.  

- Check if \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\) (from Line 1 and Line 2) lies on Line 3 (\(4x - 6y = 5\)):  
  \[ 4 \cdot \frac{4}{7} - 6 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{30}{7} = -\frac{14}{7} = -2 \neq 5 \]  
  It does not lie on Line 3.  

- Check if \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\) (from Line 2 and Line 3) lies on Line 1 (\(3y - 2x = 1\)):  
  \[ 3 \cdot \frac{3}{14} - 2 \cdot \frac{11}{7} = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{22}{7} = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{44}{14} = -\frac{35}{14} = -\frac{5}{2} \neq 1 \]  
  It does not lie on Line 1.  

No point lies on all three lines.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of points where at least two of the three lines intersect.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find intersection points of each pair of lines (Completed).  
    - Line 1 and Line 2: \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\).  
    - Line 1 and Line 3: No intersection.  
    - Line 2 and Line 3: \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Check if intersection points are distinct (Completed: Points are distinct).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine if any point lies on all three lines (Completed: No common point).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count unique intersection points.  

Current Goal: Count the total number of unique intersection points.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Count the number of unique points where at least two lines intersect.  
How to Achieve: Summarize the distinct intersection points found and count them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The intersection points are:  
- Line 1 and Line 2: \(\left( \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7} \right)\).  
- Line 2 and Line 3: \(\left( \frac{11}{7}, \frac{3}{14} \right)\).  

There are no other intersections (Line 1 and Line 3 are parallel), and no point lies on all three lines. The points are distinct, so there are 2 unique intersection points.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: There are **2 points** that lie at the intersection of at least two of the three lines.
