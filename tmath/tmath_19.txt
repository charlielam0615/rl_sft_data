Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor the quadratic expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factor $x^2 - 16x + 60$, we need to find two numbers that multiply to 60 (the constant term) and add up to -16 (the coefficient of the linear term).  

The factors of 60 are:  
1 and 60  
2 and 30  
3 and 20  
4 and 15  
5 and 12  
6 and 10  

We need two numbers that add to -16. Let's test combinations:  
- $-6$ and $-10$ multiply to 60 and add to -16.  

Thus, the factored form is:  
$$
x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the values of $a$ and $b$ such that $a > b$ and both are nonnegative integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the factored form $(x - 10)(x - 6)$, we can identify $a = 10$ and $b = 6$, since $a > b$ and both are nonnegative integers.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $3b - a$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $a = 10$ and $b = 6$ into the expression $3b - a$:  
$$
3b - a = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Factoring Verification**:  
   The quadratic $x^2 - 16x + 60$ was factored as $(x - 10)(x - 6)$. Expanding this form:  
   $$
   (x - 10)(x - 6) = x^2 - 6x - 10x + 60 = x^2 - 16x + 60
   $$  
   This matches the original quadratic, confirming the factorization is correct.

2. **Assignment of $a$ and $b$**:  
   From the factors $(x - 10)(x - 6)$, the constants are 10 and 6. Since $a > b$ and both are nonnegative integers, assigning $a = 10$ and $b = 6$ is valid.

3. **Calculation of $3b - a$**:  
   Substituting $a = 10$ and $b = 6$:  
   $$
   3b - a = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8
   $$  
   The arithmetic is correct, and the result aligns with the problem's requirements.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
