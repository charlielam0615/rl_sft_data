**Problem Restatement**: Find the center \((h, k)\) of the circle given by the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39\), and compute \(h + k\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(h + k\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\).  
3. Compute \(h + k\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the circle equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39\) in standard form. This will be achieved by completing the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms to express the equation as \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39 \]

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 39 = 0 \]

Group the \(x\) and \(y\) terms:  
\[ (x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 12y) + 39 = 0 \]

Complete the square for \(x\):  
\[ x^2 - 4x = (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4 = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \]

Complete the square for \(y\):  
\[ y^2 - 12y = (y^2 - 12y + 36) - 36 = (y - 6)^2 - 36 \]

Substitute back:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 - 4 + (y - 6)^2 - 36 + 39 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 - 4 - 36 + 39 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 - 1 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1 \]

The equation is now in standard form, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \(h = 2\), \(k = 6\), and \(r^2 = 1\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(h + k\) for the center \((h, k)\) of the circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the circle equation in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((h, k)\) (completed in Step 2: \(h = 2\), \(k = 6\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(h + k\) (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \(h + k\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(h + k\). Using the center \((h, k) = (2, 6)\) identified in Step 2, calculate \(h + k\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the center is \((h, k) = (2, 6)\).  
Compute:  
\[ h + k = 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Thus, \(h + k = 8\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the center \((2, 6)\) and the computation of \(h + k = 8\). This will be achieved by substituting the center and radius back into the standard form equation and checking if it matches the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The standard form from Step 2 is:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1 \]

Expand to compare with the original equation:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]  
\[ (y - 6)^2 = y^2 - 12y + 36 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 12y + 36 = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 40 \]

Set equal to the radius squared:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 40 = 1 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 39 = 0 \]

This matches the original equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 39 = 0 \]

The center \((2, 6)\) is correct. Now verify \(h + k\):  
\[ h = 2, k = 6 \implies h + k = 2 + 6 = 8 \]

The computation is consistent.

**Final Answer**:  
\[ h + k = 8 \]
