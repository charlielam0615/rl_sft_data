### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(h + k\), we need to determine the center \((h, k)\) of the circle. The given equation is not in standard form, so the subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form.  
3. Compute \(h + k\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form.  
Description: Complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms in the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39\) to convert it to the form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39 \]  

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 39 = 0 \]  

Rearrange to group \(x\) and \(y\) terms:  
\[ x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 12y + 39 = 0 \]  

Complete the square for \(x\):  
\[ x^2 - 4x = (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4 = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \]  

Complete the square for \(y\):  
\[ y^2 - 12y = (y^2 - 12y + 36) - 36 = (y - 6)^2 - 36 \]  

Substitute back:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 - 4 + (y - 6)^2 - 36 + 39 = 0 \]  

Simplify:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 - 4 - 36 + 39 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 - 1 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1 \]  

The equation is now in standard form: \((x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the standard form equation.  
Description: Check that the derived standard form \((x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1\) is equivalent to the original equation by expanding and comparing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the standard form:  
\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1 \]  
\[ (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = 1 \]  
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 12y + 36 - 1 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12y + 39 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 12y - 39 \]  

This matches the original equation, confirming the standard form is correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the center \((h, k)\) and compute \(h + k\).  
Description: From the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), extract \(h\) and \(k\), then calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \((x - 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 1\), the standard form is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
Thus, \(h = 2\), \(k = 6\).  
Compute:  
\[ h + k = 2 + 6 = 8 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals

Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(h + k\) for the center \((h, k)\) of the circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((h, k)\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(h + k\) (completed).  

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \(h + k = 8\).

**Final Answer**: \(h + k = 8\)
