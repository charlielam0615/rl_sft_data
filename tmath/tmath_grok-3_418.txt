**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( x \) at which the function \( y = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 8}{x - 4} \) has a vertical asymptote. A vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator of a rational function equals zero, provided the numerator does not also equal zero at that point, as this would indicate a hole instead.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the vertical asymptote, break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the condition for a vertical asymptote (denominator equals zero).  
2. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( x \).  
3. Check if the numerator is zero at the same \( x \) to rule out a hole.  
4. Confirm the vertical asymptote.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine where the denominator equals zero.  
Description: The denominator of the function is \( x - 4 \). Set \( x - 4 = 0 \) and solve for \( x \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ x - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 4 \]  
So, \( x = 4 \) is a candidate for a vertical asymptote.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check if the numerator is zero at \( x = 4 \) to ensure itâ€™s not a hole.  
Description: Evaluate the numerator \( x^2 + 2x + 8 \) at \( x = 4 \). If the numerator is non-zero, \( x = 4 \) is a vertical asymptote.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Evaluate the numerator at \( x = 4 \):  
\[ x^2 + 2x + 8 = 4^2 + 2 \cdot 4 + 8 = 16 + 8 + 8 = 32 \]  
Since the numerator is 32 (non-zero) at \( x = 4 \), there is no hole, and \( x = 4 \) is a vertical asymptote.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) where there is a vertical asymptote.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for a vertical asymptote (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) where the denominator is zero (completed: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Check the numerator at \( x = 4 \) to rule out a hole (completed: numerator is 32, non-zero).  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the vertical asymptote (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved; \( x = 4 \) is the vertical asymptote.

**Final Answer**: The function \( y = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 8}{x - 4} \) has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \).
