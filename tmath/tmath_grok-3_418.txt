**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the vertical asymptote, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for a vertical asymptote in a rational function.  
2. Identify the denominator of the given function and set it equal to zero.  
3. Solve for the value of \( x \) that makes the denominator zero.  
4. Verify that the numerator is non-zero at this \( x \)-value to confirm the asymptote.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the condition for a vertical asymptote and apply it to the function. A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator of a rational function is zero, and the numerator is non-zero at that point. To achieve this, find the value of \( x \) that makes the denominator \( x - 4 = 0 \), then check the numerator at that point.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the function \( y = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 8}{x - 4} \), a vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator is zero. Set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ x - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 4 \]  

Next, check if the numerator is non-zero at \( x = 4 \):  
Numerator: \( x^2 + 2x + 8 \)  
Substitute \( x = 4 \):  
\[ 4^2 + 2(4) + 8 = 16 + 8 + 8 = 32 \]  
Since the numerator is 32 (non-zero) and the denominator is zero at \( x = 4 \), there is a vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 4 \) correctly produces a vertical asymptote. This involves confirming that the function is undefined at \( x = 4 \) and checking the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches 4 from both sides to ensure it approaches infinity or negative infinity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, confirm the function is undefined at \( x = 4 \):  
\[ y = \frac{4^2 + 2(4) + 8}{4 - 4} = \frac{32}{0} \]  
The function is undefined at \( x = 4 \), as division by zero occurs.  

Next, analyze the behavior as \( x \) approaches 4:  
- As \( x \to 4^+ \), the denominator \( x - 4 \to 0^+ \), and the numerator approaches 32 (positive). Thus, \( y \to +\infty \).  
- As \( x \to 4^- \), the denominator \( x - 4 \to 0^- \), and the numerator remains positive, so \( y \to -\infty \).  

Since the function approaches infinity or negative infinity, \( x = 4 \) is indeed a vertical asymptote.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( x \) for which \( y = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 8}{x - 4} \) has a vertical asymptote.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for a vertical asymptote (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and solve for the denominator equal to zero (completed: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the numerator is non-zero at \( x = 4 \) (completed: numerator = 32).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the asymptote by checking the functionâ€™s behavior (completed: approaches \( \pm \infty \)).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution, as all subgoals are complete.  

The value of \( x \) that produces a vertical asymptote is \( x = 4 \).

**Final Answer**: The function \( y = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 8}{x - 4} \) has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \).
