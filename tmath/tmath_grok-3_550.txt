**Problem Statement**: Find the greatest possible sum of two consecutive integers such that their product is less than 400.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break down the goal into manageable subgoals:
1. Define the two consecutive integers mathematically.
2. Set up the constraint that their product is less than 400.
3. Express their sum in terms of the integers.
4. Maximize the sum while ensuring the product constraint is satisfied.
5. Verify the solution by checking boundary conditions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the two consecutive integers and set up the product constraint.
How to Achieve: Let the first integer be \( n \), so the second is \( n+1 \). Their product is \( n(n+1) \), which must be less than 400, i.e., \( n(n+1) < 400 \). The sum is \( n + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s represent the two consecutive integers as \( n \) and \( n+1 \), where \( n \) is an integer. Their product is:
\[ n(n+1) < 400 \]
Their sum is:
\[ n + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \]
Our goal is to maximize \( 2n + 1 \) while ensuring \( n(n+1) < 400 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the largest integer \( n \) such that \( n(n+1) < 400 \).
How to Achieve: Solve the inequality \( n(n+1) < 400 \) to find the maximum integer \( n \). Since the sum \( 2n + 1 \) increases with \( n \), the largest \( n \) satisfying the product constraint will maximize the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the inequality:
\[ n(n+1) < 400 \]
This is a quadratic inequality. Consider the equation:
\[ n(n+1) = 400 \]
\[ n^2 + n - 400 = 0 \]
Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = -400 \):
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 1600}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1601}}{2} \]
Since \( \sqrt{1601} \approx 40.0125 \):
\[ n \approx \frac{-1 + 40.0125}{2} \approx 19.50625 \quad \text{or} \quad n \approx \frac{-1 - 40.0125}{2} \approx -20.50625 \]
Since \( n \) is a positive integer, test integers around the positive root (\( n \approx 19.50625 \)). Try \( n = 19 \):
\[ 19 \cdot 20 = 380 < 400 \]
Try \( n = 20 \):
\[ 20 \cdot 21 = 420 > 400 \]
Thus, \( n = 19 \) is the largest integer satisfying \( n(n+1) < 400 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum for the largest valid \( n \).
How to Achieve: Use \( n = 19 \) to calculate the sum \( 2n + 1 \) and verify the product constraint.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = 19 \):
- Integers: \( 19 \) and \( 20 \)
- Product: \( 19 \cdot 20 = 380 < 400 \)
- Sum: \( 19 + 20 = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39 \)

Check \( n = 20 \):
- Product: \( 20 \cdot 21 = 420 > 400 \) (invalid)
Thus, the sum for \( n = 19 \) is \( 39 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( n = 19 \) gives the maximum sum and no larger sum is possible.
How to Achieve: Confirm the product for \( n = 19 \) is valid, and check \( n = 20 \) or higher to ensure they violate the constraint. Also, consider negative integers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \( n = 19 \): Product is \( 380 < 400 \), sum is \( 39 \).
- For \( n = 20 \): Product is \( 420 > 400 \), so not valid.
Consider negative integers, e.g., \( n = -20 \), \( n+1 = -19 \):
- Product: \( (-20) \cdot (-19) = 380 < 400 \)
- Sum: \( -20 + (-19) = -39 \)
Since \( -39 < 39 \), negative integers yield smaller sums. Thus, \( n = 19 \) maximizes the sum.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the greatest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the integers as \( n \) and \( n+1 \).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve \( n(n+1) < 400 \).
  - Subgoal 3: Maximize the sum \( 2n + 1 \).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.
Current Goal: Completed — solution found with sum \( 39 \) for \( n = 19 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The greatest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400 is **39** (for integers 19 and 20).
