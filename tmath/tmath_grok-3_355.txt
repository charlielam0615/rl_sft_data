### Problem Statement
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation by isolating terms involving \( 2^x \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( 2^x \).  
3. Find \( x \) by applying the logarithm.  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation by isolating terms involving \( 2^x \). This will be achieved by moving all terms with \( 2^x \) to one side of the equation and constants to the other.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \]  

Subtract \( 2^x \) from both sides to get:  
\[ 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 2^x - 26 \]  

Simplify the right-hand side:  
\[ 3 \cdot 2^x - 2^x = (3 - 1) \cdot 2^x = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  

So the equation becomes:  
\[ 6 = 2 \cdot 2^x - 26 \]  

Add 26 to both sides:  
\[ 6 + 26 = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  
\[ 32 = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  

Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ 2^x = 16 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( 2^x = 16 \) for \( x \). This will be achieved by recognizing that 16 is a power of 2 and equating exponents, or by applying the logarithm.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ 2^x = 16 \]  

Since \( 16 = 2^4 \), we can rewrite the equation as:  
\[ 2^x = 2^4 \]  

Equating the exponents (since the bases are the same):  
\[ x = 4 \]  

Alternatively, apply the logarithm:  
\[ \log_2(2^x) = \log_2(16) \]  
\[ x = \log_2(2^4) = 4 \]  

Both methods confirm \( x = 4 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 4 \) by substituting it back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation \( 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \):  

Left-hand side:  
\[ 2^4 + 6 = 16 + 6 = 22 \]  

Right-hand side:  
\[ 3 \cdot 2^4 - 26 = 3 \cdot 16 - 26 = 48 - 26 = 22 \]  

Since \( 22 = 22 \), the solution \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation.
