**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation. The goal is to isolate the variable \(x\). Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation by moving terms involving \(2^x\) to one side and constants to the other.  
2. Solve for \(2^x\).  
3. Use logarithms to isolate \(x\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation by moving terms involving \(2^x\) to one side and constants to the other.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract \(2^x\) from both sides and add 26 to both sides to isolate terms.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26 \]  
Subtract \(2^x\) from both sides:  
\[ 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 2^x - 26 \]  
Simplify the right-hand side:  
\[ 6 = 2 \cdot 2^x - 26 \]  
Add 26 to both sides:  
\[ 32 = 2 \cdot 2^x \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ 16 = 2^x \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(2^x = 16\).  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize that 16 can be expressed as a power of 2, or use logarithms to solve for \(x\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ 2^x = 16 \]  
Since \(16 = 2^4\), we can write:  
\[ 2^x = 2^4 \]  
Equating the exponents (since the bases are the same):  
\[ x = 4 \]  
Alternatively, using logarithms:  
\[ \log(2^x) = \log(16) \]  
\[ x \cdot \log(2) = \log(2^4) = 4 \cdot \log(2) \]  
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(x = 4\) satisfies the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = 4\) into both sides of the original equation and check for equality.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original equation: \(2^x + 6 = 3 \cdot 2^x - 26\)  
Substitute \(x = 4\):  
Left-hand side:  
\[ 2^4 + 6 = 16 + 6 = 22 \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ 3 \cdot 2^4 - 26 = 3 \cdot 16 - 26 = 48 - 26 = 22 \]  
Since \(22 = 22\), the solution \(x = 4\) is correct.
