### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that a fair coin tossed six times results in a sequence with exactly two heads. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes for six coin tosses.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (sequences with exactly two heads).  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
4. Express the probability as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible outcomes for six coin tosses. Achieve this by calculating the number of possible sequences, considering each toss has two outcomes (heads or tails).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since a fair coin has two outcomes (heads or tails) and it is tossed six times, the total number of possible sequences is:  
\[ 2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64. \]  
Thus, there are 64 possible outcomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of sequences with exactly two heads. Achieve this by using the binomial coefficient to count the number of ways to choose two positions out of six for heads.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The number of sequences with exactly two heads corresponds to choosing 2 positions out of 6 for heads (the rest will be tails). This is given by the binomial coefficient:  
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = \frac{30}{2} = 15. \]  
Thus, there are 15 favorable outcomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations for total and favorable outcomes. Check the correctness of the total number of outcomes (64) and the number of favorable outcomes (15).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Total outcomes**: Recalculate \( 2^6 \):  
  \( 2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64 \). This confirms 64 total outcomes.  
- **Favorable outcomes**: Recalculate \( \binom{6}{2} \):  
  \( \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \). This confirms 15 favorable outcomes.  
Both calculations are consistent and correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability of exactly two heads in six coin tosses as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes (completed: 64 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (completed: 15 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable to total outcomes (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the probability as a common fraction.  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable to total outcomes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Achieve this by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (15) by the total number of outcomes (64).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{15}{64}. \]  
This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 15 and 64 have no common factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the probability calculation. Check if \( \frac{15}{64} \) is correct and in simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Probability calculation**: Recalculate:  
  Favorable outcomes = 15, total outcomes = 64, so \( P = \frac{15}{64} \). This matches the previous result.  
- **Simplest form**: Check for common factors between 15 and 64.  
  - Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15.  
  - Factors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.  
  The only common factor is 1, so \( \frac{15}{64} \) is in simplest form.  
The probability calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the probability as a common fraction. Since the probability has been computed as \( \frac{15}{64} \), confirm this meets the requirement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability is \( \frac{15}{64} \), which is a common fraction in its simplest form. This satisfies the problemâ€™s requirement.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that a fair coin tossed six times results in a sequence with exactly two heads is:  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{15}{64}} \]
