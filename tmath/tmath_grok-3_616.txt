### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that a fair coin, tossed six times, results in a sequence with exactly two heads. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes for six coin tosses.
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (sequences with exactly two heads).
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
4. Express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for six coin tosses.
How to Achieve: Since each coin toss has 2 outcomes (heads or tails) and the coin is tossed 6 times, calculate 2^6.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each coin toss is independent with 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). For 6 tosses, the total number of possible sequences is:
2^6 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64.
Thus, there are 64 possible outcomes.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (sequences with exactly two heads).
How to Achieve: Use the binomial coefficient C(n, k) to find the number of ways to choose 2 heads in 6 tosses, where n=6 and k=2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of ways to get exactly 2 heads in 6 tosses is given by the binomial coefficient C(6, 2):
C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 30 / 2 = 15.
Thus, there are 15 favorable outcomes.

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the probability of exactly two heads in six coin tosses.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total outcomes (completed: 64 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate favorable outcomes (completed: 15 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability as a ratio.
  - Subgoal 4: Express as a common fraction.
Current Goal: Compute the probability as a ratio.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (15) by the total number of outcomes (64).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
P = 15 / 64.
Since 15 and 64 have no common factors (15 = 3 * 5, 64 = 2^6), the fraction 15/64 is in its simplest form.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the current path.
How to Achieve: Verify the calculations for total outcomes, favorable outcomes, and the probability fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total outcomes: 2^6 = 64. Correct, as each of 6 tosses has 2 outcomes.
- Favorable outcomes: C(6, 2) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15. Correct, as binomial coefficient calculation is standard.
- Probability: 15 / 64. The fraction is simplified (no common factors). Correct.
The calculations are consistent and align with the problem's requirements.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that a fair coin tossed six times results in a sequence with exactly two heads is **15/64**.
