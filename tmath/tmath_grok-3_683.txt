**Problem Restatement**: James has 7 apples, 4 red and 3 green. We need to calculate the probability of choosing 2 green apples when selecting 2 apples at random.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability of selecting 2 green apples from 7 apples.  
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 apples from 7.  
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 green apples from 3 green apples.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 apples from 7 apples. This can be achieved using the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of apples (7) and \( k \) is the number of apples chosen (2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 apples from 7:  
\[ C(7, 2) = \frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]  
So, there are 21 possible ways to choose 2 apples from 7.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 green apples from 3 green apples. Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) \), where \( n \) is the number of green apples (3) and \( k \) is the number of apples chosen (2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 green apples from 3:  
\[ C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2}{2 \times 1} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]  
So, there are 3 favorable outcomes where both apples are green.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability of choosing 2 green apples, which is the ratio of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 green apples) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 2 apples).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:  
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 green apples}}{\text{Total ways to choose 2 apples}} = \frac{C(3, 2)}{C(7, 2)} = \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7} \]  
So, the probability is \( \frac{1}{7} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations for accuracy by checking the combination formulas and the probability computation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck the calculations:  
- Total ways: \( C(7, 2) = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21 \). Correct.  
- Favorable ways: \( C(3, 2) = \frac{3 \times 2}{2 \times 1} = 3 \). Correct.  
- Probability: \( \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.142857 \). The fraction is simplified correctly.  
The calculations are consistent and follow the rules of probability for combinations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the probability of choosing 2 green apples from 7 apples.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute total ways to choose 2 apples from 7 (completed: 21 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute ways to choose 2 green apples from 3 (completed: 3 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute probability as the ratio of favorable to total outcomes (completed: \( \frac{1}{7} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate calculations (completed: calculations verified).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is resolved.  
The probability of choosing 2 green apples is \( \frac{1}{7} \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability that both apples chosen are green is \( \frac{1}{7} \).
