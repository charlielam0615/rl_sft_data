1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses.
2. Multiply the result by 3.
3. Apply the ceiling function to the result.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses, $6 - \frac{1}{2}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expression inside the parentheses is $6 - \frac{1}{2}$. Converting 6 to a fraction with denominator 2, we get:  
$$
6 = \frac{12}{2}
$$  
So,  
$$
6 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{12}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply the result $\frac{11}{2}$ by 3.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To multiply $\frac{11}{2}$ by 3, we can rewrite 3 as $\frac{3}{1}$:  
$$
\frac{11}{2} \times 3 = \frac{11}{2} \times \frac{3}{1} = \frac{33}{2}
$$  
The result of the multiplication is $\frac{33}{2}$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the ceiling function to the result $\frac{33}{2}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The ceiling function $\lceil x \rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.  
$$
\frac{33}{2} = 16.5
$$  
The smallest integer greater than or equal to $16.5$ is $17$.  
$$
\left\lceil \frac{33}{2} \right\rceil = 17
$$  
The final result is $17$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Parentheses calculation**:  
   Original expression: $6 - \frac{1}{2}$.  
   Conversion of 6 to twelfths: $6 = \frac{12}{2}$.  
   Subtraction: $\frac{12}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{2}$.  
   This is correct.  

2. **Multiplication by 3**:  
   $\frac{11}{2} \times 3 = \frac{33}{2}$.  
   This is correct.  

3. **Ceiling function application**:  
   $\frac{33}{2} = 16.5$.  
   The ceiling of 16.5 is the smallest integer â‰¥ 16.5, which is 17.  
   This is correct.  

All operations follow mathematical rules (fraction arithmetic, ceiling function definition). No inconsistencies or errors detected.
