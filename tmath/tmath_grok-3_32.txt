### Problem Statement
We need to find the product \( Q \cdot E \cdot D \), where \( Q = 5 + 2i \), \( E = i \), and \( D = 5 - 2i \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( Q \cdot E \cdot D \).  
1. Compute the product \( Q \cdot E \).  
2. Multiply the result by \( D \).  
3. Simplify the final expression to the form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( Q \cdot E \), where \( Q = 5 + 2i \) and \( E = i \). This will be achieved by multiplying the complex number \( 5 + 2i \) by \( i \), using the distributive property and the fact that \( i^2 = -1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( Q \cdot E \):  
\[ Q \cdot E = (5 + 2i) \cdot i = 5i + 2i \cdot i = 5i + 2i^2 = 5i + 2(-1) = 5i - 2 = -2 + 5i. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the product of the result from Step 2, \( -2 + 5i \), and \( D = 5 - 2i \). This will be achieved by multiplying the complex numbers \( -2 + 5i \) and \( 5 - 2i \), using the distributive property and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( (-2 + 5i) \cdot (5 - 2i) \):  
\[ (-2 + 5i)(5 - 2i) = (-2) \cdot 5 + (-2) \cdot (-2i) + 5i \cdot 5 + 5i \cdot (-2i) \]  
\[ = -10 + 4i + 25i - 10i^2 \]  
\[ = -10 + 4i + 25i - 10(-1) \]  
\[ = -10 + 10 + 4i + 25i \]  
\[ = 0 + 29i = 29i. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( Q \cdot E \cdot D \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( Q \cdot E \) (completed: result is \( -2 + 5i \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply the result by \( D \) (completed: result is \( 29i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the final expression to the form \( a + bi \) (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Simplify the final expression \( 29i \) to the form \( a + bi \).  
The result \( 29i \) is already in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 29 \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( 29i \) by checking the computation of \( Q \cdot E \cdot D \). This will be achieved by recomputing the product in a different order, such as \( Q \cdot D \cdot E \), to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( Q \cdot D \cdot E \):  
First, compute \( Q \cdot D \):  
\[ Q \cdot D = (5 + 2i)(5 - 2i) = 5 \cdot 5 - 5 \cdot 2i + 2i \cdot 5 - 2i \cdot 2i \]  
\[ = 25 - 10i + 10i - 4i^2 = 25 - 4(-1) = 25 + 4 = 29. \]  
Now multiply by \( E = i \):  
\[ 29 \cdot i = 29i. \]  

The result matches the previous computation (\( 29i \)), confirming the validity of the solution.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The product \( Q \cdot E \cdot D = 29i \).  
In the form \( a + bi \), the answer is \( 0 + 29i \).
