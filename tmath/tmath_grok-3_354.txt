### Problem Restatement
The area of a square is given by \( A = s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length. The perimeter is \( P = 4s \). We are given two squares such that the sum of their areas is 65 (\( A_1 + A_2 = 65 \)) and the difference in their areas is 33 (\( A_1 - A_2 = 33 \)). We need to find the sum of their perimeters (\( P_1 + P_2 \)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the areas of the two squares using the given equations.  
2. Determine the side lengths of the squares from their areas.  
3. Calculate the perimeters of the squares.  
4. Compute the sum of the perimeters.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the areas of the two squares. Achieve this by setting up and solving the system of equations given by the sum and difference of the areas: \( A_1 + A_2 = 65 \) and \( A_1 - A_2 = 33 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the system of equations:  
1. \( A_1 + A_2 = 65 \)  
2. \( A_1 - A_2 = 33 \)  

Add the equations to eliminate \( A_2 \):  
\[ (A_1 + A_2) + (A_1 - A_2) = 65 + 33 \]  
\[ 2A_1 = 98 \]  
\[ A_1 = 49 \]  

Substitute \( A_1 = 49 \) into the first equation:  
\[ 49 + A_2 = 65 \]  
\[ A_2 = 65 - 49 = 16 \]  

Thus, the areas are \( A_1 = 49 \) and \( A_2 = 16 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the areas found (\( A_1 = 49 \), \( A_2 = 16 \)). Check if they satisfy both given conditions: sum equals 65 and difference equals 33.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the areas:  
- Sum: \( A_1 + A_2 = 49 + 16 = 65 \), which matches the given condition.  
- Difference: \( A_1 - A_2 = 49 - 16 = 33 \), which matches the given condition.  

The areas are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the side lengths of the squares. Since the area of a square is \( s^2 \), compute the side lengths by taking the square root of the areas: \( A_1 = 49 \), \( A_2 = 16 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the side lengths:  
- For the first square, \( A_1 = s_1^2 = 49 \), so \( s_1 = \sqrt{49} = 7 \).  
- For the second square, \( A_2 = s_2^2 = 16 \), so \( s_2 = \sqrt{16} = 4 \).  

Thus, the side lengths are \( s_1 = 7 \) and \( s_2 = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the perimeters of the squares. Use the formula \( P = 4s \) with side lengths \( s_1 = 7 \) and \( s_2 = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the perimeters:  
- For the first square, \( P_1 = 4s_1 = 4 \cdot 7 = 28 \).  
- For the second square, \( P_2 = 4s_2 = 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the sum of the perimeters. Add the perimeters \( P_1 = 28 \) and \( P_2 = 16 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the sum:  
\[ P_1 + P_2 = 28 + 16 = 44 \]  

The sum of the perimeters is 44.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the perimeters of two squares.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the areas (\( A_1 = 49 \), \( A_2 = 16 \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine side lengths (\( s_1 = 7 \), \( s_2 = 4 \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate perimeters (\( P_1 = 28 \), \( P_2 = 16 \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute sum of perimeters (\( P_1 + P_2 = 44 \)). [Completed]  
Current goal: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the solution path.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is complete, with all subgoals achieved. The final answer, \( P_1 + P_2 = 44 \), aligns with the calculations from the side lengths and perimeters derived from the validated areas.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The sum of the perimeters of the two squares is **44**.
