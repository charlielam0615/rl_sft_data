### Problem Restatement
The area of a square is the square of its side length, and the perimeter is four times the side length. Given that the sum of the areas of two squares is 65 and the difference in their areas is 33, find the sum of their perimeters.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for the side lengths of the two squares.
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions for the sum and difference of their areas.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the side lengths.
4. Calculate the perimeters of both squares using the side lengths.
5. Compute the sum of their perimeters.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations for the sum and difference of the areas. Let the side lengths of the two squares be \( s \) and \( t \), where \( s \) is the side of the larger square. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the areas are \( s^2 \) and \( t^2 \). The sum of the areas gives \( s^2 + t^2 = 65 \), and the difference (assuming the larger square’s area minus the smaller one’s) gives \( s^2 - t^2 = 33 \). These equations will be used to find \( s \) and \( t \).

[IMP]
Let the side lengths of the two squares be \( s \) and \( t \), with \( s \geq t \). The area of a square is the side length squared, so:
- Sum of areas: \( s^2 + t^2 = 65 \)
- Difference of areas: \( s^2 - t^2 = 33 \)

These are the equations based on the given conditions.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( s^2 + t^2 = 65 \) and \( s^2 - t^2 = 33 \) to find the side lengths \( s \) and \( t \). Add the equations to eliminate \( t^2 \), then solve for \( s^2 \). Substitute back to find \( t^2 \), and take square roots to get \( s \) and \( t \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the system:
1. \( s^2 + t^2 = 65 \)
2. \( s^2 - t^2 = 33 \)

Add the equations:
\[ (s^2 + t^2) + (s^2 - t^2) = 65 + 33 \]
\[ 2s^2 = 98 \]
\[ s^2 = 49 \]
\[ s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \] (since side lengths are positive).

Substitute \( s^2 = 49 \) into the first equation:
\[ 49 + t^2 = 65 \]
\[ t^2 = 65 - 49 = 16 \]
\[ t = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

The side lengths are \( s = 7 \) and \( t = 4 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the side lengths \( s = 7 \) and \( t = 4 \) by checking if they satisfy both given conditions: sum of areas equals 65 and difference of areas equals 33. Compute the areas and compare with the given values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify:
- Area of first square: \( s^2 = 7^2 = 49 \)
- Area of second square: \( t^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
- Sum of areas: \( 49 + 16 = 65 \), which matches.
- Difference of areas: \( 49 - 16 = 33 \), which matches.

The side lengths \( s = 7 \) and \( t = 4 \) satisfy both conditions.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the perimeters of the squares with side lengths \( s = 7 \) and \( t = 4 \), then find their sum. The perimeter of a square is four times its side length, so compute \( 4s \) and \( 4t \), then add them.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perimeter of first square: \( 4s = 4 \times 7 = 28 \)
Perimeter of second square: \( 4t = 4 \times 4 = 16 \)
Sum of perimeters: \( 28 + 16 = 44 \)
[/IMP]

Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the sum of the perimeters of two squares given the sum of their areas is 65 and the difference is 33.
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for side lengths (completed: \( s \) and \( t \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations for sum and difference of areas (completed: \( s^2 + t^2 = 65 \), \( s^2 - t^2 = 33 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve equations for side lengths (completed: \( s = 7 \), \( t = 4 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify side lengths (completed: conditions satisfied).
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate perimeters and their sum (completed: sum is 44).
