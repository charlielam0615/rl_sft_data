**Problem Statement**: There are three containers: Container A has 4 red balls and 6 green balls, while containers B and C each have 6 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is chosen at random, and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. We need to find the probability that the selected ball is green, expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each container.  
2. Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container.  
3. Combine these probabilities to find the total probability of selecting a green ball.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of selecting each container.  
How to Achieve: Since there are three containers (A, B, C) and one is chosen at random, the probability of selecting any one container is 1/3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
There are three containers, so the probability of selecting container A is 1/3, container B is 1/3, and container C is 1/3.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container.  
How to Achieve: For each container, calculate the fraction of green balls by dividing the number of green balls by the total number of balls in that container.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Container A: 4 red + 6 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green = 6/10 = 3/5.  
- Container B: 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green = 4/10 = 2/5.  
- Container C: 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green = 4/10 = 2/5.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that a randomly selected ball is green.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the probability of selecting each container (completed: 1/3 for each).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container (completed: 3/5 for A, 2/5 for B, 2/5 for C).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine these probabilities to find the total probability (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is:  
- Main Goal: Probability of selecting a green ball.  
  - Subgoal 1: Probability of selecting each container (1/3 for A, B, C).  
  - Subgoal 2: Probability of green ball per container (A: 3/5, B: 2/5, C: 2/5).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine probabilities (current focus).  
Current Goal: Combine the probabilities to compute the total probability of selecting a green ball.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Combine the probabilities to find the total probability of selecting a green ball.  
How to Achieve: Use the law of total probability. Multiply the probability of selecting each container by the probability of selecting a green ball from that container, then sum the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total probability of selecting a green ball is:  
P(green) = P(A) × P(green|A) + P(B) × P(green|B) + P(C) × P(green|C)  
= (1/3 × 3/5) + (1/3 × 2/5) + (1/3 × 2/5)  
= (1/3 × 3/5) + (1/3 × 2/5) + (1/3 × 2/5)  
= (3/15) + (2/15) + (2/15)  
= (3 + 2 + 2)/15  
= 7/15.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated probability.  
How to Achieve: Check the calculations for each step and ensure the sum of probabilities is consistent with the problem’s structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Container selection: 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1, which is correct.  
- Green ball probabilities:  
  - Container A: 6 green / 10 total = 3/5.  
  - Container B: 4 green / 10 total = 2/5.  
  - Container C: 4 green / 10 total = 2/5.  
- Total probability: (1/3 × 3/5) + (1/3 × 2/5) + (1/3 × 2/5) = 3/15 + 2/15 + 2/15 = 7/15.  
The calculations are consistent, and 7/15 is a common fraction.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the selected ball is green is **7/15**.
