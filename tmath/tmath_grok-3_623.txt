### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that a randomly selected ball from a randomly chosen container (A, B, or C) is green. Container A has 4 red balls and 6 green balls (10 total). Containers B and C each have 6 red balls and 4 green balls (10 total each). The answer should be a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability of selecting a green ball.  
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each container.  
2. Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container.  
3. Combine these probabilities to find the total probability of selecting a green ball.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability of selecting each container.  
**How to Achieve**: Since there are three containers (A, B, C) and one is chosen at random, each container has an equal probability of being selected. There are 3 containers, so the probability of selecting any one is 1/3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are three containers: A, B, and C. Since the selection is random, the probability of choosing each container is:  
\[ P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = \frac{1}{3} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container.  
**How to Achieve**: For each container, calculate the probability of drawing a green ball by dividing the number of green balls by the total number of balls in that container.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Container A**: 4 red + 6 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green:  
  \[ P(\text{Green} | A) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} \]  
- **Container B**: 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green:  
  \[ P(\text{Green} | B) = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \]  
- **Container C**: Same as B, 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls total. Probability of green:  
  \[ P(\text{Green} | C) = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total probability of selecting a green ball.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the law of total probability. Multiply the probability of selecting each container by the probability of drawing a green ball from that container, then sum the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total probability of selecting a green ball is:  
\[ P(\text{Green}) = P(A) \cdot P(\text{Green} | A) + P(B) \cdot P(\text{Green} | B) + P(C) \cdot P(\text{Green} | C) \]  
Substitute the values:  
\[ P(\text{Green}) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \right) \]  
Calculate each term:  
- For A: \[ \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \]  
- For B: \[ \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{15} \]  
- For C: \[ \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{15} \]  
Sum them:  
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{15} \]  
\[ \frac{3}{15} + \frac{2}{15} + \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3 + 2 + 2}{15} = \frac{7}{15} \]  
So, \[ P(\text{Green}) = \frac{7}{15} \].  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the total probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the probability using an alternative method (e.g., total green balls across all containers) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative method: Consider all balls across the three containers.  
- Total balls: 10 (A) + 10 (B) + 10 (C) = 30 balls.  
- Total green balls: 6 (A) + 4 (B) + 4 (C) = 14 green balls.  
- Probability of selecting a green ball: \[ \frac{14}{30} = \frac{7}{15} \].  
This matches the previous result, confirming the calculation.  
[/IMP]
