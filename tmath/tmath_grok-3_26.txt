**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number \( x \) such that 16 is 64% of \( x \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \), and we need to solve for \( x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation.  
2. Solve the equation to find the unknown number.  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation. This can be achieved by expressing "16 is 64% of what number" as \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \), where \( x \) is the unknown number.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
"64% of a number" means 64% (or 0.64) multiplied by the unknown number \( x \). Thus, the problem statement "16 is 64% of what number" translates to the equation:  
\[ 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \) for \( x \). This can be achieved by isolating \( x \) through division.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \]  
To isolate \( x \), divide both sides by 0.64:  
\[ x = \frac{16}{0.64} \]  
Calculate:  
\[ \frac{16}{0.64} = 16 \div 0.64 = 25 \]  
(Alternatively, note that \( 0.64 = \frac{64}{100} = \frac{16}{25} \), so:  
\[ x = \frac{16}{\frac{16}{25}} = 16 \cdot \frac{25}{16} = 25 \])  
Thus, \( x = 25 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 25 \) by checking if 16 is indeed 64% of 25. This can be achieved by computing 64% of 25 and comparing it to 16.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate 64% of 25:  
\[ 0.64 \cdot 25 = 16 \]  
Since 16 matches the given value, the solution \( x = 25 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number \( x \) such that 16 is 64% of \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation to find \( x \) (completed, \( x = 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution validated).  
**Current Goal**: No further goals remain, as the problem is solved.
