**Problem Statement**: Find the number of which 16 is 64%. In mathematical terms, we need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the unknown number.  
1. Translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation.  
2. Solve the equation to find the unknown number.  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation. This involves expressing "16 is 64% of what number" as \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \), where \( x \) is the unknown number.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
"16 is 64% of what number" means 16 equals 64% (or 0.64) multiplied by the unknown number \( x \). Thus, the equation is:  
\[ 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \) for \( x \). This can be achieved by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.64.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve \( 16 = 0.64 \cdot x \), divide both sides by 0.64:  
\[ x = \frac{16}{0.64} \]  
Calculate:  
\[ 16 \div 0.64 = 16 \div \frac{64}{100} = 16 \cdot \frac{100}{64} = \frac{1600}{64} = 25 \]  
So, \( x = 25 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that 16 is 64% of 25. This can be done by calculating 64% of 25 and checking if it equals 16.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate 64% of 25:  
\[ 0.64 \cdot 25 = 16 \]  
Since the result is 16, the solution \( x = 25 \) is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of which 16 is 64%.  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the percentage problem into a mathematical equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation to find the unknown number (completed, \( x = 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, verified correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the problem is solved.  
**Final Answer**: 16 is 64% of 25.
