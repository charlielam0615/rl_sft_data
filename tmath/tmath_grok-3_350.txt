**Problem Restatement**: Find the sum of all solutions to the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the sum of all solutions into subgoals:  
1. Solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) to find all possible values of \(x\).  
2. Identify all distinct solutions.  
3. Calculate the sum of these solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) to find all values of \(x\). This can be achieved by taking the square root of both sides, accounting for both positive and negative roots, and solving for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve \((x-6)^2 = 25\):  
- Take the square root of both sides: \(x - 6 = \pm \sqrt{25}\).  
- Since \(\sqrt{25} = 5\), we have \(x - 6 = \pm 5\).  
- This gives two equations:  
  - \(x - 6 = 5 \implies x = 5 + 6 = 11\).  
  - \(x - 6 = -5 \implies x = -5 + 6 = 1\).  
Thus, the solutions are \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\) by substituting them back into the original equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For \(x = 11\): \((11 - 6)^2 = 5^2 = 25\), which satisfies the equation.  
- For \(x = 1\): \((1 - 6)^2 = (-5)^2 = 25\), which satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are valid.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all solutions to \((x-6)^2 = 25\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) (completed: solutions are \(x = 11, x = 1\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify all distinct solutions (completed: solutions are \(x = 11, x = 1\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum of these solutions (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the solutions \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the solutions \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\). This can be achieved by adding the values directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sum of solutions: \(11 + 1 = 12\).

**Final Answer**: The sum of all solutions to the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) is \(12\).
