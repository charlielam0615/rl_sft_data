**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of all solutions to the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation and find the sum of its solutions.  
- Subgoal 1: Solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) to find all possible values of \(x\).  
- Subgoal 2: Sum the solutions obtained from Subgoal 1.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) for all values of \(x\). This can be achieved by taking the square root of both sides and solving the resulting linear equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To solve \((x-6)^2 = 25\), take the square root of both sides:  
\[
x - 6 = \pm \sqrt{25} = \pm 5
\]  
This gives two equations:  
1. \(x - 6 = 5\)  
   \[
   x = 5 + 6 = 11
   \]  
2. \(x - 6 = -5\)  
   \[
   x = -5 + 6 = 1
   \]  
The solutions are \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\) satisfy the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\). This can be achieved by substituting each solution back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check \(x = 11\):  
\[
(11 - 6)^2 = 5^2 = 25
\]  
This satisfies the equation.  

Check \(x = 1\):  
\[
(1 - 6)^2 = (-5)^2 = 25
\]  
This also satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all solutions to \((x-6)^2 = 25\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) (Completed: Solutions are \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum the solutions (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the solutions obtained from Subgoal 1.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the solutions \(x = 11\) and \(x = 1\). This can be achieved by adding the two values.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Sum the solutions:  
\[
11 + 1 = 12
\]  
The sum of all solutions is 12.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all solutions to the equation \((x-6)^2 = 25\) is \(12\).
