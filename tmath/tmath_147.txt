Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations $ x - y = 3 $ and $ x + y = 31 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given the two equations:  
1. $ x - y = 3 $  
2. $ x + y = 31 $  

To solve for $ x $ and $ y $, we can use the method of elimination. Adding the two equations together eliminates $ y $:  

$$
(x - y) + (x + y) = 3 + 31
$$  
$$
2x = 34
$$  
$$
x = 17
$$  

Now substitute $ x = 17 $ into the second equation $ x + y = 31 $:  

$$
17 + y = 31
$$  
$$
y = 14
$$  

The two numbers are 17 and 14. The larger number is 17.

[VERIFY]
1. Equations setup:  
   - Difference of 3: $ x - y = 3 $  
   - Sum of 31: $ x + y = 31 $  
   **Verification**: The equations correctly model the problem's constraints.  

2. Solving the system:  
   - Adding equations: $ (x - y) + (x + y) = 3 + 31 \rightarrow 2x = 34 \rightarrow x = 17 $.  
   - Substituting $ x = 17 $ into $ x + y = 31 $: $ y = 14 $.  
   **Verification**: The algebraic steps are logically valid and error-free.  

3. Final check of solution:  
   - $ 17 - 14 = 3 $ (satisfies the difference condition).  
   - $ 17 + 14 = 31 $ (satisfies the sum condition).  
   **Verification**: The solution meets both constraints.  

4. Conclusion: The larger number is 17.  
**Overall**: No inconsistencies or errors detected in the reasoning or calculations.
