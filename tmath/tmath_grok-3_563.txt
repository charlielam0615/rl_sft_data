**Problem Restatement**: Find all positive values of \( c \) such that the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) has real solutions for \( x \), and express the answer in interval notation.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Determine the conditions for the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) to have real solutions.  
2. Identify the constraints on \( c \) being positive.  
3. Express the solution in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the conditions for \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) to have real solutions.  
How to Achieve: Analyze the quadratic \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \). For the inequality \( f(x) < 0 \) to have real solutions, the parabola must open upward (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), have real roots (discriminant \( \Delta \geq 0 \)), and the region between the roots must satisfy \( f(x) < 0 \). Compute the discriminant and ensure the parabola is below the x-axis between the roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, the parabola opens upward. For \( f(x) < 0 \) to have real solutions, the parabola must cross or touch the x-axis (real roots exist), and the inequality holds between the roots.  

The roots are found by solving \( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \). The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = (-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 36 - 4c \]  
For real roots, require:  
\[ 36 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
\[ 4c \leq 36 \]  
\[ c \leq 9 \]  

Additionally, for \( f(x) < 0 \) to hold between the roots, the parabola must be negative in that region. Since the parabola opens upward, \( f(x) < 0 \) occurs between the roots if they exist. If \( \Delta = 0 \), the parabola touches the x-axis at one point, and \( f(x) \leq 0 \) at that point, but \( f(x) < 0 \) has no solutions since the parabola is non-negative elsewhere. Thus, we need \( \Delta > 0 \):  
\[ 36 - 4c > 0 \]  
\[ 4c < 36 \]  
\[ c < 9 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the condition \( c < 9 \) ensures \( f(x) < 0 \) has real solutions.  
How to Achieve: Test boundary and interior values of \( c \) to confirm the inequality holds for some real \( x \) when \( c < 9 \), and check the behavior when \( c \geq 9 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test \( c = 8 \) (where \( c < 9 \)):  
\[ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 \]  
Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 8 = 36 - 32 = 4 > 0 \). Real roots exist.  
Roots: \( x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2}{2} \), so \( x = 4 \) or \( x = 2 \).  
Since the parabola opens upward, evaluate at the vertex (midpoint of roots):  
Vertex at \( x = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3 \).  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 6 \cdot 3 + 8 = 9 - 18 + 8 = -1 < 0 \]  
Thus, \( f(x) < 0 \) for \( x \in (2, 4) \), confirming real solutions exist.  

Test \( c = 9 \) (boundary):  
\[ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 \]  
Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 9 = 0 \). One real root at \( x = 3 \).  
\[ f(x) = (x - 3)^2 \geq 0 \]  
\( f(x) = 0 \) at \( x = 3 \), and \( f(x) > 0 \) elsewhere, so no real \( x \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \).  

Test \( c = 10 \) (where \( c > 9 \)):  
\[ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 10 \]  
Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 10 = 36 - 40 = -4 < 0 \). No real roots.  
Complete the square:  
\[ f(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 9 + 10 = (x - 3)^2 + 1 > 0 \]  
Since \( f(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \), no solutions exist for \( f(x) < 0 \).  

Thus, \( c < 9 \) is necessary and sufficient for real solutions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the condition \( c < 9 \) satisfies the requirement for real solutions, adjust the subgoal to incorporate the constraint that \( c \) must be positive (\( c > 0 \)) and express the final answer in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Incorporate the positivity constraint \( c > 0 \) and express the solution in interval notation.  
How to Achieve: Combine the condition \( c < 9 \) with \( c > 0 \), and write the resulting interval.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) has real solutions when \( c < 9 \). The problem requires \( c \) to be positive, so:  
\[ c > 0 \]  
Combining:  
\[ 0 < c < 9 \]  
In interval notation, this is:  
\[ (0, 9) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure all objectives are met and confirm the current goal is resolved.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find all positive \( c \) such that \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) has real solutions, in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine conditions for real solutions (\( c < 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Incorporate \( c > 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express in interval notation (\( (0, 9) \)).  

Current Goal: Express the solution in interval notation.
