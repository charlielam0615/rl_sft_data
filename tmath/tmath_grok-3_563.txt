**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Determine the conditions for the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) to have real solutions for \( x \).  
2. Analyze the quadratic function to find constraints on \( c \).  
3. Ensure \( c > 0 \) and express the solution in interval notation.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the conditions for the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) to have real solutions. This requires the quadratic to take negative values for some \( x \), which depends on the discriminant and the behavior of the parabola. We will analyze the discriminant and the vertex to find the range of \( c \).

Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \). For the inequality \( f(x) < 0 \) to have real solutions, the quadratic must take negative values over some interval of \( x \).

1. **Discriminant Analysis**: Since \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \) is a parabola opening upward (coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), the inequality \( f(x) < 0 \) has real solutions if the parabola dips below the x-axis, which requires real roots. The discriminant of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c
   \]
   For real roots, \( \Delta \geq 0 \):
   \[
   36 - 4c \geq 0 \implies 36 \geq 4c \implies c \leq 9
   \]
   Additionally, for the parabola to be negative between the roots (since it opens upward), the discriminant should be positive (\( \Delta > 0 \)) for the inequality to hold over an interval:
   \[
   36 - 4c > 0 \implies 36 > 4c \implies c < 9
   \]

2. **Vertex Analysis**: The vertex of the parabola \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + c \) occurs at:
   \[
   x = -\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{6}{2 \cdot 1} = 3
   \]
   Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the vertex:
   \[
   f(3) = 3^2 - 6 \cdot 3 + c = 9 - 18 + c = c - 9
   \]
   For the inequality \( f(x) < 0 \) to hold, the parabola must be negative at its vertex (the minimum point):
   \[
   c - 9 < 0 \implies c < 9
   \]

3. **Positive \( c \)**: The problem requires \( c > 0 \). Combining with the discriminant condition \( c < 9 \):
   \[
   0 < c < 9
   \]

Thus, the quadratic inequality has real solutions for \( x \) when \( 0 < c < 9 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the condition \( 0 < c < 9 \). We will test boundary and intermediate values of \( c \) to confirm the quadratic inequality has real solutions and check if the condition aligns with the requirement that \( c \) is positive.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) for different values of \( c \):

- **Case: \( c = 8 \) (within \( 0 < c < 9 \))**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 - 6x + 8 \). Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 8 = 4 > 0 \). Roots:
  \[
  x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2}{2} \implies x = 4, 2
  \]
  Since the parabola opens upward, \( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 < 0 \) between the roots: \( 2 < x < 4 \). This confirms real solutions exist.

- **Case: \( c = 9 \) (boundary)**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 \). Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 9 = 0 \). Single root at \( x = 3 \). Since \( (x - 3)^2 \geq 0 \), the inequality \( (x - 3)^2 < 0 \) has no real solutions, as the parabola touches the x-axis but never goes below it.

- **Case: \( c = 10 \) (outside, \( c > 9 \))**:  
  Discriminant: \( \Delta = 36 - 4 \cdot 10 = -4 < 0 \). No real roots, and since the parabola opens upward and the vertex value is \( f(3) = 10 - 9 = 1 > 0 \), \( f(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \). No solutions.

- **Case: \( c = 0 \) (boundary)**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 - 6x = x(x - 6) \). Roots at \( x = 0, 6 \). The inequality \( x(x - 6) < 0 \) holds for \( 0 < x < 6 \), so real solutions exist. However, \( c = 0 \) is not positive, so it is excluded.

The condition \( 0 < c < 9 \) holds, as \( c = 9 \) yields no solutions, and \( c > 9 \) or \( c \leq 0 \) either yield no solutions or violate the positivity constraint.
