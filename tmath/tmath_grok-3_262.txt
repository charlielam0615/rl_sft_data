**Problem Statement**: Find the center of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the center of the circle into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle equation in standard form by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).  
2. Identify the center from the standard form of the circle equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the circle equation in standard form.  
**How to Achieve**: Group the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms, complete the square for each, and simplify the equation to the form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation: \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).  
Group terms: \( (x^2 - 2x) + (y^2 - 4y) = 28 \).  

For \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 2x \).  
- Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-2\), halve it (\(-1\)), and square it: \((-1)^2 = 1\).  
- Add and subtract 1 inside the parentheses: \( x^2 - 2x = (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 = (x - 1)^2 - 1 \).  

For \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 - 4y \).  
- Take the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(-4\), halve it (\(-2\)), and square it: \((-2)^2 = 4\).  
- Add and subtract 4: \( y^2 - 4y = (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \).  

Substitute back:  
\( (x - 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 = 28 \).  
Simplify: \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1 - 4 = 28 \).  
\( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5 = 28 \).  
\( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \).  

The equation is now in standard form: \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the center from the standard form.  
**How to Achieve**: Extract the center \( (h, k) \) from the equation \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the standard form \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \), the center is at \( (h, k) = (1, 2) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the center by checking the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the center \( (1, 2) \) into the original equation to ensure consistency or confirm the standard form derivation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, confirm the standard form derivation:  
Original: \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).  
From Step 2:  
- \( x^2 - 2x = (x - 1)^2 - 1 \).  
- \( y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \).  
- Equation becomes: \( (x - 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 = 28 \).  
- Simplified: \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \).  

The center \( (1, 2) \) matches the form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \). Alternatively, test a point on the circle (e.g., find a point using the radius) if needed, but the derivation is consistent.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the center of the circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center from the standard form (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the center (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”center identified as \( (1, 2) \).

**Final Answer**: The center of the circle is \( (1, 2) \).
