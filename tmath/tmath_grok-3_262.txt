**Problem Restatement**: Find the center of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the center of the circle into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle equation in standard form by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).  
2. Identify the center from the standard form equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the circle equation \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \) in standard form by completing the square for \( x \) and \( y \). This will be achieved by grouping the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms, completing the square for each, and simplifying the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given equation: \( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).  
Group the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms:  
\( (x^2 - 2x) + (y^2 - 4y) = 28 \).  

For the \( x \)-terms, \( x^2 - 2x \):  
- The coefficient of \( x \) is \(-2\). Half of \(-2\) is \(-1\), and \((-1)^2 = 1\).  
- Add and subtract 1 inside the expression: \( x^2 - 2x = (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 = (x - 1)^2 - 1 \).  

For the \( y \)-terms, \( y^2 - 4y \):  
- The coefficient of \( y \) is \(-4\). Half of \(-4\) is \(-2\), and \((-2)^2 = 4\).  
- Add and subtract 4: \( y^2 - 4y = (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \).  

Substitute back into the equation:  
\( (x - 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 = 28 \).  
Simplify:  
\( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1 - 4 = 28 \).  
\( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5 = 28 \).  
\( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \).  

The equation is now in standard form: \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the center of the circle from the standard form equation \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \). This will be achieved by recognizing that the standard form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \) has the center at \( (h, k) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The standard form of the circle equation is \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center.  
From \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \):  
- Compare with the standard form: \( h = 1 \), \( k = 2 \).  
Thus, the center of the circle is \( (1, 2) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the center \( (1, 2) \) is correct by checking if the completed square form and the original equation are consistent. This will be achieved by substituting the center coordinates and radius back into the original equation to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The standard form \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33 \) indicates the center is \( (1, 2) \) and the radius is \( \sqrt{33} \).  
To validate, expand the standard form back to the general form:  
\( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \),  
\( (y - 2)^2 = y^2 - 4y + 4 \).  
So, \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y + 5 \).  
Set equal to 33:  
\( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y + 5 = 33 \).  
Simplify:  
\( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y + 5 - 33 = 0 \).  
\( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0 \).  
This matches the original equation, confirming the center \( (1, 2) \) is correct.
