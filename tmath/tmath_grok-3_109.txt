**Problem Statement**: Find the intersection point of the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point \( (5, 5) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the slope of the given line \( y = 2x + 5 \).  
2. Find the slope of the perpendicular line.  
3. Write the equation of the perpendicular line passing through \( (5, 5) \).  
4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the slope of the given line \( y = 2x + 5 \). This can be achieved by identifying the coefficient of \( x \) in the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The equation \( y = 2x + 5 \) is in slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope. Thus, the slope of the given line is \( 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to find the slope of the perpendicular line. This can be achieved by using the fact that the slope of a perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of the original slope.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The slope of the given line is \( 2 \). The slope of a line perpendicular to it is the negative reciprocal, which is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to write the equation of the perpendicular line passing through \( (5, 5) \). This can be achieved by using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with the slope \( -\frac{1}{2} \) and the point \( (5, 5) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \), \( x_1 = 5 \), and \( y_1 = 5 \):  
\[ y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 5) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} \]  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + 5 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{10}{2} \]  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \]  
The equation of the perpendicular line is \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the intersection point of the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) and the perpendicular line passing through \( (5, 5) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the slope of \( y = 2x + 5 \) (completed: slope is 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the slope of the perpendicular line (completed: slope is \( -\frac{1}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Write the equation of the perpendicular line (completed: \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the intersection point. This can be achieved by setting the equations \( y = 2x + 5 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \) equal to each other and solving for \( x \), then substituting to find \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 2x + 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \]  
Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:  
\[ 2(2x + 5) = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2}\right) \]  
\[ 4x + 10 = -x + 15 \]  
Add \( x \) to both sides:  
\[ 5x + 10 = 15 \]  
Subtract 10:  
\[ 5x = 5 \]  
\[ x = 1 \]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( y = 2x + 5 \):  
\[ y = 2(1) + 5 = 7 \]  
The intersection point is \( (1, 7) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the intersection point \( (1, 7) \) satisfies both line equations. This can be achieved by substituting \( x = 1 \), \( y = 7 \) into both equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check \( y = 2x + 5 \):  
\[ y = 2(1) + 5 = 7 \]  
Satisfied.  
Check \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \):  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{15}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{15}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]  
Satisfied.  
The point \( (1, 7) \) satisfies both equations, confirming the solution.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The intersection point is \( (1, 7) \).
