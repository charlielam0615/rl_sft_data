**Problem Restatement**: Find the intersection point of the line \( y = 2x + 5 \) and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point \( (5, 5) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the intersection point, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the equation of the line perpendicular to \( y = 2x + 5 \) that passes through \( (5, 5) \).  
2. Find the intersection point by solving the system of equations for the two lines.  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the equation of the line perpendicular to \( y = 2x + 5 \) that passes through \( (5, 5) \).  
How to Achieve: The slope of \( y = 2x + 5 \) is 2. The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal, \(- \frac{1}{2}\). Use the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \( (5, 5) \) and slope \(- \frac{1}{2} \) to find the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The slope of the perpendicular line is \(- \frac{1}{2} \). Using point-slope form with point \( (5, 5) \):  
\[ y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 5) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} \]  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + 5 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{10}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \]  
The equation of the perpendicular line is \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection point of the two lines \( y = 2x + 5 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \).  
How to Achieve: Set the equations equal to each other to solve for \( x \), then substitute \( x \) back into one of the equations to find \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 2x + 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \]  
Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:  
\[ 2(2x + 5) = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2}\right) \]  
\[ 4x + 10 = -x + 15 \]  
Add \( x \) to both sides:  
\[ 5x + 10 = 15 \]  
Subtract 10:  
\[ 5x = 5 \]  
\[ x = 1 \]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( y = 2x + 5 \):  
\[ y = 2(1) + 5 = 7 \]  
The intersection point is \( (1, 7) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the intersection point \( (1, 7) \) satisfies both line equations and the perpendicularity condition.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( (1, 7) \) into both equations to check if they hold. Confirm the slopes of the lines are negative reciprocals and that the second line passes through \( (5, 5) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check \( (1, 7) \) in \( y = 2x + 5 \):  
\[ y = 2(1) + 5 = 7 \] (Satisfied)  
Check \( (1, 7) \) in \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \):  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{15}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{15}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \] (Satisfied)  
Verify perpendicularity: Slope of first line is 2; slope of second line is \(- \frac{1}{2}\). Their product is \( 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1 \), confirming perpendicularity.  
Check if the second line passes through \( (5, 5) \):  
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}(5) + \frac{15}{2} = -\frac{5}{2} + \frac{15}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \] (Satisfied)  
The solution \( (1, 7) \) is valid.
