### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many integer values of \( a \) result in the quadratic equation \( x^2 + ax + 8a = 0 \) having integer solutions for \( x \). Integer solutions for \( x \) mean that the roots of the quadratic equation are integers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find integer values of \( a \) that yield integer roots for the quadratic equation. Subgoals:  
1. Express the quadratic equation in standard form and identify its coefficients.  
2. Use the quadratic formula to find the roots and set conditions for them to be integers.  
3. Solve for \( a \) such that the roots are integers.  
4. Count the distinct integer values of \( a \) that satisfy the condition.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express the quadratic equation and derive conditions for integer roots using the quadratic formula.  
**How to Achieve**: Write the equation in standard form, apply the quadratic formula, and ensure the discriminant is a perfect square to produce integer roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + ax + 8a = 0 \), which is already in standard form \( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \), with coefficients:  
- \( b = a \)  
- \( c = 8a \)  

For the roots to be integers, use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = a \), and \( c = 8a \). The roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8a}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 32a}}{2} \]  

For the roots to be integers, the discriminant \( \Delta = a^2 - 32a \) must be a perfect square, say \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is a non-negative integer (since the square root must be real and non-negative for real roots). Additionally, the numerator \( -a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 32a} \) must be divisible by 2 to ensure integer roots.  

Set the discriminant as a perfect square:  
\[ a^2 - 32a = k^2 \]  
Rewrite it as:  
\[ a^2 - 32a - k^2 = 0 \]  
This is a quadratic in \( a \):  
\[ a^2 - 32a - k^2 = 0 \]  
Solve for \( a \):  
\[ a = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-k^2)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 + 4k^2}}{2} = 16 \pm \sqrt{256 + k^2} \]  
For \( a \) to be an integer, \( \sqrt{256 + k^2} \) must be an integer, say \( m \), so:  
\[ 256 + k^2 = m^2 \]  
\[ k^2 = m^2 - 256 = (m - 16)(m + 16) \]  
Then, \( a = 16 \pm m \), and we need \( (m - 16)(m + 16) \) to be a perfect square.

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals based on the discriminant condition. New subgoals:  
1. Find integer pairs \( (m, k) \) such that \( (m - 16)(m + 16) = k^2 \), where \( k \) is a non-negative integer.  
2. Compute corresponding integer values of \( a = 16 \pm m \).  
3. Verify that these \( a \) values produce integer roots for \( x \).  
4. Count distinct integer \( a \) values.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find integer pairs \( (m, k) \) such that \( (m - 16)(m + 16) = k^2 \), and compute corresponding \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize \( m^2 - 256 = k^2 \), solve for integer \( m \), and calculate \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, we need:  
\[ (m - 16)(m + 16) = k^2 \]  
This implies:  
\[ m^2 - 256 = k^2 \]  
Letâ€™s find integer \( m \) such that \( m^2 - 256 \) is a perfect square. Test possible values for \( m \), ensuring \( m^2 - 256 \geq 0 \), so \( m \geq 16 \) or \( m \leq -16 \).  

Rewrite:  
\[ k^2 = (m - 16)(m + 16) \]  
Since \( k^2 \) is a perfect square, let \( m - 16 = d_1 \) and \( m + 16 = d_2 \), where \( d_1 \cdot d_2 = k^2 \), and \( d_2 = d_1 + 32 \). Thus:  
\[ d_1 (d_1 + 32) = k^2 \]  
We need \( d_1 (d_1 + 32) \) to be a perfect square. Then:  
\[ m = d_1 + 16 \]  
\[ a = 16 \pm m = 16 \pm (d_1 + 16) = \{ 32 + d_1, -d_1 \} \]  

Test positive integer values for \( d_1 \):  
- If \( d_1 = 1 \):  
  \[ k^2 = 1 \cdot (1 + 32) = 33 \] (not a perfect square)  
- If \( d_1 = 2 \):  
  \[ k^2 = 2 \cdot 34 = 68 \] (not a perfect square)  
- If \( d_1 = 8 \):  
  \[ k^2 = 8 \cdot 40 = 320 \] (not a perfect square)  
- If \( d_1 = 32 \):  
  \[ k^2 = 32 \cdot 64 = 2048 \] (not a perfect square, since \( 45^2 = 2025 \), \( 46^2 = 2116 \))  
- If \( d_1 = 128 \):  
  \[ k^2 = 128 \cdot 160 = 20480 \] (not a perfect square)  

Try negative \( d_1 \), but note \( k^2 \geq 0 \). Instead, consider the equation \( m^2 - 256 = k^2 \). Test \( m \):  
- \( m = 16 \): \( 16^2 - 256 = 256 - 256 = 0 = 0^2 \)  
  \[ a = 16 \pm 16 = \{ 32, 0 \} \]  
- \( m = 17 \): \( 17^2 - 256 = 289 - 256 = 33 \) (not a perfect square)  
- \( m = 20 \): \( 20^2 - 256 = 400 - 256 = 144 = 12^2 \)  
  \[ a = 16 \pm 20 = \{ 36, -4 \} \]  
- \( m = 25 \): \( 25^2 - 256 = 625 - 256 = 369 \) (not a perfect square)  
- \( m = -16 \): \( (-16)^2 - 256 = 256 - 256 = 0 = 0^2 \) (same as \( m = 16 \))  
- \( m = -20 \): \( (-20)^2 - 256 = 400 - 256 = 144 = 12^2 \)  
  \[ a = 16 \pm (-20) = \{ -4, 36 \} \]  

Possible \( a \): \( \{ 0, -4, 32, 36 \} \).

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the values \( a = 0, -4, 32, 36 \) produce integer roots for \( x^2 + ax + 8a = 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each \( a \) into the equation and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test each value:  
- **\( a = 0 \)**:  
  \[ x^2 + 0 \cdot x + 8 \cdot 0 = x^2 = 0 \]  
  \[ x = 0 \] (integer, but a single root due to multiplicity).  
- **\( a = -4 \)**:  
  \[ x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-32) = 16 + 128 = 144 = 12^2 \)  
  Roots: \( x = \frac{4 \pm 12}{2} = \{ 8, -4 \} \) (integers).  
- **\( a = 32 \)**:  
  \[ x^2 + 32x + 256 = 0 \]  
  \[ (x + 16)^2 = 0 \]  
  \[ x = -16 \] (integer, single root).  
- **\( a = 36 \)**:  
  \[ x^2 + 36x + 288 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 36^2 - 4 \cdot 288 = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2 \)  
  Roots: \( x = \frac{-36 \pm 12}{2} = \{ -12, -24 \} \) (integers).  

All values produce integer roots.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find how many integer values of \( a \) make \( x^2 + ax + 8a = 0 \) have integer solutions for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the equation and set conditions for integer roots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find \( a \) such that the discriminant is a perfect square (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute integer \( a \) values from \( (m - 16)(m + 16) = k^2 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify integer roots for candidate \( a \) values (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Count distinct integer \( a \) values (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Count distinct integer \( a \) values.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Count the distinct integer values of \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: List the verified \( a \) values and ensure no duplicates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The verified integer values of \( a \) are \( 0, -4, 32, 36 \). There are 4 distinct values.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that no other integer \( a \) values were missed.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the discriminant condition for additional \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Reconsider \( m^2 - 256 = k^2 \). Test additional \( m \):  
- \( m = 28 \): \( 28^2 - 256 = 784 - 256 = 528 \) (not a perfect square).  
- \( m = 32 \): \( 32^2 - 256 = 1024 - 256 = 768 \) (not a perfect square).  
- Larger \( m \): The difference \( m^2 - 256 \) grows, making perfect squares less likely.  

For negative \( m \), symmetry in \( m^2 \) covers cases (e.g., \( m = -20 \) repeats \( a = -4, 36 \)). No new integer \( a \) values emerge. The list \( \{ 0, -4, 32, 36 \} \) is complete.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
There are 4 integer values of \( a \) for which \( x^2 + ax + 8a = 0 \) has integer solutions for \( x \): \( a = 0, -4, 32, 36 \).

**Final Answer**: \( \boxed{4} \)
