### Problem Statement
We need to find the sum of all integer values \( n \) for which the equation \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\) holds true. This involves working with binomial coefficients, which represent the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a set. Our goal is to identify all possible integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation and compute their sum.

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Break Down the Problem
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve the equation:
1. Understand the binomial coefficient equation \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\).
2. Simplify or manipulate the equation using properties of binomial coefficients.
3. Solve for possible integer values of \( n \) within the valid range (0 to 26, since \(\binom{26}{n}\) is defined for \( n \) in this range).
4. Verify the solutions by substituting back into the equation.
5. Sum all valid integer values of \( n \).

### Step 2: Explore Binomial Coefficient Properties
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Simplify the equation \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\) using binomial coefficient identities.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the binomial identity \(\binom{m+1}{k} = \binom{m}{k} + \binom{m}{k-1}\) to relate \(\binom{27}{14}\) to binomial coefficients with 26, and manipulate the equation to isolate \(\binom{26}{n}\).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the binomial identity to \(\binom{27}{14}\):
\[
\binom{27}{14} = \binom{26}{14} + \binom{26}{13}.
\]
Substitute this into the given equation:
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14} + \binom{26}{13}.
\]
Subtract \(\binom{26}{13}\) from both sides:
\[
\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}.
\]
Since binomial coefficients are equal when their indices are equal (or symmetric), we have:
\[
\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14} \implies n = 14 \text{ or } n = 26 - 14 = 12,
\]
because \(\binom{26}{k} = \binom{26}{26-k}\). Thus, potential solutions are \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \).

### Step 3: Validate the Solutions
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) satisfy the original equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) into \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\) and check if the equation holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Check \( n = 14 \)**:
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14} = \binom{27}{14}.
\]
Using the identity again:
\[
\binom{27}{14} = \binom{26}{14} + \binom{26}{13}.
\]
This matches the left-hand side exactly, so \( n = 14 \) is a solution.

**Check \( n = 12 \)**:
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{12} = \binom{27}{14}.
\]
Since \(\binom{26}{12} = \binom{26}{14}\) (because \(\binom{26}{k} = \binom{26}{26-k}\)), we have:
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{12} = \binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14} = \binom{27}{14}.
\]
This also holds, so \( n = 12 \) is a solution.

**Check other values**: Since \(\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}\) only when \( n = 14 \) or \( n = 12 \), and \(\binom{26}{n}\) is a strictly increasing function for \( n \leq 13 \) and decreasing for \( n \geq 13 \), no other integer \( n \) (from 0 to 26) will satisfy \(\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}\).

### Step 4: Review the Goal Hierarchy
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the sum of all integer \( n \) such that \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation using binomial identities (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( n \) (found \( n = 12, 14 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions (verified \( n = 12, 14 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the valid \( n \) values (pending).
- **Current Goal**: Compute the sum of valid \( n \) values.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Compute the Sum
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Sum the valid integer values of \( n \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Add the verified values \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The valid values are \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \). Their sum is:
\[
12 + 14 = 26.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Final Verification
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the solutions \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) to ensure no other values were missed.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
From Step 2, we derived \(\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}\), leading to \( n = 12 \) or \( n = 14 \). In Step 3, we confirmed these satisfy the original equation. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{26}{n}\) is symmetric and peaks at \( n = 13 \), so other integers \( n \) produce values either too large or too small to equal \(\binom{26}{14}\). No other solutions exist.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The sum of all integer values \( n \) for which \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\) is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
