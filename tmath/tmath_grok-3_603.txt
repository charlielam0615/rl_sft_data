### Problem Statement
We need to find the sum of all integer values \( n \) for which the equation \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\) holds true. This involves working with binomial coefficients, which represent the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set. Let’s solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action framework.

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Understand the binomial coefficient equation and explore possible identities or relationships.  
2. Simplify or manipulate the equation to isolate \(\binom{26}{n}\).  
3. Determine the possible integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Explore the binomial coefficient equation to find a relationship or identity that can simplify \(\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use properties of binomial coefficients, such as Pascal’s identity, to manipulate the right-hand side and compare it with the left-hand side.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let’s start with the given equation:  
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{27}{14}
\]
Recall Pascal’s identity for binomial coefficients:  
\[
\binom{m}{k} = \binom{m-1}{k-1} + \binom{m-1}{k}
\]
Apply this to the right-hand side, where \( m = 27 \) and \( k = 14 \):  
\[
\binom{27}{14} = \binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14}
\]
Substitute this into the original equation:  
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14}
\]
Subtract \(\binom{26}{13}\) from both sides:  
\[
\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}
\]
Since binomial coefficients are equal when their indices are equal (or symmetric), we have:  
\[
\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14} \implies n = 14 \text{ or } n = 26 - 14 = 12
\]
This suggests \( n = 12 \) or \( n = 14 \) as potential solutions, since \(\binom{26}{k} = \binom{26}{26-k}\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) satisfy the original equation and check for other possible integer values of \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) back into the original equation and test other integers to ensure no other solutions exist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Check \( n = 14 \)**:  
Left-hand side:  
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14}
\]
From Pascal’s identity, we already know:  
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14} = \binom{27}{14}
\]
This matches the right-hand side, so \( n = 14 \) is a solution.  

**Check \( n = 12 \)**:  
Since \(\binom{26}{12} = \binom{26}{14}\) (due to symmetry), substitute \( n = 12 \):  
\[
\binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{12} = \binom{26}{13} + \binom{26}{14} = \binom{27}{14}
\]
This also satisfies the equation, so \( n = 12 \) is a solution.  

**Check for other \( n \)**:  
The equation \(\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}\) holds only for \( n = 14 \) or \( n = 12 \), due to the symmetry of binomial coefficients. To confirm no other solutions exist, consider the nature of \(\binom{26}{n}\). The function \(\binom{26}{n}\) is unimodal, peaking at \( n = 13 \) and decreasing symmetrically. Since \(\binom{26}{14} = \binom{26}{12}\), and we need:  
\[
\binom{26}{n} = \binom{26}{14}
\]
Other integers \( n \) (e.g., \( n = 11, 15, \text{etc.} \)) yield different values for \(\binom{26}{n}\). For example:  
- For \( n = 11 \), \(\binom{26}{11} = \binom{26}{15} \neq \binom{26}{14}\), as binomial coefficients decrease as you move away from the peak.  
- For \( n < 0 \) or \( n > 26 \), \(\binom{26}{n} = 0\), which doesn’t work since \(\binom{26}{14} > 0\).  

Thus, only \( n = 12 \) and \( n = 14 \) are valid.
