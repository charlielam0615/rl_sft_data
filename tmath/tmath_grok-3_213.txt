**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the sum of the roots into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the method to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation.  
2. Extract the coefficients from the given quadratic equation.  
3. Apply the method to calculate the sum of the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the method to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots can be found using the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \). This will be applied in the implementation step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). This formula is derived from Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract the coefficients from the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \). This involves identifying the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The given equation is \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \). Comparing this to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):  
- Coefficient \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)),  
- Coefficient \( b = -4 \) (coefficient of \( x \)),  
- Coefficient \( c = 3 \) (constant term).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the roots using the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \) with the identified coefficients \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the formula for the sum of the roots:  
\[ -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-4}{1} = 4. \]  
The sum of the roots is 4.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the sum of the roots by solving the quadratic equation and checking the roots explicitly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, solve \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \). The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).  
Substitute \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = 3 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 2}{2}. \]  
Roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{4 + 2}{2} = 3, \quad x = \frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1. \]  
Sum of the roots: \( 3 + 1 = 4 \).  
This matches the result from the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the roots of \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the method to find the sum of the roots (completed: use \( -\frac{b}{a} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Extract coefficients from the equation (completed: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum of the roots (completed: sum = 4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: roots are 3 and 1, sum = 4).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The sum of the roots is confirmed to be 4.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \) is 4.
