**Problem Restatement**: Find the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the sum of the roots into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the method to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation.  
2. Apply the method to the given equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).  
3. Compute the final result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the method to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation.  
How to Achieve: Recall the formula for the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), which is \( -\frac{b}{a} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \). This is derived from Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the method to the given equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).  
How to Achieve: Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the equation and substitute them into the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation is \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \). Comparing with \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):  
- \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)),  
- \( b = -4 \) (coefficient of \( x \)),  
- \( c = 3 \) (constant term).  
Using the formula for the sum of the roots:  
\[ -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-4}{1} = 4. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the computed sum of the roots.  
How to Achieve: Verify the result by finding the roots of the equation and checking their sum, or confirm the formula application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \):  
Factorize: \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \).  
Roots are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).  
Sum of roots: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).  
This matches the result from the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} = 4 \), confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the roots of \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the method to find the sum of the roots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the method to the given equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final result (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).  
Current Goal: Completed (sum of roots is 4).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the roots of \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \) is \( 4 \).
