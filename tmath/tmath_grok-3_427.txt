**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \), find the value of \( f(-2) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(-2) \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \).  
2. Compute each term of the polynomial.  
3. Sum the results to find \( f(-2) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-2) \) by substituting \( x = -2 \) into the function and evaluating each term. Achieve this by calculating \( 8(-2)^3 \), \( -6(-2)^2 \), \( -4(-2) \), and the constant \( 5 \), then summing the results.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \):  
- Compute \( 8x^3 = 8(-2)^3 = 8(-8) = -64 \).  
- Compute \( -6x^2 = -6(-2)^2 = -6(4) = -24 \).  
- Compute \( -4x = -4(-2) = 8 \).  
- Constant term: \( 5 \).  
Sum: \( -64 + (-24) + 8 + 5 = -64 - 24 + 8 + 5 = -75 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \( f(-2) \). Achieve this by recomputing each term and checking the arithmetic to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute each term:  
- \( (-2)^3 = -8 \), so \( 8(-8) = -64 \).  
- \( (-2)^2 = 4 \), so \( -6(4) = -24 \).  
- \( -4(-2) = 8 \).  
- Constant: \( 5 \).  
Sum: \( -64 - 24 = -88 \), \( -88 + 8 = -80 \), \( -80 + 5 = -75 \).  
The result matches the previous computation, confirming \( f(-2) = -75 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(-2) \) for \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute each term and sum them (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the main goal is achieved.  
The value of \( f(-2) = -75 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(-2) = -75 \)
