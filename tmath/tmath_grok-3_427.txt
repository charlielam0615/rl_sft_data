**Problem Statement**: Find the value of the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \) when \( x = -2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \) at \( x = -2 \). To achieve this, substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function and compute the result by calculating each term and summing them.

[IMP]  
To find \( f(-2) \), substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \):

1. Compute the first term: \( 8x^3 = 8(-2)^3 = 8(-8) = -64 \).
2. Compute the second term: \( -6x^2 = -6(-2)^2 = -6(4) = -24 \).
3. Compute the third term: \( -4x = -4(-2) = 8 \).
4. Compute the constant term: \( 5 = 5 \).
5. Sum the terms: \( -64 + (-24) + 8 + 5 = -64 - 24 + 8 + 5 = -88 + 8 + 5 = -80 + 5 = -75 \).

Thus, \( f(-2) = -75 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \( f(-2) = -75 \). To achieve this, recompute \( f(-2) \) using the same substitution method and confirm the result matches.

[IMP]  
Recompute \( f(-2) \) for validation:

1. First term: \( 8(-2)^3 = 8(-8) = -64 \).
2. Second term: \( -6(-2)^2 = -6(4) = -24 \).
3. Third term: \( -4(-2) = 8 \).
4. Constant term: \( 5 \).
5. Sum: \( -64 - 24 + 8 + 5 = -88 + 8 + 5 = -80 + 5 = -75 \).

The recomputed value matches: \( f(-2) = -75 \). The result is consistent.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find the value of \( f(-2) \) for \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-2) \) by substituting \( x = -2 \) (completed in Step 1).
  - Subgoal 2: Validate the computation by recomputing (completed in Step 2).

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution process is complete and accurate, with \( f(-2) = -75 \) as the result.
