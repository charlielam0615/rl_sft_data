### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the right-hand side by expressing \(4^2\) in terms of base 2.  
2. Equate the exponents of the same base to form a simpler equation.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the right-hand side by expressing \(4^2\) in terms of base 2.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize that \(4 = 2^2\), so \(4^2 = (2^2)^2 = 2^4\). Rewrite the equation using this equivalence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\), rewrite \(4^2\):  
Since \(4 = 2^2\), we have \(4^2 = (2^2)^2 = 2^4\).  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 2^{x-3} = 2^4 \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Equate the exponents of the same base to form a simpler equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the bases are the same (base 2), set the exponents equal to each other.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(2^{x-3} = 2^4\), since the bases are identical, equate the exponents:  
\[ x - 3 = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the linear equation \(x - 3 = 4\) by isolating \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve \(x - 3 = 4\):  
Add 3 to both sides:  
\[ x - 3 + 3 = 4 + 3 \]  
\[ x = 7 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the solution \(x = 7\).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = 7\) back into the original equation and verify if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 7\) into \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\):  
Left-hand side: \(2^{7-3} = 2^4 = 16\).  
Right-hand side: \(4^2 = 16\).  
Since \(16 = 16\), the solution is valid.
