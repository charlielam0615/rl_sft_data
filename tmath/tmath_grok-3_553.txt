**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\) for \(x\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the right-hand side by expressing \(4^2\) in terms of base 2.  
2. Equate the exponents of the same base.  
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \(x\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the right-hand side by expressing \(4^2\) in terms of base 2.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that \(4 = 2^2\), so \(4^2 = (2^2)^2 = 2^4\). Rewrite the equation accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \(4 = 2^2\), we have \(4^2 = (2^2)^2 = 2^4\).  
Thus, the equation \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\) becomes \(2^{x-3} = 2^4\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Equate the exponents of the same base.  
How to Achieve: Since the bases are both 2, set the exponents equal to each other.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(2^{x-3} = 2^4\), equate the exponents:  
\(x - 3 = 4\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the linear equation for \(x\).  
How to Achieve: Isolate \(x\) by adding 3 to both sides of the equation \(x - 3 = 4\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve \(x - 3 = 4\):  
\(x - 3 + 3 = 4 + 3\),  
\(x = 7\).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \(x = 7\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 7\) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 7\) into \(2^{x-3}\):  
\(2^{7-3} = 2^4 = 16\).  
Right-hand side: \(4^2 = 16\).  
Since \(2^{7-3} = 16 = 4^2\), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \(2^{x-3} = 4^2\) for \(x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(4^2\) in terms of base 2 (completed: \(4^2 = 2^4\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate exponents of the same base (completed: \(x - 3 = 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the linear equation (completed: \(x = 7\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: \(x = 7\) satisfies the equation).  
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 7\)
