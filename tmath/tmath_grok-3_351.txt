**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \( i^{11} + i^{111} \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \).

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the value of \( i^{11} \).  
2. Determine the value of \( i^{111} \).  
3. Sum the results to compute \( i^{11} + i^{111} \).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( i^{11} \). To achieve this, use the cyclic property of powers of \( i \), which repeat every 4: \( i^1 = i \), \( i^2 = -1 \), \( i^3 = -i \), \( i^4 = 1 \). Reduce the exponent modulo 4 to find the equivalent power.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( i^{11} \):  
The exponent is 11. Divide by 4: \( 11 \div 4 = 2 \) remainder 3 (since \( 11 = 4 \cdot 2 + 3 \)). Thus, \( i^{11} = i^{4 \cdot 2 + 3} = (i^4)^2 \cdot i^3 = 1^2 \cdot i^3 = i^3 = -i \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( i^{111} \). Use the same cyclic property of \( i \) to reduce the exponent modulo 4.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( i^{111} \):  
The exponent is 111. Divide by 4: \( 111 \div 4 = 27 \) remainder 3 (since \( 111 = 4 \cdot 27 + 3 \)). Thus, \( i^{111} = i^{4 \cdot 27 + 3} = (i^4)^{27} \cdot i^3 = 1^{27} \cdot i^3 = i^3 = -i \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \( i^{11} + i^{111} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( i^{11} \) (completed: \( i^{11} = -i \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( i^{111} \) (completed: \( i^{111} = -i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the results (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum \( i^{11} + i^{111} \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( i^{11} + i^{111} \). Sum the results from previous steps: \( i^{11} = -i \) and \( i^{111} = -i \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute the sum:  
\( i^{11} + i^{111} = -i + (-i) = -2i \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( -2i \). Recalculate the powers and sum to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate:  
- For \( i^{11} \): Exponent 11 mod 4 = 3, so \( i^{11} = i^3 = -i \).  
- For \( i^{111} \): Exponent 111 mod 4 = 3, so \( i^{111} = i^3 = -i \).  
- Sum: \( -i + (-i) = -2i \).  
The result matches, confirming \( i^{11} + i^{111} = -2i \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \( i^{11} + i^{111} = -2i \)
