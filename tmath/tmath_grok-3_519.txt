### Problem Statement
We need to find three numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) such that their sum is 165. The smallest number \(x\), when multiplied by 7, gives a value \(n\). This \(n\) is also equal to the largest number \(y\) minus 9, and it is equal to the third number \(z\) plus 9. We are tasked with finding the product of the three numbers, \(x \cdot y \cdot z\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable subgoals. The primary goal is to find the product \(x \cdot y \cdot z\). Subgoals include:
1. Translate the problem conditions into equations.
2. Solve the system of equations to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
3. Compute the product of the three numbers.
4. Verify the solution satisfies all conditions, including \(x\) being the smallest and \(y\) being the largest.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Translate the problem conditions into equations.
To achieve this, we will interpret each condition given in the problem and express it mathematically.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem provides the following conditions:
- The sum of the three numbers is 165: \(x + y + z = 165\).
- The smallest number \(x\), when multiplied by 7, gives \(n\): \(7x = n\).
- The value \(n\) is obtained by subtracting 9 from the largest number \(y\): \(n = y - 9\).
- The value \(n\) also results by adding 9 to the third number \(z\): \(n = z + 9\).

From the conditions involving \(n\), we equate them:
- Since \(7x = n\), \(y - 9 = n\), and \(z + 9 = n\), we have:
  - \(7x = y - 9\)
  - \(7x = z + 9\)
  - Additionally, \(y - 9 = z + 9\), which simplifies to \(y = z + 18\).

Thus, the system of equations is:
1. \(x + y + z = 165\)
2. \(7x = y - 9\)
3. \(7x = z + 9\)
4. \(y = z + 18\) (derived from equating the expressions for \(n\)).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
To achieve this, we will use the equations derived in the previous step, focusing on substitution or elimination to find the values of the variables.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have the system:
1. \(x + y + z = 165\)
2. \(7x = y - 9\)
3. \(7x = z + 9\)
4. \(y = z + 18\)

From equation 3: \(z = 7x - 9\).

From equation 4: \(y = z + 18\). Substitute \(z = 7x - 9\) into this:
\[ y = (7x - 9) + 18 = 7x + 9. \]

Now, substitute \(y = 7x + 9\) and \(z = 7x - 9\) into equation 1:
\[ x + (7x + 9) + (7x - 9) = 165. \]

Simplify:
\[ x + 7x + 7x + 9 - 9 = 165 \]
\[ 15x = 165 \]
\[ x = 11. \]

Now, find \(y\) and \(z\):
- \(y = 7x + 9 = 7 \cdot 11 + 9 = 77 + 9 = 86\).
- \(z = 7x - 9 = 7 \cdot 11 - 9 = 77 - 9 = 68\).

Thus, \(x = 11\), \(y = 86\), \(z = 68\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the solution satisfies all conditions, including the constraints that \(x\) is the smallest number and \(y\) is the largest.
To achieve this, we will substitute \(x = 11\), \(y = 86\), and \(z = 68\) into all given conditions and check if they hold. We will also confirm the relative sizes of the numbers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the conditions:
- Sum: \(x + y + z = 11 + 86 + 68 = 165\). This satisfies \(x + y + z = 165\).
- Compute \(n\):
  - From \(x\): \(7x = 7 \cdot 11 = 77\).
  - From \(y\): \(y - 9 = 86 - 9 = 77\).
  - From \(z\): \(z + 9 = 68 + 9 = 77\).
  All expressions for \(n\) are equal, so \(n = 77\).
- Check relative sizes: The numbers are \(x = 11\), \(y = 86\), \(z = 68\). Comparing:
  - \(11 < 68 < 86\), so \(x = 11\) is the smallest, and \(y = 86\) is the largest.

All conditions are satisfied.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the product of the three numbers, \(x \cdot y \cdot z\).
To achieve this, we will multiply the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) obtained in Step 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \(x = 11\), \(y = 86\), and \(z = 68\):
\[ x \cdot y \cdot z = 11 \cdot 86 \cdot 68. \]

First, compute \(11 \cdot 86\):
\[ 11 \cdot 86 = 11 \cdot (80 + 6) = 11 \cdot 80 + 11 \cdot 6 = 880 + 66 = 946. \]

Now, compute \(946 \cdot 68\):
\[ 946 \cdot 68 = 946 \cdot (60 + 8) = 946 \cdot 60 + 946 \cdot 8. \]
- \(946 \cdot 60 = 946 \cdot 6 \cdot 10 = 5676 \cdot 10 = 56760\).
- \(946 \cdot 8 = 7568\).
- Total: \(56760 + 7568 = 64328\).

Thus, the product is \(11 \cdot 86 \cdot 68 = 64328\).
