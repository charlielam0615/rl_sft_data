### Problem Statement
We need to find three numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) such that:
- Their sum is \( x + y + z = 165 \).
- The smallest number is \( x \), and when multiplied by 7, it gives \( 7x = n \).
- The value \( n \) is obtained by subtracting 9 from the largest number \( y \), so \( n = y - 9 \).
- The value \( n \) is also obtained by adding 9 to the third number \( z \), so \( n = z + 9 \).
- We need to compute the product \( x \cdot y \cdot z \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Translate the given conditions into a system of equations.
2. Solve the system to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).
3. Verify that \( x \) is the smallest and \( y \) is the largest.
4. Compute the product \( x \cdot y \cdot z \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to translate the problem conditions into a system of equations. Achieve this by carefully interpreting each condition and expressing it mathematically.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the problem:
- Sum: \( x + y + z = 165 \).
- \( x \) multiplied by 7 gives \( n \): \( 7x = n \).
- \( n \) is \( y \) minus 9: \( n = y - 9 \).
- \( n \) is \( z \) plus 9: \( n = z + 9 \).

Equate the expressions for \( n \):
- From \( 7x = n \), \( n = y - 9 \), and \( n = z + 9 \), we get:
  - \( 7x = y - 9 \)
  - \( 7x = z + 9 \)
  - \( y - 9 = z + 9 \)

Thus, the system is:
1. \( x + y + z = 165 \)
2. \( 7x = y - 9 \)
3. \( 7x = z + 9 \)
4. \( y - 9 = z + 9 \) (optional, as itâ€™s derived from 2 and 3)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Achieve this by substituting equations to eliminate variables and solve.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 165 \)
2. \( 7x = y - 9 \implies y = 7x + 9 \)
3. \( 7x = z + 9 \implies z = 7x - 9 \)

Substitute \( y = 7x + 9 \) and \( z = 7x - 9 \) into the sum:
\[
x + (7x + 9) + (7x - 9) = 165
\]
Simplify:
\[
x + 7x + 7x + 9 - 9 = 165
\]
\[
15x = 165
\]
\[
x = \frac{165}{15} = 11
\]

Find \( y \) and \( z \):
- \( y = 7x + 9 = 7 \cdot 11 + 9 = 77 + 9 = 86 \)
- \( z = 7x - 9 = 7 \cdot 11 - 9 = 77 - 9 = 68 \)

So, \( x = 11 \), \( y = 86 \), \( z = 68 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that the solution satisfies all conditions, including \( x \) being the smallest and \( y \) being the largest. Achieve this by checking each condition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check conditions:
- Sum: \( x + y + z = 11 + 86 + 68 = 165 \). Satisfied.
- \( n = 7x = 7 \cdot 11 = 77 \).
- \( n = y - 9 = 86 - 9 = 77 \). Satisfied.
- \( n = z + 9 = 68 + 9 = 77 \). Satisfied.
- Order: \( x = 11 \), \( y = 86 \), \( z = 68 \). Compare: \( 11 < 68 < 86 \), so \( x \) is smallest, \( y \) is largest. Satisfied.

All conditions hold.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute the product \( x \cdot y \cdot z \). Achieve this by multiplying the values found.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = 11 \cdot 86 \cdot 68
\]
First, \( 11 \cdot 86 = 11 \cdot (80 + 6) = 11 \cdot 80 + 11 \cdot 6 = 880 + 66 = 946 \).
Then, \( 946 \cdot 68 = 946 \cdot (70 - 2) = 946 \cdot 70 - 946 \cdot 2 \).
- \( 946 \cdot 70 = 946 \cdot 7 \cdot 10 = (900 + 46) \cdot 7 \cdot 10 = (6300 + 322) \cdot 10 = 66220 \)
- \( 946 \cdot 2 = 1892 \)
- So, \( 66220 - 1892 = 64328 \)

Thus, the product is \( 64328 \).
