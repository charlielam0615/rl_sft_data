**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the equation by expressing the terms with exponents and simplify by equating the expressions, possibly by dividing or manipulating the equation to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
Rewrite the left-hand side: \( (5x)^4 = (5x) \cdot (5x) \cdot (5x) \cdot (5x) = 5^4 \cdot x^4 = 625x^4 \).  
Rewrite the right-hand side: \( (10x)^3 = (10x) \cdot (10x) \cdot (10x) = 10^3 \cdot x^3 = 1000x^3 \).  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 625x^4 = 1000x^3 \]  
To simplify, divide both sides by the common terms. Since \( x \neq 0 \), divide both sides by \( x^3 \):  
\[ 625x^4 / x^3 = 1000x^3 / x^3 \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ 625x = 1000 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{1000}{625} \]  
Simplify the fraction:  
\[ \frac{1000}{625} = \frac{1000 \div 125}{625 \div 125} = \frac{8}{5} \]  
So, \( x = \frac{8}{5} \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) satisfies the original equation and meets the problemâ€™s constraints (non-zero, real, and expressed as a common fraction).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) into the original equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \) and check if both sides are equal. Confirm the solution is non-zero and real, and that \( \frac{8}{5} \) is a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) into the equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
Left-hand side:  
\[ 5x = 5 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 8 \]  
\[ (5x)^4 = 8^4 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 4096 \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ 10x = 10 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 16 \]  
\[ (10x)^3 = 16^3 = 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 = 4096 \]  
Since \( 4096 = 4096 \), the solution \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) satisfies the equation.  
Check constraints:  
- **Non-zero**: \( \frac{8}{5} \neq 0 \).  
- **Real**: \( \frac{8}{5} \) is a real number.  
- **Common fraction**: \( \frac{8}{5} \) is a fraction in its simplest form (8 and 5 are coprime).
