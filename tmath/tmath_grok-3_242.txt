### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
1. Simplify the given equation by expressing both sides with the same base or variable.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify that the solution is non-zero, real, and can be expressed as a common fraction.  
4. Check the solution by substituting it back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Rewrite the expressions \( 5x \) and \( 10x \) in terms of \( x \), compute the powers, and equate the simplified forms to form a solvable equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
- Left side: \( (5x)^4 = (5x) \cdot (5x) \cdot (5x) \cdot (5x) = 5^4 \cdot x^4 = 625x^4 \).  
- Right side: \( (10x)^3 = (10x) \cdot (10x) \cdot (10x) = 10^3 \cdot x^3 = 1000x^3 \).  

The equation becomes:  
\[ 625x^4 = 1000x^3 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the simplified equation \( 625x^4 = 1000x^3 \) for \( x \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side to form a polynomial equation, factor it, and solve for \( x \). Ensure the solutions are non-zero and real.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From \( 625x^4 = 1000x^3 \), move all terms to one side:  
\[ 625x^4 - 1000x^3 = 0 \]  

Factor the equation:  
\[ x^3 (625x - 1000) = 0 \]  

Set each factor to zero:  
1. \( x^3 = 0 \implies x = 0 \) (not allowed since we need non-zero solutions).  
2. \( 625x - 1000 = 0 \implies 625x = 1000 \implies x = \frac{1000}{625} \).  

Simplify the fraction:  
\[ \frac{1000}{625} = \frac{1000 \div 125}{625 \div 125} = \frac{8}{5} \]  

So, \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) is a candidate solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) satisfies the original equation \( (5x)^4 = (10x)^3 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) into both sides of the original equation and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = \frac{8}{5} \):  
- Left side: \( 5x = 5 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 8 \), so \( (5x)^4 = 8^4 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 4096 \).  
- Right side: \( 10x = 10 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 16 \), so \( (10x)^3 = 16^3 = 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 = 4096 \).  

Since \( 4096 = 4096 \), the solution \( x = \frac{8}{5} \) satisfies the equation.
