**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \), find the value of \( f(11) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the given function \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \).  
2. Substitute \( n = 11 \) into the function.  
3. Perform the arithmetic calculations to compute \( f(11) \).  
4. Verify the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( n = 11 \) into the function \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \) and compute the result. This will be achieved by performing the arithmetic operations step-by-step.

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 11 \) into \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \):  
- Compute \( n^2 \): \( 11^2 = 121 \).  
- Compute \( n \): \( 11 \).  
- Compute the constant: \( 17 \).  
- Add them together: \( 121 + 11 + 17 = 149 \).  
So, \( f(11) = 149 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computed value \( f(11) = 149 \). This will be achieved by recomputing the function and checking for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute \( f(11) \):  
- \( 11^2 = 121 \).  
- \( 11 + 17 = 28 \).  
- \( 121 + 28 = 149 \).  
The recomputed value matches the previous result, confirming \( f(11) = 149 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(11) \) for \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( n = 11 \) and compute (completed, result: 149).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed, confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution, as the computation and verification are complete. The value of \( f(11) \) is 149.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(11) = 149 \)
