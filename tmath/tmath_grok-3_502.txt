**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of the function \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \) when \( n = 11 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(11) \) for the function \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \). To achieve this, substitute \( n = 11 \) into the function and perform the arithmetic calculations.

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 11 \) into \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \):  
- Compute \( n^2 = 11^2 = 121 \).  
- Compute \( n = 11 \).  
- Compute the constant term: \( 17 \).  
- Sum the results: \( 121 + 11 + 17 \).  
First, \( 121 + 11 = 132 \).  
Then, \( 132 + 17 = 149 \).  
Thus, \( f(11) = 149 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \( f(11) = 149 \). This can be achieved by recalculating \( f(11) \) using the same function and checking if the result matches, or by using an alternative method to confirm the answer.

[IMP]  
To validate, recompute \( f(11) \):  
- \( 11^2 = 121 \).  
- \( 11 + 17 = 28 \).  
- \( 121 + 28 = 149 \).  
The recomputed value matches the previous result.  
Alternatively, break down the function:  
- \( n^2 + n = 11^2 + 11 = 121 + 11 = 132 \).  
- \( 132 + 17 = 149 \).  
Both methods yield \( f(11) = 149 \), confirming the calculation is correct.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(11) \) for \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( n = 11 \) into the function and calculate the result (completed in Step 1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate the computation to ensure accuracy (completed in Step 2).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming the computed value and ensuring all steps are complete. The computed value is \( f(11) = 149 \), and validation has been performed.

**Final Answer**:  
The value of \( f(11) \) is \( 149 \).
