**Problem Statement**: Given the system of equations:

compute the value of \(x^2 y + xy^2\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of computing \(x^2 y + xy^2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equations to express them in a more manageable form.  
2. Find relationships between \(x\) and \(y\) or compute their values.  
3. Use the relationships or values to compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the first equation \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Combine the terms in the first equation to express it in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), and explore its relationship with the second equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first equation is:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = 3
\]
Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{y + x}{xy} = 3
\]
Thus:
\[
x + y = 3xy
\]
This gives us a new equation:
\[
x + y = 3xy \quad (1)
\]
The second equation is:
\[
xy + x + y = 4 \quad (2)
\]
Notice that both equations involve \(x + y\). We can use equation (1) to substitute \(x + y = 3xy\) into equation (2).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Substitute \(x + y = 3xy\) into the second equation to simplify the system.  
**How to Achieve**: Replace \(x + y\) in the second equation with \(3xy\) and solve for a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From equation (1):
\[
x + y = 3xy
\]
Substitute \(x + y = 3xy\) into equation (2):
\[
xy + (x + y) = 4
\]
\[
xy + 3xy = 4
\]
\[
4xy = 4
\]
\[
xy = 1
\]
Now we have:
\[
xy = 1 \quad (3)
\]
Substitute \(xy = 1\) back into equation (1):
\[
x + y = 3xy = 3 \cdot 1 = 3
\]
\[
x + y = 3 \quad (4)
\]
We now have a simpler system:
\[
xy = 1, \quad x + y = 3
\]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find relationships between \(x\) and \(y\) (completed: \(xy = 1\), \(x + y = 3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\) using \(xy = 1\) and \(x + y = 3\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\) using the relationships \(xy = 1\) and \(x + y = 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize \(x^2 y + xy^2\) and express it in terms of \(xy\) and \(x + y\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Notice that:
\[
x^2 y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)
\]
Using the known values:
\[
xy = 1, \quad x + y = 3
\]
Substitute:
\[
x^2 y + xy^2 = xy \cdot (x + y) = 1 \cdot 3 = 3
\]
Thus, the value of \(x^2 y + xy^2\) is 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the computation of \(x^2 y + xy^2 = 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) using \(xy = 1\) and \(x + y = 3\), compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\) directly, and confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(xy = 1\), express \(y = \frac{1}{x}\). Substitute into \(x + y = 3\):
\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = 3
\]
Multiply through by \(x\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)):
\[
x^2 + 1 = 3x
\]
\[
x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
Thus:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad y = \frac{1}{x} = \frac{2}{3 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(3 - \sqrt{5})}{(3 + \sqrt{5})(3 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
or
\[
x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad y = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
Compute \(x^2 y + xy^2\):
\[
x^2 y = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad xy^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2
\]
This is complex, so letâ€™s confirm using \(x^2 y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) = 1 \cdot 3 = 3\). Alternatively, test numerically:
\[
x^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{14 + 6\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 y = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(7 + 3\sqrt{5})(3 - \sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{21 - 7\sqrt{5} + 9\sqrt{5} - 15}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
Similarly, compute \(xy^2\) and sum, but since \(x^2 y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) = 3\) holds, the result is consistent.
