Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Compute $ f(g(x)) $ and $ g(f(x)) $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To compute $ f(g(x)) $, we substitute $ g(x) = Bx + A $ into $ f(x) = Ax + B $, giving us:

$$ f(g(x)) = A(Bx + A) + B = ABx + A^2 + B $$

To compute $ g(f(x)) $, we substitute $ f(x) = Ax + B $ into $ g(x) = Bx + A $, giving us:

$$ g(f(x)) = B(Ax + B) + A = ABx + B^2 + A $$

Now, we need to simplify the expression $ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) $:

$$ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (ABx + A^2 + B) - (ABx + B^2 + A) $$

Simplifying this expression:

$$ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = ABx + A^2 + B - ABx - B^2 - A = A^2 - B^2 + B - A $$

Given that $ f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A $, we can equate the two expressions:

$$ A^2 - B^2 + B - A = B - A $$

Solving this equation will help us find a relationship between $ A $ and $ B $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ A^2 - B^2 + B - A = B - A $ to find a relationship between $ A $ and $ B $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the equation:  

$$ A^2 - B^2 + B - A = B - A $$

We can simplify this by subtracting $ B - A $ from both sides:  

$$ A^2 - B^2 + B - A - (B - A) = 0 $$

$$ A^2 - B^2 + B - A - B + A = 0 $$

$$ A^2 - B^2 = 0 $$

This simplifies to:  

$$ A^2 = B^2 $$

Taking the square root of both sides gives:  

$$ A = B \quad \text{or} \quad A = -B $$

However, we are given the condition $ A \neq B $, so $ A = B $ is not valid. Therefore, we must have:  

$$ A = -B $$

Now, using $ A = -B $, we can find $ A + B $.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $ A + B $ using $ A = -B $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given $ A = -B $, we substitute into $ A + B $:  

$$ A + B = (-B) + B = 0 $$  

Thus, the value of $ A + B $ is $ 0 $.

1. **Function Composition Verification**:
   - f(g(x)) = A(Bx + A) + B = ABx + A² + B (✓)
   - g(f(x)) = B(Ax + B) + A = ABx + B² + A (✓)
   - f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (ABx + A² + B) - (ABx + B² + A) simplifies to A² - B² + B - A (✓)

2. **Equation Simplification Verification**:
   - Given f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A:
     - A² - B² + B - A = B - A (✓)
     - Subtracting (B - A) from both sides yields A² - B² = 0 (✓)
     - Factoring: (A - B)(A + B) = 0 (✓)

3. **Constraint Application Verification**:
   - A ≠ B is explicitly given, eliminating A = B as a solution (✓)
   - Remaining solution: A = -B (✓)

4. **Final Computation Verification**:
   - A + B = (-B) + B = 0 (✓)

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected in the reasoning process.
