**Problem Statement**: Given the terms of an arithmetic sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \ldots\), solve for \(x\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(x\), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the common difference of the arithmetic sequence using the given terms.  
2. Set up an equation based on the common difference.  
3. Solve the equation for \(x\).  
4. Verify the solution by checking if the terms form a valid arithmetic sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the common difference of the arithmetic sequence and set up an equation.  
**How to Achieve**: In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Compute the difference between the second term (\(x-1\)) and the first term (\(\frac{1}{2}\)), and between the third term (\(3x\)) and the second term (\(x-1\)). Set these differences equal to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The common difference \(d\) is calculated as follows:  
- Difference between the second and first terms: \((x-1) - \frac{1}{2} = x - 1 - \frac{1}{2} = x - \frac{3}{2}\).  
- Difference between the third and second terms: \(3x - (x-1) = 3x - x + 1 = 2x + 1\).  

Since the sequence is arithmetic, the common difference must be the same:  
\[ x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \(x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1\) for \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Isolate \(x\) by performing algebraic operations to simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1 \]  

Subtract \(x\) from both sides:  
\[ -\frac{3}{2} = x + 1 \]  

Subtract 1 from both sides:  
\[ -\frac{3}{2} - 1 = x \]  
\[ -\frac{3}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = x \]  
\[ x = -\frac{5}{2} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) produces a valid arithmetic sequence.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) into the terms \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x\), compute the resulting terms, and check if the differences between consecutive terms are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\):  
- First term: \(\frac{1}{2}\).  
- Second term: \(x - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = -\frac{7}{2}\).  
- Third term: \(3x = 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = -\frac{15}{2}\).  

Check the common difference:  
- Between second and first: \(-\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{8}{2} = -4\).  
- Between third and second: \(-\frac{15}{2} - \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right) = -\frac{15}{2} + \frac{7}{2} = -\frac{8}{2} = -4\).  

The common difference is \(-4\) for both, confirming the sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{7}{2}, -\frac{15}{2}, \ldots\) is arithmetic.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Solve for \(x\) in the arithmetic sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \ldots\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the common difference and set up an equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation for \(x\) (completed, \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, sequence is arithmetic).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\)
