**Problem Statement**: Given the terms of an arithmetic sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \ldots\), solve for \(x\). In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. We need to find the value of \(x\) that ensures the given terms form such a sequence.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \(x\), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Identify the common difference of the arithmetic sequence using the given terms.
2. Set up an equation based on the constant difference between consecutive terms.
3. Solve the equation for \(x\).
4. Verify the solution by checking if the terms form an arithmetic sequence.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to identify the common difference and set up an equation. Since the sequence is arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Compute the differences \((x-1) - \frac{1}{2}\) and \(3x - (x-1)\), set them equal, and solve for \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the differences:
- First difference: \((x-1) - \frac{1}{2} = x - 1 - \frac{1}{2} = x - \frac{3}{2}\).
- Second difference: \(3x - (x-1) = 3x - x + 1 = 2x + 1\).

Since the sequence is arithmetic, the differences are equal:
\[ x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1 \]

Solve the equation:
\[ x - 2x = 1 + \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ -x = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = -\frac{5}{2} \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the solution \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\). Substitute \(x\) back into the terms \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x\), compute the resulting sequence, and check if the differences between consecutive terms are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\):
- First term: \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Second term: \(x - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = -\frac{7}{2}\).
- Third term: \(3x = 3 \cdot -\frac{5}{2} = -\frac{15}{2}\).

Check the differences:
- Second term minus first: \(-\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{8}{2} = -4\).
- Third term minus second: \(-\frac{15}{2} - \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right) = -\frac{15}{2} + \frac{7}{2} = -\frac{8}{2} = -4\).

The differences are equal (\(-4\)), confirming the sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{7}{2}, -\frac{15}{2}\) is arithmetic.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy based on recent planning:
- Main goal: Solve for \(x\) in the arithmetic sequence \(\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \ldots\).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the common difference (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 3).

Current goal: Conclude the solution since all subgoals are completed.

The solution \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\) has been validated, and no further subgoals are needed.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\)
