### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from the set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17} is odd.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers from the given set.
2. Identify the condition for the product of two integers to be odd.
3. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the product is odd.
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers from the set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}.
How to Achieve: The set has 13 integers (from 5 to 17, inclusive). Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) to find the number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from 13.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of integers in the set is 13 (since 17 - 5 + 1 = 13).
Total ways to choose 2 distinct integers:
C(13, 2) = 13! / (2!(13-2)!) = (13 × 12) / (2 × 1) = 78.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the condition for the product of two integers to be odd.
How to Achieve: Analyze the properties of odd and even numbers. The product of two integers is odd only if both integers are odd.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the product of two integers to be odd, both numbers must be odd, because:
- Odd × Odd = Odd
- Odd × Even = Even
- Even × Even = Even
Thus, we need both chosen integers to be odd for their product to be odd.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the product is odd.
How to Achieve: Identify the odd integers in the set, then calculate the number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers using the combination formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List the integers from 5 to 17: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}.
Odd integers: {5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17} (7 numbers).
Number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers:
C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = (7 × 6) / (2 × 1) = 21.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (from Step 4) by the total number of outcomes (from Step 2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Favorable outcomes (product is odd): 21.
Total outcomes: 78.
Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 21 / 78.
Simplify: 21 ÷ 3 = 7, 78 ÷ 3 = 26, so 21 / 78 = 7 / 26.
The fraction 7/26 is in its simplest form (7 is prime, and 26 = 2 × 13, so no common factors).
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the product of two distinct integers from 5 to 17 is odd.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers (completed: 78 ways).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for the product to be odd (completed: both integers must be odd).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (completed: 21 ways).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability (completed: 7/26).

### Final Answer
The probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from 5 to 17, inclusive, is odd is **7/26**.
