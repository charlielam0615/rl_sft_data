**Problem Statement**: Factor the expression \( t^2 - 121 \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of factoring \( t^2 - 121 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recognize the expression as a difference of squares.  
2. Apply the difference of squares formula to factor the expression.  
3. Verify the factored form.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Recognize the expression \( t^2 - 121 \) as a difference of squares.  
How to Achieve: Identify if the expression fits the form \( a^2 - b^2 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are terms such that \( t^2 = a^2 \) and \( 121 = b^2 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression is \( t^2 - 121 \). Notice that:  
- \( t^2 = t^2 \), so \( t \) is the first term.  
- \( 121 = 11^2 \), so \( 11 \) is the second term.  
Thus, \( t^2 - 121 = t^2 - 11^2 \), which is a difference of squares.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the difference of squares formula to factor \( t^2 - 121 \).  
How to Achieve: Use the formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), where \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the difference of squares formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \):  
- Here, \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \).  
- So, \( t^2 - 121 = t^2 - 11^2 = (t - 11)(t + 11) \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the factored form \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \).  
How to Achieve: Expand the factored expression and check if it equals the original expression \( t^2 - 121 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \):  
- Use the FOIL method: \( (t - 11)(t + 11) = t \cdot t + t \cdot 11 + (-11) \cdot t + (-11) \cdot 11 \).  
- This gives: \( t^2 + 11t - 11t - 121 = t^2 - 121 \).  
The expansion matches the original expression, confirming the factorization is correct.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Factor \( t^2 - 121 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the expression as a difference of squares (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the difference of squares formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factored form (completed).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).

**Final Answer**:  
The factored form of \( t^2 - 121 \) is \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \).
