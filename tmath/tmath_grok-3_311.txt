**Problem Statement**: Factor the expression \( t^2 - 121 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of factoring \( t^2 - 121 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recognize the structure of the expression.  
2. Apply the appropriate factoring technique based on the recognized structure.  
3. Verify the factored form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Recognize the structure of the expression \( t^2 - 121 \).  
How to Achieve: Observe the expression to identify if it matches a known algebraic pattern, such as a difference of squares.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression \( t^2 - 121 \) is a binomial with two terms: \( t^2 \) and \( -121 \). Notice that \( t^2 = t^2 \) (a perfect square) and \( 121 = 11^2 \) (another perfect square). Thus, the expression can be written as \( t^2 - 11^2 \), which matches the difference of squares pattern: \( a^2 - b^2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the appropriate factoring technique for \( t^2 - 121 \).  
How to Achieve: Use the difference of squares formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), where \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the difference of squares formula:  
\( t^2 - 121 = t^2 - 11^2 = (t - 11)(t + 11) \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the factored form \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \).  
How to Achieve: Expand the factored expression and check if it equals the original expression \( t^2 - 121 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \):  
\( (t - 11)(t + 11) = t \cdot t + t \cdot 11 - 11 \cdot t - 11 \cdot 11 = t^2 + 11t - 11t - 121 = t^2 - 121 \).  
The result matches the original expression, confirming the factoring is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Factor \( t^2 - 121 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the structure of the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the appropriate factoring technique (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factored form (completed).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The expression \( t^2 - 121 \) has been factored as \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \), and the solution is verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The factored form of \( t^2 - 121 \) is \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \).
