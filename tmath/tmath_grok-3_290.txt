**Problem Restatement**: Find the value of \( y \) in the equation \( \frac{30}{50} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \( y \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.  
2. Isolate the square root on the right-hand side.  
3. Eliminate the square root by squaring both sides.  
4. Solve for \( y \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation \( \frac{30}{50} \).  
How to Achieve: Reduce the fraction \( \frac{30}{50} \) to its simplest form by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \( \frac{30}{50} \):  
\[ \frac{30 \div 10}{50 \div 10} = \frac{3}{5} \]  
So, the equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{3}{5} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the square root on the right-hand side of \( \frac{3}{5} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \).  
How to Achieve: Square both sides of the equation to remove the square root.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Square both sides:  
\[ \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \left( \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \right)^2 \]  
Left-hand side:  
\[ \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25} \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ \left( \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \right)^2 = \frac{y}{50} \]  
So, the equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{9}{25} = \frac{y}{50} \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \( y \) in \( \frac{9}{25} = \frac{y}{50} \).  
How to Achieve: Cross-multiply to isolate \( y \), then compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cross-multiply:  
\[ 9 \cdot 50 = 25 \cdot y \]  
\[ 450 = 25y \]  
Divide both sides by 25:  
\[ y = \frac{450}{25} = 18 \]  
So, \( y = 18 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( y = 18 \) is correct.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( y = 18 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 18 \) into \( \frac{30}{50} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \):  
Left-hand side:  
\[ \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]  
Right-hand side:  
\[ \sqrt{\frac{18}{50}} = \sqrt{\frac{18 \div 2}{50 \div 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]  
Since \( 0.6 = 0.6 \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( y \) in \( \frac{30}{50} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the left-hand side (completed: \( \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Eliminate the square root (completed: squared both sides to get \( \frac{9}{25} = \frac{y}{50} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( y \) (completed: \( y = 18 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified \( y = 18 \)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, solution found).
