**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( y \) in the equation \( \frac{30}{50} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( y \).  
- Subgoal 1: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.  
- Subgoal 2: Isolate the square root on the right-hand side.  
- Subgoal 3: Square both sides to eliminate the square root.  
- Subgoal 4: Solve for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the left-hand side of the equation \( \frac{30}{50} \). This can be achieved by performing the division to obtain a numerical value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The left-hand side is \( \frac{30}{50} \).  
\[ \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]  
So, the equation becomes:  
\[ 0.6 = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to isolate the square root and solve for \( y \). This can be achieved by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, then solving the resulting equation for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting with:  
\[ 0.6 = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \]  
Square both sides to remove the square root:  
\[ (0.6)^2 = \left( \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \right)^2 \]  
\[ 0.36 = \frac{y}{50} \]  
Multiply both sides by 50 to solve for \( y \):  
\[ y = 0.36 \times 50 = 18 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by substituting \( y = 18 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 18 \) into the right-hand side:  
\[ \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{50}} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6 \]  
The left-hand side is:  
\[ \frac{30}{50} = 0.6 \]  
Since \( 0.6 = 0.6 \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( y \) in \( \frac{30}{50} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the left-hand side (completed: \( \frac{30}{50} = 0.6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate the square root (completed: obtained \( 0.6 = \sqrt{\frac{y}{50}} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Square both sides and solve for \( y \) (completed: \( y = 18 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified \( y = 18 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Completed all subgoals; the solution is \( y = 18 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( y \) is 18.
