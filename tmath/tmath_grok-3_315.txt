**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the ratio of the x-intercepts \( s \) to \( t \) for two lines with the same non-zero y-intercept. The first line has a slope of 10 and an x-intercept at \( (s, 0) \). The second line has a slope of 6 and an x-intercept at \( (t, 0) \). The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the ratio \( s/t \), we need to:  
1. Determine the equations of both lines using their slopes, x-intercepts, and the fact that they share the same y-intercept.  
2. Use the shared y-intercept to relate the two equations.  
3. Find expressions for \( s \) and \( t \) and compute their ratio.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the equations of both lines.  
How to Achieve: Use the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. Since both lines have the same y-intercept \( b \), use the given slopes and x-intercepts to express \( b \) in terms of \( s \) and \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the first line: Slope = 10, x-intercept = \( (s, 0) \). At the x-intercept, \( y = 0 \), so:  
\[ 0 = 10s + b \implies b = -10s \]  

For the second line: Slope = 6, x-intercept = \( (t, 0) \). At the x-intercept:  
\[ 0 = 6t + b \implies b = -6t \]  

Since both lines have the same y-intercept:  
\[ -10s = -6t \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for the ratio \( s/t \) using the relationship between \( s \) and \( t \).  
How to Achieve: From the equation \( -10s = -6t \), simplify to find the ratio \( s/t \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting from:  
\[ -10s = -6t \]  
Divide both sides by \(-1\):  
\[ 10s = 6t \]  
Solve for the ratio:  
\[ \frac{s}{t} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the ratio \( s/t = 3/5 \) is correct.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( s = \frac{3}{5}t \) into the y-intercept equations to confirm consistency and check if the lines satisfy all given conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assume \( s = \frac{3}{5}t \). For the first line, y-intercept:  
\[ b = -10s = -10 \cdot \frac{3}{5}t = -6t \]  

For the second line, y-intercept:  
\[ b = -6t \]  

Both y-intercepts match, confirming the relationship \( 10s = 6t \). The equations are:  
- First line: \( y = 10x - 10s \)  
- Second line: \( y = 6x - 6t \)  

Using \( s = \frac{3}{5}t \), the x-intercepts are:  
- First line: \( 0 = 10s - 10s \implies x = s \) (correct).  
- Second line: \( 0 = 6t - 6t \implies x = t \) (correct).  

The ratio \( s/t = 3/5 \) satisfies all conditions.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the ratio \( s/t \) as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equations of both lines using slopes and x-intercepts.  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the shared y-intercept to relate \( s \) and \( t \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the ratio \( s/t \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution.  

Current Goal: Completed â€” the ratio \( s/t = 3/5 \) has been found and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The ratio of \( s \) to \( t \) is \( \frac{3}{5} \).  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{3}{5}} \]
