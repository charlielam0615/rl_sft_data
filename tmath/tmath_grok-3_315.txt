### Problem Restatement
We need to find the ratio of the x-intercepts, \( s / t \), for two lines that share the same non-zero y-intercept. The first line has a slope of 10 and an x-intercept at \( (s, 0) \). The second line has a slope of 6 and an x-intercept at \( (t, 0) \). The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the ratio \( s / t \):  
1. Determine the equations of both lines using their slopes and shared y-intercept.  
2. Use the x-intercepts \( (s, 0) \) and \( (t, 0) \) to express \( s \) and \( t \) in terms of the y-intercept.  
3. Form the ratio \( s / t \) and simplify it to a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the equations of the two lines. Use the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the common y-intercept, and apply the x-intercept conditions to find \( s \) and \( t \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the common y-intercept be \( b \), where \( b \neq 0 \).  

- **First line**: Slope = 10, x-intercept = \( (s, 0) \).  
  The equation is \( y = 10x + b \).  
  At the x-intercept, \( y = 0 \):  
  \[
  0 = 10s + b \implies 10s = -b \implies s = -\frac{b}{10}.
  \]

- **Second line**: Slope = 6, x-intercept = \( (t, 0) \).  
  The equation is \( y = 6x + b \).  
  At the x-intercept, \( y = 0 \):  
  \[
  0 = 6t + b \implies 6t = -b \implies t = -\frac{b}{6}.
  \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the ratio \( s / t \) using the expressions for \( s \) and \( t \) derived in the previous step and simplify it to a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the results from the previous step:  
\[
s = -\frac{b}{10}, \quad t = -\frac{b}{6}.
\]
The ratio is:
\[
\frac{s}{t} = \frac{-\frac{b}{10}}{-\frac{b}{6}} = \frac{b}{10} \cdot \frac{6}{b} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]
Since \( b \neq 0 \), the \( b \) terms cancel out, and the ratio simplifies to \( \frac{3}{5} \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the ratio \( s / t = \frac{3}{5} \) by checking the consistency of the line equations and ensuring the solution aligns with the problemâ€™s conditions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, consider the x-intercepts again:  
- For the first line, \( y = 10x + b \), the x-intercept gives \( s = -\frac{b}{10} \).  
- For the second line, \( y = 6x + b \), the x-intercept gives \( t = -\frac{b}{6} \).  
The ratio:
\[
\frac{s}{t} = \frac{-\frac{b}{10}}{-\frac{b}{6}} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]
Alternatively, test with a specific y-intercept, say \( b = 1 \):  
- First line: \( y = 10x + 1 \), x-intercept: \( 0 = 10s + 1 \implies s = -\frac{1}{10} \).  
- Second line: \( y = 6x + 1 \), x-intercept: \( 0 = 6t + 1 \implies t = -\frac{1}{6} \).  
- Ratio: \( \frac{s}{t} = \frac{-\frac{1}{10}}{-\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} \).  
The result is consistent, confirming the ratio is correct.
