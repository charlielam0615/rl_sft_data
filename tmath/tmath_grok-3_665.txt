**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of ways to seat 4 sons and 3 daughters of the Smith family in a row of 7 chairs, ensuring that at least 2 boys are seated next to each other.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of ways to seat 7 children in 7 chairs without restrictions.
2. Calculate the number of arrangements where no two boys are adjacent.
3. Subtract the arrangements from step 2 from the total arrangements to find the number of arrangements where at least two boys are next to each other.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 7 children in 7 chairs without restrictions.
How to Achieve: Since there are 7 distinct children (4 sons and 3 daughters) and 7 chairs, compute the number of permutations of the 7 children.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of ways to arrange 7 distinct children in 7 chairs is given by the factorial of the number of children:
\[ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \]
So, there are 5040 possible seating arrangements without any restrictions.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of arrangements where no two boys are adjacent.
How to Achieve: Arrange the 3 daughters first, then place the 4 sons in the gaps between or around the daughters such that no two sons are adjacent.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
1. Arrange the 3 daughters in the 7 chairs. The number of ways to arrange 3 distinct daughters is:
   \[ 3! = 6 \]
2. After placing the 3 daughters, there are 4 remaining positions (gaps) around them. For example, if daughters are in positions D1, D2, D3, the gaps are before D1, between D1 and D2, between D2 and D3, and after D3, giving 4 gaps.
3. To ensure no two boys are adjacent, place at most one boy in each gap. Choose 4 gaps to place the 4 sons, but since there are only 4 gaps available, we must use all 4 gaps.
4. Arrange the 4 distinct sons in these 4 gaps. The number of ways to arrange 4 sons is:
   \[ 4! = 24 \]
5. Thus, the number of ways to arrange the children with no two boys adjacent is:
   \[ 3! \times 4! = 6 \times 24 = 144 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of arrangements where no two boys are adjacent.
How to Achieve: Reassess the gap-based approach by considering the placement of daughters and sons explicitly and check for consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Reconsider the arrangement:
- Place 3 daughters in 3 of the 7 chairs. The number of ways to choose 3 chairs out of 7 is:
  \[ \binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35 \]
- Arrange the 3 daughters in those chairs: \( 3! = 6 \).
- Place the 4 sons in the remaining 4 chairs, ensuring no two boys are adjacent. However, since the remaining chairs may be adjacent, this approach is complex.
Instead, revisit the gap method:
- After placing 3 daughters, there are 4 gaps (before the first daughter, between daughters, and after the last daughter).
- Place 4 sons in these 4 gaps, one per gap, to ensure no adjacency: \( 4! = 24 \).
- Total: \( 3! \times 4! = 6 \times 24 = 144 \).
The gap method is consistent and simpler, confirming 144 arrangements.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of arrangements where at least two boys are next to each other.
How to Achieve: Subtract the number of arrangements where no two boys are adjacent from the total number of arrangements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total arrangements (from Step 2): 5040
Arrangements with no two boys adjacent (from Step 3): 144
Arrangements with at least two boys next to each other:
\[ 5040 - 144 = 4896 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the number of ways to seat 4 sons and 3 daughters in 7 chairs with at least 2 boys next to each other.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total arrangements (completed: 5040).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate arrangements with no two boys adjacent (completed: 144).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute arrangements with at least two boys adjacent (completed: 4896).
Current Goal: Finalize and confirm the solution.
The calculations align with the subgoals, and the final answer is derived.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the final answer by ensuring all steps are correct and consistent.
How to Achieve: Double-check calculations and logic, particularly the gap method and subtraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total arrangements: \( 7! = 5040 \), correct for 7 distinct children.
- No two boys adjacent: 3 daughters create 4 gaps, sons placed one per gap (\( 3! \times 4! = 6 \times 24 = 144 \)).
- At least two boys adjacent: \( 5040 - 144 = 4896 \).
The logic of using gaps ensures no adjacency, and subtraction accounts for the complement. The calculations are mathematically sound.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The number of ways to seat the 4 sons and 3 daughters in a row of 7 chairs such that at least 2 boys are next to each other is **4896**.
