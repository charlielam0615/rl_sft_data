### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( y - x \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are two numbers satisfying the following conditions:
1. The sum of the two numbers is \( x + y = 399 \).
2. The fraction \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \).

We will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and organizing the content according to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( y - x \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both given equations. Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the equation \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \) to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \).  
2. Substitute this expression into the sum equation \( x + y = 399 \) to solve for \( y \).  
3. Compute \( x \) using the relationship from step 1.  
4. Calculate \( y - x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using the equation \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \). This can be achieved by solving the equation for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \), multiply both sides by \( y \):  
\[ x = 0.9y \]  
This gives us \( x \) as a function of \( y \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( y \) by substituting \( x = 0.9y \) into the sum equation \( x + y = 399 \). This will yield a single equation in terms of \( y \), which we can solve.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 0.9y \) into \( x + y = 399 \):  
\[ 0.9y + y = 399 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ 1.9y = 399 \]  
Solve for \( y \):  
\[ y = \frac{399}{1.9} \]  
To compute this, convert 1.9 to a fraction: \( 1.9 = \frac{19}{10} \). Then:  
\[ y = \frac{399}{\frac{19}{10}} = 399 \cdot \frac{10}{19} = \frac{399 \cdot 10}{19} = \frac{3990}{19} \]  
Perform the division:  
\[ 3990 \div 19 = 210 \] (since \( 19 \cdot 210 = 3990 \)).  
Thus, \( y = 210 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( x \) using the relationship \( x = 0.9y \) and the value \( y = 210 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( x = 0.9y \):  
\[ x = 0.9 \cdot 210 = \frac{9}{10} \cdot 210 = \frac{9 \cdot 210}{10} = \frac{1890}{10} = 189 \]  
Thus, \( x = 189 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 189 \) and \( y = 210 \) satisfy both given equations: \( x + y = 399 \) and \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the sum:  
\[ x + y = 189 + 210 = 399 \]  
This satisfies \( x + y = 399 \).  

Check the fraction:  
\[ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{189}{210} = \frac{189 \div 21}{210 \div 21} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9 \]  
This satisfies \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \).  

Both conditions are met, so the values are valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final answer, \( y - x \), using \( x = 189 \) and \( y = 210 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[ y - x = 210 - 189 = 21 \]  
[/IMP]
