**Problem Statement**: The sum of two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is 399, and the fraction \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \). We need to find the value of \( y - x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given equations \( x + y = 399 \) and \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \) to set up a system of equations.  
2. Solve the system to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).  
3. Compute \( y - x \) using the values obtained.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the system of equations based on \( x + y = 399 \) and \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \). This can be achieved by expressing \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using the fraction equation, substituting into the sum equation, and solving for \( y \), then finding \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \), we get:  
\[ x = 0.9y \]  

Substitute \( x = 0.9y \) into \( x + y = 399 \):  
\[ 0.9y + y = 399 \]  
\[ 1.9y = 399 \]  
\[ y = \frac{399}{1.9} \]  

Compute \( y \):  
\[ y = \frac{399}{1.9} = \frac{399 \cdot 10}{19} = \frac{3990}{19} \approx 210 \]  

Now find \( x \):  
\[ x = 0.9y = 0.9 \cdot 210 = 189 \]  

Verify:  
- Sum: \( x + y = 189 + 210 = 399 \), which satisfies \( x + y = 399 \).  
- Fraction: \( \frac{x}{y} = \frac{189}{210} = 0.9 \), which satisfies \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the values \( x = 189 \) and \( y = 210 \) by checking both given conditions and ensuring the calculations are correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the equations:  
1. \( x + y = 189 + 210 = 399 \), which matches the given sum.  
2. \( \frac{x}{y} = \frac{189}{210} = \frac{189 \div 21}{210 \div 21} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9 \), which matches the given fraction.  

The values satisfy both equations, confirming the solution is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( y - x \) using the values \( x = 189 \) and \( y = 210 \). This can be achieved by subtracting \( x \) from \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ y - x = 210 - 189 = 21 \]
