**Problem Statement**: Given the equations \( a + b = 6 \) and \( a - b = 2 \), find the value of \( a^2 - b^2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \( a^2 - b^2 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the given equations.  
2. Use the values of \( a \) and \( b \) to compute \( a^2 - b^2 \).  
3. Alternatively, explore if \( a^2 - b^2 \) can be computed directly using an algebraic identity.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the equations \( a + b = 6 \) and \( a - b = 2 \). This can be achieved by adding the equations to eliminate \( b \) and find \( a \), then substituting to find \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the equations:  
\[ (a + b) + (a - b) = 6 + 2 \]  
\[ 2a = 8 \]  
\[ a = 4 \]  
Substitute \( a = 4 \) into \( a + b = 6 \):  
\[ 4 + b = 6 \]  
\[ b = 2 \]  
So, \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( a^2 - b^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) (completed: \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( a^2 - b^2 \) using the values of \( a \) and \( b \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Explore direct computation using an algebraic identity (not yet pursued).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( a^2 - b^2 \) using \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a^2 - b^2 \) using \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \). This can be achieved by calculating \( a^2 = 4^2 \), \( b^2 = 2^2 \), and then finding the difference.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[ a^2 = 4^2 = 16 \]  
\[ b^2 = 2^2 = 4 \]  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = 16 - 4 = 12 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \( a^2 - b^2 \) can be computed directly using an algebraic identity, based on the original equations \( a + b = 6 \) and \( a - b = 2 \). Retrieve relevant information about algebraic identities for \( a^2 - b^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The expression \( a^2 - b^2 \) can be factored as a difference of squares:  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) \]  
From previous steps, the given equations are \( a + b = 6 \) and \( a - b = 2 \). This identity allows direct computation of \( a^2 - b^2 \) without explicitly solving for \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a^2 - b^2 \) using the identity \( a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) \), with \( a + b = 6 \) and \( a - b = 2 \). This can be achieved by multiplying the values of \( a + b \) and \( a - b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the identity:  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( a^2 - b^2 = 12 \) by ensuring consistency between the two methods (direct calculation and algebraic identity).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first method (Step 4) used \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \):  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = 16 - 4 = 12 \]  
The second method (Step 6) used the identity:  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12 \]  
Both methods yield \( a^2 - b^2 = 12 \), confirming the result is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ a^2 - b^2 = 12 \]
