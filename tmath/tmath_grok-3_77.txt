### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \(a^2 - b^2\) given the equations \(a + b = 6\) and \(a - b = 2\). Let's solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \(a^2 - b^2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the given system of equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).  
2. Use the values of \(a\) and \(b\) to compute \(a^2 - b^2\).  
3. Alternatively, explore if \(a^2 - b^2\) can be computed directly using an algebraic identity.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(a + b = 6\) and \(a - b = 2\) to find \(a\) and \(b\). This can be achieved by adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add the equations:  
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 6 + 2 \implies 2a = 8 \implies a = 4
\]  
Substitute \(a = 4\) into \(a + b = 6\):  
\[
4 + b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]  
So, \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \(a = 4\), \(b = 2\) by checking both given equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \(a + b = 6\):  
\[
4 + 2 = 6 \quad \text{(True)}
\]  
Check \(a - b = 2\):  
\[
4 - 2 = 2 \quad \text{(True)}
\]  
The values \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\) satisfy both equations, so the solution is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(a^2 - b^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations \(a + b = 6\) and \(a - b = 2\). (Completed: \(a = 4\), \(b = 2\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Use \(a\) and \(b\) to compute \(a^2 - b^2\). (Pending)  
  - Subgoal 3: Explore algebraic identity for \(a^2 - b^2\). (Not pursued yet)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(a^2 - b^2\) using \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a^2 - b^2\) using \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\). This can be achieved by direct substitution into the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = 4^2 - 2^2 = 16 - 4 = 12
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the computation of \(a^2 - b^2\) is correct by recalling the algebraic identity for \(a^2 - b^2\) and checking if it yields the same result.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The expression \(a^2 - b^2\) can be factored as:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
\]  
From previous steps, \(a + b = 6\) and \(a - b = 2\). Thus:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12
\]  
This matches the result from Step 5 (\(a^2 - b^2 = 12\)), confirming the computation.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final answer \(a^2 - b^2 = 12\) by ensuring both methods (direct computation and algebraic identity) are consistent and correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Direct computation: \(a^2 - b^2 = 4^2 - 2^2 = 16 - 4 = 12\).  
Algebraic identity: \(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12\).  
Both methods yield \(a^2 - b^2 = 12\), and the inputs \(a = 4\), \(b = 2\) satisfy the original equations. The answer is consistent.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \(a^2 - b^2\) is \(12\).
