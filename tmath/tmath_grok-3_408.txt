**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the simplified form of the expression \( 3(x^2 - x^3 + x) + 3(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) - 5(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^3 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given expression by distributing and combining like terms.  
2. Identify the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the resulting polynomial.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression by distributing each term and combining like terms. Achieve this by expanding each part of the expression separately, then summing the coefficients for each power of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand each term:  
- First term: \( 3(x^2 - x^3 + x) = 3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x \).  
- Second term: \( 3(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) = 3x + 6x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 + 3x^3 \).  
- Third term: \( -5(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) = -5 - 5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2 \).  

Combine all terms:  
\[ (9x^5) + (-3x^3 + 6x^3 + 3x^3 + 20x^3) + (3x^2 - 9x^2 + 5x^2) + (3x + 3x - 5x) - 5 \].  

Group like terms:  
- \( x^5 \): \( 9x^5 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -3x^3 + 6x^3 + 3x^3 + 20x^3 = 26x^3 \).  
- \( x^2 \): \( 3x^2 - 9x^2 + 5x^2 = -1x^2 \).  
- \( x \): \( 3x + 3x - 5x = 1x \).  
- Constant: \( -5 \).  

Simplified expression: \( 9x^5 + 26x^3 - x^2 + x - 5 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the simplification by checking the coefficient of \( x^3 \). Ensure the calculation of the \( x^3 \) terms is correct by re-examining the expansion and combination steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute \( x^3 \) terms:  
- First term: \( -3x^3 \).  
- Second term: \( 6x^3 + 3x^3 = 9x^3 \).  
- Third term: \( -5(-4x^3) = 20x^3 \).  
Total: \( -3 + 9 + 20 = 26x^3 \).  
The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 26, consistent with the previous step.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the simplified expression.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by distributing and combining like terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the coefficient of \( x^3 \) (completed, coefficient is 26).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the simplification (completed, coefficient confirmed as 26).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by extracting the coefficient of \( x^3 \).  
The simplified expression is \( 9x^5 + 26x^3 - x^2 + x - 5 \), so the coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 26.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 26.
