**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the simplified expression \( 3(x^2 - x^3 + x) + 3(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) - 5(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^3 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the constants (3, 3, -5) to each term in the respective polynomials.  
2. Collect all terms of the expression.  
3. Identify and sum the coefficients of \( x^3 \).  
4. Simplify to find the final coefficient.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Distribute the constants to each term in the polynomials.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply each term inside the parentheses by their respective coefficients (3, 3, -5) to expand the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute the constants:  
- First polynomial: \( 3(x^2 - x^3 + x) = 3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x \)  
- Second polynomial: \( 3(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) = 3x + 6x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 + 3x^3 \)  
- Third polynomial: \( -5(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) = -5 - 5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2 \)  

The expanded expression is:  
\( (3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x) + (3x + 6x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 + 3x^3) + (-5 - 5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2) \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Collect all terms of the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Combine like terms by grouping terms with the same degree (e.g., \( x^5 \), \( x^3 \), \( x^2 \), \( x \), constant).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Combine like terms:  
- \( x^5 \): \( 9x^5 \)  
- \( x^3 \): \( -3x^3 + 6x^3 + 3x^3 + 20x^3 = (-3 + 6 + 3 + 20)x^3 = 26x^3 \)  
- \( x^2 \): \( 3x^2 - 9x^2 + 5x^2 = (3 - 9 + 5)x^2 = -1x^2 = -x^2 \)  
- \( x \): \( 3x + 3x - 5x = (3 + 3 - 5)x = 1x = x \)  
- Constant: \( -5 \)  

The simplified expression is:  
\( 9x^5 + 26x^3 - x^2 + x - 5 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficient of \( x^3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Extract the coefficient of \( x^3 \) from the simplified expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the simplified expression \( 9x^5 + 26x^3 - x^2 + x - 5 \), the term involving \( x^3 \) is \( 26x^3 \).  
The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 26.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the coefficient of \( x^3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the coefficient by redistributing and recollecting \( x^3 \) terms to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute \( x^3 \) terms:  
- First polynomial: \( -3x^3 \)  
- Second polynomial: \( 6x^3 + 3x^3 = 9x^3 \)  
- Third polynomial: \( -5 \cdot (-4x^3) = 20x^3 \)  
Sum: \( -3x^3 + 9x^3 + 20x^3 = (9 - 3 + 20)x^3 = 26x^3 \)  

The coefficient is confirmed as 26.
