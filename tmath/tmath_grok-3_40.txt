**Problem Statement**: Given the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x + 9 & \text{if } x < -2, \\ 5 - 2x & \text{if } x \geq -2, \end{cases} \) find the value of \( f(-7) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(-7) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies by evaluating the condition for \( x = -7 \).  
2. Apply the appropriate function piece to compute \( f(-7) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine which piece of the piecewise function applies for \( x = -7 \). This involves checking if \( x = -7 \) satisfies \( x < -2 \) or \( x \geq -2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( -7 < -2 \), the function piece \( f(x) = 2x + 9 \) applies for \( x = -7 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-7) \) using the function piece \( f(x) = 2x + 9 \). This involves substituting \( x = -7 \) into the expression and performing the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -7 \) into \( f(x) = 2x + 9 \):  
\( f(-7) = 2(-7) + 9 = -14 + 9 = -5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(-7) \). This involves rechecking the condition and the arithmetic to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck the condition: Since \( -7 < -2 \), the correct piece is \( f(x) = 2x + 9 \).  
Recalculate: \( f(-7) = 2(-7) + 9 = -14 + 9 = -5 \). The computation is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(-7) \) for the given piecewise function.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine which piece of the function applies for \( x = -7 \). (Completed: \( x = -7 < -2 \), so use \( f(x) = 2x + 9 \).)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(-7) \) using the appropriate function piece. (Completed: \( f(-7) = -5 \).)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation. (Completed: Condition and arithmetic verified.)  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(-7) = -5 \)
