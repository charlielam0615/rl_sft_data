### Problem Restatement
We are given a rectangular box with:
- Volume: 4320 cubic inches.
- Surface area: 1704 square inches.
- Sum of the lengths of its 12 edges: 208 inches.
We need to find the volume of the box if its length, width, and height are each increased by 1 inch.

Let’s denote the dimensions of the box as:
- Length: \( l \) inches
- Width: \( w \) inches
- Height: \( h \) inches

From the problem:
1. Volume: \( l \cdot w \cdot h = 4320 \)
2. Surface area: \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 1704 \)
3. Sum of the lengths of the 12 edges: \( 4l + 4w + 4h = 208 \)

We need to compute the new volume: \( (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the new volume into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the original dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) by solving the system of equations derived from the given volume, surface area, and edge sum.
2. Compute the new dimensions: \( l + 1 \), \( w + 1 \), \( h + 1 \).
3. Calculate the new volume: \( (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the original dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \). Achieve this by setting up and solving the system of equations:
- \( l \cdot w \cdot h = 4320 \)
- \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 1704 \), which simplifies to \( lw + lh + wh = 852 \)
- \( 4l + 4w + 4h = 208 \), which simplifies to \( l + w + h = 52 \)
Use these equations to find \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Simplify the given equations:
1. Volume: \( lwh = 4320 \)
2. Surface area: \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 1704 \implies lw + lh + wh = 852 \)
3. Edge sum: \( 4l + 4w + 4h = 208 \implies l + w + h = 52 \)

Let’s solve this system. From the edge sum:
\[ l + w + h = 52 \]

From the surface area:
\[ lw + lh + wh = 852 \]

From the volume:
\[ lwh = 4320 \]

To proceed, express one variable in terms of the others. From \( l + w + h = 52 \), solve for \( h \):
\[ h = 52 - l - w \]

Substitute \( h = 52 - l - w \) into the surface area equation:
\[ lw + l(52 - l - w) + w(52 - l - w) = 852 \]
Expand:
\[ lw + 52l - l^2 - lw + 52w - lw - w^2 = 852 \]
Simplify (note that \( lw - lw - lw = -lw \)):
\[ -l^2 - w^2 - lw + 52l + 52w = 852 \]
Rearrange:
\[ l^2 + w^2 + lw - 52l - 52w = -852 \]

Now substitute \( h = 52 - l - w \) into the volume equation:
\[ lw(52 - l - w) = 4320 \]

We now have two key equations:
1. \( l^2 + w^2 + lw - 52l - 52w = -852 \)
2. \( lw(52 - l - w) = 4320 \)

Rewrite the surface area equation:
\[ l^2 + w^2 + lw - 52l - 52w + 852 = 0 \]
This resembles a quadratic form. Let’s try to manipulate it. Notice it can be written as:
\[ (l + w)^2 - lw - 52(l + w) + 852 = 0 \]
Since \( l + w + h = 52 \), let \( s = l + w \), so \( h = 52 - s \). Then:
\[ s^2 - lw - 52s + 852 = 0 \]
\[ lw = s^2 - 52s + 852 \]

Substitute into the volume equation:
\[ lw(52 - l - w) = 4320 \]
Since \( l + w = s \), we have \( 52 - l - w = 52 - s \), so:
\[ lw (52 - s) = 4320 \]
\[ lw = \frac{4320}{52 - s} \]

Equate the two expressions for \( lw \):
\[ s^2 - 52s + 852 = \frac{4320}{52 - s} \]

Multiply through by \( 52 - s \) to eliminate the denominator:
\[ (s^2 - 52s + 852)(52 - s) = 4320 \]

Expand:
\[ (s^2 - 52s + 852)(52 - s) = s^2 \cdot 52 - s^3 - 52s \cdot 52 + 52s^2 + 852 \cdot 52 - 852s \]
\[ = -s^3 + 52s^2 + 52s^2 - 2704s - 852s + 852 \cdot 52 \]
\[ = -s^3 + 104s^2 - 3556s + 44252 \]

So:
\[ -s^3 + 104s^2 - 3556s + 44252 = 4320 \]
\[ s^3 - 104s^2 + 3556s - 44252 + 4320 = 0 \]
\[ s^3 - 104s^2 + 3556s - 39932 = 0 \]

Solve this cubic equation for \( s = l + w \). Testing possible rational roots (factors of \(-39932\) over factors of 1), let’s try \( s = 26 \):
\[ 26^3 - 104 \cdot 26^2 + 3556 \cdot 26 - 39932 \]
\[ 26^3 = 17576 \]
\[ 104 \cdot 26^2 = 104 \cdot 676 = 70304 \]
\[ 3556 \cdot 26 = 92456 \]
\[ 17576 - 70304 + 92456 - 39932 = 17576 + 92456 - 70304 - 39932 = 110032 - 110236 = -204 \]

The result is close but not zero, suggesting \( s = 26 \) is not exact. Let’s try numerical methods or further factorization later if needed, but first, let’s explore the volume equation with \( s \).

Return to:
\[ lw = \frac{4320}{52 - s} \]
\[ lw = s^2 - 52s + 852 \]

Assume \( s = 26 \):
\[ lw = \frac{4320}{52 - 26} = \frac{4320}{26} = 166.1538 \]
\[ lw = 26^2 - 52 \cdot 26 + 852 = 676 - 1352 + 852 = 176 \]

The values don’t match, indicating a need to solve the cubic more accurately. Let’s proceed by assuming we need the exact \( s \), but for now, let’s try to find \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) using the equations.

Instead, let’s try substituting \( h = 52 - l - w \) into the volume and solve numerically later if needed. For now, let’s derive \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) by solving the quadratic in \( l \) and \( w \).

From \( lw = \frac{4320}{52 - l - w} \), and using \( l + w + h = 52 \), we proceed numerically later. Let’s try to find consistent dimensions.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the equations are set up correctly and if the approach to solve for \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) is feasible. Check the consistency of the system and consider numerical or algebraic methods to find the dimensions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The system is:
\[ l + w + h = 52 \]
\[ lw + lh + wh = 852 \]
\[ lwh = 4320 \]

The cubic equation for \( s = l + w \) was complex, so let’s try a substitution approach again. Let’s assume \( l \) and \( w \) are roots of a quadratic derived from the equations.

Try to express variables symmetrically. Let’s use the fact that \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are roots of a polynomial whose coefficients relate to the symmetric sums:
- Sum: \( l + w + h = 52 \)
- Sum of pairwise products: \( lw + lh + wh = 852 \)
- Product: \( lwh = 4320 \)

Assume the dimensions are roots of:
\[ x^3 - (l + w + h)x^2 + (lw + lh + wh)x - lwh = 0 \]
\[ x^3 - 52x^2 + 852x - 4320 = 0 \]

Solve this cubic to find \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \). Use the rational root theorem. Possible roots are factors of \(-4320\) over 1: \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \ldots, \pm 4320 \).

Test \( x = 12 \):
\[ 12^3 - 52 \cdot 12^2 + 852 \cdot 12 - 4320 \]
\[ 12^3 = 1728 \]
\[ 52 \cdot 12^2 = 52 \cdot 144 = 7488 \]
\[ 852 \cdot 12 = 10224 \]
\[ 1728 - 7488 + 10224 - 4320 = 1728 + 10224 - 7488 - 4320 = 11952 - 11808 = 144 \]

Not zero. Try \( x = 15 \):
\[ 15^3 - 52 \cdot 15^2 + 852 \cdot 15 - 4320 \]
\[ 15^3 = 3375 \]
\[ 52 \cdot 15^2 = 52 \cdot 225 = 11700 \]
\[ 852 \cdot 15 = 12780 \]
\[ 3375 - 11700 + 12780 - 4320 = 3375 + 12780 - 11700 - 4320 = 16155 - 16020 = 135 \]

Try \( x = 18 \):
\[ 18^3 - 52 \cdot 18^2 + 852 \cdot 18 - 4320 \]
\[ 18^3 = 5832 \]
\[ 52 \cdot 18^2 = 52 \cdot 324 = 16848 \]
\[ 852 \cdot 18 = 15336 \]
\[ 5832 - 16848 + 15336 - 4320 = 5832 + 15336 - 16848 - 4320 = 21168 - 21168 = 0 \]

So, \( x = 18 \) is a root. Use synthetic division to factor:
\[ x^3 - 52x^2 + 852x - 4320 \div (x - 18) \]
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
18 & 1 & -52 & 852 & -4320 \\
   &   & 18  & -612 & 4320  \\
\hline
   & 1 & -34 & 240  & 0     \\
\end{array}
\]
Quotient: \( x^2 - 34x + 240 \).

Solve:
\[ x^2 - 34x + 240 = 0 \]
\[ x = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{34^2 - 4 \cdot 240}}{2} = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{1156 - 960}}{2} = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{196}}{2} = \frac{34 \pm 14}{2} \]
\[ x = 24, \quad x = 10 \]

So, the dimensions are \( l = 18 \), \( w = 24 \), \( h = 10 \) (or permutations).

Verify:
- Sum: \( 18 + 24 + 10 = 52 \)
- Pairwise products: \( 18 \cdot 24 + 18 \cdot 10 + 24 \cdot 10 = 432 + 180 + 240 = 852 \)
- Product: \( 18 \cdot 24 \cdot 10 = 432 \cdot 10 = 4320 \)

All equations are satisfied. The dimensions are valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the volume of the box after increasing each dimension by 1 inch.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the original dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \). (*Completed*)
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the new dimensions: \( l + 1 \), \( w + 1 \), \( h + 1 \).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the new volume: \( (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) \).

**Current Goal**: Compute the new dimensions and calculate the new volume.

**Summary**: The original dimensions are \( l = 18 \), \( w = 24 \), \( h = 10 \), found by solving the system of equations derived from the volume, surface area, and edge sum.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the new dimensions and calculate the new volume. Using the dimensions \( l = 18 \), \( w = 24 \), \( h = 10 \), compute \( l + 1 = 19 \), \( w + 1 = 25 \), \( h + 1 = 11 \), and then calculate \( 19 \cdot 25 \cdot 11 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
New dimensions:
- \( l + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 \)
- \( w + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \)
- \( h + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

New volume:
\[ (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) = 19 \cdot 25 \cdot 11 \]
\[ 19 \cdot 25 = 475 \]
\[ 475 \cdot 11 = 475 \cdot 10 + 475 = 4750 + 475 = 5225 \]

The new volume is 5225 cubic inches.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the new volume calculation. Verify the computation of \( 19 \cdot 25 \cdot 11 = 5225 \) and ensure it aligns with the problem’s requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
\[ 19 \cdot 25 = 475 \]
\[ 475 \cdot 11 = 475 \cdot (10 + 1) = 4750 + 475 = 5225 \]

The calculation is consistent. To further validate, consider the increase in volume. The volume expansion is:
\[ (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) = lwh + lw + lh + wh + l + w + h + 1 \]
Using known values:
- \( lwh = 4320 \)
- \( lw = 18 \cdot 24 = 432 \)
- \( lh = 18 \cdot 10 = 180 \)
- \( wh = 24 \cdot 10 = 240 \)
- \( l + w + h = 52 \)
- Constant: 1

\[ 4320 + 432 + 180 + 240 + 52 + 1 = 4320 + 852 + 52 + 1 = 5225 \]

The alternative method confirms the new volume is 5225 cubic inches.

### Final Answer
The volume of the box after increasing each dimension by 1 inch is **5225 cubic inches**.
