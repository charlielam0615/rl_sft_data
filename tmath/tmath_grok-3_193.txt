**Problem Statement**: Expand the expression \( 16(2x + 5) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of expanding \( 16(2x + 5) \), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Apply the distributive property to multiply 16 by each term inside the parentheses.  
2. Simplify the resulting terms.  
3. Combine the terms into a final expanded expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the distributive property to \( 16(2x + 5) \). This involves multiplying 16 by \( 2x \) and 16 by 5 separately.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the distributive property, \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \):  
- Multiply 16 by \( 2x \): \( 16 \cdot 2x = 32x \).  
- Multiply 16 by 5: \( 16 \cdot 5 = 80 \).  
The expression becomes \( 32x + 80 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the expanded expression \( 32x + 80 \) is correct by checking the distributive property application and simplifying the terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Recompute: \( 16(2x + 5) = 16 \cdot 2x + 16 \cdot 5 = 32x + 80 \).  
- Check by substituting a value, e.g., \( x = 1 \):  
  - Original: \( 16(2 \cdot 1 + 5) = 16(2 + 5) = 16 \cdot 7 = 112 \).  
  - Expanded: \( 32 \cdot 1 + 80 = 32 + 80 = 112 \).  
The results match, confirming the expansion is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Expand \( 16(2x + 5) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the distributive property (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the expansion (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: The expansion is complete, and the result is \( 32x + 80 \). No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The expanded expression is \( 32x + 80 \).
