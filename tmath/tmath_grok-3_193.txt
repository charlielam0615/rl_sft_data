**Problem Statement**: Expand the expression \( 16(2x + 5) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of expanding \( 16(2x + 5) \) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Apply the distributive property to multiply 16 by each term inside the parentheses.
2. Simplify the resulting expression by performing the multiplications.
3. Combine any like terms if present.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Apply the distributive property to multiply 16 by each term in \( (2x + 5) \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the distributive property, \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \), where \( a = 16 \), \( b = 2x \), and \( c = 5 \). Multiply 16 by \( 2x \) and 16 by 5 separately.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute 16 to each term:
- \( 16 \cdot 2x = 32x \)
- \( 16 \cdot 5 = 80 \)

The expression becomes \( 32x + 80 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the expanded expression \( 32x + 80 \).

**How to Achieve**: Check the expansion by substituting a value for \( x \) and comparing the original and expanded expressions. Use \( x = 1 \) for simplicity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Original expression: \( 16(2x + 5) \)
  - For \( x = 1 \): \( 16(2 \cdot 1 + 5) = 16(2 + 5) = 16 \cdot 7 = 112 \)
- Expanded expression: \( 32x + 80 \)
  - For \( x = 1 \): \( 32 \cdot 1 + 80 = 32 + 80 = 112 \)

Both expressions yield 112, confirming the expansion is correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Expand \( 16(2x + 5) \)
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the distributive property (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting expression (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the expansion (completed in Step 3).

**Current Goal**: The expansion is complete, and verification confirms \( 32x + 80 \) as the correct result. No further subgoals are needed.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The expanded expression is \( 32x + 80 \).
