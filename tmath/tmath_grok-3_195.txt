**Problem Statement**: The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. We need to find the maximum possible area of the rectangle in square inches.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the maximum area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 24 inches into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the area of the rectangle in terms of its dimensions.  
2. Use the perimeter constraint to relate the dimensions.  
3. Optimize the area by finding the dimensions that yield the maximum value.  
4. Calculate the maximum area in square inches.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the area of the rectangle and use the perimeter constraint to set up an equation. Define the rectangle’s length (L) and width (W), use the perimeter formula 2L + 2W = 24 to relate L and W, and express the area A = L * W in terms of one variable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the length of the rectangle be L inches and the width be W inches. The perimeter is given as:  
2L + 2W = 24  
Simplify:  
L + W = 12  
Solve for L:  
L = 12 - W  
The area of the rectangle is:  
A = L * W  
Substitute L = 12 - W into the area formula:  
A = (12 - W) * W = 12W - W²  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maximize the area A = 12W - W². Since this is a quadratic function in W, find the vertex of the parabola to determine the value of W that maximizes the area, then compute the corresponding L and A.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The area function is A = 12W - W², which can be rewritten as:  
A = -W² + 12W  
This is a quadratic function in the form A = aW² + bW + c, where a = -1, b = 12, and c = 0. Since a < 0, the parabola opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex. The W-coordinate of the vertex is given by:  
W = -b / (2a) = -12 / (2 * -1) = 12 / 2 = 6  
When W = 6 inches, calculate L:  
L = 12 - W = 12 - 6 = 6 inches  
Now, compute the area:  
A = L * W = 6 * 6 = 36 square inches  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that W = 6 and L = 6 yield the maximum area by checking the perimeter constraint and considering alternative dimensions to confirm the area is maximized.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the perimeter:  
2L + 2W = 2 * 6 + 2 * 6 = 12 + 12 = 24 inches  
The perimeter satisfies the constraint. To confirm the area is maximized, test other dimensions:  
- If W = 5, then L = 12 - 5 = 7, so A = 5 * 7 = 35 square inches.  
- If W = 4, then L = 12 - 4 = 8, so A = 4 * 8 = 32 square inches.  
- If W = 2, then L = 12 - 2 = 10, so A = 2 * 10 = 20 square inches.  
The area A = 36 square inches when L = W = 6 is larger than these alternatives. Additionally, since the area function A = -W² + 12W is a downward-opening parabola, the vertex at W = 6 gives the maximum.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
