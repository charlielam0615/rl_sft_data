**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 24 inches, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the area of the rectangle in terms of its dimensions.  
2. Use the perimeter constraint to relate the dimensions.  
3. Optimize the area by finding the dimensions that maximize it.  
4. Calculate the maximum area in square inches.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the area of the rectangle and use the perimeter constraint to set up the optimization problem.  
How to Achieve: Define the rectangle’s length (L) and width (W). Use the perimeter formula 2L + 2W = 24 to express one dimension in terms of the other, and write the area formula A = L * W as a function of one variable for optimization.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the length of the rectangle be L inches and the width be W inches. The perimeter is given as 24 inches, so:  
2L + 2W = 24  
Divide through by 2:  
L + W = 12  
Solve for W in terms of L:  
W = 12 - L  

The area A of the rectangle is:  
A = L * W = L * (12 - L) = 12L - L²  

This area function A(L) = 12L - L² needs to be maximized, where L is the length in inches.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Maximize the area function A(L) = 12L - L².  
How to Achieve: Since A(L) is a quadratic function, find its maximum by determining the vertex of the parabola. This can be done by finding the critical point using calculus (taking the derivative and setting it to zero) or by recognizing the vertex of a quadratic function.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area function is A(L) = 12L - L², which is a quadratic function in the form A(L) = -L² + 12L. Since the coefficient of L² is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex.  

For a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -1, b = 12, so:  
L = -b/(2a) = -12/(2 * -1) = 12/2 = 6  

Thus, L = 6 inches. Substitute into the perimeter constraint to find W:  
W = 12 - L = 12 - 6 = 6 inches  

The dimensions that maximize the area are L = 6 inches and W = 6 inches, indicating a square.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that L = 6 and W = 6 yield the maximum area and satisfy the perimeter constraint.  
How to Achieve: Check the perimeter with these dimensions and calculate the area. Optionally, test other dimensions to confirm the area is maximized at L = W = 6.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the perimeter:  
2L + 2W = 2 * 6 + 2 * 6 = 12 + 12 = 24 inches  
The perimeter constraint is satisfied.  

Calculate the area:  
A = L * W = 6 * 6 = 36 square inches  

To confirm this is the maximum, test other dimensions, e.g., L = 8, W = 12 - 8 = 4:  
Perimeter: 2 * 8 + 2 * 4 = 16 + 8 = 24 inches (satisfied)  
Area: 8 * 4 = 32 square inches  

Try L = 4, W = 12 - 4 = 8:  
Area: 4 * 8 = 32 square inches  

The area at L = 6, W = 6 (36 square inches) is larger than at other dimensions, confirming the maximum.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 24 inches.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the area in terms of the dimensions (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the perimeter constraint to relate dimensions (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Optimize the area function (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate and verify the maximum area (completed in Step 4).  

Current Goal: Conclude the solution by stating the maximum area.  

The dimensions L = 6 inches and W = 6 inches yield an area of 36 square inches, which has been verified as the maximum.
