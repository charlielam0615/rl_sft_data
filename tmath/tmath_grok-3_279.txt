**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of integers between -12.1 and 3.3:  
1. Identify the range of integers by determining the nearest integers to -12.1 and 3.3.  
2. List all integers within this range.  
3. Calculate the sum of these integers.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the range of integers by determining the nearest integers to -12.1 and 3.3. This will be achieved by rounding -12.1 up to the nearest integer and 3.3 down to the nearest integer to define the inclusive range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the range of integers:  
- The number -12.1 is between -13 and -12. Rounding up (ceiling) gives -12.  
- The number 3.3 is between 3 and 4. Rounding down (floor) gives 3.  
Thus, the integers between -12.1 and 3.3, inclusive of the bounds, are from -12 to 3.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to list all integers within the range from -12 to 3 and calculate their sum. This will be achieved by identifying the sequence of integers and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The integers from -12 to 3 (inclusive) are: -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.  
Count the numbers:  
- First term, \( a_1 = -12 \), last term, \( a_n = 3 \).  
- Number of terms: \( n = 3 - (-12) + 1 = 16 \).  
Sum of an arithmetic series: \( S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \).  
Calculate: \( S = \frac{16}{2} \cdot (-12 + 3) = 8 \cdot (-9) = -72 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the sum by recalculating it using an alternative method, such as direct addition of the integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
List the integers: -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.  
Sum them directly:  
- Negative terms: -12 + (-11) + (-10) + (-9) + (-8) + (-7) + (-6) + (-5) + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) = -78.  
- Non-negative terms: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  
- Total: -78 + 6 = -72.  
This matches the result from the arithmetic series formula, confirming the sum is -72.
