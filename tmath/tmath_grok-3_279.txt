**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3. Since -12.1 and 3.3 are not integers, we interpret this as the sum of all integers from the ceiling of -12.1 (i.e., -12) to the floor of 3.3 (i.e., 3).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the range of integers between -12.1 and 3.3.  
2. Determine the sequence of integers in this range.  
3. Calculate the sum of these integers.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the range of integers between -12.1 and 3.3.  
How to Achieve: Determine the ceiling of -12.1 and the floor of 3.3 to find the inclusive range of integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The ceiling of -12.1 is -12 (the smallest integer greater than or equal to -12.1). The floor of 3.3 is 3 (the largest integer less than or equal to 3.3). Thus, the integers in the range are from -12 to 3, inclusive.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the sequence of integers in the range from -12 to 3.  
How to Achieve: List all integers from -12 to 3 and confirm the count of terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence of integers from -12 to 3 is: -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.  
To find the number of terms, use the formula for the count of integers in a range [a, b]:  
Number of terms = b - a + 1 = 3 - (-12) + 1 = 3 + 12 + 1 = 16.  
There are 16 integers in the sequence.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the integers from -12 to 3.  
How to Achieve: Use the arithmetic series sum formula for the sequence of integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence is an arithmetic series with:  
- First term (a₁) = -12  
- Last term (aₙ) = 3  
- Number of terms (n) = 16  
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:  
Sum = n * (a₁ + aₙ) / 2  
Sum = 16 * (-12 + 3) / 2 = 16 * (-9) / 2 = 16 * -4.5 = -72.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the sum of the integers from -12 to 3.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the sum using an alternative method (e.g., pairing terms) to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pair the terms from the sequence: (-12 + 3), (-11 + 2), (-10 + 1), (-9 + 0), (-8 + -1), (-7 + -2), (-6 + -3), (-5 + -4).  
Each pair sums to: -12 + 3 = -9, -11 + 2 = -9, etc.  
There are 8 pairs (since 16 terms / 2 = 8), and each pair sums to -9.  
Total sum = 8 * -9 = -72.  
This matches the previous result, confirming the sum is -72.  
[/IMP]
