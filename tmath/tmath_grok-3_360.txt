### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the interest earned by Jose and Patricia on their $50,000 investments over 2 years at a 4% annual interest rate. Jose’s investment is compounded yearly, while Patricia’s is compounded quarterly. Then, we find the difference in their interest earned, rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the final amount for Jose’s investment with yearly compounding.  
2. Calculate the final amount for Patricia’s investment with quarterly compounding.  
3. Compute the interest earned by each (final amount minus initial investment).  
4. Find the difference in interest earned and round to the nearest dollar.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Jose’s final amount using the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.04 \), \( n = 1 \) (yearly compounding), and \( t = 2 \). Apply the formula to find the amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 50,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 2} = 50,000 \left(1.04\right)^2 \)  
Calculate \( 1.04^2 = 1.0816 \).  
\( A = 50,000 \cdot 1.0816 = 54,080 \).  
Jose’s final amount is $54,080.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Patricia’s final amount using the compound interest formula, where \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.04 \), \( n = 4 \) (quarterly compounding), and \( t = 2 \). Apply the formula to find the amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 50,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 2} = 50,000 \left(1 + 0.01\right)^8 = 50,000 \cdot 1.01^8 \)  
Calculate \( 1.01^8 \):  
\( 1.01^2 = 1.0201 \), \( 1.01^4 = 1.0201^2 \approx 1.04060401 \), \( 1.01^8 = 1.04060401^2 \approx 1.0828569984 \).  
\( A = 50,000 \cdot 1.0828569984 \approx 54,142.84992 \).  
Patricia’s final amount is approximately $54,142.85.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the interest earned by Jose and Patricia, then find the difference. Subtract the initial investment ($50,000) from each final amount to get the interest, compute the difference, and round to the nearest dollar.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Jose’s interest: \( 54,080 - 50,000 = 4,080 \).  
Patricia’s interest: \( 54,142.85 - 50,000 = 4,142.85 \).  
Difference: \( 4,142.85 - 4,080 = 62.85 \).  
Rounded to the nearest dollar: \( 62.85 \approx 63 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations by checking the compound interest formulas and ensuring the difference is reasonable. Recalculate key steps briefly to confirm accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck Jose: \( 1.04^2 = 1.0816 \), \( 50,000 \cdot 1.0816 = 54,080 \). Interest: \( 54,080 - 50,000 = 4,080 \). Correct.  
Recheck Patricia: \( 1.01^8 \approx 1.0828569984 \), \( 50,000 \cdot 1.0828569984 \approx 54,142.85 \). Interest: \( 54,142.85 - 50,000 = 4,142.85 \). Correct.  
Difference: \( 4,142.85 - 4,080 = 62.85 \), rounds to $63. Correct.  
The results are consistent, and quarterly compounding yielding slightly more interest aligns with expectations.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate how much more interest Patricia earned than Jose, rounded to the nearest dollar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Jose’s final amount (completed: $54,080).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Patricia’s final amount (completed: $54,142.85).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute interest earned by each and find the difference (completed: $63).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate calculations (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Review goal completion; the main goal is achieved with a final answer of $63.

### Final Answer
Patricia’s investment earned $63 more than Jose’s, to the nearest dollar.
