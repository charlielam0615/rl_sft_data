### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the difference in earnings between two investments of $50,000 over 2 years at a 4% annual interest rate, where Jose’s investment is compounded yearly and Patricia’s is compounded quarterly. The result should be rounded to the nearest dollar.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the final amount for Jose’s investment using yearly compounding.  
2. Calculate the final amount for Patricia’s investment using quarterly compounding.  
3. Compute the interest earned by each investment (final amount minus initial investment).  
4. Find the difference in interest earned (Patricia’s interest minus Jose’s interest).  
5. Round the difference to the nearest dollar.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the final amount for Jose’s investment, compounded yearly. Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.04 \), \( n = 1 \) (yearly compounding), and \( t = 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 50,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 2} = 50,000 \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2 = 50,000 \cdot 1.04^2 \)  
Calculate \( 1.04^2 = 1.0816 \).  
\( A = 50,000 \cdot 1.0816 = 54,080 \).  
Jose’s final amount is $54,080.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the final amount for Patricia’s investment, compounded quarterly. Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.04 \), \( n = 4 \) (quarterly compounding), and \( t = 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 50,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 2} = 50,000 \left(1 + 0.01\right)^8 = 50,000 \cdot 1.01^8 \)  
Calculate \( 1.01^8 \):  
\( 1.01^2 = 1.0201 \), \( 1.01^4 = 1.0201^2 \approx 1.04060401 \), \( 1.01^8 = 1.04060401^2 \approx 1.0828569984 \).  
\( A = 50,000 \cdot 1.0828569984 \approx 54,142.84992 \).  
Patricia’s final amount is approximately $54,142.85.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the interest earned by each investment. Subtract the initial investment ($50,000) from each final amount to find the interest earned by Jose and Patricia.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Jose’s interest: \( 54,080 - 50,000 = 4,080 \).  
Patricia’s interest: \( 54,142.85 - 50,000 = 4,142.85 \).  
Jose earned $4,080 in interest, and Patricia earned approximately $4,142.85.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the difference in interest earned (Patricia’s interest minus Jose’s interest) and round to the nearest dollar.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Difference in interest: \( 4,142.85 - 4,080 = 62.85 \).  
Round 62.85 to the nearest dollar: Since 0.85 > 0.5, round up to 63.  
The difference is $63.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by checking the compound interest formulas and the rounding step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute key steps for accuracy:  
- Jose: \( 1.04^2 = 1.0816 \), \( 50,000 \cdot 1.0816 = 54,080 \), interest = \( 54,080 - 50,000 = 4,080 \). Correct.  
- Patricia: \( 1.01^8 \approx 1.0828569984 \), \( 50,000 \cdot 1.0828569984 \approx 54,142.85 \), interest = \( 54,142.85 - 50,000 = 4,142.85 \). Correct.  
- Difference: \( 4,142.85 - 4,080 = 62.85 \). Rounding 62.85 gives 63 (since 0.85 > 0.5). Correct.  
The calculations are valid.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate how much more money Patricia’s investment earned than Jose’s, rounded to the nearest dollar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Jose’s final amount (completed: $54,080).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate Patricia’s final amount (completed: $54,142.85).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute interest earned by each (completed: Jose $4,080, Patricia $4,142.85).  
  - Subgoal 4: Find the difference in interest (completed: $62.85).  
  - Subgoal 5: Round the difference to the nearest dollar (completed: $63).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate calculations (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to ensure all subgoals are completed. All subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved with a difference of $63.

### Final Answer
Patricia’s investment earned $63 more than Jose’s, to the nearest dollar.
