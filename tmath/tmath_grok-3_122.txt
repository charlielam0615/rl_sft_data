**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) for \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator.  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve for \(x\).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid and does not make the denominator zero.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to eliminate the fraction in \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\). Achieve this by multiplying both sides by the denominator \(x-2\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Multiply both sides of \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) by \(x-2\):  
\[
(x-2) \cdot \frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3 \cdot (x-2)
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
x + 4 = 3(x - 2)
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \(x + 4 = 3(x - 2)\). Achieve this by distributing and solving for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Distribute the right-hand side:  
\[
x + 4 = 3x - 6
\]  
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:  
\[
4 = 2x - 6
\]  
Add 6 to both sides:  
\[
10 = 2x
\]  
Divide by 2:  
\[
x = 5
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(x = 5\) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking if the denominator is non-zero.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 5\) into \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\):  
\[
\frac{5 + 4}{5 - 2} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
\]  
The left-hand side equals 3, matching the right-hand side. Check the denominator: \(x - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3\), which is non-zero. The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) for \(x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the fraction (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \(x\) (completed, \(x = 5\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed, solution valid).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the solution \(x = 5\) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 5\)
