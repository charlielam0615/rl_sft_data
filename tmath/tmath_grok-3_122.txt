**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) for \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator.  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve for \(x\).  
4. Validate the solution by checking for restrictions and substituting back.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the fraction in \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\).  
How to Achieve: Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator \(x-2\) to clear the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\)  
Multiply both sides by \(x-2\):  
\(\frac{x+4}{x-2} \cdot (x-2) = 3 \cdot (x-2)\)  
This simplifies to:  
\(x + 4 = 3(x - 2)\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation \(x + 4 = 3(x - 2)\).  
How to Achieve: Distribute the right-hand side, combine like terms, and isolate \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\(x + 4 = 3(x - 2)\)  
Distribute:  
\(x + 4 = 3x - 6\)  
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:  
\(4 = 2x - 6\)  
Add 6 to both sides:  
\(10 = 2x\)  
Divide by 2:  
\(x = 5\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the solution \(x = 5\).  
How to Achieve: Check for restrictions (denominator cannot be zero) and substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check restrictions: The denominator \(x - 2 \neq 0\), so \(x \neq 2\). Since \(x = 5 \neq 2\), it is not restricted.  
Substitute \(x = 5\) into the original equation:  
\(\frac{x + 4}{x - 2} = \frac{5 + 4}{5 - 2} = \frac{9}{3} = 3\)  
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side (3 = 3), so the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \(\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3\) for \(x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the fraction (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \(x\) (completed, \(x = 5\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution \(x = 5\) has been reached and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 5\)
