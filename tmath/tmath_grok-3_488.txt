### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Understand the condition for a quadratic equation to have at least one real root.
2. Apply this condition to the given quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 \).
3. Solve for the possible values of \( b \).
4. Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 \) to have at least one real root.

**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the condition for at least one real root is that the discriminant must be non-negative (\( \Delta \geq 0 \)). Identify the coefficients of the quadratic, compute the discriminant, and set up the inequality to find \( b \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 \), the coefficients are:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = b \)
- \( c = 16 \)

The discriminant is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = b^2 - 64
\]

For the quadratic to have at least one real root, we need:
\[
b^2 - 64 \geq 0
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality \( b^2 - 64 \geq 0 \) to find all possible values of \( b \).

**How to Achieve**: Solve the inequality by isolating \( b \) and determining the values that satisfy it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve:
\[
b^2 - 64 \geq 0
\]
\[
b^2 \geq 64
\]
\[
|b| \geq 8
\]
\[
b \leq -8 \quad \text{or} \quad b \geq 8
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
(-\infty, -8] \cup [8, \infty)
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that the solution \( b \leq -8 \) or \( b \geq 8 \) ensures at least one real root and that no other values of \( b \) satisfy the condition.

**How to Achieve**: Test boundary values and points within and outside the intervals to confirm the discriminant condition and check the number of real roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Boundary case**: \( b = 8 \)
  \[
  \Delta = 8^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0
  \]
  Discriminant is zero, indicating exactly one real root (repeated root). The quadratic is:
  \[
  x^2 + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)^2 = 0
  \]
  Root: \( x = -4 \) (one real root).

- **Boundary case**: \( b = -8 \)
  \[
  \Delta = (-8)^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0
  \]
  Discriminant is zero, indicating one real root. The quadratic is:
  \[
  x^2 - 8x + 16 = (x - 4)^2 = 0
  \]
  Root: \( x = 4 \) (one real root).

- **Inside interval**: \( b = 10 \)
  \[
  \Delta = 10^2 - 64 = 100 - 64 = 36 > 0
  \]
  Positive discriminant indicates two distinct real roots.

- **Outside interval**: \( b = 0 \)
  \[
  \Delta = 0^2 - 64 = -64 < 0
  \]
  Negative discriminant indicates no real roots.

The solution \( b \leq -8 \) or \( b \geq 8 \) correctly identifies all values where the discriminant is non-negative, ensuring at least one real root.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find all possible values of \( b \) such that \( x^2 + bx + 16 \) has at least one real root, expressed in interval notation.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for at least one real root (\( \Delta \geq 0 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the discriminant for \( x^2 + bx + 16 \).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the inequality \( b^2 - 64 \geq 0 \).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.
  - Subgoal 5: Express the solution in interval notation.

**Current Goal**: Express the final solution in interval notation.

The solution from Step 3, validated in Step 4, is \( (-\infty, -8] \cup [8, \infty) \).

### Final Answer
The possible values of \( b \) for which \( x^2 + bx + 16 \) has at least one real root are:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, -8] \cup [8, \infty)}
\]
