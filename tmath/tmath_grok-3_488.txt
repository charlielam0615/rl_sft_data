**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all possible values of \( b \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 + bx + 16 = 0 \) has at least one real root. The answer should be expressed in interval notation.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for a quadratic equation to have at least one real root.  
2. Apply this condition to the given quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 = 0 \).  
3. Solve for the possible values of \( b \).  
4. Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for a quadratic equation to have at least one real root. This involves analyzing the discriminant of the quadratic equation, as the discriminant determines the nature of the roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is given by \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). The quadratic has at least one real root if \( \Delta \geq 0 \), meaning the discriminant is non-negative (zero for one real root, positive for two real roots).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the discriminant condition to the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 = 0 \) and find the values of \( b \) that satisfy it. This involves computing the discriminant and solving the resulting inequality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 16 = 0 \), identify the coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = b \), and \( c = 16 \). The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = b^2 - 64 \]  
For at least one real root, we need:  
\[ b^2 - 64 \geq 0 \]  
Solving this inequality:  
\[ b^2 \geq 64 \]  
\[ |b| \geq 8 \]  
This implies:  
\[ b \geq 8 \quad \text{or} \quad b \leq -8 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( b \geq 8 \) or \( b \leq -8 \) by checking if it correctly ensures at least one real root. This involves testing boundary cases and confirming the discriminant behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test boundary cases:  
- If \( b = 8 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 8^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant is zero, indicating one real root. The quadratic is \( x^2 + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)^2 = 0 \), with a double root at \( x = -4 \).  
- If \( b = -8 \):  
  \[ \Delta = (-8)^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant is zero, indicating one real root. The quadratic is \( x^2 - 8x + 16 = (x - 4)^2 = 0 \), with a double root at \( x = 4 \).  
- If \( b = 9 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 9^2 - 64 = 81 - 64 = 17 > 0 \]  
  Positive discriminant indicates two real roots.  
- If \( b = 0 \):  
  \[ \Delta = 0^2 - 64 = -64 < 0 \]  
  Negative discriminant indicates no real roots.  
These tests confirm that \( b \geq 8 \) or \( b \leq -8 \) correctly identifies when the quadratic has at least one real root.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find all possible values of \( b \) such that \( x^2 + bx + 16 \) has at least one real root, expressed in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for at least one real root (completed: discriminant \( \Delta \geq 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the condition to compute \( b \) (completed: solved \( b^2 - 64 \geq 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: tested boundary and non-boundary cases).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the solution in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution \( b \geq 8 \) or \( b \leq -8 \) in interval notation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the solution \( b \geq 8 \) or \( b \leq -8 \) in interval notation, ensuring the format is mathematically correct and concise.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solution \( b \geq 8 \) or \( b \leq -8 \) corresponds to the intervals:  
\[ (-\infty, -8] \cup [8, \infty) \]  
This represents all values of \( b \) such that \( b \leq -8 \) or \( b \geq 8 \).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The possible values of \( b \) for which \( x^2 + bx + 16 \) has at least one real root are:  
\[ (-\infty, -8] \cup [8, \infty) \]
