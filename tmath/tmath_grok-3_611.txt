### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of possible starting lineups of 5 players for the Screamers, a team with 12 players, where two specific players, Bob and Yogi, cannot both be included in the lineup. The order of players in the lineup does not matter, so we are counting combinations of 5 players.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of possible lineups of 5 players from 12 without any restrictions.
2. Identify the number of lineups that include both Bob and Yogi.
3. Subtract the number of lineups with both Bob and Yogi from the total to get the number of valid lineups where Bob and Yogi are not both included.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of possible lineups of 5 players from 12 without restrictions.
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 12 \) and \( k = 5 \), to compute the number of ways to choose 5 players from 12.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \( C(12, 5) \):
\[
C(12, 5) = \frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = \frac{12!}{5! \cdot 7!} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
12 \cdot 11 = 132, \quad 132 \cdot 10 = 1320, \quad 1320 \cdot 9 = 11880, \quad 11880 \cdot 8 = 95040
\]
Calculate the denominator:
\[
5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120
\]
Divide:
\[
\frac{95040}{120} = 792
\]
So, there are 792 possible lineups without restrictions.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of lineups that include both Bob and Yogi.
How to Achieve: If Bob and Yogi are both in the lineup, we fix 2 of the 5 positions with Bob and Yogi and choose the remaining 3 players from the other 10 players (12 total minus Bob and Yogi). Use the combination formula \( C(10, 3) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \( C(10, 3) \):
\[
C(10, 3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{3! \cdot 7!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
10 \cdot 9 = 90, \quad 90 \cdot 8 = 720
\]
Calculate the denominator:
\[
3! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6
\]
Divide:
\[
\frac{720}{6} = 120
\]
So, there are 120 lineups that include both Bob and Yogi.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of valid lineups where Bob and Yogi are not both included.
How to Achieve: Subtract the number of lineups with both Bob and Yogi (from Step 3) from the total number of lineups (from Step 2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total lineups (from Step 2): 792
Lineups with both Bob and Yogi (from Step 3): 120
Valid lineups:
\[
792 - 120 = 672
\]
So, there are 672 valid lineups where Bob and Yogi are not both included.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the solution.
How to Achieve: Use an alternative approach to confirm the result. Consider choosing lineups where either Bob is included but not Yogi, or Yogi is included but not Bob, or neither is included, and sum these cases.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach:
- **Case 1: Bob is in the lineup, Yogi is not.**
  - Choose Bob (1 way), then choose 4 more players from the remaining 10 players (excluding Yogi): \( C(10, 4) \).
  - Compute:
    \[
    C(10, 4) = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210
    \]
  - Total for this case: \( 1 \cdot 210 = 210 \).
- **Case 2: Yogi is in the lineup, Bob is not.**
  - Choose Yogi (1 way), then choose 4 more players from the remaining 10 players (excluding Bob): \( C(10, 4) = 210 \).
  - Total for this case: \( 1 \cdot 210 = 210 \).
- **Case 3: Neither Bob nor Yogi is in the lineup.**
  - Choose 5 players from the remaining 10 players (excluding both Bob and Yogi): \( C(10, 5) \).
  - Compute:
    \[
    C(10, 5) = \frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{30240}{120} = 252
    \]
  - Total for this case: 252.
- Sum the cases:
  \[
  210 + 210 + 252 = 672
  \]
The alternative approach yields 672, matching the previous result, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 6: Track Goals

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of starting lineups of 5 players where Bob and Yogi are not both included.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total lineups without restrictions (completed: 792).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate lineups with both Bob and Yogi (completed: 120).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract to find valid lineups (completed: 672).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution using an alternative approach (completed: 672).
Current Goal: None (problem solved).
The final answer is 672 valid lineups.

### Final Answer
The number of starting lineups Coach Yellsalot can make, where Bob and Yogi are not both included, is 672.
