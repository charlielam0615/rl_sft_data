**Problem Statement**: Mackenzie has 142 feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden, with the side lengths being natural numbers (positive integers). We need to find the maximum area (in square feet) that can be enclosed by the fencing.

### Step 1: Define the goal and break it down
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the area of a rectangular garden given a perimeter of 142 feet, with side lengths as natural numbers. Break this into subgoals:  
1. Express the area and perimeter in terms of length and width.  
2. Identify constraints on the side lengths (natural numbers, perimeter).  
3. Find the combination of length and width that maximizes the area.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it meets all conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Set up the mathematical model
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to express the area and perimeter of the rectangle in terms of its length and width. We will use the perimeter formula to relate the sides and the area formula to maximize the enclosed space.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a rectangle with length \( l \) and width \( w \), both natural numbers:  
- Perimeter: \( 2l + 2w = 142 \), so \( l + w = 71 \).  
- Area: \( A = l \cdot w \).  
We need to maximize \( A = l \cdot w \) subject to \( l + w = 71 \), where \( l \) and \( w \) are positive integers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Analyze how to maximize the area
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To maximize the area \( A = l \cdot w \) with \( l + w = 71 \), we need to:  
1. Express the area in terms of one variable.  
2. Determine the possible values of \( l \) and \( w \) (natural numbers summing to 71).  
3. Identify the pair that yields the maximum area, considering that for a fixed perimeter, a rectangle’s area is maximized when it is closest to a square.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4: Express area and find possible values
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to express the area in terms of one variable and list possible pairs of \( l \) and \( w \). We will solve for \( w \) in terms of \( l \) using the perimeter constraint and compute the area.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( l + w = 71 \), we get \( w = 71 - l \).  
The area is:  
\[ A = l \cdot w = l \cdot (71 - l) = 71l - l^2. \]  
Since \( l \) and \( w \) are natural numbers, \( l \) ranges from 1 to 70 (if \( l = 71 \), then \( w = 0 \), which is not a valid side length for a rectangle). Thus, possible pairs \((l, w)\) are \((1, 70), (2, 69), \ldots, (35, 36), \ldots, (70, 1)\).  
To maximize \( A = 71l - l^2 \), we can either:  
- Evaluate \( A \) for each pair.  
- Use the fact that for a fixed perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when the shape is as close to a square as possible (i.e., \( l \approx w \)).  
Since \( l + w = 71 \), the closest to a square is when \( l \) and \( w \) are as equal as possible. For \( l + w = 71 \), try \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \):  
\[ A = 35 \cdot 36 = 1260. \]  
Try nearby values to confirm:  
- If \( l = 34 \), \( w = 37 \): \( A = 34 \cdot 37 = 1258 \).  
- If \( l = 36 \), \( w = 35 \): \( A = 36 \cdot 35 = 1260 \).  
- If \( l = 30 \), \( w = 41 \): \( A = 30 \cdot 41 = 1230 \).  
The pair \( (35, 36) \) or \( (36, 35) \) seems promising for maximum area.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Optimize using a mathematical approach
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to confirm the maximum area by treating the area function as a quadratic and finding its vertex, ensuring the solution aligns with natural number constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area function is \( A = 71l - l^2 \), or equivalently, \( A = -l^2 + 71l \). This is a quadratic function in \( l \), with a maximum at the vertex. For a quadratic \( A = al^2 + bl + c \), the vertex occurs at \( l = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \), \( b = 71 \), so:  
\[ l = -\frac{71}{2(-1)} = \frac{71}{2} = 35.5. \]  
Since \( l \) must be a natural number, test \( l = 35 \) and \( l = 36 \):  
- For \( l = 35 \), \( w = 71 - 35 = 36 \), \( A = 35 \cdot 36 = 1260 \).  
- For \( l = 36 \), \( w = 71 - 36 = 35 \), \( A = 36 \cdot 35 = 1260 \).  
The vertex at \( l = 35.5 \) suggests the maximum area occurs around \( l = 35 \) or \( 36 \). Since \( l = 35.5 \) is not an integer, the maximum integer values are indeed \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \) or vice versa, yielding \( A = 1260 \).

### Step 6: Review the goal hierarchy
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the maximum area of a rectangular garden with a 142-foot perimeter and natural number side lengths.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express area and perimeter mathematically (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify constraints (natural numbers, perimeter = 142) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Maximize the area by finding optimal \( l \) and \( w \) (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \) (or vice versa) gives the maximum area and verify it meets all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Verify the solution
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to verify that the area of 1260 square feet for \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \) is the maximum by checking the perimeter constraint and testing additional pairs to ensure no larger area exists.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the perimeter:  
\[ 2l + 2w = 2 \cdot 35 + 2 \cdot 36 = 70 + 72 = 142. \]  
The perimeter constraint is satisfied.  
Test additional pairs to confirm the maximum:  
- For \( l = 20 \), \( w = 51 \): \( A = 20 \cdot 51 = 1020 \).  
- For \( l = 40 \), \( w = 31 \): \( A = 40 \cdot 31 = 1240 \).  
- For \( l = 1 \), \( w = 70 \): \( A = 1 \cdot 70 = 70 \).  
The area decreases as \( l \) moves further from 35 or 36, confirming that \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \) (or vice versa) yields the maximum area of 1260 square feet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall information to ensure completeness
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure all constraints and calculations are correct by reviewing prior steps for consistency, particularly the perimeter constraint and natural number requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
- **Perimeter constraint**: From Step 2, the perimeter is \( 2l + 2w = 142 \), or \( l + w = 71 \), which was consistently applied.  
- **Natural number requirement**: From Step 4, we restricted \( l \) and \( w \) to natural numbers (1 to 70), ensuring all tested pairs (e.g., \( (35, 36) \)) are valid.  
- **Area maximization**: Steps 4 and 5 confirmed the maximum area occurs at \( l = 35 \), \( w = 36 \) or vice versa, with \( A = 1260 \), using both pair testing and the quadratic vertex method.  
- **Verification**: Step 7 validated the perimeter and tested other pairs, confirming 1260 square feet as the maximum.  
All steps align with the problem’s requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The maximum number of square feet that can be enclosed by 142 feet of fencing, with the garden’s side lengths as natural numbers, is **1260 square feet**, achieved when the sides are 35 feet and 36 feet.
