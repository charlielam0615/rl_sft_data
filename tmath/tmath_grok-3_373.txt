### Problem Restatement
Mackenzie has 142 feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden, with the side lengths being natural numbers (positive integers). We need to find the maximum area (in square feet) that can be enclosed by the fencing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the maximum area of a rectangular garden with a perimeter of 142 feet and natural number side lengths, break the problem into subgoals:
1. Define the relationship between the perimeter, side lengths, and area of the rectangle.
2. Express the area in terms of one variable using the perimeter constraint.
3. Determine the possible values for the side lengths, considering they are natural numbers.
4. Find the side lengths that maximize the area.
5. Calculate the maximum area.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to define the relationship between the perimeter, side lengths, and area. This will be achieved by setting up equations for the perimeter and area of the rectangle using variables for the length and width.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the length of the garden be \( L \) feet and the width be \( W \) feet, where \( L \) and \( W \) are natural numbers. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:
\[ 2L + 2W = 142 \]
Simplifying:
\[ L + W = 71 \]
The area of the rectangle is:
\[ A = L \cdot W \]
We need to maximize \( A \) subject to \( L + W = 71 \), with \( L \) and \( W \) being positive integers.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to express the area in terms of one variable using the perimeter constraint. This will be achieved by solving the perimeter equation for one variable and substituting it into the area formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the perimeter equation \( L + W = 71 \), solve for \( W \):
\[ W = 71 - L \]
Substitute \( W \) into the area formula:
\[ A = L \cdot W = L \cdot (71 - L) = 71L - L^2 \]
The area is now expressed as a quadratic function:
\[ A(L) = -L^2 + 71L \]
Since \( L \) and \( W \) are natural numbers, \( L \) must be an integer such that \( 1 \leq L \leq 70 \) (because \( W = 71 - L \geq 1 \)).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find the side lengths that maximize the area. This will be achieved by analyzing the quadratic function \( A(L) = -L^2 + 71L \) to find the integer value of \( L \) that yields the maximum area.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The area function \( A(L) = -L^2 + 71L \) is a quadratic equation in \( L \), with a negative leading coefficient (\(-1\)), so it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. For a quadratic function \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), the vertex is at:
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} \]
Here, \( a = -1 \), \( b = 71 \), and \( c = 0 \). Calculate the vertex:
\[ L = -\frac{71}{2 \cdot (-1)} = \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \]
Since \( L \) must be a natural number, evaluate the area at the integers closest to 35.5, i.e., \( L = 35 \) and \( L = 36 \).

For \( L = 35 \):
\[ W = 71 - 35 = 36 \]
\[ A = 35 \cdot 36 = 1260 \]

For \( L = 36 \):
\[ W = 71 - 36 = 35 \]
\[ A = 36 \cdot 35 = 1260 \]

Both yield the same area, suggesting symmetry around the vertex. To confirm, test values around these points, e.g., \( L = 34 \):
\[ W = 71 - 34 = 37 \]
\[ A = 34 \cdot 37 = 1258 \]

Since 1258 < 1260, the area decreases as we move away from \( L = 35 \) or 36.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate that \( L = 35 \), \( W = 36 \) (or vice versa) gives the maximum area. This will be achieved by checking the perimeter constraint and considering other possible integer pairs to ensure no larger area exists.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the perimeter for \( L = 35 \), \( W = 36 \):
\[ 2L + 2W = 2 \cdot 35 + 2 \cdot 36 = 70 + 72 = 142 \]
The perimeter constraint is satisfied.

To ensure maximality, consider the nature of the quadratic function \( A(L) = 71L - L^2 \). Since the vertex is at \( L = 35.5 \), and we’ve tested integers on either side, let’s try another pair farther from the vertex, e.g., \( L = 30 \):
\[ W = 71 - 30 = 41 \]
\[ A = 30 \cdot 41 = 1230 \]
Since 1230 < 1260, the area is smaller. The symmetry of the function and the integer constraint suggest \( L = 35 \), \( W = 36 \) (or \( L = 36 \), \( W = 35 \)) is optimal.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the maximum area using the optimal side lengths. This will be achieved by using the side lengths \( L = 35 \), \( W = 36 \) to compute the area and stating the final answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the optimal side lengths \( L = 35 \), \( W = 36 \):
\[ A = 35 \cdot 36 = 1260 \]
The maximum area that can be enclosed is 1260 square feet.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The maximum number of square feet that can be enclosed by the fencing is **1260 square feet**.
