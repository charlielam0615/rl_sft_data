**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to find the value of the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \) when \( x = -1 \). This involves substituting \( x = -1 \) into the function and computing the result.

**Step 1:**

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into a clear, forward-looking subgoal: substitute \( x = -1 \) into the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \) to compute the output. This will guide me to the solution in a structured way.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(-1) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -1 \) into the expression \( x^2 - 1 \), calculate the value of \( (-1)^2 \), and then subtract 1 from the result.

[IMP]  
Let's compute \( f(-1) \):  
\( f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \).  
So, the value of \( f(-1) \) is 0.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( f(-1) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \).  
Current Goal: Confirm the computation of \( f(-1) \) as completed with the result of 0.  
All goals are aligned, and the main goal has been achieved.
