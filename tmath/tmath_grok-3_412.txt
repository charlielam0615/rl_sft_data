**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( f(-1) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( f(-1) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \). To achieve this, substitute \( x = -1 \) into the function and evaluate the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find \( f(-1) \), substitute \( x = -1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \):  
\[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \( f(-1) = 0 \). This will be done by re-evaluating the substitution and checking the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute \( f(-1) \):  
\[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \]  
The arithmetic is correct, and the result matches the previous calculation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-management system:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(-1) \) for \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \).  
  - Subgoal: Substitute \( x = -1 \) into the function (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Verify the computation (completed).  
Current goal: None, as the main goal has been achieved and validated.  
The computed value is \( f(-1) = 0 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(-1) = 0 \)
