**Problem Statement**: Compute the value of \( 9! / 8! \) without using a calculator.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( 9! / 8! \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the definition of factorials and the expression \( 9! / 8! \).  
2. Simplify the expression using factorial properties.  
3. Compute the final result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \( 9! / 8! \). This can be achieved by applying the factorial property that \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \), which allows cancellation of common terms in the numerator and denominator.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \( 9! = 9 \times 8! \), the expression becomes:  
\[ \frac{9!}{8!} = \frac{9 \times 8!}{8!} \]  
The \( 8! \) terms cancel out, leaving:  
\[ \frac{9 \times 8!}{8!} = 9 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the simplification \( 9! / 8! = 9 \). This can be achieved by confirming the factorial property used and checking the cancellation logic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, recall that \( 9! = 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times \cdots \times 1 \) and \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times \cdots \times 1 \). Thus:  
\[ \frac{9!}{8!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times \cdots \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times \cdots \times 1} = 9 \]  
The cancellation of \( 8! \) is correct, confirming the result is 9.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( 9! / 8! \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand factorial definitions and the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression using factorial properties (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final result (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final result and conclude the solution.  
The result from the simplification and validation steps is 9.
