**Problem Statement**: Diana is 14 years old and three years younger than Eduardo. Eduardo is four years older than Chad. Faye is three years older than Chad. We need to determine Faye's age.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find Faye's age:  
1. Use Diana's age to find Eduardo's age.  
2. Use Eduardo's age to find Chad's age.  
3. Use Chad's age to find Faye's age.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find Eduardo's age. Since Diana is 14 years old and three years younger than Eduardo, we can calculate Eduardo's age by adding 3 years to Diana's age.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Diana's age is 14. Since she is three years younger than Eduardo, Eduardo's age is:  
14 + 3 = 17 years old.  

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find Chad's age. Since Eduardo is four years older than Chad, we can calculate Chad's age by subtracting 4 years from Eduardo's age.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Eduardo's age is 17. Since he is four years older than Chad, Chad's age is:  
17 - 4 = 13 years old.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find Faye's age. Since Faye is three years older than Chad, we can calculate Faye's age by adding 3 years to Chad's age.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Chad's age is 13. Since Faye is three years older than Chad, Faye's age is:  
13 + 3 = 16 years old.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated ages by checking if they satisfy all given relationships: Diana is 14, Diana is three years younger than Eduardo, Eduardo is four years older than Chad, and Faye is three years older than Chad.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Diana's age: 14 (given).  
- Eduardo's age: 17. Check: Diana (14) is three years younger than Eduardo (17), since 17 - 14 = 3. Valid.  
- Chad's age: 13. Check: Eduardo (17) is four years older than Chad (13), since 17 - 13 = 4. Valid.  
- Faye's age: 16. Check: Faye (16) is three years older than Chad (13), since 16 - 13 = 3. Valid.  
All relationships are satisfied.  

[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine Faye's age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find Eduardo's age (completed: 17).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find Chad's age (completed: 13).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find Faye's age (completed: 16).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate all ages (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
Faye's age is 16 years old.
