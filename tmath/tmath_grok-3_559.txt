Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find Faye's age:  
1. Determine Eduardo's age using Diana's age and their age relationship.  
2. Determine Chad's age using Eduardo's age and their age relationship.  
3. Determine Faye's age using Chad's age and their age relationship.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine Eduardo's age.  
How to Achieve: Diana is 14 years old and three years younger than Eduardo. Therefore, Eduardo's age is Diana's age plus 3 years.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Eduardo's age = Diana's age + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine Chad's age.  
How to Achieve: Eduardo is 17 years old and four years older than Chad. Therefore, Chad's age is Eduardo's age minus 4 years.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Chad's age = Eduardo's age - 4 = 17 - 4 = 13 years old.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine Faye's age.  
How to Achieve: Faye is three years older than Chad, who is 13 years old. Therefore, Faye's age is Chad's age plus 3 years.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Faye's age = Chad's age + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 years old.  

[/IMP]
