**Problem Restatement**: John needs to catch a train that arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00, waits for 20 minutes, and then leaves. John arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00. We need to calculate the probability that the train is still at the station when John arrives.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Model the train’s arrival and departure times.  
2. Model John’s arrival time.  
3. Define the condition for John catching the train (train is present when John arrives).  
4. Calculate the probability using a geometric or analytical approach.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Model the train’s and John’s arrival times.  
How to Achieve: Represent the time interval (2:00 to 3:00) as a 60-minute period (0 to 60 minutes). Assume the train arrives uniformly at time \( T \) (0 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 60), departs at \( T + 20 \), and John arrives uniformly at time \( J \) (0 ≤ \( J \) ≤ 60). Use these to set up the problem mathematically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the time interval from 2:00 to 3:00 be 60 minutes, starting at \( t = 0 \) (2:00) and ending at \( t = 60 \) (3:00).  
- Train’s arrival time \( T \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 60) \).  
- Train departs at \( T + 20 \).  
- John’s arrival time \( J \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 60) \).  
The train is present when \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \).  
Since \( T \) and \( J \) are independent, their joint probability density over the 60 × 60 minute interval is:  
\[ f(T, J) = \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60} = \frac{1}{3600} \] for \( 0 \leq T, J \leq 60 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the condition for John catching the train and calculate the probability.  
How to Achieve: The train is present if John arrives between the train’s arrival (\( T \)) and departure (\( T + 20 \)), i.e., \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \). Use a geometric approach by plotting \( T \) and \( J \) on a 60 × 60 square and find the area where the condition holds, then divide by the total area (3600).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Plot \( T \) (train arrival) on the x-axis and \( J \) (John’s arrival) on the y-axis over a 60 × 60 square. The train is present if:  
\[ T \leq J \leq T + 20 \]  
This region is bounded by:  
- \( J \geq T \) (John arrives after or when the train arrives).  
- \( J \leq T + 20 \) (John arrives before or when the train departs).  
- \( 0 \leq T, J \leq 60 \).  

The total area of the square is \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \).  
The favorable region is where \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \). To find this area:  
- The line \( J = T \) represents John arriving when the train arrives.  
- The line \( J = T + 20 \) represents John arriving when the train departs.  
- The region is a strip between \( J = T \) and \( J = T + 20 \), clipped by \( 0 \leq T, J \leq 60 \).  

Calculate the area:  
- For \( 0 \leq T \leq 40 \), \( J \) ranges from \( T \) to \( T + 20 \), and the difference is 20 minutes. The area is:  
  \[ \int_0^{40} 20 \, dT = 20 \cdot 40 = 800. \]  
- For \( 40 < T \leq 60 \), \( J \) ranges from \( T \) to 60 (since \( T + 20 > 60 \)). The length of \( J \) is \( 60 - T \). The area is:  
  \[ \int_{40}^{60} (60 - T) \, dT = \int_{40}^{60} 60 \, dT - \int_{40}^{60} T \, dT = [60T]_{40}^{60} - \left[\frac{T^2}{2}\right]_{40}^{60} = (3600 - 2400) - \left(\frac{3600 - 1600}{2}\right) = 1200 - 1000 = 200. \]  
Total favorable area: \( 800 + 200 = 1000 \).  
Probability:  
\[ \frac{\text{Favorable area}}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{1000}{3600} = \frac{5}{18}. \]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated probability.  
How to Achieve: Check the geometric calculation by considering an alternative approach (e.g., fixing John’s arrival time and calculating the probability the train is present) and confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alternative approach: Fix John’s arrival time at \( J = j \), where \( 0 \leq j \leq 60 \). The train is present if \( T \leq j \leq T + 20 \), or equivalently, \( j - 20 \leq T \leq j \).  
- If \( j \leq 20 \), then \( j - 20 \leq 0 \), so \( T \) ranges from 0 to \( j \). Probability: \( \frac{j}{60} \).  
- If \( j > 20 \), then \( T \) ranges from \( j - 20 \) to \( j \). Probability: \( \frac{j - (j - 20)}{60} = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \).  

Average probability over all \( j \):  
\[ P = \int_0^{60} P(\text{train present} | J = j) \cdot \frac{1}{60} \, dj = \int_0^{20} \frac{j}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60} \, dj + \int_{20}^{60} \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{60} \, dj. \]  
- First integral: \( \int_0^{20} \frac{j}{3600} \, dj = \frac{1}{3600} \cdot \frac{20^2}{2} = \frac{200}{3600} = \frac{1}{18} \).  
- Second integral: \( \int_{20}^{60} \frac{1}{180} \, dj = \frac{1}{180} \cdot (60 - 20) = \frac{40}{180} = \frac{4}{18} \).  
Total: \( \frac{1}{18} + \frac{4}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \).  
This matches the geometric result, confirming the probability is \( \frac{5}{18} \).
