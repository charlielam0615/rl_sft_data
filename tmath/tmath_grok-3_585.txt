**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the probability that John catches a train that arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00, waits for 20 minutes, and then leaves. John also arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00. The goal is to determine the probability that the train is still at the station when John arrives.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the probability.

1. Define the time frame and variables for the train's and John's arrival times.
2. Model the train's presence at the station based on its arrival time and 20-minute waiting period.
3. Determine the condition for John catching the train (i.e., John's arrival time falls within the train's presence).
4. Calculate the probability using a geometric or probabilistic approach, considering the random arrival times.
5. Verify the solution for correctness.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the time frame and variables for the train's and John's arrival times. This will be achieved by representing the time interval (2:00 to 3:00) as a unit interval and assigning random variables to the arrival times.

[IMP]  
Let the time interval from 2:00 to 3:00 be represented as [0, 60] minutes for simplicity, where 0 corresponds to 2:00 and 60 corresponds to 3:00.  
- Let \( T \) be the train's arrival time, uniformly distributed over [0, 60].  
- Let \( J \) be John's arrival time, also uniformly distributed over [0, 60].  
- The train arrives at time \( T \), waits for 20 minutes, and leaves at \( T + 20 \).  
- John catches the train if his arrival time \( J \) satisfies \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the train's presence and determine the condition for John catching the train. This will be achieved by defining the time window during which the train is at the station and checking if John's arrival falls within this window.

[IMP]  
For a given train arrival time \( T \), the train is at the station from \( T \) to \( T + 20 \).  
- John catches the train if \( J \geq T \) and \( J \leq T + 20 \).  
- Equivalently, the condition is \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \).  
- Since \( T \) and \( J \) are both in [0, 60], we must also account for cases where \( T + 20 > 60 \), meaning the train's presence extends beyond 3:00, but John's arrival is capped at 60.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability that John catches the train. This will be achieved by using a geometric probability approach, representing the problem in a 2D sample space and finding the proportion of favorable outcomes.

[IMP]  
Represent the sample space as a 60 × 60 square, where the x-axis is \( T \) (train's arrival time) and the y-axis is \( J \) (John's arrival time), both ranging from 0 to 60. The total area of the sample space is \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \), and \( T \) and \( J \) are uniformly distributed, so the probability is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area.

The condition \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \) describes a region in the \( T \)-\( J \) plane:
- \( J \geq T \): John arrives after or when the train arrives.
- \( J \leq T + 20 \): John arrives before or when the train leaves.

To find the favorable region:
- Plot the lines \( J = T \) and \( J = T + 20 \).
- Since \( J \leq 60 \), for \( T > 40 \), the train's departure time \( T + 20 > 60 \), but John's arrival is bounded by \( J \leq 60 \).

Split the calculation based on \( T \):
1. **For \( 0 \leq T \leq 40 \)**:
   - The train leaves at \( T + 20 \leq 60 \).
   - Favorable region: \( T \leq J \leq T + 20 \).
   - This is the area between \( J = T \) and \( J = T + 20 \) for \( 0 \leq T \leq 40 \), \( 0 \leq J \leq 60 \).
   - Area = \( \int_0^{40} (T + 20 - T) \, dT = \int_0^{40} 20 \, dT = 20 \times 40 = 800 \).

2. **For \( 40 < T \leq 60 \)**:
   - The train leaves at \( T + 20 \), but John’s arrival is capped at \( J \leq 60 \).
   - Favorable region: \( T \leq J \leq 60 \).
   - Area = \( \int_{40}^{60} (60 - T) \, dT \).
   - Compute: \( \int (60 - T) \, dT = 60T - \frac{T^2}{2} \).
   - Evaluate from 40 to 60: \( [60 \times 60 - \frac{60^2}{2}] - [60 \times 40 - \frac{40^2}{2}] = [3600 - 1800] - [2400 - 800] = 1800 - 1600 = 200 \).

Total favorable area = \( 800 + 200 = 1000 \).

Probability = \( \frac{\text{Favorable area}}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{1000}{3600} = \frac{5}{18} \).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the probability calculation. This will be achieved by cross-checking the geometric approach with an alternative method or logical checks to ensure correctness.

[IMP]  
To validate, consider an alternative approach using conditional probability:
- Fix train arrival time \( T \), uniformly distributed over [0, 60].
- Probability John arrives in [\( T \), \( T + 20 \)]:
  - If \( 0 \leq T \leq 40 \), the interval length is 20 minutes, so probability = \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \).
  - If \( 40 < T \leq 60 \), the interval is from \( T \) to 60, length \( 60 - T \), so probability = \( \frac{60 - T}{60} \).
- Average over \( T \):
  - For \( 0 \leq T \leq 40 \), probability = \( \frac{1}{3} \), weight = \( \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \), contribution = \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9} \).
  - For \( 40 < T \leq 60 \), probability = \( \frac{60 - T}{60} \), weight = \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \).
  - Compute: \( \int_{40}^{60} \frac{60 - T}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60} \, dT = \frac{1}{3600} \int_{40}^{60} (60 - T) \, dT = \frac{1}{3600} \times 200 = \frac{200}{3600} = \frac{1}{18} \).
- Total probability = \( \frac{2}{9} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{4}{18} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \).

The geometric and conditional probability methods agree, confirming the result.
