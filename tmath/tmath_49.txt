Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The formula for the $n$th term of a geometric sequence.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The $n$th term of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:  
$$ a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} $$  
where $a$ is the first term of the sequence, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the position of the term in the sequence.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the common ratio of the geometric sequence.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the common ratio $r$ of the geometric sequence $9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots$, divide any term by the previous term. For example:  
$$ r = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$  
$$ r = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} $$  
$$ r = \frac{1/3}{1} = \frac{1}{3} $$  
The common ratio is $r = \frac{1}{3}$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the formula for the $n$th term to find the tenth term of the geometric sequence.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given the first term $a = 9$, the common ratio $r = \frac{1}{3}$, and $n = 10$, the tenth term is:  
$$
a_{10} = a \cdot r^{n-1} = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{10-1} = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^9
$$  
$$
a_{10} = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{19683} = \frac{9}{19683} = \frac{1}{2187}
$$  
The tenth term is $\frac{1}{2187}$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: The entire solution process for calculating the tenth term of the geometric sequence.

[VERIFY]
1. **Common ratio validation**:  
   The sequence is 9, 3, 1, 1/3, ...  
   - 3/9 = 1/3  
   - 1/3 = 1/3  
   - (1/3)/1 = 1/3  
   All divisions consistently yield $r = 1/3$. This confirms the common ratio is correct.

2. **Formula application**:  
   The formula $a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}$ is correctly used with $a = 9$, $r = 1/3$, and $n = 10$.  
   - Exponent calculation: $10 - 1 = 9$  
   - Power calculation: $(1/3)^9 = 1/19683$  
   - Multiplication: $9 \cdot (1/19683) = 9/19683$  
   - Simplification: $9/19683 = 1/2187$  

3. **Arithmetic verification**:  
   $3^9 = 19683$ is correct (since $3^9 = 19683$). Dividing 9 by 19683 reduces to $1/2187$ because $19683 รท 9 = 2187$.

All steps are mathematically consistent and error-free. The final answer is correctly derived.
