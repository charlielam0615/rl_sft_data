Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the form of the binomial square and match its expansion to the given quadratic $9x^2 + 24x + a$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We want to express $9x^2 + 24x + a$ as the square of a binomial. Suppose the binomial is $ (mx + n)^2 $. Expanding this, we get:  
$$
(mx + n)^2 = m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2
$$  
Now, match this to the given quadratic $9x^2 + 24x + a$. Comparing the coefficients:  
1. $m^2 = 9$, so $m = 3$ or $m = -3$.  
2. $2mn = 24$. Substituting $m = 3$, we get $2(3)n = 24 \Rightarrow 6n = 24 \Rightarrow n = 4$.  
3. $n^2 = a$. Substituting $n = 4$, we get $a = 16$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Binomial form validation**: The general form $(mx + n)^2$ expands to $m^2x^2 + 2mnx + n^2$, which matches the structure of a perfect square trinomial. This is mathematically valid.

2. **Coefficient matching**:
   - $m^2 = 9$: Solving gives $m = \pm3$, which is correct.
   - For $m = 3$: $2mn = 24 \Rightarrow 2(3)n = 24 \Rightarrow n = 4$. Then $a = n^2 = 16$. This is valid.
   - For $m = -3$: $2(-3)n = 24 \Rightarrow -6n = 24 \Rightarrow n = -4$. Then $a = (-4)^2 = 16$. This also holds.

3. **Consistency check**: Both cases ($m = 3$ and $m = -3$) lead to the same value of $a = 16$. The quadratic becomes $(3x + 4)^2$ or $(-3x - 4)^2$, both of which expand to $9x^2 + 24x + 16$. This confirms the solution is consistent regardless of the sign of $m$.

4. **Final verification**: Substituting $a = 16$ into the original expression gives $9x^2 + 24x + 16$, which factors as $(3x + 4)^2$. This confirms the solution is correct.
