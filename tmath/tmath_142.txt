The complex conjugate of the denominator $ 2 + 3i $ is $ 2 - 3i $. To simplify the expression, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ 2 - 3i $:  

$$
\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i} \cdot \frac{2 - 3i}{2 - 3i} = \frac{(1 - i)(2 - 3i)}{(2 + 3i)(2 - 3i)}
$$  

Now we compute the numerator and the denominator separately.  
Numerator:  
$$
(1 - i)(2 - 3i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-3i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-3i) = 2 - 3i - 2i + 3i^2
$$  
Since $ i^2 = -1 $, we substitute:  
$$
2 - 3i - 2i + 3(-1) = 2 - 5i - 3 = -1 - 5i
$$  

Denominator:  
$$
(2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = 2^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9i^2 = 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13
$$  

So the simplified expression becomes:  
$$
\frac{-1 - 5i}{13}
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Complex conjugate multiplication**: The conjugate of the denominator (2 + 3i) is correctly identified as (2 - 3i). Multiplying numerator and denominator by this conjugate is the standard method for rationalizing complex denominators.

2. **Numerator expansion**: 
   - (1 - i)(2 - 3i) expands to 2 - 3i - 2i + 3i²
   - Combining like terms: 2 - 5i + 3i²
   - Substituting i² = -1: 2 - 5i - 3 = -1 - 5i
   - This matches the calculated result (-1 - 5i)

3. **Denominator calculation**:
   - (2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = 4 - (3i)² = 4 - 9i²
   - Substituting i² = -1: 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13
   - This matches the calculated result (13)

4. **Final expression**: (-1 - 5i)/13 is the correct simplified form with real and imaginary parts properly separated.

All mathematical operations follow the rules of complex arithmetic, and the substitution of i² = -1 was applied correctly throughout the calculation. No arithmetic errors or sign mistakes were detected in any step of the process.
