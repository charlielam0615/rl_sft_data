Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Analyze the given equation $x + y + xy = 76$ to determine the value of $x + y$.

4. Verify the solution meets the requirements.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the equation $x + y + xy = 76$ for easier solving.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To simplify the given equation $x + y + xy = 76$, we can add 1 to both sides and then factor the left-hand side:
$$
x + y + xy + 1 = 77
$$
This can be rewritten as:
$$
(x + 1)(y + 1) = 77
$$
Now, we need to find positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 77$ and $x, y < 20$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Find positive integer pairs $(x + 1, y + 1)$ such that $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 77$ and $x, y < 20$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The number 77 can be factored into pairs of positive integers as:
$$
(1, 77), (7, 11), (11, 7), (77, 1)
$$
Since $x, y < 20$, we subtract 1 from each factor to find valid values of $x$ and $y$:
$$
(1 - 1, 77 - 1) = (0, 76) \quad \text{(Invalid, since 76 is not less than 20)}
$$
$$
(7 - 1, 11 - 1) = (6, 10)
$$
$$
(11 - 1, 7 - 1) = (10, 6)
$$
$$
(77 - 1, 1 - 1) = (76, 0) \quad \text{(Invalid, since 76 is not less than 20 and 0 is not positive)}
$$
The valid pairs are $(6, 10)$ and $(10, 6)$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the solution process and final answer for the equation $x + y + xy = 76$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Transformation**: The original equation was transformed by adding 1 to both sides, resulting in $(x+1)(y+1) = 77$. This is mathematically valid because expanding $(x+1)(y+1)$ yields $xy + x + y + 1$, which matches the left-hand side of the modified equation. 

2. **Factorization of 77**: The factor pairs of 77 are correctly identified as $(1, 77), (7, 11), (11, 7), (77, 1)$. This is accurate since 77 has no other positive integer factors.

3. **Exclusion of Invalid Pairs**: The pairs $(1, 77)$ and $(77, 1)$ lead to $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ (invalid as per the problem's requirement for positive integers) or values exceeding 19 (e.g., $76$), which is correctly excluded. This step is logically sound.

4. **Valid Pair Selection**: The remaining pairs $(7, 11)$ and $(11, 7)$ yield $(x, y) = (6, 10)$ and $(10, 6)$, both of which satisfy $x, y < 20$. Substituting these into the original equation confirms correctness:
   - For $x = 6, y = 10$: $6 + 10 + 6 \cdot 10 = 16 + 60 = 76$.
   - For $x = 10, y = 6$: $10 + 6 + 10 \cdot 6 = 16 + 60 = 76$.

5. **Final Answer Consistency**: The sum $x + y = 16$ is consistent across both valid solutions, and all constraints (positive integers < 20) are satisfied. No alternative solutions exist within the given constraints.

The reasoning is logically consistent, and all steps are mathematically valid.
