**Problem Restatement**: Find the area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). The area is measured in square units.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Find the x-intercepts of the curve by setting \( y = 0 \).  
2. Find the y-intercept by setting \( x = 0 \).  
3. Identify the vertices of the triangle formed by these intercepts.  
4. Calculate the area of the triangle using the vertices.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). Achieve this by setting \( y = 0 \) and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) = 0 \).  
Since the equation is a product, set each factor to zero:  
- \( (x-3)^2 = 0 \implies x = 3 \) (with multiplicity 2, indicating a double root).  
- \( x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2 \).  
Thus, the x-intercepts are at \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -2 \), corresponding to points \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-intercept of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). Achieve this by setting \( x = 0 \) and solving for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation:  
\( y = (0-3)^2 (0+2) = (-3)^2 \cdot 2 = 9 \cdot 2 = 18 \).  
Thus, the y-intercept is at \( (0, 18) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find x-intercepts (completed: \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find y-intercept (completed: \( (0, 18) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the triangle’s vertices.  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the triangle’s area.  
**Current Goal**: Identify the triangle’s vertices.  
The vertices of the triangle are the x-intercepts \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and the y-intercept \( (0, 18) \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the points \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and \( (0, 18) \) form a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the points are not collinear). Achieve this by checking if the area of the triangle is non-zero or by verifying that the points do not lie on a single line.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use the determinant formula for the area of a triangle given vertices \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \):  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right| \]  
Assign: \( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 0) \), \( (x_2, y_2) = (-2, 0) \), \( (x_3, y_3) = (0, 18) \).  
Compute:  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3 (0 - 18) + (-2) (18 - 0) + 0 (0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3 (-18) + (-2) (18) + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -54 - 36 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 90 = 45. \]  
Since the area is non-zero (45 square units), the points are not collinear, confirming a valid triangle.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the area of the triangle with vertices \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and \( (0, 18) \). Since the area was computed during validation, confirm and finalize the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The area was calculated in the previous step as 45 square units using the determinant formula. To confirm, use an alternative method: treat the x-axis as the base.  
- Base: Distance between \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \) = \( |3 - (-2)| = 5 \).  
- Height: Distance from \( (0, 18) \) to the x-axis = 18.  
- Area: \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 18 = 45 \).  
Both methods agree, confirming the area is 45 square units.

### Final Answer
The area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \) is 45 square units.
