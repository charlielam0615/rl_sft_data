### Problem Restatement
We need to find the area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). The x-intercepts occur where \( y = 0 \), and the y-intercept occurs where \( x = 0 \). The area of the triangle is calculated using the coordinates of these intercepts.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the x-intercepts of the curve by setting \( y = 0 \).  
2. Find the y-intercept by setting \( x = 0 \).  
3. Use the intercepts as vertices to form a triangle.  
4. Calculate the area of the triangle using the coordinates of the vertices.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). This can be achieved by setting \( y = 0 \) and solving for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the x-intercepts, set \( y = 0 \):  
\[ (x-3)^2 (x+2) = 0 \]  
This gives:  
\[ (x-3)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x+2 = 0 \]  
- For \( (x-3)^2 = 0 \), \( x = 3 \) (with multiplicity 2, but still one point).  
- For \( x+2 = 0 \), \( x = -2 \).  
Thus, the x-intercepts are at \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-intercept of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \). This can be achieved by setting \( x = 0 \) and solving for \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the y-intercept, set \( x = 0 \):  
\[ y = (0-3)^2 (0+2) = 9 \cdot 2 = 18 \]  
Thus, the y-intercept is at \( (0, 18) \).

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find x-intercepts (completed: x-intercepts at \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find y-intercept (completed: y-intercept at \( (0, 18) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Form the triangle using intercepts (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the triangleâ€™s area (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Form the triangle using the intercepts \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and \( (0, 18) \).

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to form the triangle using the intercepts \( (3, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and \( (0, 18) \), and calculate its area. This can be achieved by applying the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The vertices of the triangle are \( A(3, 0) \), \( B(-2, 0) \), and \( C(0, 18) \). The area of a triangle with vertices \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \) is given by:  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right| \]  
Substitute the coordinates:  
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 0) \), \( (x_2, y_2) = (-2, 0) \), \( (x_3, y_3) = (0, 18) \).  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3 (0 - 18) + (-2) (18 - 0) + 0 (0 - 0) \right| \]  
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3 (-18) + (-2) (18) + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -54 - 36 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 90 = 45 \]  
The area of the triangle is 45 square units.

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculated area of the triangle. This can be achieved by checking the calculation and ensuring the intercepts form a valid triangle.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, confirm the intercepts and area calculation:  
- **Intercepts**: x-intercepts at \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \), y-intercept at \( (0, 18) \). These are correct based on prior steps.  
- **Triangle Validity**: The points are not collinear (the y-intercept has \( y = 18 \), while x-intercepts have \( y = 0 \)), forming a valid triangle.  
- **Area Recalculation**: Use an alternative method, such as treating the base as the line between \( (3, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \), and the height as the y-coordinate of \( (0, 18) \).  
  - Base length: \( |3 - (-2)| = 5 \).  
  - Height: \( y = 18 \) at \( (0, 18) \).  
  - Area: \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 18 = 45 \).  
The area matches, confirming 45 square units.

### Final Answer
The area of the triangle formed by the x- and y-intercepts of the curve \( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \) is **45 square units**.
