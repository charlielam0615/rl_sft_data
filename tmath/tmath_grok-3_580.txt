**Problem Restatement**: Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are odd integers, we need to determine how many terms in the binomial expansion of \( (m + n)^6 \) have odd coefficients.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the binomial expansion of \( (m + n)^6 \).  
2. Identify the coefficients of the terms in the expansion.  
3. Determine which coefficients are odd.  
4. Count the number of odd coefficients.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Understand the binomial expansion of \( (m + n)^6 \).  
How to Achieve: Use the binomial theorem to write the expansion and identify the general term.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The binomial theorem states that for \( (a + b)^n \), the expansion is:  
\[ (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \]  
For \( (m + n)^6 \), we have \( a = m \), \( b = n \), and \( n = 6 \). The general term is:  
\[ T_k = \binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \]  
where \( k \) ranges from 0 to 6, and the coefficient of the term is \( \binom{6}{k} \). There are \( 6 + 1 = 7 \) terms in total.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine which coefficients in the expansion are odd.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the binomial coefficients \( \binom{6}{k} \) for \( k = 0 \) to 6 and check their parity, considering the effect of \( m \) and \( n \) being odd.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
First, compute the binomial coefficients:  
- \( \binom{6}{0} = 1 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = 15 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{6} = 20 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{4} = \binom{6}{2} = 15 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{5} = \binom{6}{1} = 6 \)  
- \( \binom{6}{6} = 1 \)  

The coefficients are: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.  
Next, consider the term \( \binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are odd integers, we need to check if the entire coefficient \( \binom{6}{k} \) is odd, as \( m^{6-k} \) and \( n^k \) are odd (odd numbers raised to any integer power remain odd, and the product of odd numbers is odd). Thus, the parity of the term depends solely on \( \binom{6}{k} \).  

Check the parity:  
- \( \binom{6}{0} = 1 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \): even  
- \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \): even  
- \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{5} = 6 \): even  
- \( \binom{6}{6} = 1 \): odd  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the parity of the term depends only on \( \binom{6}{k} \).  
How to Achieve: Confirm that \( m^{6-k} n^k \) is always odd when \( m \) and \( n \) are odd, using properties of odd numbers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( m \) and \( n \) are odd, any power \( m^{6-k} \) or \( n^k \) is odd (e.g., \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 5^3 = 125 \)). The product \( m^{6-k} n^k \) is odd because odd × odd = odd. Thus, the term \( \binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \) is odd if and only if \( \binom{6}{k} \) is odd. This confirms that we only need to check the parity of \( \binom{6}{k} \).

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many terms in \( (m + n)^6 \) have odd coefficients.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the binomial expansion (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the coefficients (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine which coefficients are odd (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the number of odd coefficients (pending).  
Current Goal: Count the number of odd coefficients.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Count the number of odd coefficients.  
How to Achieve: Sum the number of \( \binom{6}{k} \) that are odd based on previous calculations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 3, the coefficients with odd parity are:  
- \( \binom{6}{0} = 1 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \): odd  
- \( \binom{6}{6} = 1 \): odd  

There are 4 odd coefficients.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the count of odd coefficients.  
How to Achieve: Use a combinatorial identity or alternative method to confirm the number of odd binomial coefficients for \( n = 6 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
An alternative method is to use the fact that the number of odd binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} \) for a given \( n \) equals \( 2^{s(n)} \), where \( s(n) \) is the number of 1’s in the binary representation of \( n \). For \( n = 6 \), in binary:  
\[ 6 = 110_2 \]  
There are 2 ones, so the number of odd coefficients is \( 2^2 = 4 \).  

This matches our count (for \( k = 0, 2, 4, 6 \)).
