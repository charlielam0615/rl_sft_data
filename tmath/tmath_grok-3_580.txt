**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine how many terms in the binomial expansion of \((m + n)^6\) have odd coefficients, given that \(m\) and \(n\) are odd integers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the binomial expansion of \((m + n)^6\).  
2. Identify the coefficients in the expansion.  
3. Determine which coefficients are odd, considering \(m\) and \(n\) are odd integers.  
4. Count the number of odd coefficients.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the binomial expansion of \((m + n)^6\) and identify its coefficients. This can be achieved by applying the binomial theorem, which gives the general form of the expansion and the formula for coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \((m + n)^6\) is:  
\[
(m + n)^6 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k
\]  
Each term is of the form \(\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\), where \(\binom{6}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, and \(k\) ranges from 0 to 6. The coefficient of the term \(m^{6-k} n^k\) is \(\binom{6}{k}\). Our task is to determine how many of these coefficients are odd.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine whether the coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\) depend on \(m\) and \(n\) being odd, and to evaluate the parity (odd or even) of each coefficient. This can be achieved by analyzing the effect of \(m\) and \(n\) on the term’s coefficient and computing \(\binom{6}{k}\) directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \(m\) and \(n\) are odd integers, consider the term \(\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\). The coefficient of the term is \(\binom{6}{k}\), which is independent of \(m\) and \(n\). However, the entire term includes \(m^{6-k} n^k\), and we need to check if the numerical coefficient of each term in the expansion is odd.  

Let’s compute the binomial coefficients for \(k = 0\) to \(k = 6\):  
- \(\binom{6}{0} = 1\)  
- \(\binom{6}{1} = 6\)  
- \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15\)  
- \(\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 20\)  
- \(\binom{6}{4} = \binom{6}{2} = 15\)  
- \(\binom{6}{5} = \binom{6}{1} = 6\)  
- \(\binom{6}{6} = 1\)  

Coefficients: \(1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\).  

Now, identify which are odd:  
- \(1\) (odd)  
- \(6\) (even)  
- \(15\) (odd)  
- \(20\) (even)  
- \(15\) (odd)  
- \(6\) (even)  
- \(1\) (odd)  

There are 4 odd coefficients (\(\binom{6}{0}, \binom{6}{2}, \binom{6}{4}, \binom{6}{6}\)). However, we must consider the effect of \(m^{6-k} n^k\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are odd, their powers are odd if the exponent is odd, and even if the exponent is even. Let’s explore this in the next step.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine if the parity of \(m^{6-k} n^k\) affects the oddness of the term’s coefficient in the context of the problem. This can be achieved by examining the parity of each term and testing with specific odd values for \(m\) and \(n\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The term is \(\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\). The problem asks for terms that are “odd,” which likely refers to the numerical coefficient of each term in the polynomial after expansion. Since \(m\) and \(n\) are odd, compute the parity of \(m^{6-k} n^k\):  
- If the exponent \(6-k\) is even, \(m^{6-k}\) is even (since \(m\) is odd, but raised to an even power).  
- If \(k\) is even, \(n^k\) is even.  

Test with \(m = 1\), \(n = 1\) (both odd):  
\[
(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64
\]  
Expansion:  
\[
1 \cdot 1^6 + 6 \cdot 1^5 \cdot 1 + 15 \cdot 1^4 \cdot 1^2 + 20 \cdot 1^3 \cdot 1^3 + 15 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1^4 + 6 \cdot 1 \cdot 1^5 + 1 \cdot 1^6 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64
\]  
The coefficients themselves (\(1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\)) are the numerical coefficients of the terms. The odd coefficients correspond to \(k = 0, 2, 4, 6\).  

Now, consider the term’s coefficient in the polynomial. For general odd \(m, n\), the coefficient \(\binom{6}{k}\) is multiplied by \(m^{6-k} n^k\), but in the context of the binomial expansion, the “coefficient” typically refers to \(\binom{6}{k}\). Let’s assume the problem refers to the binomial coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The core content is the binomial expansion of \((m + n)^6\) and the parity of its coefficients. Retrieve information from previous steps about the coefficients and their parity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
From Step 2, the expansion is \(\sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\), with coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\).  
From Step 3, the coefficients are \(1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\), and the odd coefficients are for \(k = 0, 2, 4, 6\) (4 terms).  
From Step 4, we tested with \(m = 1, n = 1\), confirming the coefficients, and noted that \(m^{6-k} n^k\) may affect parity, but the problem likely asks for the binomial coefficients’ parity.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the problem refers to the binomial coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\) being odd, or the entire term’s coefficient. This can be achieved by re-evaluating the problem’s wording and testing with another pair of odd integers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The problem asks, “how many terms in the expansion of \((m + n)^6\) are odd?” In polynomial expansions, “terms” typically refer to the monomials \(\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\), and “odd” likely refers to their numerical coefficients. Since \(\binom{6}{k}\) is the coefficient, and \(m^{6-k} n^k\) is the variable part, test with \(m = 3, n = 5\):  

Compute \((3 + 5)^6 = 8^6 = 262144\). Expansion:  
- \(k=0\): \(\binom{6}{0} 3^6 = 1 \cdot 729 = 729\) (odd)  
- \(k=1\): \(\binom{6}{1} 3^5 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 243 \cdot 5 = 7290\) (even)  
- \(k=2\): \(\binom{6}{2} 3^4 \cdot 5^2 = 15 \cdot 81 \cdot 25 = 30375\) (odd)  
- \(k=3\): \(\binom{6}{3} 3^3 \cdot 5^3 = 20 \cdot 27 \cdot 125 = 67500\) (even)  
- \(k=4\): \(\binom{6}{4} 3^2 \cdot 5^4 = 15 \cdot 9 \cdot 625 = 84375\) (odd)  
- \(k=5\): \(\binom{6}{5} 3 \cdot 5^5 = 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 3125 = 56250\) (even)  
- \(k=6\): \(\binom{6}{6} 5^6 = 1 \cdot 15625 = 15625\) (odd)  

Odd coefficients occur for \(k = 0, 2, 4, 6\), confirming 4 terms. This suggests the problem refers to the binomial coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\).

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many terms in \((m + n)^6\) have odd coefficients.  
  - Subgoal 1 (Step 1): Understand the binomial expansion.  
  - Subgoal 2 (Step 2): Identify the coefficients.  
  - Subgoal 3 (Step 3): Determine which coefficients are odd.  
  - Subgoal 4 (Step 4): Analyze the effect of \(m\) and \(n\) being odd.  
  - Subgoal 5 (Step 6): Validate the interpretation of “odd terms.”  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the number of odd binomial coefficients.  
From previous steps, we identified 4 odd coefficients (\(\binom{6}{0}, \binom{6}{2}, \binom{6}{4}, \binom{6}{6}\)).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the answer by confirming that the problem asks for the number of terms with odd binomial coefficients \(\binom{6}{k}\). This can be achieved by using a mathematical approach to count odd coefficients systematically.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To count odd coefficients systematically, use the fact that for \((x + y)^n\), the number of odd coefficients can be found by evaluating at specific points. For \(n = 6\), compute \((1 + 1)^6\) and \((1 - 1)^6\):  
- \((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k}\).  
- \((1 - 1)^6 = 0^6 = 0 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k = \binom{6}{0} - \binom{6}{1} + \binom{6}{2} - \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{4} - \binom{6}{5} + \binom{6}{6}\).  

Number of odd coefficients = \(\frac{(1 + 1)^6 + (1 - 1)^6}{2} = \frac{64 + 0}{2} = 32\). This counts the odd coefficients in the polynomial evaluated at \(x = 1, y = 1\), but since we’re interested in \(\binom{6}{k}\), recompute:  

Alternatively, the number of odd \(\binom{n}{k}\) for \(n = 6\) is \(2^{\text{number of 1s in binary representation of } n}\). For \(n = 6 = 110_2\), there are 2 ones, so \(2^2 = 4\) odd coefficients, corresponding to \(k = 0, 2, 4, 6\).  

Since \(m\) and \(n\) are odd, they don’t affect the parity of \(\binom{6}{k}\). Thus, there are 4 terms with odd binomial coefficients.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: There are 4 terms in the expansion of \((m + n)^6\) with odd coefficients.
