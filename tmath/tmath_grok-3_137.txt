### Problem Statement
We need to find the positive difference between the two values of \( a \) that satisfy the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \), where the function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[
f(n) = \begin{cases} 
n^2 - 2 & \text{if } n < 0, \\
2n - 20 & \text{if } n \geq 0.
\end{cases}
\]
The positive difference is the absolute difference between the two solutions for \( a \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(-2) \).  
2. Compute \( f(2) \).  
3. Set up the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \).  
4. Solve for \( a \), considering the piecewise definition of \( f(a) \).  
5. Find the positive difference between the two values of \( a \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-2) \). Since \(-2 < 0\), use the formula \( f(n) = n^2 - 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = -2 \):  
\[
f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \). Since \( 2 \geq 0 \), use the formula \( f(n) = 2n - 20 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = 2 \):  
\[
f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 - 20 = 4 - 20 = -16.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \). Use the computed values \( f(-2) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = -16 \), and express \( f(a) \) based on the piecewise definition of \( f \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the results:  
\[
f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 2 + (-16) + f(a) = -14 + f(a) = 0.
\]
Thus:  
\[
f(a) = 14.
\]
Since \( f(a) \) is piecewise, consider both cases:  
- If \( a < 0 \), then \( f(a) = a^2 - 2 = 14 \).  
- If \( a \geq 0 \), then \( f(a) = 2a - 20 = 14 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( f(a) = 14 \) for both cases of the piecewise function to find the values of \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Case 1: \( a < 0 \)**  
\[
a^2 - 2 = 14 \implies a^2 = 16 \implies a = \pm 4.
\]
Since \( a < 0 \), take \( a = -4 \).  

**Case 2: \( a \geq 0 \)**  
\[
2a - 20 = 14 \implies 2a = 34 \implies a = 17.
\]
Since \( a = 17 \geq 0 \), this is valid.  

The two solutions are \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \) satisfy the original equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verify \( a = -4 \)**:  
Since \( -4 < 0 \), use \( f(a) = a^2 - 2 \):  
\[
f(-4) = (-4)^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14.
\]
Check:  
\[
f(-2) + f(2) + f(-4) = 2 + (-16) + 14 = 2 - 16 + 14 = 0.
\]
Valid.  

**Verify \( a = 17 \)**:  
Since \( 17 \geq 0 \), use \( f(a) = 2a - 20 \):  
\[
f(17) = 2 \cdot 17 - 20 = 34 - 20 = 14.
\]
Check:  
\[
f(-2) + f(2) + f(17) = 2 + (-16) + 14 = 2 - 16 + 14 = 0.
\]
Valid.  

Both solutions satisfy the equation.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the positive difference between the two values of \( a \), i.e., \( |a_1 - a_2| \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solutions are \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \).  
Positive difference:  
\[
|17 - (-4)| = |17 + 4| = |21| = 21.
\]
[/IMP]
