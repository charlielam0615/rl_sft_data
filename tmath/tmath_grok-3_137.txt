### Problem Restatement
We need to find the positive difference between the two values of \( a \) that satisfy the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \), where the function is defined as:
\[
f(n) = \begin{cases} 
n^2 - 2 & \text{if } n < 0, \\
2n - 20 & \text{if } n \geq 0.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
Subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(-2) \) and \( f(2) \).  
2. Set up the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \).  
3. Solve for \( a \), considering the piecewise nature of \( f(a) \).  
4. Find the two values of \( a \).  
5. Calculate the positive difference between the two values of \( a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-2) \) and \( f(2) \). This will be achieved by applying the function \( f(n) \) based on the value of \( n \) and the piecewise definition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = -2 \): Since \( -2 < 0 \), use \( f(n) = n^2 - 2 \).  
\[ f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. \]

For \( n = 2 \): Since \( 2 \geq 0 \), use \( f(n) = 2n - 20 \).  
\[ f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 - 20 = 4 - 20 = -16. \]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation \( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \) using the computed values and solve for \( f(a) \). This will be achieved by substituting \( f(-2) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = -16 \) into the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute the values:  
\[ f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 2 + (-16) + f(a) = 0. \]  
\[ -14 + f(a) = 0. \]  
\[ f(a) = 14. \]

Now, we need to find \( a \) such that \( f(a) = 14 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( f(a) = 14 \) for \( a \), considering the piecewise definition of \( f(a) \). This will be achieved by solving the equation for both cases: \( a < 0 \) and \( a \geq 0 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Case 1: \( a < 0 \)**  
Use \( f(a) = a^2 - 2 \).  
\[ a^2 - 2 = 14. \]  
\[ a^2 = 16. \]  
\[ a = \pm 4. \]  
Since \( a < 0 \), take \( a = -4 \).  
Verify: \( f(-4) = (-4)^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 \), which satisfies \( f(a) = 14 \).

**Case 2: \( a \geq 0 \)**  
Use \( f(a) = 2a - 20 \).  
\[ 2a - 20 = 14. \]  
\[ 2a = 34. \]  
\[ a = 17. \]  
Verify: \( f(17) = 2 \cdot 17 - 20 = 34 - 20 = 14 \), which satisfies \( f(a) = 14 \).

Thus, the two values of \( a \) are \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \) are the only solutions by checking for other possible solutions and ensuring the piecewise cases are exhaustive. This will be achieved by confirming the solutions satisfy the original equation and checking the domain of \( f(a) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify in the original equation:  
For \( a = -4 \):  
\[ f(-2) + f(2) + f(-4) = 2 + (-16) + f(-4) = 2 - 16 + ( (-4)^2 - 2 ) = 2 - 16 + (16 - 2) = 2 - 16 + 14 = 0. \]  
Satisfied.

For \( a = 17 \):  
\[ f(-2) + f(2) + f(17) = 2 + (-16) + f(17) = 2 - 16 + ( 2 \cdot 17 - 20 ) = 2 - 16 + (34 - 20) = 2 - 16 + 14 = 0. \]  
Satisfied.

The piecewise function covers all real numbers (\( a < 0 \) and \( a \geq 0 \)), and each case yielded one solution. The quadratic equation \( a^2 - 16 = 0 \) in the first case has two roots, but only \( a = -4 \) satisfies \( a < 0 \). The linear equation \( 2a - 34 = 0 \) in the second case has one root. No other cases exist, so the solutions are complete.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the positive difference between the two values of \( a \), which are \( a = -4 \) and \( a = 17 \). This will be achieved by computing \( |17 - (-4)| \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The positive difference is:  
\[ |17 - (-4)| = |17 + 4| = |21| = 21. \]
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
