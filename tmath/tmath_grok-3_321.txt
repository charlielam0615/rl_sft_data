**Problem Statement**: Find the greatest possible positive integer value of \( x \) such that \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the greatest positive integer \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.  
- Subgoal 1: Simplify the given inequality \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \).  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified inequality to find the range of possible \( x \).  
- Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) within that range.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the inequality \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \). Achieve this by applying algebraic rules to reduce the expression to a simpler form, assuming \( x \neq 0 \) since the denominator involves \( x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify the inequality:  
\[ \frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^{4-2} = x^2 \]  
Thus, the inequality becomes:  
\[ x^2 < 10 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( x^2 < 10 \) to find the range of possible \( x \). Achieve this by taking the square root of both sides, considering both positive and negative solutions, and noting that \( x \) must be a positive integer as per the problem.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[ x^2 < 10 \]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[ \sqrt{x^2} < \sqrt{10} \]  
\[ |x| < \sqrt{10} \]  
Since \( \sqrt{10} \approx 3.162 \), we have:  
\[ -3.162 < x < 3.162 \]  
Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, consider \( x > 0 \), so:  
\[ 0 < x < 3.162 \]  
The positive integers satisfying this are \( x = 1, 2, 3 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest positive integer \( x \) such that \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the inequality \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \) (completed: simplified to \( x^2 < 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified inequality to find the range of \( x \) (completed: \( 0 < x < 3.162 \), so \( x = 1, 2, 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) within that range (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) from the set \( \{1, 2, 3\} \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) from the set \( \{1, 2, 3\} \). Achieve this by comparing the integers and selecting the largest one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The positive integers satisfying \( 0 < x < 3.162 \) are \( 1, 2, 3 \). The greatest among them is \( 3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( x = 3 \) is the greatest positive integer satisfying \( \frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10 \). Achieve this by checking if \( x = 3 \) satisfies the inequality and if the next integer, \( x = 4 \), does not.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check \( x = 3 \):  
\[ \frac{3^4}{3^2} = \frac{81}{9} = 9 \]  
Since \( 9 < 10 \), \( x = 3 \) satisfies the inequality.  

Check \( x = 4 \):  
\[ \frac{4^4}{4^2} = \frac{256}{16} = 16 \]  
Since \( 16 > 10 \), \( x = 4 \) does not satisfy the inequality.  

Thus, \( x = 3 \) is the greatest positive integer that satisfies the inequality.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greatest possible positive integer value of \( x \) is \( 3 \).
