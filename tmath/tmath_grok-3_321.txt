### Problem Statement
We need to find the greatest possible positive integer value of \( x \) such that the inequality \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\) holds.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the inequality and find the greatest positive integer \( x \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given inequality \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\).  
2. Solve the simplified inequality to find the range of possible values for \( x \).  
3. Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) within this range.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the inequality \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\). This can be achieved by applying exponent rules to reduce the expression and then solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the inequality:  
\[
\frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^{4-2} = x^2
\]  
Thus, the inequality becomes:  
\[
x^2 < 10
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( x^2 < 10 \) to find the range of possible values for \( x \). This can be achieved by taking the square root of both sides and considering the constraints for positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[
x^2 < 10
\]  
Take the square root of both sides (noting that \( x \) is a positive integer, so we only consider the positive root):  
\[
x < \sqrt{10}
\]  
Since \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.162\), we have:  
\[
x < 3.162
\]  
Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, possible values are \( x = 1, 2, 3 \), as \( x = 4 \) would give \( x^2 = 16 \), which is not less than 10.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest positive integer \( x \) such that \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the inequality \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\). (Completed: Simplified to \( x^2 < 10 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified inequality to find the range of possible values for \( x \). (Completed: \( x < \sqrt{10} \approx 3.162 \), so \( x = 1, 2, 3 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) within this range. (Current goal)  

**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) from the possible values \( x = 1, 2, 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the greatest positive integer \( x \) from the possible values \( x = 1, 2, 3 \). This can be achieved by selecting the largest integer in the set.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the possible values \( x = 1, 2, 3 \), the greatest positive integer is \( x = 3 \).  
Verify:  
For \( x = 3 \), compute \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^2 = 3^2 = 9\), and \( 9 < 10 \), which satisfies the inequality.  
For \( x = 4 \), compute \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^2 = 4^2 = 16\), and \( 16 \not< 10 \), so \( x = 4 \) does not satisfy the inequality.  
Thus, \( x = 3 \) is the greatest positive integer that satisfies the condition.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( x = 3 \) is indeed the greatest positive integer satisfying \(\frac{x^4}{x^2} < 10\). This can be achieved by confirming the solution against the original inequality and checking the next integer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate:  
- For \( x = 3 \): \(\frac{3^4}{3^2} = \frac{81}{9} = 9\), and \( 9 < 10 \), which is valid.  
- For \( x = 4 \): \(\frac{4^4}{4^2} = \frac{256}{16} = 16\), and \( 16 \not< 10 \), which is invalid.  
- Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, and \( x = 4 \) fails, \( x = 3 \) is the largest possible value.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The greatest possible positive integer value of \( x \) is \( \boxed{3} \).
