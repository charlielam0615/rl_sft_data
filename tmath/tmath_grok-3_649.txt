**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.  
2. Identify all possible sums that are prime numbers.  
3. Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is a prime number.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.  
How to Achieve: Each die has 6 faces, and the rolls are independent. Multiply the number of outcomes for each die (6 × 6) to find the total number of possible outcomes.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes is:  
6 × 6 = 36.  
Thus, there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify all possible sums that are prime numbers.  
How to Achieve: List all possible sums from rolling two dice (ranging from 2 to 12) and identify which of these are prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The possible sums from rolling two dice range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6). The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Checking these against the possible sums:  
- Sum = 2: Prime.  
- Sum = 3: Prime.  
- Sum = 5: Prime.  
- Sum = 7: Prime.  
- Sum = 11: Prime.  
- Sum = 13 or higher: Not possible since the maximum sum is 12.  
Thus, the prime sums are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is a prime number.  
How to Achieve: For each prime sum (2, 3, 5, 7, 11), list all possible pairs of dice rolls that produce that sum and count them.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
List the pairs (die1, die2) for each prime sum:  
- Sum = 2: (1,1). 1 outcome.  
- Sum = 3: (1,2), (2,1). 2 outcomes.  
- Sum = 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). 4 outcomes.  
- Sum = 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). 6 outcomes.  
- Sum = 11: (5,6), (6,5). 2 outcomes.  
Total favorable outcomes: 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the count of favorable outcomes.  
How to Achieve: Recheck the pairs for each prime sum to ensure no outcomes are missed or double-counted.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the pairs:  
- Sum 2: Only (1,1) → 1 outcome.  
- Sum 3: (1,2), (2,1) → 2 outcomes.  
- Sum 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) → 4 outcomes.  
- Sum 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) → 6 outcomes.  
- Sum 11: (5,6), (6,5) → 2 outcomes.  
Total: 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15 outcomes. The count is consistent.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the sum of two dice is a prime number, expressed as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total outcomes (completed: 36 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify prime sums (completed: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate favorable outcomes (completed: 15 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute probability (pending).  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as a common fraction.

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (15) by the total outcomes (36) and simplify the fraction if possible.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 15/36.  
Simplify the fraction:  
- The greatest common divisor of 15 and 36 is 3 (since 15 = 3 × 5, 36 = 3 × 12).  
- Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5, 36 ÷ 3 = 12.  
Thus, 15/36 simplifies to 5/12.  
Check if 5/12 is in simplest form: 5 is prime, 12 = 2² × 3, no common factors. The fraction is simplified.

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the probability calculation.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the probability and confirm the fraction is in its simplest form.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Favorable outcomes = 15, total outcomes = 36.  
Probability = 15/36 = 5/12 (after dividing by 3).  
Confirm GCD(5,12) = 1, so 5/12 is in simplest form.  
The calculation is consistent.  

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
The probability that the sum of the numbers shown on two standard 6-sided dice is a prime number is **5/12**.
