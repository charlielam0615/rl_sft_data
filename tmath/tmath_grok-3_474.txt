**Problem Restatement**: I need to compute the sum of powers of the imaginary unit \( i \) from \( i^{-100} \) to \( i^{100} \), i.e., \( i^{-100} + i^{-99} + i^{-98} + \cdots + i^{-1} + i^0 + i^1 + \cdots + i^{99} + i^{100} \).

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to compute the sum of powers of \( i \). First, I will identify the pattern in the powers of \( i \), as they cycle every 4 terms. Then, I will determine how many complete cycles of 4 are in the range from \( -100 \) to \( 100 \), and handle any remaining terms. Finally, I will compute the sum based on this structure.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify the pattern in the powers of \( i \).  
Description: I will list the values of \( i^n \) for a few positive and negative exponents to confirm the repeating cycle of values (1, i, -1, -i).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I know that the imaginary unit \( i \) has a cyclic pattern in its powers:  
- \( i^0 = 1 \)  
- \( i^1 = i \)  
- \( i^2 = -1 \)  
- \( i^3 = -i \)  
- \( i^4 = 1 \)  
This cycle repeats every 4 exponents. For negative exponents, since \( i^{-n} = (i^n)^{-1} \), the pattern holds:  
- \( i^{-1} = -i \) (since \( i^{-1} = \frac{1}{i} = -i \))  
- \( i^{-2} = -1 \)  
- \( i^{-3} = i \)  
- \( i^{-4} = 1 \)  
Thus, the cycle for any integer exponent is: 1, i, -1, -i, repeating every 4 terms.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of terms and structure of the sum from \( i^{-100} \) to \( i^{100} \).  
Description: I will calculate the total number of terms in the sum and see how many complete cycles of 4 are present, then identify any leftover terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The exponents range from -100 to 100, inclusive. The total number of terms is:  
\( 100 - (-100) + 1 = 201 \) terms.  
Since the powers of \( i \) repeat every 4 terms, I divide 201 by 4 to find the number of complete cycles and any remainder:  
\( 201 \div 4 = 50 \) cycles with a remainder of 1 term (since \( 4 \cdot 50 = 200 \), leaving 1 extra term).  
Next, I determine where the cycles align by finding the starting point of the exponents modulo 4. For \( n = -100 \), compute \( -100 \mod 4 \):  
\( -100 \div 4 = -25 \), so \( -100 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), corresponding to \( i^0 = 1 \).  
The sequence starts at \( i^{-100} = 1 \), and the 201st term is \( i^{100} \), which is also \( 100 \mod 4 = 0 \), so \( i^{100} = 1 \).  
Since there are 50 complete cycles (covering 200 terms), each cycle sums to \( 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0 \). The remaining 1 term is \( i^{100} = 1 \).

Current Goal: Compute the sum based on cycles and remaining terms.

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute the final sum using the cycle sums and the remaining term.  
Description: I will sum the values of the 50 complete cycles (each summing to 0) and add the value of the remaining term \( i^{100} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
As established, each cycle of 4 terms sums to:  
\( 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = 0 \).  
There are 50 complete cycles, so their total sum is:  
\( 50 \cdot 0 = 0 \).  
The remaining term is the 201st term, which is \( i^{100} = 1 \).  
Therefore, the total sum is:  
\( 0 + 1 = 1 \).

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed sum.  
Description: I will double-check the number of terms, the cycle alignment, and the sum to ensure no errors in calculation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let me verify the range and cycles:  
- Exponents from -100 to 100 inclusive are indeed 201 terms.  
- \( i^{-100} = i^{4 \cdot (-25)} = (i^4)^{-25} = 1^{-25} = 1 \), confirming the starting point.  
- 200 terms form 50 cycles, each summing to 0.  
- The 201st term is \( i^{100} = 1 \).  
To further validate, consider a smaller range, say from \( i^{-4} \) to \( i^{4} \):  
Terms: \( i^{-4}=1, i^{-3}=i, i^{-2}=-1, i^{-1}=-i, i^0=1, i^1=i, i^2=-1, i^3=-i, i^4=1 \).  
Sum: \( 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) + 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) + 1 = (1-1+1) + (i-i) + (-1+1) + (-i+i) = 1 \).  
This has 9 terms (2 cycles of 4 = 8 terms, sum to 0, plus 1 extra term \( i^4=1 \)), total sum = 1, which matches my method.  
Thus, for the original problem with 201 terms (50 cycles + 1 term), the sum should be 1.  
The final answer is \( 1 \).
