**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) for which the fractions \(\frac{3+x}{5+x}\) and \(\frac{1+x}{2+x}\) are equal.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Set the two fractions equal to each other to form an equation.
2. Solve the equation for \( x \).
3. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid and does not make the denominators zero.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set the two fractions equal and solve for \( x \).
Description: Create an equation by equating \(\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}\), then solve for \( x \) using algebraic methods such as cross-multiplication or clearing denominators.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}\), cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[
(3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x)
\]
Expand both sides:
- Left: \((3+x)(2+x) = 6 + 3x + 2x + x^2 = x^2 + 5x + 6\)
- Right: \((1+x)(5+x) = 5 + 5x + x + x^2 = x^2 + 6x + 5\)

Equate and simplify:
\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5
\]
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
5x + 6 = 6x + 5
\]
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[
6 = 6x + 5
\]
Subtract 5:
\[
1 = 6x
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
x = \frac{1}{6}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \).
Description: Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) into both fractions to check if they are equal and ensure the denominators are not zero.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{6} \):
- Left fraction: \(\frac{3 + \frac{1}{6}}{5 + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{18}{6} + \frac{1}{6}}{\frac{30}{6} + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{19}{6}}{\frac{31}{6}} = \frac{19}{31}\)
- Right fraction: \(\frac{1 + \frac{1}{6}}{2 + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{6}{6} + \frac{1}{6}}{\frac{12}{6} + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{7}{6}}{\frac{13}{6}} = \frac{7}{13}\)

Since \(\frac{19}{31} \neq \frac{7}{13}\), the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) does not make the fractions equal. Check denominators:
- \( 5 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{31}{6} \neq 0 \)
- \( 2 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{13}{6} \neq 0 \)

The solution is invalid. There may be an error or no solution exists.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Backtrack (Planning)
Since the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) is invalid, return to the equation setup and re-evaluate the algebraic steps for potential errors or consider if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Re-solve the equation \(\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}\) carefully.
Description: Reattempt solving by cross-multiplying again and carefully simplifying to catch any errors.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the cross-multiplication:
\[
(3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x)
\]
Expand:
- Left: \( x^2 + 5x + 6 \)
- Right: \( x^2 + 6x + 5 \)

Equate:
\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5
\]
Simplify:
\[
5x + 6 = 6x + 5
\]
\[
6 - 5 = 6x - 5x
\]
\[
1 = x
\]
So, \( x = 1 \). The previous step had an arithmetic error (dividing incorrectly led to \( x = \frac{1}{6} \)).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 1 \).
Description: Substitute \( x = 1 \) into both fractions to check equality and denominator validity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 1 \):
- Left fraction: \(\frac{3 + 1}{5 + 1} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}\)
- Right fraction: \(\frac{1 + 1}{2 + 1} = \frac{2}{3}\)

Since \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\), the fractions are equal. Check denominators:
- \( 5 + 1 = 6 \neq 0 \)
- \( 2 + 1 = 3 \neq 0 \)

The solution \( x = 1 \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \( x \) such that \(\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Set up and solve the equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the solution (completed).
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as \( x = 1 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) for which \(\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}\) is \( x = 1 \).
