**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) for which the expressions \( \frac{3+x}{5+x} \) and \( \frac{1+x}{2+x} \) are equal.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation \( \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \).  
- Subgoal 1: Set up the equation by equating the two fractions.  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
- Subgoal 3: Verify the solution to ensure it is valid and does not make the denominators zero.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation by equating the two fractions and simplify it to a solvable form. This will be achieved by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions and then simplifying the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \]  
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:  
\[ (3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x) \]  
Expand both sides:  
Left side: \( (3+x)(2+x) = 6 + 3x + 2x + x^2 = x^2 + 5x + 6 \)  
Right side: \( (1+x)(5+x) = 5 + 5x + x + x^2 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \)  
Equate the expanded expressions:  
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \]  
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:  
\[ 5x + 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:  
\[ 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
Subtract 5 from both sides:  
\[ 1 = 6x \]  
Divide by 6:  
\[ x = \frac{1}{6} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) by substituting it into the original equation and checking if the denominators are non-zero to ensure the solution is valid.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) into both expressions:  
Left side: \( \frac{3 + \frac{1}{6}}{5 + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{18}{6} + \frac{1}{6}}{\frac{30}{6} + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{19}{6}}{\frac{31}{6}} = \frac{19}{31} \)  
Right side: \( \frac{1 + \frac{1}{6}}{2 + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{6}{6} + \frac{1}{6}}{\frac{12}{6} + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{7}{6}}{\frac{13}{6}} = \frac{7}{13} \)  
Since \( \frac{19}{31} \neq \frac{7}{13} \), the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) does not satisfy the equation.  
Check the denominators:  
- \( 5 + x = 5 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{31}{6} \neq 0 \)  
- \( 2 + x = 2 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{13}{6} \neq 0 \)  
The denominators are non-zero, so \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) is defined, but it is not a valid solution since the fractions are not equal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
Since the solution \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) was invalid, return to the equation \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \) and re-evaluate the steps to identify any errors or alternative approaches.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \). Retrieve and summarize information from previous steps related to solving this equation to identify any mistakes or missed solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
From Step 2, the equation was simplified to:  
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \]  
This led to:  
\[ 5x + 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
\[ 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
\[ 1 = 6x \]  
\[ x = \frac{1}{6} \]  
In Step 3, substituting \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) showed the fractions were not equal, indicating a potential error. Reviewing the algebra:  
The expansion and simplification in Step 2 appear correct:  
- Left side: \( (3+x)(2+x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 \)  
- Right side: \( (1+x)(5+x) = x^2 + 6x + 5 \)  
The simplification to \( 6 = 6x + 5 \) is algebraically sound. The issue may be that the equation has no solutions, or an alternative method should be considered.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to explore an alternative method to solve \( \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \) by equating the numerators after adjusting the fractions to have the same denominator, and to confirm if there are no solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are \( 5+x \) and \( 2+x \), so the least common denominator is \( (5+x)(2+x) \). Rewrite the equation:  
\[ \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( (5+x)(2+x) \):  
\[ (3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x) \]  
This is the same equation as in Step 2, confirming the algebraic approach. Instead, try another method by assuming the fractions are equal and test for possible solutions directly or consider if the equation has no solutions. Subtract one fraction from the other:  
\[ \frac{3+x}{5+x} - \frac{1+x}{2+x} = 0 \]  
Combine over the common denominator \( (5+x)(2+x) \):  
\[ \frac{(3+x)(2+x) - (1+x)(5+x)}{(5+x)(2+x)} = 0 \]  
Since the denominator cannot be zero (\( x \neq -5, -2 \)), the numerator must be zero:  
\[ (3+x)(2+x) - (1+x)(5+x) = 0 \]  
This simplifies to the same equation as before, so let’s try solving by assuming the numerators are proportional or test boundary conditions. Alternatively, analyze the equation’s behavior:  
The equation \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \) simplified to \( x = \frac{1}{6} \), but it didn’t satisfy the original equation. To confirm if there are no solutions, consider the function:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{3+x}{5+x} - \frac{1+x}{2+x} \]  
If \( f(x) = 0 \), the fractions are equal. Since \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) was invalid, test other values or analyze the function’s roots. Numerical testing or graphing could help, but algebraically, the linear equation suggests a single root, which was invalid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( x \) such that \( \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up and solve the equation (Step 2, completed but solution invalid).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the solution (Step 3, found \( x = \frac{1}{6} \) invalid).  
  - Subgoal 3: Backtrack and re-evaluate the equation (Step 4, completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Recall previous steps to identify errors (Step 5, confirmed algebra but no valid solution).  
  - Subgoal 5: Try alternative method to confirm no solutions (Step 6, ongoing).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm if there are no solutions or find any missed solutions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to definitively determine if there are no solutions by re-checking the algebra and considering the possibility that the fractions never equal each other, possibly using a different algebraic approach or analyzing the function’s behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Revisit the equation:  
\[ \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \]  
Cross-multiply again to ensure no mistakes:  
\[ (3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x) \]  
Expand:  
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 5x + 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
\[ 6 - 5 = 6x - 5x \]  
\[ 1 = x \]  
This suggests \( x = 1 \), not \( x = \frac{1}{6} \), indicating an error in Step 2’s simplification. Correct the mistake:  
From \( 5x + 6 = 6x + 5 \):  
\[ 6 - 5 = 6x - 5x \]  
\[ 1 = x \]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \):  
Left side: \( \frac{3+1}{5+1} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)  
Right side: \( \frac{1+1}{2+1} = \frac{2}{3} \)  
Since \( \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \), the solution \( x = 1 \) is valid. Check denominators:  
- \( 5 + 1 = 6 \neq 0 \)  
- \( 2 + 1 = 3 \neq 0 \)  
The solution is defined. To ensure completeness, check if other solutions exist by solving the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = x^2 + 6x + 5 \]  
\[ 5x + 6 = 6x + 5 \]  
This is linear, confirming a single solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate \( x = 1 \) thoroughly and confirm no other solutions exist by checking the equation and denominators.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-verify \( x = 1 \):  
\[ \frac{3+1}{5+1} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
\[ \frac{1+1}{2+1} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
The fractions are equal, and denominators are non-zero. To confirm no other solutions, note that the equation reduced to a linear equation, indicating a single root. Alternatively, consider the function:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{3+x}{5+x} - \frac{1+x}{2+x} \]  
The numerator after combining is:  
\[ (3+x)(2+x) - (1+x)(5+x) = (x^2 + 5x + 6) - (x^2 + 6x + 5) = 5x + 6 - 6x - 5 = -x + 1 \]  
So:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{-x + 1}{(5+x)(2+x)} \]  
Set \( f(x) = 0 \):  
\[ -x + 1 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 1 \]  
Denominators are zero at \( x = -5, -2 \), which are not solutions. The linear numerator confirms a single root.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) for which \( \frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x} \) is \( x = 1 \).  
\[ \boxed{1} \]
