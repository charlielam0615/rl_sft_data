**Problem Restatement**: The math club has 6 boys and 8 girls, and a team of 6 people must be selected for a state math competition, consisting of exactly 3 boys and 3 girls. Determine the number of ways to form such a team.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 6 boys.  
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 girls from 8 girls.  
3. Multiply the results to find the total number of ways to form the team.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 6 boys. This can be achieved using the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the combination formula:  
\( C(6, 3) = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 3!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \).  
There are 20 ways to choose 3 boys from 6 boys.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 girls from 8 girls. This can be achieved using the combination formula \( C(n, k) \), where \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the combination formula:  
\( C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5!}{3! \cdot 5!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \).  
There are 56 ways to choose 3 girls from 8 girls.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of ways to form the team by multiplying the number of ways to choose 3 boys and 3 girls. This can be achieved by multiplying the results from the previous steps: 20 (boys) and 56 (girls).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Multiply the number of ways:  
\( 20 \cdot 56 = 1120 \).  
There are 1120 ways to form a team of 3 boys and 3 girls.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculations. This can be achieved by rechecking the combination calculations and the multiplication step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Recheck \( C(6, 3) \): \( \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( C(8, 3) \): \( \frac{8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \). Correct.  
- Recheck multiplication: \( 20 \cdot 56 = 1120 \). Correct.  
The calculations are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the number of ways to select a team of 3 boys and 3 girls from 6 boys and 8 girls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 6 boys (completed: 20 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 girls from 8 girls (completed: 56 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply the results to find the total number of ways (completed: 1120 ways).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 1120 ways to select a team of 3 boys and 3 girls from 6 boys and 8 girls.
