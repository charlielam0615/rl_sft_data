### Problem Statement
We need to find two positive integers that are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), each less than 20, such that the product of the integers plus their sum equals 95. We are tasked with finding the sum of these two integers. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
1. Translate the problem into a mathematical equation based on the given condition.  
2. Identify constraints: the integers are positive, relatively prime, and less than 20.  
3. Solve the equation while ensuring the constraints are met.  
4. Compute the sum of the two integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to translate the problem into a mathematical equation. Define variables for the two integers and express the condition "the product of two positive integers plus their sum is 95" as an equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the two positive integers be \( x \) and \( y \). The problem states that their product plus their sum equals 95, so we can write the equation:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = 95 \]  
This can be rewritten as:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 = 95 \]  
Thus:  
\[ (x + 1)(y + 1) = 96 \]  
The integers \( x \) and \( y \) must be positive, less than 20, and relatively prime (i.e., \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \)).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to find pairs of positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( (x + 1)(y + 1) = 96 \), with \( x, y < 20 \) and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). Since \( x + 1 \) and \( y + 1 \) are factors of 96, identify all factor pairs of 96 and derive corresponding \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
We need to find pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( a \cdot b = 96 \), where \( a = x + 1 \), \( b = y + 1 \), and \( x, y \) are positive integers less than 20, with \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). First, list the factor pairs of 96:  
\[ 96 = 1 \cdot 96, 2 \cdot 48, 3 \cdot 32, 4 \cdot 24, 6 \cdot 16, 8 \cdot 12, 12 \cdot 8, 16 \cdot 6, 24 \cdot 4, 32 \cdot 3, 48 \cdot 2, 96 \cdot 1 \]  
For each pair \( (a, b) \), compute \( x = a - 1 \), \( y = b - 1 \), and check if \( x, y \geq 1 \) and \( x, y < 20 \):  
- \( (1, 96) \): \( x = 1 - 1 = 0 \), \( y = 96 - 1 = 95 \). Invalid, as \( x = 0 \) is not positive, and \( y = 95 > 20 \).  
- \( (2, 48) \): \( x = 2 - 1 = 1 \), \( y = 48 - 1 = 47 \). Invalid, as \( y = 47 > 20 \).  
- \( (3, 32) \): \( x = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \( ying y = 32 - 1 = 31 \). Invalid, as \( y = 31 > 20 \).  
- \( (4, 24) \): \( x = 4 - 1 = 3 \), \( y = 24 - 1 = 23 \). Invalid, as \( y = 23 > 20 \).  
- \( (6, 16) \): \( x = 6 - 1 = 5 \), \( y = 16 - 1 = 15 \). Valid: \( x = 5 \), \( y = 15 < 20 \).  
- \( (8, 12) \): \( x = 8 - 1 = 7 \), \( y = 12 - 1 = 11 \). Valid: \( x = 7 \), \( y = 11 < 20 \).  
- \( (12, 8) \): Same as \( (8, 12) \): \( x = 11 \), \( y = 7 \).  
- \( (16, 6) \): Same as \( (6, 16) \): \( x = 15 \), \( y = 5 \).  
- Higher pairs (e.g., \( (24, 4) \)) yield \( y \geq 20 \), so they are invalid.  
Now, check the valid pairs for the condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \):  
- For \( (x, y) = (5, 15) \): \( \gcd(5, 15) = 5 \neq 1 \). Not relatively prime.  
- For \( (x, y) = (7, 11) \): \( \gcd(7, 11) = 1 \). Relatively prime.  
Verify the equation for \( x = 7 \), \( y = 11 \):  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = 7 \cdot 11 + 7 + 11 = 77 + 7 + 11 = 95 \]  
This satisfies the condition.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 7 \), \( y = 11 \) by checking all constraints and ensuring no other valid pairs exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The pair \( (x, y) = (7, 11) \) satisfies:  
- \( x \cdot y + x + y = 7 \cdot 11 + 7 + 11 = 77 + 18 = 95 \).  
- Both \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 11 \) are less than 20.  
- \( \gcd(7, 11) = 1 \), so they are relatively prime.  
To ensure completeness, reconsider other factor pairs of 96:  
- \( (5, 15) \): \( \gcd(5, 15) = 5 \neq 1 \). Not relatively prime.  
- Other pairs yield at least one number \( \geq 20 \) or are duplicates (e.g., \( (11, 7) \)).  
No other pairs satisfy all conditions. Thus, \( (7, 11) \) is the only solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the sum of the two integers \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 11 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of the integers is:  
\[ x + y = 7 + 11 = 18 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of two positive integers that are relatively prime, each less than 20, whose product plus their sum equals 95.  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the problem into a mathematical equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify valid pairs of integers satisfying the equation and constraints (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of the integers (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer, which is the sum of the integers (18).  
The solution process is complete, and the sum \( 7 + 11 = 18 \) satisfies all conditions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The sum of the two integers is 18.
