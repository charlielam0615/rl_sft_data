**Problem Restatement**: We need to find two positive integers that are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), each less than 20, such that the product of the two integers plus their sum equals 95. We are tasked with determining the sum of these two integers. The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and formatting responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Define the mathematical equation based on the problem statement.  
2. Identify constraints: the integers are positive, relatively prime, and less than 20.  
3. Solve the equation while ensuring the constraints are met.  
4. Compute the sum of the two integers.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the mathematical equation. Let the two integers be \( x \) and \( y \). The problem states their product plus their sum equals 95, so the equation is \( x \cdot y + x + y = 95 \). Simplify this to a form suitable for solving, and note the constraints: \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers less than 20 and relatively prime (GCD(\( x, y \)) = 1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = 95 \]  
This can be factored as:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y = x(y + 1) + y = 95 \]  
Alternatively, rewrite it as:  
\[ x \cdot y + x + y + 1 = 95 + 1 \]  
\[ (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 = 95 \]  
\[ (x + 1)(y + 1) = 96 \]  
Thus, we need pairs of positive integers \( (x + 1, y + 1) \) whose product is 96, where \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers less than 20, and GCD(\( x, y \)) = 1.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find pairs of positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( (x + 1)(y + 1) = 96 \), with \( x, y < 20 \), and GCD(\( x, y \)) = 1. Achieve this by finding factor pairs of 96 and checking which pairs satisfy the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Find the factor pairs of 96:  
\[ 96 = 1 \times 96, 2 \times 48, 3 \times 32, 4 \times 24, 6 \times 16, 8 \times 12 \]  
For each pair \( (a, b) \) where \( a \cdot b = 96 \), let \( x + 1 = a \), \( y + 1 = b \), so \( x = a - 1 \), \( y = b - 1 \). Check each pair:  
- \( (1, 96) \): \( x = 0 \), \( y = 95 \). Invalid: \( x = 0 \) is not positive, and \( y = 95 > 20 \).  
- \( (2, 48) \): \( x = 1 \), \( y = 47 \). Invalid: \( y = 47 > 20 \).  
- \( (3, 32) \): \( x = 2 \), \( y = 31 \). Invalid: \( y = 31 > 20 \).  
- \( (4, 24) \): \( x = 3 \), \( y = 23 \). Invalid: \( y = 23 > 20 \).  
- \( (6, 16) \): \( x = 5 \), \( y = 15 \). Valid: \( x = 5 < 20 \), \( y = 15 < 20 \).  
- \( (8, 12) \): \( x = 7 \), \( y = 11 \). Valid: \( x = 7 < 20 \), \( y = 11 < 20 \).  
Pairs to check further: \( (x, y) = (5, 15) \) and \( (7, 11) \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the pairs \( (x, y) = (5, 15) \) and \( (7, 11) \) satisfy the equation \( x \cdot y + x + y = 95 \) and the relatively prime condition (GCD(\( x, y \)) = 1).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each pair:  
- For \( (x, y) = (5, 15) \):  
  \[ 5 \cdot 15 + 5 + 15 = 75 + 5 + 15 = 95 \]  
  Equation satisfied. Check GCD: GCD(5, 15) = 5 â‰  1. Not relatively prime.  
- For \( (x, y) = (7, 11) \):  
  \[ 7 \cdot 11 + 7 + 11 = 77 + 7 + 11 = 95 \]  
  Equation satisfied. Check GCD: GCD(7, 11) = 1 (since 7 and 11 are prime). Relatively prime.  
Pair \( (7, 11) \) satisfies all conditions.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if other factor pairs of 96 yield valid solutions and confirm the pair \( (7, 11) \) is unique given the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconsider factor pairs of 96, including those where \( a \leq b \):  
- \( (12, 8) \): \( x = 11 \), \( y = 7 \). Same as \( (7, 11) \), already checked.  
- \( (16, 6) \): \( x = 15 \), \( y = 5 \). Same as \( (5, 15) \), GCD = 5, not relatively prime.  
- \( (24, 4) \): \( x = 23 \), \( y = 3 \). Invalid: \( x = 23 > 20 \).  
- Higher pairs (e.g., \( (32, 3) \), \( (48, 2) \), \( (96, 1) \)) yield at least one number \( \geq 20 \).  
No other pairs satisfy \( x, y < 20 \) and GCD(\( x, y \)) = 1. Confirm \( (7, 11) \) is the only valid pair.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of two positive integers whose product plus their sum is 95, are relatively prime, and each less than 20.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the equation (completed: \( (x + 1)(y + 1) = 96 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find factor pairs of 96 and derive \( x, y \) (completed: pairs \( (5, 15) \), \( (7, 11) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify pairs for equation and constraints (completed: only \( (7, 11) \) valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the integers \( x = 7 \), \( y = 11 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the integers \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 11 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ 7 + 11 = 18 \]  
The sum of the two integers is 18.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the two integers is 18.
