**Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the probability that exactly three out of ten 6-sided dice show a 1 when rolled, and express the answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling ten 6-sided dice.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show a 1.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
4. Round the probability to the nearest thousandth.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling ten 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 faces, and the rolls are independent, so we calculate the total outcomes as 6 raised to the power of 10.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 6 possible outcomes, and there are 10 dice. The total number of possible outcomes is:  
\[ 6^{10} = 60,466,176 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show a 1. This is a binomial probability problem, where we need the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 10 to show a 1, with each 1 having a probability of 1/6, and the remaining 7 dice showing any number other than 1 (probability 5/6).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
This is a binomial probability scenario with \( n = 10 \), \( k = 3 \), probability of success (rolling a 1) \( p = \frac{1}{6} \), and probability of failure (not rolling a 1) \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \). The number of favorable outcomes is given by the binomial coefficient multiplied by the probabilities:  
- Number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 10: \( \binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 120 \).  
- Probability for each favorable outcome: \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^7 \).  
So, the probability is:  
\[ P = \binom{10}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^7 = 120 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^7 \].  
Calculate:  
- \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216} \).  
- \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^7 = \frac{5^7}{6^7} = \frac{78125}{279936} \).  
- Combine: \( P = 120 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{78125}{279936} \).  
- Numerator: \( 120 \cdot 78125 = 9,375,000 \).  
- Denominator: \( 216 \cdot 279936 = 60,466,176 \).  
- So, \( P = \frac{9,375,000}{60,466,176} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total outcomes and convert it to a decimal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ P = \frac{9,375,000}{60,466,176} \approx 0.15500686 \].  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to round the probability to the nearest thousandth (three decimal places).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The probability is approximately 0.15500686. Rounding to the nearest thousandth:  
- The third decimal place is 5, and the fourth decimal place is 0, followed by a 0, so we check the next digit (6), which suggests rounding up.  
- Thus, 0.15500686 rounds to 0.155.
