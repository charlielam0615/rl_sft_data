**Problem Statement**: Given that the pairwise sums of three numbers are 29, 46, and 53, find the sum of all three numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the sum of the three numbers.  
- Subgoal 1: Define the three numbers as variables, say \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
- Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the given pairwise sums: \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), \(b + c = 53\).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
- Subgoal 4: Calculate the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), \(b + c = 53\) to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). This can be achieved by adding all equations to relate the sum of the numbers and then solving for individual values if needed.

[IMP]  
Add the given equations:  
\[
(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 29 + 46 + 53
\]
This simplifies to:  
\[
2a + 2b + 2c = 128
\]
\[
a + b + c = 64
\]
The sum of the three numbers is 64. To ensure correctness, proceed to find individual values:  
Subtract \(a + b = 29\) from \(a + b + c = 64\):  
\[
(a + b + c) - (a + b) = 64 - 29 \implies c = 35
\]
Subtract \(a + c = 46\) from \(a + b + c = 64\):  
\[
(a + b + c) - (a + c) = 64 - 46 \implies b = 18
\]
Subtract \(b + c = 53\) from \(a + b + c = 64\):  
\[
(a + b + c) - (b + c) = 64 - 53 \implies a = 11
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(a = 11\), \(b = 18\), and \(c = 35\) satisfy the original equations \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), and \(b + c = 53\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the equations:  
- \(a + b = 11 + 18 = 29\), which matches.  
- \(a + c = 11 + 35 = 46\), which matches.  
- \(b + c = 18 + 35 = 53\), which matches.  
The values satisfy all given equations, confirming the solution is correct. The sum of the numbers is \(a + b + c = 11 + 18 + 35 = 64\).
