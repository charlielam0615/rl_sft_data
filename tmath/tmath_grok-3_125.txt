**Problem Restatement**: We need to find three numbers whose pairwise sums are 29, 46, and 53, and then determine the sum of these three numbers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the three numbers as variables.  
2. Set up equations based on the given pairwise sums.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the numbers.  
4. Calculate the sum of the three numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the three numbers and set up equations based on the pairwise sums.  
**How to Achieve**: Let the three numbers be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The pairwise sums are given as \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), and \(b + c = 53\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the three numbers be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Based on the problem:  
- \(a + b = 29\)  
- \(a + c = 46\)  
- \(b + c = 53\)  
These equations represent the pairwise sums of the three numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use algebraic methods (e.g., substitution or elimination) to solve the system of equations: \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), \(b + c = 53\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We have the following system of equations:  
1. \(a + b = 29\)  
2. \(a + c = 46\)  
3. \(b + c = 53\)  

To solve, add all three equations:  
\[
(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 29 + 46 + 53
\]
This simplifies to:  
\[
2a + 2b + 2c = 128
\]
\[
a + b + c = 64
\]
Now, we need the individual values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Subtract the first equation from this result:  
\[
(a + b + c) - (a + b) = 64 - 29
\]
\[
c = 35
\]
Substitute \(c = 35\) into the second equation:  
\[
a + 35 = 46 \implies a = 46 - 35 = 11
\]
Substitute \(c = 35\) into the third equation:  
\[
b + 35 = 53 \implies b = 53 - 35 = 18
\]
So, the three numbers are \(a = 11\), \(b = 18\), and \(c = 35\).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the numbers \(a = 11\), \(b = 18\), and \(c = 35\) satisfy the given pairwise sums.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the equations \(a + b = 29\), \(a + c = 46\), and \(b + c = 53\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the pairwise sums:  
- \(a + b = 11 + 18 = 29\), which matches.  
- \(a + c = 11 + 35 = 46\), which matches.  
- \(b + c = 18 + 35 = 53\), which matches.  
The numbers \(11\), \(18\), and \(35\) satisfy all given conditions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the three numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) found in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The three numbers are \(11\), \(18\), and \(35\). Their sum is:  
\[
11 + 18 + 35 = 64
\]
[/IMP]
