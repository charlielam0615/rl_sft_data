**Problem Restatement**: BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January, and each subsequent month (February, March, April, May), they built twice the number of canoes as the previous month. We need to calculate the total number of canoes built by the end of May.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of canoes built each month from January to May.  
2. Sum the canoes built across all five months to find the total.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of canoes built each month from January to May.  
How to Achieve: Since the number of canoes doubles each month starting with 7 in January, compute the canoes for each month as follows: January = 7, February = 7 × 2, March = 7 × 2², April = 7 × 2³, May = 7 × 2⁴.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- January: 7 canoes  
- February: 7 × 2 = 14 canoes  
- March: 7 × 2² = 7 × 4 = 28 canoes  
- April: 7 × 2³ = 7 × 8 = 56 canoes  
- May: 7 × 2⁴ = 7 × 16 = 112 canoes  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the monthly canoe calculations.  
How to Achieve: Check if each month’s canoe count is twice the previous month’s, starting from January’s 7 canoes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- January: 7 (given).  
- February: 14 ÷ 7 = 2, correct.  
- March: 28 ÷ 14 = 2, correct.  
- April: 56 ÷ 28 = 2, correct.  
- May: 112 ÷ 56 = 2, correct.  
The calculations follow the doubling pattern, so they are valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the canoes built from January to May to find the total.  
How to Achieve: Add the canoes for each month: 7 (Jan) + 14 (Feb) + 28 (Mar) + 56 (Apr) + 112 (May).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
7 + 14 = 21  
21 + 28 = 49  
49 + 56 = 105  
105 + 112 = 217  
Total canoes built by the end of May: 217.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of canoes built each month (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum the canoes to find the total (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is completed, as the total (217 canoes) has been calculated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the total sum of canoes.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the sum using an alternative method, such as recognizing the sequence as a geometric series: 7 + 7×2 + 7×2² + 7×2³ + 7×2⁴ = 7 × (1 + 2 + 2² + 2³ + 2⁴).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence is a geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2, and 5 terms:  
1 + 2 + 2² + 2³ + 2⁴ = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31.  
Total canoes = 7 × 31 = 217.  
This matches the previous sum, confirming the total is 217 canoes.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: BoatsRUs built a total of 217 canoes by the end of May.
