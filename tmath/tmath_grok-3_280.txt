**Problem Statement**: BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January, and each subsequent month they built twice the number of canoes as the previous month. We need to calculate the total number of canoes built by the end of May.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the total number of canoes built from January to May.  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the number of canoes built each month from January to May.  
- Subgoal 2: Sum the number of canoes built across these months to get the total.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of canoes built each month from January to May.  
**How to Achieve**: The number of canoes doubles each month, starting with 7 in January. This forms a geometric sequence where each monthâ€™s production is 7 * 2^(n-1), where n is the month number (January = 1, February = 2, ..., May = 5). Calculate the canoes for each month.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- January (n=1): 7 * 2^(1-1) = 7 * 2^0 = 7 canoes  
- February (n=2): 7 * 2^(2-1) = 7 * 2^1 = 14 canoes  
- March (n=3): 7 * 2^(3-1) = 7 * 2^2 = 28 canoes  
- April (n=4): 7 * 2^(4-1) = 7 * 2^3 = 56 canoes  
- May (n=5): 7 * 2^(5-1) = 7 * 2^4 = 112 canoes  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sum the number of canoes built from January to May to find the total.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the number of canoes calculated for each month: 7 (Jan) + 14 (Feb) + 28 (Mar) + 56 (Apr) + 112 (May). Alternatively, recognize this as a geometric series with first term 7, common ratio 2, and 5 terms, and use the geometric series sum formula: S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a = 7, r = 2, n = 5.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the geometric series formula:  
- S = 7 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7 * (32 - 1) / 1 = 7 * 31 = 217  
Alternatively, summing directly:  
- 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217  
Both methods confirm the total is 217 canoes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the total number of canoes calculated.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the monthly calculations for errors and confirm the sum using both the direct addition and geometric series formula to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Recheck monthly calculations:  
  - Jan: 7 * 2^0 = 7  
  - Feb: 7 * 2^1 = 14  
  - Mar: 7 * 2^2 = 28  
  - Apr: 7 * 2^3 = 56  
  - May: 7 * 2^4 = 112  
- Sum: 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217  
- Geometric series: S = 7 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7 * 31 = 217  
Both methods agree, confirming the total is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of canoes built each month (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum the canoes to find the total (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculations (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Completed all subgoals; the total number of canoes is 217.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: BoatsRUs built a total of 217 canoes by the end of May.
