**Problem Statement:** We need to solve the equation \(361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x\) for the value of \(x\).

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve for \(x\). The equation involves addition and multiplication, so the first subgoal is to compute the product \(2 \times 19 \times 6\). The second subgoal is to add the result to 361 and 36 to find the value of \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the product \(2 \times 19 \times 6\).  
Description: I will first multiply 19 by 6, then multiply the result by 2 to get the final product.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let's calculate the product step by step. First, \(19 \times 6 = 114\). Then, multiply this result by 2: \(114 \times 2 = 228\). So, the value of \(2 \times 19 \times 6\) is 228.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the sum of 361, the product (228), and 36 to find \(x\).  
Description: I will add the numbers in sequence, starting with 361 and 228, then adding 36 to the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Now, let's add the numbers together. First, \(361 + 228 = 589\). Then, add 36 to this sum: \(589 + 36 = 625\). Therefore, \(x = 625\).

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation for \(x\).  
Description: I will recompute each part of the equation and confirm the sum to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let's validate the solution. Recompute the product: \(19 \times 6 = 114\), and \(114 \times 2 = 228\). Now, add the numbers again: \(361 + 228 = 589\), and \(589 + 36 = 625\). The equation becomes \(361 + 228 + 36 = 625\), which matches our result for \(x\). The solution is correct.

**Step 5:**
