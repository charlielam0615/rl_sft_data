**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x \) for \( x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the product \( 19 \times 6 \).  
2. Multiply the result by 2.  
3. Add 361 to the result.  
4. Add 36 to the final sum to find \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the product \( 19 \times 6 \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply 19 by 6 using standard arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 19 \times 6 \):  
\( 19 \times 6 = 114 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Multiply the result from the previous step by 2, i.e., compute \( 2 \times 114 \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply 114 by 2 using standard arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 2 \times 114 \):  
\( 2 \times 114 = 228 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add 361 to the result from the previous step, i.e., compute \( 228 + 361 \).  
How to Achieve: Add 228 and 361 using standard arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 228 + 361 \):  
\( 228 + 361 = 589 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add 36 to the result from the previous step, i.e., compute \( 589 + 36 \).  
How to Achieve: Add 589 and 36 using standard arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 589 + 36 \):  
\( 589 + 36 = 625 \).  
Thus, \( x = 625 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by recomputing the expression to ensure \( x = 625 \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute \( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 \) step-by-step and check if the result equals 625.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the expression:  
1. \( 19 \times 6 = 114 \).  
2. \( 2 \times 114 = 228 \).  
3. \( 228 + 361 = 589 \).  
4. \( 589 + 36 = 625 \).  
The result is 625, which matches \( x = 625 \). The solution is valid.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 19 \times 6 \). (Completed: Result = 114)  
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply by 2, i.e., \( 2 \times 114 \). (Completed: Result = 228)  
  - Subgoal 3: Add 361, i.e., \( 228 + 361 \). (Completed: Result = 589)  
  - Subgoal 4: Add 36, i.e., \( 589 + 36 \). (Completed: Result = 625)  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solution. (Completed: Validated \( x = 625 \))  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, solution found).
