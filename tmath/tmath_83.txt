Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the value of $\sqrt[4]{16}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$\sqrt[4]{16}$ means the 4th root of 16, which is the number that when raised to the 4th power equals 16.  
We know $2^4 = 16$, so $\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$.

The results from the previous steps are:  
- $\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$  
- $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$  
- $\sqrt{4} = 2$  

Now multiply these values together:  
$$
2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8
$$  
The final answer is 8.

[VERIFY]
1. **Evaluating $\sqrt[4]{16}$**:  
   - 16 is $2^4$, so taking the 4th root of $2^4$ yields $2$.  
   - Verification: $2^4 = 16$ ✔️  

2. **Evaluating $\sqrt[3]{8}$**:  
   - 8 is $2^3$, so taking the 3rd root of $2^3$ yields $2$.  
   - Verification: $2^3 = 8$ ✔️  

3. **Evaluating $\sqrt{4}$**:  
   - 4 is $2^2$, so taking the square root of $2^2$ yields $2$.  
   - Verification: $2^2 = 4$ ✔️  

4. **Final Multiplication**:  
   - $2 \cdot 2 = 4$, and $4 \cdot 2 = 8$.  
   - Verification: All intermediate products align with basic arithmetic rules ✔️  

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
