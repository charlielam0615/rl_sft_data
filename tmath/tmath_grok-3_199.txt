**Problem Restatement**: We need to find two positive integers whose difference is 6 and whose product is 112, then compute their sum.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the two positive integers in terms of their difference.  
2. Set up equations based on their difference and product.  
3. Solve the equations to find the integers.  
4. Compute the sum of the integers.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current goal: Define the two positive integers and set up equations based on their difference and product.  
How to achieve it: Let the smaller integer be \( x \). Since their difference is 6 6 \), the larger integer is \( x + 6 \). Their product is 112, so set up the equation \( x (x + 6) = 112 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the smaller integer be \( x \). Then the larger integer is \( x + 6 \). Given their product is 112, we write:  
\[ x(x + 6) = 112 \]  
This gives the quadratic equation:  
\[ x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current goal: Solve the quadratic equation to find the integers.  
How to achieve it: Solve \( x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula or factoring, ensuring solutions are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = -112 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = 6^2 - 4(1)(-112) = 36 + 448 = 484 \]  
\[ x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-28}{2} = -14 \]  
Since \( x \) is a positive integer, \( x = 8 \). The larger integer is \( x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current goal: Verify the solution satisfies the given conditions.  
How to achieve it: Check if the integers 8 and 14 have a difference of 6 and a product of 112.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify:  
- Difference: \( 14 - 8 = 6 \), which satisfies the condition.  
- Product: \( 8 \times 14 = 112 \), which satisfies the condition.  
The integers 8 and 14 are correct.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current goal: Compute the sum of the integers.  
How to achieve it: Add the two integers, 8 and 14.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum: \( 8 + 14 = 22 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of two positive integers whose difference is 6 and product is 112.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the integers and set up equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find the integers (completed: integers are 8 and 14).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: conditions satisfied).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum (completed: sum is 22).  
Current goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The final answer is 22.
