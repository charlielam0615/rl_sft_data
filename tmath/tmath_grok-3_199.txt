**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Define the two positive integers in terms of a variable.  
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions (difference is 6, product is 112).  
3. Solve the equations to find the integers.  
4. Calculate the sum of the integers.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the integers and set up equations based on the given conditions. Let the smaller integer be \( x \). Then, the larger integer is \( x + 6 \) (since their difference is 6). Their product is 112, so we can write the equation \( x (x + 6) = 112 \). Solve this quadratic equation to find the integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the smaller integer be \( x \). Then the larger integer is \( x + 6 \).  
Given their product is 112, we have:  
\[ x (x + 6) = 112 \]  
Expand and rearrange into a quadratic equation:  
\[ x^2 + 6x = 112 \]  
\[ x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = -112 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4(1)(-112) = 36 + 448 = 484 \]  
\[ x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2(1)} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-28}{2} = -14 \]  
Since the integers are positive, discard \( x = -14 \). Thus, \( x = 8 \).  
The integers are \( x = 8 \) and \( x + 6 = 14 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the integers 8 and 14 satisfy both conditions: their difference is 6, and their product is 112.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the difference: \( 14 - 8 = 6 \), which satisfies the condition.  
Check the product: \( 8 \times 14 = 112 \), which satisfies the condition.  
Both conditions are met, so the integers 8 and 14 are correct.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the integers 8 and 14.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of the integers is:  
\[ 8 + 14 = 22 \]
