**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) such that \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n = 8! \), where \( 8! \) is the factorial of 8.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( n \):  
1. Calculate the value of \( 8! \).  
2. Express \( 8! \) in terms of its prime factorization.  
3. Compare the prime factorization of \( 8! \) with \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \).  
4. Solve for \( n \) by isolating it in the equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate \( 8! \) and find its value.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( 8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \) using multiplication.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( 8! \):  
\( 8 \cdot 7 = 56 \)  
\( 56 \cdot 6 = 336 \)  
\( 336 \cdot 5 = 1680 \)  
\( 1680 \cdot 4 = 6720 \)  
\( 6720 \cdot 3 = 20160 \)  
\( 20160 \cdot 2 = 40320 \)  
So, \( 8! = 40320 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the prime factorization of \( 8! = 40320 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize 40320 into its prime factors by dividing by the smallest prime numbers repeatedly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factorize 40320:  
- Divide by 2: \( 40320 \div 2 = 20160 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 20160 \div 2 = 10080 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 10080 \div 2 = 5040 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 5040 \div 2 = 2520 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 2520 \div 2 = 1260 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 1260 \div 2 = 630 \)  
- Divide by 2: \( 630 \div 2 = 315 \)  
- Divide by 3: \( 315 \div 3 = 105 \)  
- Divide by 3: \( 105 \div 3 = 35 \)  
- Divide by 5: \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)  
- Divide by 7: \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)  

So, the prime factorization is:  
\( 40320 = 2^7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \).

**Current Goal**: Compare the prime factorization and solve for \( n \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compare the prime factorization of \( 8! \) with \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \) and solve for \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Set up the equation \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n = 2^7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \), equate the prime factors, and solve for \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given:  
\( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n = 2^7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \)  

Compare the prime factors:  
- For prime 2: Exponent in \( 8! \) is 7, in \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \) is 5. Difference: \( 7 - 5 = 2 \), so \( n \) must contribute \( 2^2 \).  
- For prime 3: Exponent in \( 8! \) is 2, in \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \) is 2. Difference: \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), so \( n \) contributes \( 3^0 = 1 \).  
- For prime 5: Exponent in \( 8! \) is 1, in \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \) is 0. Difference: \( 1 - 0 = 1 \), so \( n \) must contribute \( 5^1 \).  
- For prime 7: Exponent in \( 8! \) is 1, in \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n \) is 0. Difference: \( 1 - 0 = 1 \), so \( n \) must contribute \( 7^1 \).  

Thus, \( n = 2^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \).  
Calculate \( n \):  
\( n = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 20 \cdot 7 = 140 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( n = 140 \) satisfies \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot n = 8! \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 140 \) and check if it equals \( 40320 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 140 \):  
- \( 2^5 = 32 \)  
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( 32 \cdot 9 = 288 \)  
- \( 288 \cdot 140 = 288 \cdot (100 + 40) = 288 \cdot 100 + 288 \cdot 40 = 28800 + 11520 = 40320 \)  

This matches \( 8! = 40320 \).  

Alternatively, verify via prime factorization:  
\( n = 140 = 2^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \)  
So, \( 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 = 2^{5+2} \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 = 2^7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \), which equals the prime factorization of \( 8! \).  

The solution is correct.
