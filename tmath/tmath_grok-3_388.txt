**Problem Statement**: Find the point where the line passing through the points (9, 1) and (5, 5) intersects the x-axis.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the x-axis intersection:  
1. Determine the equation of the line passing through (9, 1) and (5, 5).  
2. Find the point where this line intersects the x-axis by setting y = 0 and solving for x.  
3. Express the intersection point as a coordinate (x, 0).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the equation of the line passing through (9, 1) and (5, 5). This will be achieved by calculating the slope of the line and using the point-slope form to derive the line equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the equation of the line:  
1. Calculate the slope \( m \) using the formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \):  
   \( m = \frac{5 - 1}{5 - 9} = \frac{4}{-4} = -1 \).  
2. Use the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point (9, 1):  
   \( y - 1 = -1(x - 9) \).  
3. Simplify to slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \):  
   \( y - 1 = -x + 9 \),  
   \( y = -x + 9 + 1 \),  
   \( y = -x + 10 \).  
The equation of the line is \( y = -x + 10 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-axis intersection by setting y = 0 in the line equation \( y = -x + 10 \) and solving for x.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set \( y = 0 \) in the equation \( y = -x + 10 \):  
\( 0 = -x + 10 \),  
\( x = 10 \).  
The intersection point is (10, 0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the intersection point (10, 0) is correct by checking if it lies on the line and confirming the x-axis intersection.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
1. Substitute (10, 0) into the line equation \( y = -x + 10 \):  
   \( y = -10 + 10 = 0 \), which satisfies the equation.  
2. Confirm the point lies on the x-axis: Since y = 0, the point (10, 0) is indeed on the x-axis.  
3. Optionally, verify using the slope and another point, e.g., (9, 1):  
   Slope from (9, 1) to (10, 0): \( \frac{0 - 1}{10 - 9} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1 \), which matches the slope calculated earlier.  
The point (10, 0) is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the point where the line through (9, 1) and (5, 5) intersects the x-axis.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equation of the line (completed: \( y = -x + 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the x-axis intersection by setting y = 0 (completed: x = 10, point (10, 0)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the intersection point (completed: (10, 0) satisfies the equation and lies on the x-axis).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the intersection point (10, 0) has been determined and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The line intersects the x-axis at the point (10, 0).
