**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the point where the line intersects the x-axis, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the equation of the line passing through (9, 1) and (5, 5).  
2. Determine the x-intercept by setting y = 0 in the line equation and solving for x.  
3. Express the result as a point (x, 0).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the equation of the line passing through (9, 1) and (5, 5). This can be achieved by calculating the slope of the line and using the point-slope form to derive the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the equation of the line:  
1. Calculate the slope \( m \) using the formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \):  
   \[
   m = \frac{5 - 1}{5 - 9} = \frac{4}{-4} = -1
   \]  
2. Use the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point (9, 1):  
   \[
   y - 1 = -1(x - 9)
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   y - 1 = -x + 9 \implies y = -x + 9 + 1 \implies y = -x + 10
   \]  
The equation of the line is \( y = -x + 10 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-intercept of the line \( y = -x + 10 \). This can be achieved by setting \( y = 0 \) and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the x-intercept, set \( y = 0 \) in the equation \( y = -x + 10 \):  
\[
0 = -x + 10 \implies x = 10
\]  
The x-intercept is at the point (10, 0).

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the point where the line through (9, 1) and (5, 5) intersects the x-axis.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the equation of the line (completed: \( y = -x + 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the x-intercept (completed: (10, 0)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the result as a point (completed: (10, 0)).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the result, but since the x-intercept has been found, the main goal is complete.  
The final answer is the point (10, 0).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The line intersects the x-axis at the point **(10, 0)**.
