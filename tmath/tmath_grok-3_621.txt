### Problem Restatement
We have seven sticks with lengths 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 inches. Three sticks are randomly selected, and we need to find the probability that these three sticks can form a triangle when their endpoints are joined. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction. To form a triangle, the stick lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must satisfy the triangle inequality: \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\), where \(c\) is the longest side.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability.  
1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7.  
2. Identify the conditions for three stick lengths to form a triangle (triangle inequality).  
3. Determine which combinations of three sticks satisfy these conditions.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable combinations to total combinations.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7. This can be achieved by using the combination formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(n = 7\) and \(k = 3\).  

[IMP]  
The total number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is given by:  
\[ C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35. \]  
So, there are 35 possible combinations of 3 sticks.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Define the next subgoal: Identify the triangle inequality conditions and apply them to determine which combinations of three sticks can form a triangle. The triangle inequality states that for lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (with \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the following must hold:  
1. \(a + b > c\)  
2. \(a + c > b\) (automatically satisfied if \(a \leq b\))  
3. \(b + c > a\) (automatically satisfied if \(b \leq c\))  
Thus, we only need to check \(a + b > c\) for each combination, where \(c\) is the longest side.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to list all combinations of three sticks and check which ones satisfy the triangle inequality \(a + b > c\), where \(a \leq b \leq c\). This can be achieved by systematically enumerating all 35 combinations and testing the inequality.  

[IMP]  
The stick lengths are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. We list all combinations of three sticks and check if they form a triangle. To optimize, we sort each triplet \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\) and verify \(a + b > c\). Below are the combinations, with those that fail the triangle inequality marked:  

- (2, 3, 5): \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 5\) → Fails  
- (2, 3, 7): \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 7\) → Fails  
- (2, 3, 11): \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 11\) → Fails  
- (2, 3, 13): \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (2, 3, 17): \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (2, 5, 7): \(2 + 5 = 7 \not> 7\) → Fails  
- (2, 5, 11): \(2 + 5 = 7 \not> 11\) → Fails  
- (2, 5, 13): \(2 + 5 = 7 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (2, 5, 17): \(2 + 5 = 7 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (2, 7, 11): \(2 + 7 = 9 \not> 11\) → Fails  
- (2, 7, 13): \(2 + 7 = 9 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (2, 7, 17): \(2 + 7 = 9 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (2, 11, 13): \(2 + 11 = 13 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (2, 11, 17): \(2 + 11 = 13 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (2, 13, 17): \(2 + 13 = 15 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (3, 5, 7): \(3 + 5 = 8 > 7\) → Succeeds  
- (3, 5, 11): \(3 + 5 = 8 \not> 11\) → Fails  
- (3, 5, 13): \(3 + 5 = 8 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (3, 5, 17): \(3 + 5 = 8 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (3, 7, 11): \(3 + 7 = 10 \not> 11\) → Fails  
- (3, 7, 13): \(3 + 7 = 10 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (3, 7, 17): \(3 + 7 = 10 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (3, 11, 13): \(3 + 11 = 14 > 13\) → Succeeds  
- (3, 11, 17): \(3 + 11 = 14 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (3, 13, 17): \(3 + 13 = 16 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (5, 7, 11): \(5 + 7 = 12 > 11\) → Succeeds  
- (5, 7, 13): \(5 + 7 = 12 \not> 13\) → Fails  
- (5, 7, 17): \(5 + 7 = 12 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (5, 11, 13): \(5 + 11 = 16 > 13\) → Succeeds  
- (5, 11, 17): \(5 + 11 = 16 \not> 17\) → Fails  
- (5, 13, 17): \(5 + 13 = 18 > 17\) → Succeeds  
- (7, 11, 13): \(7 + 11 = 18 > 13\) → Succeeds  
- (7, 11, 17): \(7 + 11 = 18 > 17\) → Succeeds  
- (7, 13, 17): \(7 + 13 = 20 > 17\) → Succeeds  
- (11, 13, 17): \(11 + 13 = 24 > 17\) → Succeeds  

Out of 35 combinations, 9 satisfy the triangle inequality: (3, 5, 7), (3, 11, 13), (5, 7, 11), (5, 11, 13), (5, 13, 17), (7, 11, 13), (7, 11, 17), (7, 13, 17), (11, 13, 17).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the list of combinations that form a triangle by rechecking the triangle inequality for a sample of succeeding and failing cases to ensure accuracy.  

[IMP]  
Let’s validate a succeeding case, (3, 5, 7), and a failing case, (2, 3, 5):  
- For (3, 5, 7), sorted as \(a = 3, b = 5, c = 7\):  
  \(3 + 5 = 8 > 7\). Other inequalities: \(3 + 7 > 5\) (true), \(5 + 7 > 3\) (true). Valid triangle.  
- For (2, 3, 5), sorted as \(a = 2, b = 3, c = 5\):  
  \(2 + 3 = 5 \not> 5\). Fails the triangle inequality.  
The checks confirm the correctness of the identified combinations. The count of 9 favorable combinations appears consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute the probability that three randomly selected sticks form a triangle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total combinations of 3 sticks from 7 (completed: 35 combinations).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify triangle inequality conditions (completed: \(a + b > c\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: List and check all combinations for triangle formation (completed: 9 valid combinations).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the list of valid combinations (completed: sample checks confirm accuracy).  
  - Subgoal 5 (current): Compute the probability using the ratio of favorable to total combinations.  

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as a fraction.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable combinations (9) to total combinations (35), expressed as a common fraction. This can be achieved by forming the fraction and simplifying it.  

[IMP]  
The number of favorable combinations is 9, and the total number of combinations is 35. The probability is:  
\[ \frac{9}{35} \]  
To ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, check if 9 and 35 have common factors. Since 9 = \(3^2\) and 35 = \(5 \times 7\), they share no common factors other than 1. Thus, \(\frac{9}{35}\) is already simplified.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final probability by confirming the counts of favorable and total combinations and ensuring the fraction is simplified.  

[IMP]  
- Total combinations: \(C(7, 3) = 35\), as computed earlier.  
- Favorable combinations: 9, as listed and validated in Step 4 and Step 5.  
- Fraction: \(\frac{9}{35}\). Since 9 and 35 are coprime (no common factors), the fraction is simplified.  
The probability calculation is consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The probability that three randomly selected sticks can form a triangle is \(\frac{9}{35}\).
