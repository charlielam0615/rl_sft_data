**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(\frac{3^4 + 3^2}{3^3 - 3}\) and express the answer as a common fraction.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of simplifying the expression into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the numerator \(3^4 + 3^2\).  
2. Compute the denominator \(3^3 - 3\).  
3. Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing numerator by denominator.  
4. Ensure the final fraction is in its simplest form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the numerator \(3^4 + 3^2\). This will be achieved by calculating each term (\(3^4\) and \(3^2\)) and adding them together.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \(3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81\).  
Calculate \(3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9\).  
Add them: \(81 + 9 = 90\).  
The numerator is 90.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the denominator \(3^3 - 3\). This will be achieved by calculating \(3^3\) and subtracting 3 from it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \(3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).  
Subtract: \(27 - 3 = 24\).  
The denominator is 24.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the fraction \(\frac{90}{24}\). This will be achieved by dividing the numerator by the denominator and simplifying the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Form the fraction: \(\frac{90}{24}\).  
Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 90 and 24.  
Prime factors: \(90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5\), \(24 = 2^3 \times 3\).  
GCD = \(2 \times 3 = 6\).  
Divide numerator and denominator by 6:  
\(\frac{90 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{15}{4}\).  
The fraction \(\frac{15}{4}\) is in simplest form since 15 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the simplified fraction \(\frac{15}{4}\). This will be achieved by checking the calculations of the numerator, denominator, and simplification steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck numerator: \(3^4 = 81\), \(3^2 = 9\), \(81 + 9 = 90\). Correct.  
Recheck denominator: \(3^3 = 27\), \(27 - 3 = 24\). Correct.  
Recheck simplification: \(\frac{90}{24} \div \frac{6}{6} = \frac{15}{4}\). GCD of 15 and 4 is 1, so the fraction is simplified.  
The fraction \(\frac{15}{4}\) is valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \(\frac{3^4 + 3^2}{3^3 - 3}\) as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute numerator \(3^4 + 3^2\) (completed: 90).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute denominator \(3^3 - 3\) (completed: 24).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the fraction \(\frac{90}{24}\) (completed: \(\frac{15}{4}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: \(\frac{15}{4}\) is correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The final simplified fraction is \(\frac{15}{4}\).
