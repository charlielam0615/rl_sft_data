**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(\frac{3^4 + 3^2}{3^3 - 3}\) and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the expression:  
1. Compute the numerator \(3^4 + 3^2\).  
2. Compute the denominator \(3^3 - 3\).  
3. Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator.  
4. Ensure the final answer is a common fraction in its simplest form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the numerator \(3^4 + 3^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate \(3^4\) and \(3^2\), then add the results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \(3^4 = 81\) and \(3^2 = 9\).  
Add them: \(81 + 9 = 90\).  
The numerator is 90.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the denominator \(3^3 - 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate \(3^3\) and subtract 3 from the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \(3^3 = 27\).  
Subtract: \(27 - 3 = 24\).  
The denominator is 24.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the fraction \(\frac{90}{24}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the numerator by the denominator and simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 90 and 24, then divide both by the GCD.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The fraction is \(\frac{90}{24}\).  
Find the GCD of 90 and 24:  
- Prime factors of 90: \(2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5\).  
- Prime factors of 24: \(2^3 \cdot 3\).  
- Common factors: \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\).  
Divide numerator and denominator by 6:  
- \(\frac{90 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{15}{4}\).  
The fraction \(\frac{15}{4}\) is in simplest form since 15 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the simplified fraction \(\frac{15}{4}\) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the original expression and confirm the simplification steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recalculate:  
- Numerator: \(3^4 = 81\), \(3^2 = 9\), so \(81 + 9 = 90\).  
- Denominator: \(3^3 = 27\), \(27 - 3 = 24\).  
- Fraction: \(\frac{90}{24}\).  
- Simplify: GCD of 90 and 24 is 6, so \(\frac{90 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{15}{4}\).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming \(\frac{15}{4}\) is correct.
