### Problem Statement
Find the x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis that is equidistant from points A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis equidistant from A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4). Subgoals:  
1. Define the point on the x-axis as (x, 0).  
2. Set up equations for the distances from this point to A and B, ensuring they are equal.  
3. Solve the resulting equation to find the x-coordinate.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation based on the distances from the point (x, 0) to points A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4) being equal. Use the distance formula to compute these distances and set them equal to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the point on the x-axis be (x, 0).  
- Distance from (x, 0) to A(-2, 0):  
  Using the distance formula,  
  \[
  d_A = \sqrt{(x - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x + 2)^2} = |x + 2|
  \]  
- Distance from (x, 0) to B(0, 4):  
  \[
  d_B = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
  \]  
Since the point is equidistant, set \( d_A = d_B \):  
\[
|x + 2| = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( |x + 2| = \sqrt{x^2 + 16} \) for x. Square both sides to eliminate the absolute value and solve the resulting quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Square both sides of \( |x + 2| = \sqrt{x^2 + 16} \):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 16
\]  
Expand the left side:  
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = x^2 + 16
\]  
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:  
\[
4x + 4 = 16
\]  
Subtract 4:  
\[
4x = 12
\]  
Divide by 4:  
\[
x = 3
\]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the point (3, 0) is equidistant from A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4) by calculating the distances and checking if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the distance from (3, 0) to A(-2, 0):  
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(3 - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(3 + 2)^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]  
Calculate the distance from (3, 0) to B(0, 4):  
\[
d_B = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]  
Since \( d_A = d_B = 5 \), the solution \( x = 3 \) is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis equidistant from A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the point on the x-axis as (x, 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the distance equation \( |x + 2| = \sqrt{x^2 + 16} \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find \( x = 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution by checking distances.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution \( x = 3 \) as the final answer, as validation is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis equidistant from points A(-2, 0) and B(0, 4) is **3**.
