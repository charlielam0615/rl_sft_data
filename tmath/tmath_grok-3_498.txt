### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the x-coordinate of the point on the x-axis that is equidistant from points \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(0, 4) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the point on the x-axis as \( P(x, 0) \).  
2. Set up the condition for equidistance by equating the distances from \( P \) to \( A \) and \( P \) to \( B \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation to find the x-coordinate.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the equation for the point \( P(x, 0) \) on the x-axis that is equidistant from \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(0, 4) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the distances \( PA \) and \( PB \), set them equal, and solve for \( x \). Use the distance formula for points \( P(x, 0) \), \( A(-2, 0) \), and \( B(0, 4) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the point on the x-axis be \( P(x, 0) \).  

- **Distance from \( P(x, 0) \) to \( A(-2, 0) \)**:  
  Using the distance formula:  
  \[
  PA = \sqrt{(x - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x + 2)^2} = |x + 2|
  \]

- **Distance from \( P(x, 0) \) to \( B(0, 4) \)**:  
  \[
  PB = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
  \]

Since \( P \) is equidistant from \( A \) and \( B \), set \( PA = PB \):  
\[
|x + 2| = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
\]

To eliminate the absolute value, consider both cases for \( |x + 2| \):  

**Case 1: \( x + 2 \geq 0 \)** (i.e., \( x \geq -2 \))  
\[
x + 2 = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 16
\]
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = x^2 + 16
\]
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:  
\[
4x + 4 = 16
\]
\[
4x = 12 \implies x = 3
\]
Since \( x = 3 \geq -2 \), this solution is valid for Case 1.

**Case 2: \( x + 2 < 0 \)** (i.e., \( x < -2 \))  
\[
-(x + 2) = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
\]
\[
-x - 2 = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}
\]
Square both sides:  
\[
(-x - 2)^2 = x^2 + 16
\]
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = x^2 + 16
\]
\[
4x + 4 = 16
\]
\[
4x = 12 \implies x = 3
\]
Since \( x = 3 \not< -2 \), this solution is not valid for Case 2.

Thus, the candidate solution is \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the point \( P(3, 0) \) is equidistant from \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(0, 4) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the distances \( PA \) and \( PB \) for \( x = 3 \) and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( P(3, 0) \):  

- **Distance \( PA \)**:  
  \[
  PA = \sqrt{(3 - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(3 + 2)^2} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5
  \]

- **Distance \( PB \)**:  
  \[
  PB = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
  \]

Since \( PA = 5 = PB \), the point \( P(3, 0) \) is equidistant from \( A \) and \( B \).
