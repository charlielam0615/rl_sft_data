### Problem Restatement
We need to find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle. Interior numbers are defined as the numbers in a row excluding the first and last elements (which are always 1). Given:
- The fourth row's interior numbers sum to 6.
- The fifth row's interior numbers sum to 14.
We will use the meta-cognitive action set to solve this systematically.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row into subgoals:  
1. Understand Pascal's Triangle and identify the interior numbers for a given row.  
2. Verify the given sums for rows 4 and 5 to establish a pattern or method.  
3. Compute the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle.  
4. Sum the interior numbers of the seventh row.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Understand Pascal's Triangle and define interior numbers.  
- **How to achieve**: Research Pascal's Triangle structure, noting that each row \( n \) (starting from \( n=0 \)) corresponds to binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} \). Interior numbers exclude the first (\( \binom{n}{0} = 1 \)) and last (\( \binom{n}{n} = 1 \)) elements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Pascal's Triangle rows are indexed starting from \( n=0 \):  
- Row 0: \( 1 \)  
- Row 1: \( 1, 1 \)  
- Row 2: \( 1, 2, 1 \)  
- Row 3: \( 1, 3, 3, 1 \)  
- Row 4: \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \)  
- Row 5: \( 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1 \)  
- Row 6: \( 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 \)  
- Row 7: \( 1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1 \)  

For row \( n \), the numbers are \( \binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \ldots, \binom{n}{n} \). Interior numbers are \( \binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2}, \ldots, \binom{n}{n-1} \). For row 7 (\( n=7 \)), interior numbers are \( \binom{7}{1}, \binom{7}{2}, \binom{7}{3}, \binom{7}{4}, \binom{7}{5}, \binom{7}{6} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Verify the given sums for rows 4 and 5.  
- **How to achieve**: Compute the interior numbers for rows 4 and 5, sum them, and check against the provided sums (6 for row 4, 14 for row 5).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Row 4 (\( n=4 \))**: Numbers are \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \). Interior numbers: \( 4, 6, 4 \).  
  Sum: \( 4 + 6 + 4 = 14 \).  
  **Note**: The problem states the sum is 6, suggesting a possible error. Let's proceed and revisit if needed.  
- **Row 5 (\( n=5 \))**: Numbers are \( 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1 \). Interior numbers: \( 5, 10, 10, 5 \).  
  Sum: \( 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 \).  
  **Note**: The problem states the sum is 14, indicating a discrepancy.  

The sums don't match. This suggests the problem may refer to a different definition or row indexing, or there may be a typo. Let's hypothesize that the problem uses 1-based row indexing (row 1 is \( 1 \), row 2 is \( 1, 1 \), etc.), and test:  
- **Row 4 (1-based, so \( n=3 \))**: \( 1, 3, 3, 1 \). Interior: \( 3, 3 \). Sum: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \). Matches!  
- **Row 5 (1-based, so \( n=4 \))**: \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \). Interior: \( 4, 6, 4 \). Sum: \( 4 + 6 + 4 = 14 \). Matches!  

Thus, the problem likely uses 1-based indexing, where row \( n \) in the problem is row \( n-1 \) in standard 0-based indexing. For the seventh row, we compute row 6 (0-based).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on validation, adjust subgoals to use 1-based indexing:  
1. Compute row 6 (0-based) for the seventh row (1-based).  
2. Identify and sum its interior numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Compute row 6 (0-based) and sum its interior numbers.  
- **How to achieve**: List the binomial coefficients for \( n=6 \), exclude the first and last, and sum the rest.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Row 6 (\( n=6 \))**: \( \binom{6}{0}, \binom{6}{1}, \ldots, \binom{6}{6} = 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 \).  
- Interior numbers: \( \binom{6}{1}, \binom{6}{2}, \binom{6}{3}, \binom{6}{4}, \binom{6}{5} = 6, 15, 20, 15, 6 \).  
- Sum: \( 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 = 62 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row.  
  - Subgoal: Understand Pascal's Triangle and interior numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Verify given sums for rows 4 and 5 (completed, identified 1-based indexing).  
  - Subgoal: Compute row 6 (0-based) for the seventh row (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Sum interior numbers of row 6 (completed, sum = 62).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing calculations.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Confirm the sum of interior numbers for row 6 (0-based).  
- **How to achieve**: Recompute the sum and explore an alternative method (e.g., sum of binomial coefficients) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recompute: Row 6 is \( 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 \). Interior: \( 6, 15, 20, 15, 6 \).  
  Sum: \( 6 + 15 = 21 \), \( 21 + 20 = 41 \), \( 41 + 15 = 56 \), \( 56 + 6 = 62 \). Correct.  

- Alternative method: For row \( n \) (0-based), interior numbers are \( \binom{n}{1}, \ldots, \binom{n}{n-1} \).  
  Sum of all coefficients: \( \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n \).  
  Exclude first and last: \( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n - \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{n} = 2^n - 1 - 1 \).  
  For \( n=6 \): \( 2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62 \). Matches!

The sum is consistent.

### Final Answer
The sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle (using 1-based indexing, so row 6 in 0-based) is **62**.
