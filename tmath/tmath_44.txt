Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Analyze the behavior of the floor function in the equation $\left\lfloor n^2/4 \right\rfloor - \lfloor n/2 \rfloor^2 = 2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To analyze the behavior of the floor function, we need to consider the properties of the floor function and how it interacts with the expressions $n^2/4$ and $n/2$.

The floor function, $\lfloor x \rfloor$, returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For the given equation, the left-hand side is the difference between the floor of $n^2/4$ and the square of the floor of $n/2$.

We will consider different cases for $n$ based on whether $n$ is even or odd, as this will affect the value of $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$.

1. **Case 1: $n$ is even**  
   If $n$ is even, then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. In this case, $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor = k$, and $n^2/4 = (2k)^2/4 = k^2$. Thus, $\left\lfloor n^2/4 \right\rfloor = k^2$, and the equation becomes $k^2 - k^2 = 0$, which is not equal to 2.

2. **Case 2: $n$ is odd**  
   If $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. In this case, $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor = k$, and $n^2/4 = (2k + 1)^2/4 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1)/4 = k^2 + k + 0.25$. Thus, $\left\lfloor n^2/4 \right\rfloor = k^2 + k$, and the equation becomes $k^2 + k - k^2 = k$. For this to be equal to 2, $k = 2$.

Therefore, the integer value of $n$ that satisfies the equation is $n = 2k + 1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the reasoning in the implementation step for identifying the integer value of $n$ that satisfies the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The reasoning in the implementation step splits the problem into cases for even and odd $n$. 

1. **Case 1: Even $n$**  
   The analysis correctly identifies that for even $n = 2k$, $\left\lfloor n^2/4 \right\rfloor = k^2$ and $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor^2 = k^2$, leading to $k^2 - k^2 = 0$. This correctly eliminates even $n$ as solutions.

2. **Case 2: Odd $n$**  
   For odd $n = 2k + 1$, the analysis computes $\left\lfloor n^2/4 \right\rfloor = k^2 + k$ and $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor^2 = k^2$, leading to $k^2 + k - k^2 = k$. Setting $k = 2$ gives $n = 5$, which is valid. However, the reasoning does not explicitly check for other possible values of $k$ (e.g., $k = 3$, $k = 1$, or negative integers) to confirm that $n = 5$ is the **only** solution. While the conclusion is correct, the verification process should explicitly confirm the uniqueness of the solution by testing edge cases (e.g., $k = 1$, $k = 3$, and negative $k$) as done in the thought process. The current reasoning assumes uniqueness without exhaustive validation, which could be a critical oversight in a formal proof.

Despite this, the final answer $n = 5$ is correct. The verification confirms that the reasoning is logically sound, albeit slightly incomplete in its edge-case analysis. No errors in the core logic are found.
