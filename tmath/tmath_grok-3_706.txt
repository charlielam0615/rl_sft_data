**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that the product of two distinct numbers randomly selected from the set {3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51} is a multiple of 63. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set.  
2. Identify which numbers in the set are relevant for producing a product that is a multiple of 63.  
3. Calculate the number of favorable pairs whose product is a multiple of 63.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set.  
How to Achieve: The set has 7 numbers. Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) to find the number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from 7, ensuring order doesn’t matter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The set {3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51} contains 7 numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers is given by the combination formula C(7, 2):  
C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = (7 × 6) / (2 × 1) = 42 / 2 = 21.  
So, there are 21 possible pairs.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify which numbers in the set are relevant for producing a product that is a multiple of 63.  
How to Achieve: Factorize 63 to understand the divisibility requirement (63 = 3² × 7). For a product to be a multiple of 63, it must have at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7 in its prime factorization. Factorize each number in the set to check for these factors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Factorize 63: 63 = 3² × 7. For the product of two numbers to be divisible by 63, the prime factorization of the product must include at least 3² × 7. Factorize each number in the set:  
- 3 = 3¹  
- 7 = 7¹  
- 21 = 3¹ × 7¹  
- 27 = 3³  
- 35 = 5¹ × 7¹  
- 42 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 7¹  
- 51 = 3¹ × 17¹  

Numbers with at least one factor of 3: {3, 21, 27, 42, 51}.  
Numbers with at least one factor of 7: {7, 21, 35, 42}.  
For the product to be a multiple of 63, one number must contribute at least 3² or two numbers together must provide at least two 3’s and one 7.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of favorable pairs whose product is a multiple of 63.  
How to Achieve: Identify pairs (a, b) where a × b is divisible by 3² × 7. Since 27 = 3³ provides enough factors of 3, test pairs including 27 with numbers containing at least one 7. Also, check pairs where one number has at least one 3 and the other has at least one 3 and one 7, ensuring the product has 3² × 7.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To be divisible by 63 = 3² × 7, the product’s prime factorization needs at least two 3’s and one 7. Consider:  
1. **Pairs with 27 (3³)**: Since 27 has 3³, pairing it with any number containing at least 7¹ ensures the product has 3² × 7. Numbers with 7: {7, 21, 35, 42}. Pairs: (27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42). That’s 4 pairs.  
   - Check: (27 × 7 = 3³ × 7¹), (27 × 21 = 3⁴ × 7¹), (27 × 35 = 3³ × 5¹ × 7¹), (27 × 42 = 2¹ × 3⁴ × 7¹). All are divisible by 3² × 7.  

2. **Pairs without 27**: Need one number with at least one 3 and another with at least one 3 and one 7, and together they provide 3² × 7. Numbers with 3: {3, 21, 42, 51}. Numbers with 3 and 7: {21, 42}. Test pairs:  
   - (3, 21): 3¹ × (3¹ × 7¹) = 3² × 7¹. Divisible.  
   - (3, 42): 3¹ × (2¹ × 3¹ × 7¹) = 2¹ × 3² × 7¹. Divisible.  
   - (51, 21): 3¹ × 17¹ × (3¹ × 7¹) = 3² × 7¹ × 17¹. Divisible.  
   - (51, 42): 3¹ × 17¹ × (2¹ × 3¹ × 7¹) = 2¹ × 3² × 7¹ × 17¹. Divisible.  
   - (21, 42): (3¹ × 7¹) × (2¹ × 3¹ × 7¹) = 2¹ × 3² × 7². Divisible.  

   Other pairs like (3, 3), (42, 42), (51, 51) are not possible since numbers are distinct. Check pairs like (3, 51): 3¹ × (3¹ × 17¹) = 3² × 17¹ (no 7, not divisible).  

Favorable pairs: (27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42), (3, 21), (3, 42), (51, 21), (51, 42), (21, 42). Total: 9 pairs.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the favorable pairs to ensure no pairs are missed or incorrectly included.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the favorable pairs systematically and check their divisibility by 63.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute favorable pairs:  
- **With 27**: Pairs (27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42). That’s 4 pairs.  
- **Without 27**: Numbers with 3: {3, 21, 42, 51}. Numbers with 3 and 7: {21, 42}. Pairs:  
   - (3, 21), (3, 42), (51, 21), (51, 42), (21, 42). That’s 5 pairs.  
Total: 4 + 5 = 9 pairs.  
Verify: Each pair’s product was checked in Step 4 and confirmed divisible by 63. No other pairs (e.g., (3, 51), (42, 51)) provide both 3² and 7. The count is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs.  
How to Achieve: Use the number of favorable pairs (9) and total pairs (21) to calculate the probability as a fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total pairs: 21 (from Step 2). Favorable pairs: 9 (from Steps 4 and 5).  
Probability = favorable pairs / total pairs = 9 / 21.  
Simplify: 9 ÷ 3 = 3, 21 ÷ 3 = 7. Thus, 9 / 21 = 3 / 7.  
[/IMP]
