**Problem Statement**: Calculate the value of the expression \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the expression efficiently.  
1. Recognize the structure of the expression \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\).  
2. Explore patterns or identities that match the expression, such as binomial expansions.  
3. Simplify the expression if a pattern is identified, or compute each term directly.  
4. Calculate the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify if the expression \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\) matches a known mathematical pattern or identity.  
How to Achieve: Compare the expression to the binomial expansion formula \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). Check if the coefficients and powers align with a specific form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The expression is \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\). Notice that the coefficients 1, 3, 3, 1 resemble the binomial coefficients for \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\). Let’s test if the expression fits this form:  
- Set \(a = 99\) and \(b = 1\).  
- Then, \((99 + 1)^3 = 100^3 = 99^3 + 3(99^2)(1) + 3(99)(1^2) + 1^3 = 99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\).  
The expression matches \((99 + 1)^3 = 100^3\). Thus, the value is \(100^3 = 100 \times 100 \times 100 = 1,000,000\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the result by computing the expression directly to confirm the binomial pattern simplification.  
How to Achieve: Calculate each term \(99^3\), \(3(99^2)\), \(3(99)\), and \(1\), then sum them to check if the total equals \(1,000,000\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute each term:  
- \(99^2 = 9,801\) (since \(99 \times 99 = 9,801\)).  
- \(99^3 = 99 \times 9,801 = 970,299\) (since \(99 \times 9,801 = 9,801 \times 100 - 9,801 = 980,100 - 9,801 = 970,299\)).  
- \(3(99^2) = 3 \times 9,801 = 29,403\).  
- \(3(99) = 3 \times 99 = 297\).  
- \(1 = 1\).  
Sum: \(970,299 + 29,403 + 297 + 1\).  
- \(970,299 + 29,403 = 999,702\).  
- \(999,702 + 297 = 999,999\).  
- \(999,999 + 1 = 1,000,000\).  
The direct calculation confirms the result is \(1,000,000\), matching the binomial expansion result.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the expression’s structure.  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify a pattern (binomial expansion).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify using the pattern (\(100^3\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate by direct computation.  
Current Goal: Completed validation, confirming the result.  
The result \(1,000,000\) has been verified via both pattern recognition and direct calculation.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\) is \(1,000,000\).
