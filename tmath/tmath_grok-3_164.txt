### Problem Statement
Solve the equation \(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\) for \( x \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Define necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the goal of solving the equation.  
- Final goal: Find all values of \( x \) that satisfy \(\frac{3x^2 + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the resulting equation after simplification.  
- Subgoal 2: Simplify the equation by eliminating the denominator.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify restrictions on \( x \) (e.g., denominator cannot be zero).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Identify restrictions on \( x \).  
- **How to achieve**: Analyze the denominator of the left-hand side to ensure it is not zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The denominator is \( x - 1 \). Set \( x - 1 \neq 0 \):  
\( x \neq 1 \).  
Thus, \( x = 1 \) is not a valid solution.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Simplify the equation by eliminating the denominator.  
- **How to achieve**: Multiply both sides of the equation by \( x - 1 \) to clear the fraction, then simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with:  
\(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\)  
Multiply both sides by \( x - 1 \) (valid since \( x \neq 1 \)):  
\( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 = (3x + 1)(x - 1) \)  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\( (3x + 1)(x - 1) = 3x^2 - 3x + x - 1 = 3x^2 - 2x - 1 \)  
So the equation becomes:  
\( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 3x^2 - 2x - 1 \)  
Subtract \( 3x^2 \) from both sides:  
\( 2x + 1 = -2x - 1 \)  
Add \( 2x \) to both sides:  
\( 4x + 1 = -1 \)  
Subtract 1:  
\( 4x = -2 \)  
Divide by 4:  
\( x = -\frac{1}{2} \)

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Check the validity of the solution \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).  
- **How to achieve**: Substitute \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \) into the original equation to verify both sides are equal, and confirm it satisfies the restriction \( x \neq 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \) into the left-hand side:  
Denominator: \( x - 1 = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2} \neq 0 \) (satisfies restriction).  
Numerator: \( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 3\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = \frac{3}{4} - 1 + 1 = \frac{3}{4} \)  
Left-hand side:  
\( \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{-\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \)  
Right-hand side:  
\( 3x + 1 = 3\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{3}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2} \)  
Since \( -\frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify restrictions on \( x \) (Completed: \( x \neq 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the equation by eliminating the denominator (Completed: Simplified to \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the resulting equation (Completed: Found \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (Completed: Verified \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \)).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution process.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\) is \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).
