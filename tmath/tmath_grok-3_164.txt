**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\) for \(x\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator.  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve the simplified equation for \(x\).  
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they are valid.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the fraction in the equation \(\frac{3x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1} = 3x + 1\).  
How to Achieve: Multiply both sides of the equation by \(x - 1\) to clear the denominator, ensuring \(x \neq 1\) to avoid division by zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Multiply both sides by \(x - 1\):  
\[
(3x^2 + 2x + 1) = (3x + 1)(x - 1)
\]
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
(3x + 1)(x - 1) = 3x \cdot x + 3x \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot (-1) = 3x^2 - 3x + x - 1 = 3x^2 - 2x - 1
\]
The equation becomes:  
\[
3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 3x^2 - 2x - 1
\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation \(3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 3x^2 - 2x - 1\).  
How to Achieve: Subtract \(3x^2\) from both sides to eliminate the quadratic term, then simplify and solve for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Subtract \(3x^2\) from both sides:  
\[
(3x^2 + 2x + 1) - 3x^2 = (3x^2 - 2x - 1) - 3x^2
\]
\[
2x + 1 = -2x - 1
\]
Add \(2x\) to both sides:  
\[
2x + 2x + 1 = -1
\]
\[
4x + 1 = -1
\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
\[
4x = -2
\]
Divide by 4:  
\[
x = -\frac{2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) in the original equation and check for extraneous solutions.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) into both sides of the original equation and confirm equality. Also, check if \(x = 1\) is a restriction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) into the left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{3\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1}{-\frac{1}{2} - 1}
\]
Numerator:  
\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 1 + 1 = \frac{3}{4} - 1 + 1 = \frac{3}{4}
\]
Denominator:  
\[
-\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]
So:  
\[
\frac{\frac{3}{4}}{-\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{-2}{3} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Right-hand side:  
\[
3 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{3}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Both sides equal \(-\frac{1}{2}\), so \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) is valid.  
Check the restriction: \(x \neq 1\) since the denominator \(x - 1 = 0\) at \(x = 1\). Since \(x = -\frac{1}{2} \neq 1\), there are no extraneous solutions.
