**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( f(g(3)) \), where \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(g(3)) \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(3) \).  
2. Use the result of \( g(3) \) as the input for \( f(x) \).  
3. Compute \( f(g(3)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( g(3) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \) and evaluate the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( g(x) \):  
\[ g(3) = 2(3)^2 - 2(3) - 3 = 2(9) - 6 - 3 = 18 - 6 - 3 = 9 \]  
So, \( g(3) = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(g(3)) \), i.e., \( f(9) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \) and evaluate the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(9) = 2\sqrt{9} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{9}} = 2(3) + \frac{12}{3} = 6 + 4 = 10 \]  
So, \( f(9) = 10 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(3)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(3) \) (completed: \( g(3) = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(3)) \), i.e., \( f(9) \) (completed: \( f(9) = 10 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the final result for \( f(g(3)) \).  
The computations indicate \( f(g(3)) = 10 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the computation of \( f(g(3)) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute \( g(3) \) and \( f(9) \) to ensure correctness and check for potential errors.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Recompute \( g(3) \)**:  
\[ g(3) = 2(3)^2 - 2(3) - 3 = 18 - 6 - 3 = 9 \] (matches previous result).  
**Recompute \( f(9) \)**:  
\[ f(9) = 2\sqrt{9} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{9}} = 6 + 4 = 10 \] (matches previous result).  
The calculations are consistent, and no errors are found.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
\[ f(g(3)) = 10 \]
