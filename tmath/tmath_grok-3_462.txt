### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(g(3)) \), where \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve \( f(g(3)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(3) \).  
2. Use the result of \( g(3) \) as the input for \( f(x) \).  
3. Evaluate \( f \) at the value obtained from \( g(3) \).  
4. Simplify the final expression to obtain the numerical value of \( f(g(3)) \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(3) \), where \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 3 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \) and performing the arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \):  
\( g(3) = 2(3^2) - 2(3) - 3 = 2(9) - 6 - 3 = 18 - 6 - 3 = 9 \).  
So, \( g(3) = 9 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(3)) = f(9) \), where \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 9 \) into the expression for \( f(x) \) and simplifying.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \):  
\( f(9) = 2\sqrt{9} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{9}} = 2(3) + \frac{12}{3} = 6 + 4 = 10 \).  
So, \( f(9) = 10 \).

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \( f(g(3)) = 10 \). This will be achieved by rechecking the calculations for \( g(3) \) and \( f(9) \) to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recheck \( g(3) \):  
  \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 2x - 3 \), so \( g(3) = 2(3^2) - 2(3) - 3 = 2(9) - 6 - 3 = 18 - 6 - 3 = 9 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( f(9) \):  
  \( f(x) = 2\sqrt{x} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{x}} \), so \( f(9) = 2\sqrt{9} + \frac{12}{\sqrt{9}} = 2(3) + \frac{12}{3} = 6 + 4 = 10 \). Correct.  
The calculations are consistent, confirming \( f(g(3)) = 10 \).

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(3)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(3) \) (completed: \( g(3) = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(9) \) (completed: \( f(9) = 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed: calculations confirmed).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with \( f(g(3)) = 10 \). No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
\( f(g(3)) = 10 \)
