**Problem Restatement**:  
We need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the piecewise function \(f(x)\) is continuous everywhere, and then compute \(a + b\). A function is continuous at a point if the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at that point are equal. The function has potential discontinuities at the points where the pieces meet, i.e., at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2\).

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(a + b\), we need to ensure the piecewise function is continuous at the boundaries \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2\). This involves:  
1. Identifying the points where the function pieces meet (\(x = -2\) and \(x = 2\)).  
2. Setting up continuity conditions at these points by equating the left-hand and right-hand limits and the function value.  
3. Solving the resulting equations to find \(a\) and \(b\).  
4. Computing \(a + b\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure continuity at \(x = -2\).  
**How to Achieve**: For continuity at \(x = -2\), the left-hand limit (from \(x < -2\)) must equal the right-hand limit (from \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\)) and the function value at \(x = -2\). Compute the limits using the respective pieces and set them equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
At \(x = -2\):  
- **Left-hand limit** (\(x \to -2^-\), using \(x < -2\)):  
  \(f(x) = 2x - b\), so \(\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b\).  
- **Right-hand limit** (\(x \to -2^+\), using \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\)):  
  \(f(x) = x - 5\), so \(\lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = -2 - 5 = -7\).  
- **Function value** at \(x = -2\):  
  Since \(x = -2\) falls in \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\), \(f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7\).  

For continuity, \(\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = f(-2)\). Thus:  
\(-4 - b = -7\).  
Solving:  
\(-4 - b = -7 \implies b = -4 + 7 \implies b = 3\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure continuity at \(x = 2\).  
**How to Achieve**: For continuity at \(x = 2\), the left-hand limit (from \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\)) must equal the right-hand limit (from \(x > 2\)) and the function value at \(x = 2\). Compute the limits using the respective pieces and set them equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
At \(x = 2\):  
- **Left-hand limit** (\(x \to 2^-\), using \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\)):  
  \(f(x) = x - 5\), so \(\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2 - 5 = -3\).  
- **Right-hand limit** (\(x \to 2^+\), using \(x > 2\)):  
  \(f(x) = ax + 3\), so \(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = a \cdot 2 + 3 = 2a + 3\).  
- **Function value** at \(x = 2\):  
  Since \(x = 2\) falls in \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\), \(f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3\).  

For continuity, \(\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = f(2)\). Thus:  
\(-3 = 2a + 3\).  
Solving:  
\(-3 = 2a + 3 \implies 2a = -3 - 3 \implies 2a = -6 \implies a = -3\).

**Final Answer**:  
\(a + b = 0\)### Problem Statement
We need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the piecewise function \( f(x) \) is continuous at all points, and then compute \( a + b \). The function is defined as:

\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
ax + 3, & \text{if } x > 2, \\
x - 5, & \text{if } -2 \leq x \leq 2, \\
2x - b, & \text{if } x < -2.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

A function is continuous if, at the points where the pieces meet (i.e., \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)), the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and the function's value are equal.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to ensure the function is continuous:
1. Ensure continuity at \( x = 2 \) by equating the left-hand limit (from the middle piece) and the right-hand limit (from the first piece), and ensuring they match the function's value.
2. Ensure continuity at \( x = -2 \) by equating the left-hand limit (from the third piece) and the right-hand limit (from the middle piece), and ensuring they match the function's value.
3. Solve the resulting equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).
4. Compute \( a + b \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Ensure continuity at \( x = 2 \).

**How to Achieve**: For continuity at \( x = 2 \), the left-hand limit (from \( x - 5 \)) must equal the right-hand limit (from \( ax + 3 \)), and both must equal the function's value at \( x = 2 \). Since \( x = 2 \) lies in the middle piece (\( -2 \leq x \leq 2 \)), we use \( f(2) = x - 5 \). Compute the limits and set them equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Left-hand limit** (as \( x \to 2^- \), from the middle piece):
  \[
  f(x) = x - 5 \implies \lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2 - 5 = -3
  \]
- **Right-hand limit** (as \( x \to 2^+ \), from the first piece):
  \[
  f(x) = ax + 3 \implies \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = a \cdot 2 + 3 = 2a + 3
  \]
- **Function value** at \( x = 2 \) (middle piece includes \( x = 2 \)):
  \[
  f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3
  \]
- For continuity at \( x = 2 \):
  \[
  \lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = f(2)
  \]
  \[
  -3 = 2a + 3
  \]
- Solve for \( a \):
  \[
  2a + 3 = -3 \implies 2a = -6 \implies a = -3
  \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Ensure continuity at \( x = -2 \).

**How to Achieve**: For continuity at \( x = -2 \), the left-hand limit (from \( 2x - b \)) must equal the right-hand limit (from \( x - 5 \)), and both must equal the function's value at \( x = -2 \). Since \( x = -2 \) lies in the middle piece (\( -2 \leq x \leq 2 \)), we use \( f(-2) = x - 5 \). Compute the limits and set them equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Left-hand limit** (as \( x \to -2^- \), from the third piece):
  \[
  f(x) = 2x - b \implies \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b
  \]
- **Right-hand limit** (as \( x \to -2^+ \), from the middle piece):
  \[
  f(x) = x - 5 \implies \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = -2 - 5 = -7
  \]
- **Function value** at \( x = -2 \) (middle piece includes \( x = -2 \)):
  \[
  f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7
  \]
- For continuity at \( x = -2 \):
  \[
  \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = f(-2)
  \]
  \[
  -4 - b = -7
  \]
- Solve for \( b \):
  \[
  -b = -3 \implies b = 3
  \]

**Current Goal**: Compute \( a + b \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the values of \( a \) and \( b \) obtained from the continuity conditions at \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \), and calculate their sum.

From previous steps:
- \( a = -3 \)
- \( b = 3 \)

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Verify the continuity of the function with \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 3 \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 3 \) into the function and check continuity at \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \) by ensuring the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value are equal at both points.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The function becomes:
\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-3x + 3, & \text{if } x > 2, \\
x - 5, & \text{if } -2 \leq x \leq 2, \\
2x - 3, & \text{if } x < -2.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

- **Check continuity at \( x = 2 \)**:
  - Left-hand limit: \( \lim_{x \to 2^-} (x - 5) = 2 - 5 = -3 \)
  - Right-hand limit: \( \lim_{x \to 2^+} (-3x + 3) = -3 \cdot 2 + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3 \)
  - Function value: \( f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3 \)
  - Since \( -3 = -3 = -3 \), the function is continuous at \( x = 2 \).

- **Check continuity at \( x = -2 \)**:
  - Left-hand limit: \( \lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x - 3) = 2(-2) - 3 = -4 - 3 = -7 \)
  - Right-hand limit: \( \lim_{x \to -2^+} (x - 5) = -2 - 5 = -7 \)
  - Function value: \( f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7 \)
  - Since \( -7 = -7 = -7 \), the function is continuous at \( x = -2 \).

The function is continuous at both points, confirming the solution.

### Final Answer
The values satisfying continuity are \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 3 \), so:
\[
a + b = 0
\]
