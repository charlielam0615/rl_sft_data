### Problem Restatement
Solve the equation \(2(3^x) = 162\) for \(x\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \(2(3^x) = 162\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the exponential term \(3^x\).  
2. Solve for \(x\) by expressing both sides with the same base or using logarithms.  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Isolate the exponential term \(3^x\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Divide both sides of the equation \(2(3^x) = 162\) by 2 to isolate \(3^x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 2(3^x) = 162 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ 3^x = \frac{162}{2} = 81 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve for \(x\) in \(3^x = 81\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Recognize that 81 can be written as a power of 3, then equate exponents, or use logarithms if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We have:  
\[ 3^x = 81 \]  
Since \(81 = 3^4\), rewrite the equation:  
\[ 3^x = 3^4 \]  
Because the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ x = 4 \]  
Alternatively, using logarithms:  
\[ \log(3^x) = \log(81) \]  
\[ x \log(3) = \log(81) \]  
\[ x = \frac{\log(81)}{\log(3)} \]  
Since \(\log(81) = \log(3^4) = 4 \log(3)\), we get:  
\[ x = \frac{4 \log(3)}{\log(3)} = 4 \]  
Both methods confirm \(x = 4\).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the solution \(x = 4\) is correct.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation and check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 4\) into \(2(3^x) = 162\):  
\[ 2(3^4) = 2(81) = 162 \]  
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, so the solution \(x = 4\) is correct.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Solve \(2(3^x) = 162\) for \(x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Isolate the exponential term \(3^x\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \(x\) in \(3^x = 81\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The solution \(x = 4\) has been reached and verified.
