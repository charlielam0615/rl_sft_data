**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2(3^x) = 162 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \( 2(3^x) = 162 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the exponential term \( 3^x \).  
2. Solve for \( x \) by expressing 162 as a power of 3 or using logarithms.  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to isolate the exponential term \( 3^x \). This can be achieved by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 2(3^x) = 162 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ 3^x = \frac{162}{2} = 81 \]  
The equation is now simplified to \( 3^x = 81 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( 3^x = 81 \) for \( x \). This can be achieved by expressing 81 as a power of 3, since 81 is \( 3^4 \), and then equating the exponents.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite 81 as a power of 3:  
\[ 81 = 3^4 \]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[ 3^x = 3^4 \]  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ x = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 4 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation \( 2(3^x) = 162 \):  
\[ 2(3^4) = 2(81) = 162 \]  
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, so the solution \( x = 4 \) is valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( 2(3^x) = 162 \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Isolate the exponential term \( 3^x \) (completed: \( 3^x = 81 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) by expressing 81 as a power of 3 (completed: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: \( x = 4 \) satisfies the original equation).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution is verified.  
The final solution is \( x = 4 \).

**Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)
