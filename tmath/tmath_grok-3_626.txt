**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, the order of the boxes does not matter, and we need to count the distinct distributions based on how the balls are partitioned between the two boxes.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the possible ways to partition 4 distinguishable balls into 2 boxes, considering the boxes are indistinguishable.  
2. Calculate the number of distributions for each valid partition.  
3. Sum the valid distributions to get the total number of ways.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible partitions of 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the sizes of the partitions (e.g., 4-0, 3-1, 2-2), as the order of the boxes does not matter. For each partition, calculate the number of ways to assign the 4 distinguishable balls to those partition sizes.

Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we consider partitions of 4 balls into two non-negative integers \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) where \(n_1 + n_2 = 4\) and \(n_1 \geq n_2\) (to avoid double-counting, e.g., 3-1 is the same as 1-3). The possible partitions are:  
- (4, 0): One box has 4 balls, the other has 0.  
- (3, 1): One box has 3 balls, the other has 1.  
- (2, 2): Each box has 2 balls.  

For each partition, compute the number of ways to assign 4 distinguishable balls:  
- **(4, 0)**: Choose 4 balls for one box (the other gets 0). Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there is only 1 way to assign all 4 balls to one box: \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).  
- **(3, 1)**: Choose 3 balls out of 4 for one box (the other gets the remaining 1). Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we calculate \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).  
- **(2, 2)**: Choose 2 balls out of 4 for one box (the other gets the remaining 2). Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we divide by 2 to account for the fact that swapping the boxes gives the same partition: \(\binom{4}{2} / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\).  

Total ways: \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculated partitions and their respective counts to ensure all possible distributions are covered and correctly computed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, reconsider the partitions:  
- **(4, 0)**: All 4 balls in one box. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, thereâ€™s only 1 way. Correct.  
- **(3, 1)**: Choose 3 balls for one box, 1 for the other. \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\). Since boxes are indistinguishable, this is not doubled. Correct.  
- **(2, 2)**: Choose 2 balls for one box, the other gets the remaining 2. \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\), but since boxes are indistinguishable, divide by 2: \(6 / 2 = 3\). Correct.  
- Check for missed partitions: Other partitions like (0, 4) are equivalent to (4, 0), and (1, 3) is equivalent to (3, 1) due to indistinguishability. No other partitions satisfy \(n_1 + n_2 = 4\).  
The sum \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\) covers all cases. To further confirm, note that for distinguishable boxes, the number of ways is \(2^4 = 16\), and dividing by 2 (for indistinguishability) suggests around 8, aligning with our result.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible partitions of 4 balls (completed: partitions are (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the number of ways for each partition (completed: 1, 4, 3 respectively).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the ways to get the total (completed: total = 8).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: partitions and counts verified).
