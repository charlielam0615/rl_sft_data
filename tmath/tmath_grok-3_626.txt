**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, where the boxes can contain any non-negative number of balls (including zero).

### Step 1: Define the Problem and Initial Approach
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into subgoals to systematically approach the solution:  
1. Understand the constraints: 4 distinguishable balls, 2 indistinguishable boxes, and boxes can be empty.  
2. Identify possible distributions of balls by the number of balls in each box.  
3. Calculate the number of ways for each valid distribution, accounting for the boxes being indistinguishable.  
4. Sum the valid distributions to get the total number of ways.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Identify Possible Distributions
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we focus on partitions of 4 balls into two non-negative integers (representing the number of balls in each box), where the order of the boxes does not matter. List the possible partitions of 4 balls:  
- (4, 0): One box has 4 balls, the other has 0.  
- (3, 1): One box has 3 balls, the other has 1.  
- (2, 2): Each box has 2 balls.  
Partitions like (0, 4) or (1, 3) are equivalent to (4, 0) and (3, 1) respectively due to indistinguishability of the boxes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3: Calculate Ways for Each Distribution
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the number of ways to assign 4 distinguishable balls to each partition (4, 0), (3, 1), and (2, 2).  
- **How to Achieve**: For each partition, calculate the number of ways to choose balls for the boxes, accounting for the boxes being indistinguishable. Use combinatorial methods to assign balls to the specified counts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For each partition, compute the number of ways to assign 4 distinguishable balls:  
- **(4, 0)**: Choose 4 balls for one box (the other gets 0). Since boxes are indistinguishable, there is only 1 way to assign all 4 balls to one box:  
  Number of ways = \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \).  
- **(3, 1)**: Choose 3 balls for one box (the other gets the remaining 1). Since boxes are indistinguishable, choosing 3 balls for one box is equivalent to choosing 1 ball for the other:  
  Number of ways = \( \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4 \).  
- **(2, 2)**: Choose 2 balls for one box (the other gets the remaining 2). Since boxes are indistinguishable, choosing 2 balls for one box defines the assignment:  
  Number of ways = \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \). However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we must divide by 2 to account for the symmetry of the two boxes:  
  Number of ways = \( \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validate the Calculations
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for each partition and ensure no distributions are missed.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the partitions cover all possibilities and confirm the combinatorial calculations are correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the partitions:  
- The partitions (4, 0), (3, 1), and (2, 2) cover all ways to split 4 balls into two non-negative integers (since \( 4+0 \), \( 3+1 \), \( 2+2 \) are the only pairs summing to 4, and pairs like (0, 4) are equivalent due to indistinguishability).  
- Recalculate:  
  - (4, 0): \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \), correct.  
  - (3, 1): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), correct.  
  - (2, 2): \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \), divided by 2 for indistinguishability gives 3, correct.  
No other partitions exist (e.g., negative numbers are not allowed). Calculations are consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Sum the Number of Ways
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Sum the number of ways from all valid partitions to find the total.  
- **How to Achieve**: Add the number of ways for (4, 0), (3, 1), and (2, 2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total number of ways = \( 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Review Goals and Finalize

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible partitions of 4 balls → Completed: (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate ways for each partition → Completed: 1, 4, 3 respectively.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate calculations → Completed: Partitions and calculations verified.  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the ways → Completed: Total = 8.  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the total.  
The total number of ways is 8, based on the validated calculations.
