**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the sum of the complex numbers \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of adding \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\), break it down into subgoals:  
1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.  
2. Add the real parts together.  
3. Add the imaginary parts together.  
4. Combine the results to form the final complex number.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.  
How to Achieve: For a complex number \(a + bi\), \(a\) is the real part, and \(b\) is the imaginary part. Apply this to both \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(1 + 3i\):  
- Real part: \(1\)  
- Imaginary part: \(3\)  

For \(2 - 4i\):  
- Real part: \(2\)  
- Imaginary part: \(-4\)  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add the real parts together.  
How to Achieve: Take the real parts identified in the previous step (\(1\) and \(2\)) and compute their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Real parts: \(1 + 2 = 3\)  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add the imaginary parts together.  
How to Achieve: Take the imaginary parts identified in Step 2 (\(3\) and \(-4\)) and compute their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Imaginary parts: \(3 + (-4) = 3 - 4 = -1\)  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Combine the results to form the final complex number.  
How to Achieve: Use the summed real part (\(3\)) and imaginary part (\(-1\)) to write the complex number in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Real part: \(3\)  
Imaginary part: \(-1\)  
Final complex number: \(3 + (-1)i = 3 - 1i\)  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the current path.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the sum of \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\) directly to confirm the result matches \(3 - 1i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Direct computation:  
\((1 + 3i) + (2 - 4i) = (1 + 2) + (3i - 4i) = 3 - 1i\)  
The result matches the computed answer \(3 - 1i\), confirming the path is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the real parts together (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the imaginary parts together (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Combine the results to form the final complex number (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, with the final answer \(3 - 1i\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Machiavelli got the number \(3 - i\).
