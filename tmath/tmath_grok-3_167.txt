**Problem Restatement**: Machiavelli added the complex numbers \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\). We need to determine the resulting complex number.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to add the complex numbers \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\). To achieve this, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately, then simplify the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To add \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\), we combine the real and imaginary parts:

- Real parts: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
- Imaginary parts: \(3i + (-4i) = 3i - 4i = -1i\)

Thus, the sum is \(3 - 1i\), or simply \(3 - i\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the sum \(3 - i\). To achieve this, recheck the addition of the real and imaginary parts and confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck the addition:

- Real parts: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
- Imaginary parts: \(3i - 4i = -1i\)

The result is \(3 - i\), which matches the previous calculation. The sum is correct.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Determine the sum of \(1 + 3i\) and \(2 - 4i\).
  - Subgoal: Add the real and imaginary parts (completed).
  - Subgoal: Validate the result (completed).

Current goal: None, as the main goal is achieved with the result \(3 - i\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Machiavelli got the number \(3 - i\).
