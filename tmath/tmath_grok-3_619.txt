### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when a fair six-sided die is rolled four times. A fair six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6, each with an equal probability of 1/6. The rolls are independent, and we are looking for the probability of exactly three successes (rolling a 1) in four trials.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Identify the probability model for the die rolls.
2. Determine the probability of success (rolling a 1) and failure (rolling a non-1).
3. Calculate the number of ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls.
4. Compute the probability using the appropriate probability formula.
5. Validate the final result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the probability model and the probabilities of success and failure.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recognize that each roll is independent with a fixed probability of rolling a 1 (success) or not rolling a 1 (failure). Use the properties of a fair six-sided die to assign probabilities.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the die is fair and has six sides, the probability of rolling a 1 (success) is \( \frac{1}{6} \). The probability of not rolling a 1 (failure, i.e., rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is \( \frac{5}{6} \). The rolls are independent, and the number of 1s in four rolls follows a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 4 \) (number of trials) and \( p = \frac{1}{6} \) (probability of success).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the binomial coefficient to determine the number of ways to choose which three of the four rolls result in a 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of ways to choose exactly three rolls out of four to result in a 1 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{4}{3} \).  
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 1} = 4 \]  
There are 4 possible sequences where exactly three rolls are 1s.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the probability of exactly three 1s using the binomial probability formula.  
- **How to Achieve**: Apply the binomial probability formula \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n = 4 \), \( k = 3 \), \( p = \frac{1}{6} \), and \( 1-p = \frac{5}{6} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the binomial probability formula:  
\[ P(X = 3) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4-3} \]  
From Step 3, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
Calculate the probabilities:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6} = \frac{1}{216} \]  
\[ \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^1 = \frac{5}{6} \]  
So,  
\[ P(X = 3) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = 4 \cdot \frac{5}{216 \cdot 6} = 4 \cdot \frac{5}{1296} = \frac{20}{1296} \]  
Simplify \( \frac{20}{1296} \):  
The greatest common divisor of 20 and 1296 is 4 (since \( 20 = 4 \cdot 5 \), \( 1296 = 4 \cdot 324 \)).  
\[ \frac{20 \div 4}{1296 \div 4} = \frac{5}{324} \]  
Thus, the probability is \( \frac{5}{324} \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the calculated probability.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the binomial coefficient, probability values, and calculations for correctness, and verify the result using an alternative method (e.g., listing outcomes or numerical approximation).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Check Calculations**:  
- Binomial coefficient: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), confirmed correct.  
- Probabilities: \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216} \), \( \frac{5}{6} \), and total: \( 4 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20}{1296} = \frac{5}{324} \).  
- Numerical value: \( \frac{5}{324} \approx 0.015432 \), which is reasonable for a low-probability event (three 1s in four rolls).  

**Alternative Method**: List possible sequences where exactly three rolls are 1s:  
The sequences are (1,1,1,non-1), (1,1,non-1,1), (1,non-1,1,1), (non-1,1,1,1). Thatâ€™s 4 sequences.  
For each sequence, the probability is:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^1 = \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{5}{1296} \]  
Total probability: \( 4 \cdot \frac{5}{1296} = \frac{20}{1296} = \frac{5}{324} \), matching the previous result.  

The calculations are consistent.
