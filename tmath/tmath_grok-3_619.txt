**Problem Statement**: Calculate the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a fair six-sided die four times.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die roll.
2. Identify the number of ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls.
3. Calculate the probability of exactly three 1s using the binomial probability formula.
4. Compute the final numerical probability.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die roll.
How to Achieve: A fair six-sided die has faces {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so the probability of rolling a 1 is 1 out of 6.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability of rolling a 1 on a single roll is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
The probability of not rolling a 1 is \( \frac{5}{6} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the number of ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls.
How to Achieve: Use the binomial coefficient to find the number of ways to choose 3 rolls out of 4 to result in a 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of ways to choose 3 rolls out of 4 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{4}{3} \).
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{24}{6 \cdot 1} = 4
\]
So, there are 4 ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls.

### Step 4

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability of rolling exactly three 1s in four rolls.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die roll (Completed: \( \frac{1}{6} \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the number of ways to get exactly three 1s in four rolls (Completed: 4 ways).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula (Pending).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final numerical probability (Pending).
Current Goal: Calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of exactly three 1s using the binomial probability formula.
How to Achieve: Use the binomial probability formula \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n = 4 \), \( k = 3 \), \( p = \frac{1}{6} \), and \( 1-p = \frac{5}{6} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The binomial probability formula is:
\[
P(X = 3) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{4-3}
\]
From Step 3, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
Calculate the probabilities:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
\]
\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^1 = \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
P(X = 3) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = 4 \cdot \frac{5}{1296} = \frac{20}{1296}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{20}{1296} = \frac{20 \div 4}{1296 \div 4} = \frac{5}{324}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the probability calculation.
How to Achieve: Check the binomial probability calculation and simplification for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]
\[
\left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
\]
\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^1 = \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
P(X = 3) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{216 \cdot 6} = \frac{20}{1296}
\]
\[
\frac{20}{1296} = \frac{5}{324}
\]
The fraction is in its simplest form (5 and 324 have no common factors). The calculation is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the final numerical probability.
How to Achieve: Convert \( \frac{5}{324} \) to a decimal for a numerical answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\frac{5}{324} \approx 0.0154320987654321
\]
Rounding to four decimal places: \( 0.0154 \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times in four rolls of a fair six-sided die is \( \frac{5}{324} \) or approximately 0.0154.
