Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify $\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}$ using the property of radicals and express it in the form $a\sqrt[4]{b}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We can use the property of radicals that $\sqrt[n]{x^m} = x^{m/n}$. Applying this to the given expression, we have:

$$
\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3} = (2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{1/4}
$$

Now, we can distribute the exponent to each factor:

$$
(2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{1/4} = 2^{7/4} \cdot 3^{3/4}
$$

We can simplify this further by writing the exponents as mixed numbers:

$$
2^{7/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^1 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}
$$
$$
3^{3/4} = 3^{0 + 3/4} = 3^0 \cdot 3^{3/4} = 1 \cdot 3^{3/4} = 3^{3/4}
$$

Combining these, we get:

$$
2 \cdot 2^{3/4} \cdot 3^{3/4} = 2 \cdot (2^{3/4} \cdot 3^{3/4})
$$

We can combine the terms in the parentheses using the property $x^{m/n} \cdot y^{m/n} = (xy)^{m/n}$:

$$
2 \cdot (2^{3/4} \cdot 3^{3/4}) = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)^{3/4} = 2 \cdot 6^{3/4}
$$

Now, we have the expression in the form $a\sqrt[4]{b}$, where $a = 2$ and $b = 6^3 = 216$. Therefore, the simplified expression is:

$$
2\sqrt[4]{216}
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution, including exponent simplification, radical properties, and arithmetic calculations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Exponent Simplification**: The original expression $\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}$ was converted to $(2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{1/4}$. This is valid because $\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{1/n}$. Further distribution to $2^{7/4} \cdot 3^{3/4}$ is correct, as exponents multiply when powers are applied to products.

2. **Breaking Exponents into Integer + Fractional Parts**:  
   - $2^{7/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^1 \cdot 2^{3/4}$ is valid.  
   - $3^{3/4}$ remains as is since $3^{0 + 3/4} = 3^{3/4}$.  
   This step correctly isolates the integer part of the exponent for extraction from the radical.

3. **Combining Terms Under the Radical**:  
   $2^{3/4} \cdot 3^{3/4} = (2 \cdot 3)^{3/4} = 6^{3/4}$ is valid because $x^{m/n} \cdot y^{m/n} = (xy)^{m/n}$. This correctly combines the terms into a single radical expression.

4. **Final Form and Arithmetic**:  
   - The simplified form $2 \cdot 6^{3/4}$ translates to $2\sqrt[4]{6^3}$, where $6^3 = 216$.  
   - Calculation of $6^3 = 216$ is correct.  
   - Sum $a + b = 2 + 216 = 218$ is accurate.

All steps are logically sound, and the final result aligns with the problem's requirements. No errors detected.
