### Problem Restatement
Given two points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \) on the Cartesian plane with midpoint \( M(m, n) \), point \( A \) is moved vertically upwards 8 units and horizontally to the right 2 units, and point \( B \) is moved vertically downwards 2 units and horizontally to the left 10 units. The new midpoint is \( M' \). We need to find the distance between \( M \) and \( M' \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the coordinates of the original midpoint \( M \).  
2. Find the new coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) after their respective movements.  
3. Calculate the coordinates of the new midpoint \( M' \).  
4. Compute the distance between \( M \) and \( M' \) using the distance formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the coordinates of the original midpoint \( M \). The midpoint of two points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \) is found using the midpoint formula: \( M = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the midpoint formula for points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \):  
\[ M = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right) \]  
Given that \( M \) has coordinates \( (m, n) \), we have:  
\[ m = \frac{a + c}{2}, \quad n = \frac{b + d}{2} \]  
Thus, the coordinates of \( M \) are \( (m, n) = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the new coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) after their movements. Point \( A(a, b) \) moves vertically upwards 8 units (increase \( y \)-coordinate by 8) and horizontally to the right 2 units (increase \( x \)-coordinate by 2). Point \( B(c, d) \) moves vertically downwards 2 units (decrease \( y \)-coordinate by 2) and horizontally to the left 10 units (decrease \( x \)-coordinate by 10).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- For point \( A(a, b) \):  
  - Horizontal movement to the right by 2 units: \( x \)-coordinate becomes \( a + 2 \).  
  - Vertical movement upwards by 8 units: \( y \)-coordinate becomes \( b + 8 \).  
  - New coordinates of \( A \): \( A' = (a + 2, b + 8) \).  

- For point \( B(c, d) \):  
  - Horizontal movement to the left by 10 units: \( x \)-coordinate becomes \( c - 10 \).  
  - Vertical movement downwards by 2 units: \( y \)-coordinate becomes \( d - 2 \).  
  - New coordinates of \( B \): \( B' = (c - 10, d - 2) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the coordinates of the new midpoint \( M' \) of points \( A' \) and \( B' \). Use the midpoint formula with the new coordinates \( A'(a + 2, b + 8) \) and \( B'(c - 10, d - 2) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the midpoint formula for points \( A'(a + 2, b + 8) \) and \( B'(c - 10, d - 2) \):  
\[ M' = \left( \frac{(a + 2) + (c - 10)}{2}, \frac{(b + 8) + (d - 2)}{2} \right) \]  
Simplify the \( x \)-coordinate:  
\[ \frac{(a + 2) + (c - 10)}{2} = \frac{a + c - 8}{2} = \frac{a + c}{2} - 4 \]  
Simplify the \( y \)-coordinate:  
\[ \frac{(b + 8) + (d - 2)}{2} = \frac{b + d + 6}{2} = \frac{b + d}{2} + 3 \]  
Since \( m = \frac{a + c}{2} \) and \( n = \frac{b + d}{2} \), the coordinates of \( M' \) are:  
\[ M' = (m - 4, n + 3) \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the coordinates of \( M' \). Check the calculation by re-deriving the midpoint \( M' \) and ensure consistency with the movements of \( A \) and \( B \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the midpoint \( M' \):  
- Coordinates of \( A' \): \( (a + 2, b + 8) \).  
- Coordinates of \( B' \): \( (c - 10, d - 2) \).  
- Midpoint formula:  
  \[ x = \frac{(a + 2) + (c - 10)}{2} = \frac{a + c - 8}{2} = \frac{a + c}{2} - 4 = m - 4 \]  
  \[ y = \frac{(b + 8) + (d - 2)}{2} = \frac{b + d + 6}{2} = \frac{b + d}{2} + 3 = n + 3 \]  
The coordinates \( M' = (m - 4, n + 3) \) are consistent.  
Additionally, verify the relationship:  
- Original midpoint \( M \): \( (m, n) = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right) \).  
- The shift in \( x \)-coordinate (\( -4 \)) and \( y \)-coordinate (\( +3 \)) aligns with the net effect of the movements:  
  - \( x \)-shift: \( \frac{2 + (-10)}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \).  
  - \( y \)-shift: \( \frac{8 + (-2)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).  
The calculation is valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the distance between \( M(m, n) \) and \( M'(m - 4, n + 3) \) using the distance formula:  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply the distance formula for points \( M(m, n) \) and \( M'(m - 4, n + 3) \):  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{((m - 4) - m)^2 + ((n + 3) - n)^2} \]  
Simplify:  
\[ = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
The distance between \( M \) and \( M' \) is 5 units.  
[/IMP]

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
