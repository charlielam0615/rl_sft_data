### Problem Restatement
Given two points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \) on the Cartesian plane, their midpoint is \( M(m, n) \). Point \( A \) is moved vertically upwards by 8 units and horizontally to the right by 2 units, and point \( B \) is moved vertically downwards by 2 units and horizontally to the left by 10 units. The new midpoint after these movements is \( M' \). We need to find the distance between \( M \) and \( M' \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the coordinates of the original midpoint \( M \).
2. Find the new coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) after their respective movements.
3. Calculate the coordinates of the new midpoint \( M' \).
4. Compute the distance between \( M \) and \( M' \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of the original midpoint \( M \).
Description: Use the midpoint formula for points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \) to find \( M(m, n) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The midpoint \( M \) between points \( A(a, b) \) and \( B(c, d) \) is calculated using the midpoint formula:
\[
M = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right)
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \( M \) are:
\[
M(m, n) = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the new coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) after their movements.
Description: Apply the given translations to \( A \) (up 8 units, right 2 units) and \( B \) (down 2 units, left 10 units) to obtain their new coordinates.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Point \( A(a, b) \):
  - Moving vertically upwards by 8 units increases the y-coordinate by 8: \( b + 8 \).
  - Moving horizontally to the right by 2 units increases the x-coordinate by 2: \( a + 2 \).
  - New coordinates of \( A \): \( A'(a + 2, b + 8) \).

- Point \( B(c, d) \):
  - Moving vertically downwards by 2 units decreases the y-coordinate by 2: \( d - 2 \).
  - Moving horizontally to the left by 10 units decreases the x-coordinate by 10: \( c - 10 \).
  - New coordinates of \( B \): \( B'(c - 10, d - 2) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the coordinates of the new midpoint \( M' \).
Description: Use the midpoint formula with the new coordinates of \( A' \) and \( B' \) to find \( M' \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The new points are \( A'(a + 2, b + 8) \) and \( B'(c - 10, d - 2) \). The midpoint \( M' \) is:
\[
M' = \left( \frac{(a + 2) + (c - 10)}{2}, \frac{(b + 8) + (d - 2)}{2} \right)
\]
Simplify the x-coordinate:
\[
\frac{(a + 2) + (c - 10)}{2} = \frac{a + 2 + c - 10}{2} = \frac{a + c - 8}{2} = \frac{a + c}{2} - 4
\]
Simplify the y-coordinate:
\[
\frac{(b + 8) + (d - 2)}{2} = \frac{b + 8 + d - 2}{2} = \frac{b + d + 6}{2} = \frac{b + d}{2} + 3
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \( M' \) are:
\[
M' = \left( \frac{a + c}{2} - 4, \frac{b + d}{2} + 3 \right)
\]
Since \( M(m, n) = \left( \frac{a + c}{2}, \frac{b + d}{2} \right) \), we can write:
\[
M' = (m - 4, n + 3)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the distance between \( M \) and \( M' \).
Description: Use the distance formula with the coordinates of \( M(m, n) \) and \( M'(m - 4, n + 3) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The distance between \( M(m, n) \) and \( M'(m - 4, n + 3) \) is calculated using the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substitute the coordinates:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{((m - 4) - m)^2 + ((n + 3) - n)^2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
= \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]
The distance between \( M \) and \( M' \) is 5 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the distance calculation.
Description: Recheck the coordinates of \( M' \) and the distance formula to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( M' \):
- \( A'(a + 2, b + 8) \), \( B'(c - 10, d - 2) \).
- x-coordinate: \( \frac{a + 2 + c - 10}{2} = \frac{a + c - 8}{2} = \frac{a + c}{2} - 4 = m - 4 \).
- y-coordinate: \( \frac{b + 8 + d - 2}{2} = \frac{b + d + 6}{2} = \frac{b + d}{2} + 3 = n + 3 \).
- \( M' = (m - 4, n + 3) \).

Recalculate distance:
\[
\sqrt{(m - 4 - m)^2 + (n + 3 - n)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5
\]
The calculation is consistent.
