**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the 13th term of a geometric sequence where the 7th term is 7 and the 10th term is 21.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the 13th term, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the given terms (7th term = 7, 10th term = 21) to set up equations based on the geometric sequence formula.  
2. Solve for the first term and common ratio.  
3. Use these to find the 13th term.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations using the geometric sequence formula for the 7th and 10th terms. A geometric sequence has the form \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. For the 7th term (\( n = 7 \)), \( a \cdot r^6 = 7 \). For the 10th term (\( n = 10 \)), \( a \cdot r^9 = 21 \). We will write these equations to proceed.

[IMP]  
Using the geometric sequence formula \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \):  
- For the 7th term: \( a \cdot r^6 = 7 \) (Equation 1).  
- For the 10th term: \( a \cdot r^9 = 21 \) (Equation 2).  
These equations will be used in the next step to find \( a \) and \( r \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( a \cdot r^6 = 7 \) and \( a \cdot r^9 = 21 \) to find the common ratio \( r \) and first term \( a \). Divide the second equation by the first to eliminate \( a \), then solve for \( r \). Substitute \( r \) back to find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:  
\[ \frac{a \cdot r^9}{a \cdot r^6} = \frac{21}{7} \]  
\[ r^3 = 3 \]  
\[ r = 3^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{3} \].  

Substitute \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \) into Equation 1:  
\[ a \cdot (\sqrt[3]{3})^6 = 7 \]  
\[ a \cdot (3^{1/3})^6 = a \cdot 3^2 = a \cdot 9 = 7 \]  
\[ a = \frac{7}{9} \].  

Thus, the first term is \( a = \frac{7}{9} \), and the common ratio is \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the values \( a = \frac{7}{9} \) and \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \) by checking if they satisfy the given conditions for the 7th and 10th terms. Compute the 7th and 10th terms using these values and confirm they match 7 and 21, respectively.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the 7th term (\( n = 7 \)):  
\[ a_7 = a \cdot r^6 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (\sqrt[3]{3})^6 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (3^{1/3})^6 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^2 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 9 = 7 \].  
This matches the given 7th term.  

For the 10th term (\( n = 10 \)):  
\[ a_{10} = a \cdot r^9 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (\sqrt[3]{3})^9 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (3^{1/3})^9 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^3 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 27 = \frac{7 \cdot 27}{9} = 7 \cdot 3 = 21 \].  
This matches the given 10th term.  

The values \( a = \frac{7}{9} \) and \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \) are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the 13th term using the formula \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with \( a = \frac{7}{9} \), \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \), and \( n = 13 \). Compute \( a_{13} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (\sqrt[3]{3})^{12} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the 13th term (\( n = 13 \)):  
\[ a_{13} = a \cdot r^{12} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (\sqrt[3]{3})^{12} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (3^{1/3})^{12} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^4 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 81 = \frac{7 \cdot 81}{9} = 7 \cdot 9 = 63 \].  
The 13th term is 63.

  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) (completed: \( a = \frac{7}{9} \), \( r = \sqrt[3]{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: 7th and 10th terms match).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the 13th term (completed: \( a_{13} = 63 \)).
