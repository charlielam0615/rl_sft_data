**Problem Restatement**: Find the 13th term of a geometric sequence where the 7th term is 7 and the 10th term is 21.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the 13th term, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the given terms (7th term = 7, 10th term = 21) to find the common ratio \( r \) and the first term \( a \).  
2. Derive the general formula for the \( n \)-th term of the geometric sequence.  
3. Calculate the 13th term using the derived formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the common ratio \( r \) and the first term \( a \).  
How to Achieve: Use the geometric sequence formula \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \). Set up equations for the 7th term (\( a \cdot r^6 = 7 \)) and the 10th term (\( a \cdot r^9 = 21 \)). Divide the equations to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( r \), then find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a geometric sequence, the \( n \)-th term is \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \).  
- 7th term: \( a \cdot r^6 = 7 \)  
- 10th term: \( a \cdot r^9 = 21 \)  

Divide the 10th term equation by the 7th term equation:  
\[
\frac{a \cdot r^9}{a \cdot r^6} = \frac{21}{7}  
\]
\[
r^3 = 3 \implies r = \sqrt[3]{3} = 3^{1/3}  
\]

Substitute \( r = 3^{1/3} \) into the 7th term equation:  
\[
a \cdot (3^{1/3})^6 = 7 \implies a \cdot 3^{6/3} = 7 \implies a \cdot 3^2 = 7 \implies a \cdot 9 = 7 \implies a = \frac{7}{9}  
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the values of \( r \) and \( a \).  
How to Achieve: Use \( r = 3^{1/3} \) and \( a = \frac{7}{9} \) to compute the 10th term and check if it equals 21.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the 10th term:  
\[
a_{10} = a \cdot r^9 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (3^{1/3})^9 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^{9/3} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^3 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 27 = \frac{7 \cdot 27}{9} = \frac{189}{9} = 21  
\]
The calculated 10th term matches the given value, confirming \( r = 3^{1/3} \) and \( a = \frac{7}{9} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the 13th term.  
How to Achieve: Use the general formula \( a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \) with \( a = \frac{7}{9} \), \( r = 3^{1/3} \), and \( n = 13 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the 13th term:  
\[
a_{13} = a \cdot r^{12} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot (3^{1/3})^{12} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^{12/3} = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 3^4 = \frac{7}{9} \cdot 81 = \frac{7 \cdot 81}{9} = \frac{567}{9} = 63  
\]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the 13th term of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the common ratio \( r \) and first term \( a \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the general formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the 13th term (completed).  
Current Goal: Completed (13th term calculated as 63).

**Final Answer**: The 13th term of the geometric sequence is \( 63 \).
