**Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of coins \( n \) such that when \( n \) coins are simultaneously flipped, the probability of getting at most one tail is \( \frac{3}{16} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( n \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the probability of getting at most one tail in terms of \( n \).  
2. Set up an equation based on the given probability \( \frac{3}{16} \).  
3. Solve the equation to find \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the probability of getting at most one tail when flipping \( n \) coins. Achieve this by modeling the coin flips as a binomial distribution and calculating the probability of 0 or 1 tail.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each coin has a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) for heads and \( \frac{1}{2} \) for tails. The number of tails follows a binomial distribution with parameters \( n \) (number of trials) and \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) (probability of tails). The probability of at most one tail is the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 0 tails and exactly 1 tail:  
- **0 tails**: All coins show heads. Probability = \( \binom{n}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \).  
- **1 tail**: Exactly one coin shows tails. Probability = \( \binom{n}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1} = \binom{n}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \).  
Thus, the total probability is:  
\[ P(\text{at most 1 tail}) = \binom{n}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + \binom{n}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left( \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} \right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n. \]  
Since \( \binom{n}{0} = 1 \) and \( \binom{n}{1} = n \), this simplifies to:  
\[ P(\text{at most 1 tail}) = (1 + n) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1 + n}{2^n}. \]  
The problem states this equals \( \frac{3}{16} \), so:  
\[ \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16}. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16} \) for \( n \). Achieve this by testing integer values of \( n \) to find a solution that satisfies the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16}. \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 2^n \):  
\[ 1 + n = \frac{3}{16} \cdot 2^n = \frac{3 \cdot 2^n}{16} = \frac{3 \cdot 2^n}{2^4} = 3 \cdot 2^{n-4}. \]  
Thus:  
\[ 1 + n = 3 \cdot 2^{n-4}. \]  
Test integer values for \( n \):  
- For \( n = 3 \):  
  \[ 1 + 3 = 4, \quad 3 \cdot 2^{3-4} = 3 \cdot 2^{-1} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5. \quad 4 \neq 1.5. \]  
- For \( n = 4 \):  
  \[ 1 + 4 = 5, \quad 3 \cdot 2^{4-4} = 3 \cdot 2^0 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3. \quad 5 \neq 3. \]  
- For \( n = 5 \):  
  \[ 1 + 5 = 6, \quad 3 \cdot 2^{5-4} = 3 \cdot 2^1 = 6. \quad 6 = 6. \]  
- For \( n = 6 \):  
  \[ 1 + 6 = 7, \quad 3 \cdot 2^{6-4} = 3 \cdot 2^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12. \quad 7 \neq 12. \]  
The equation holds for \( n = 5 \).  
Alternatively, compute \( \frac{1 + n}{2^n} \) directly:  
- \( n = 5 \): \( \frac{1 + 5}{2^5} = \frac{6}{32} = \frac{3}{16} \).  
This confirms the solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( n = 5 \) satisfies the original probability condition. Achieve this by recomputing the probability with \( n = 5 \) and checking if it equals \( \frac{3}{16} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( n = 5 \):  
\[ P(\text{at most 1 tail}) = \frac{1 + 5}{2^5} = \frac{6}{32} = \frac{3}{16}. \]  
This matches the given probability, confirming \( n = 5 \) is correct.  
To ensure uniqueness, test other values:  
- \( n = 6 \): \( \frac{1 + 6}{2^6} = \frac{7}{64} \approx 0.1094 \neq \frac{3}{16} = 0.1875. \]  
- \( n = 4 \): \( \frac{1 + 4}{2^4} = \frac{5}{16} = 0.3125 \neq 0.1875. \]  
No other small positive integers satisfy the equation, confirming \( n = 5 \).
