### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of coins \( n \) such that when \( n \) coins are simultaneously flipped, the probability that at most one of them shows tails is \( \frac{3}{16} \). Each coin flip is independent, with a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) for heads or tails.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( n \).  
1. Define the event "at most one tail" as the sum of probabilities for zero tails and exactly one tail.  
2. Express these probabilities using the binomial probability formula.  
3. Set up the equation based on the given probability \( \frac{3}{16} \).  
4. Solve the equation to find \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the probability of at most one tail mathematically. Achieve this by calculating the probabilities of zero tails and one tail using the binomial distribution, summing them, and setting the result equal to \( \frac{3}{16} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The event "at most one tail" includes:  
- **Zero tails**: All coins show heads. Probability is \( P(X = 0) = \binom{n}{0} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{2^n} \).  
- **One tail**: Exactly one coin shows tails. Probability is \( P(X = 1) = \binom{n}{1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^1 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1} = n \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} = n \cdot \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{n}{2^n} \).  

Total probability:  
\[ P(\text{at most one tail}) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{n}{2^n} = \frac{1 + n}{2^n} \].  

Given:  
\[ \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16} \].

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16} \) for \( n \). Achieve this by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction and testing integer values of \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{3}{16} \].  

Cross-multiply:  
\[ 16 (1 + n) = 3 \cdot 2^n \].  

Simplify:  
\[ 16 + 16n = 3 \cdot 2^n \].  

Since \( n \) is the number of coins, test positive integer values for \( n \):  
- For \( n = 1 \):  
  \[ 16 + 16 \cdot 1 = 16 + 16 = 32 \],  
  \[ 3 \cdot 2^1 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \].  
  \( 32 \neq 6 \).  

- For \( n = 2 \):  
  \[ 16 + 16 \cdot 2 = 16 + 32 = 48 \],  
  \[ 3 \cdot 2^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \].  
  \( 48 \neq 12 \).  

- For \( n = 3 \):  
  \[ 16 + 16 \cdot 3 = 16 + 48 = 64 \],  
  \[ 3 \cdot 2^3 = 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \].  
  \( 64 \neq 24 \).  

- For \( n = 4 \):  
  \[ 16 + 16 \cdot 4 = 16 + 64 = 80 \],  
  \[ 3 \cdot 2^4 = 3 \cdot 16 = 48 \].  
  \( 80 \neq 48 \).  

- For \( n = 5 \):  
  \[ 16 + 16 \cdot 5 = 16 + 80 = 96 \],  
  \[ 3 \cdot 2^5 = 3 \cdot 32 = 96 \].  
  \( 96 = 96 \).  

The equation holds for \( n = 5 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( n = 5 \) by recomputing the probability and checking if it equals \( \frac{3}{16} \). Achieve this by substituting \( n = 5 \) back into the probability formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( n = 5 \):  
\[ P(\text{at most one tail}) = \frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \frac{1 + 5}{2^5} = \frac{6}{32} = \frac{3}{16} \].  

The probability matches \( \frac{3}{16} \), confirming \( n = 5 \) is correct.
