**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the $y$-intercept, we need to determine the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis, which occurs when $x = 0$. The subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the equation in a form that allows us to solve for $y$ when $x = 0$.  
2. Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation to find the $y$-value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation $x - 2y = 5$ to solve for $y$.  
Description: Isolate $y$ by performing algebraic operations to express the equation in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), where the $y$-intercept is $b$.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
$x - 2y = 5$  

Subtract $x$ from both sides:  
$-2y = 5 - x$  

Divide both sides by $-2$:  
$y = \frac{5 - x}{-2} = \frac{-5 + x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{5}{2}$  

The equation is now in slope-intercept form $y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2}$, where the $y$-intercept is $-\frac{5}{2}$.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the $y$-intercept by substituting $x = 0$ into the equation.  
Description: Use either the original equation $x - 2y = 5$ or the rewritten form $y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2}$ to compute $y$ when $x = 0$.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the slope-intercept form $y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{5}{2}$:  
Substitute $x = 0$:  
$y = \frac{1}{2}(0) - \frac{5}{2} = -\frac{5}{2}$  

Alternatively, using the original equation $x - 2y = 5$:  
Substitute $x = 0$:  
$0 - 2y = 5$  
$-2y = 5$  
$y = -\frac{5}{2}$  

Both methods confirm the $y$-intercept is $-\frac{5}{2}$.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the $y$-intercept calculation.  
Description: Check the solution by substituting $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{5}{2}$ back into the original equation to ensure it holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{5}{2}$ into $x - 2y = 5$:  
$0 - 2\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = 0 + 5 = 5$  

The equation is satisfied, confirming the $y$-intercept is correct.
