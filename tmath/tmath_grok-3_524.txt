**Problem Statement**: Find the y-intercept of the line given by the equation \( x - 2y = 5 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the y-intercept, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand that the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis (i.e., where \( x = 0 \)).  
2. Rearrange the given equation into a form that allows us to solve for \( y \) when \( x = 0 \).  
3. Compute the value of \( y \) at \( x = 0 \).  
4. Validate the result to ensure correctness.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rearrange the equation \( x - 2y = 5 \) to solve for \( y \) when \( x = 0 \). This can be achieved by isolating \( y \) in the equation and substituting \( x = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]  
Substitute \( x = 0 \):  
\[ 0 - 2y = 5 \]  
\[ -2y = 5 \]  
Divide both sides by \(-2\):  
\[ y = -\frac{5}{2} \]  
The y-intercept is \( y = -\frac{5}{2} \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( y = -\frac{5}{2} \) is the correct y-intercept by checking if the point \( (0, -\frac{5}{2}) \) satisfies the original equation and confirming the y-intercept definition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -\frac{5}{2} \) into the original equation \( x - 2y = 5 \):  
\[ x - 2y = 0 - 2 \left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = 0 + 5 = 5 \]  
The equation holds true, confirming the point \( (0, -\frac{5}{2}) \) lies on the line. Additionally, the y-intercept occurs where \( x = 0 \), which aligns with our calculation.
