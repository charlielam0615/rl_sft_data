**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all integer values \( n \) such that the equation \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\) holds, and then compute the sum of those \( n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Simplify the given equation \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\) using binomial coefficient identities.
2. Identify all integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the simplified equation.
3. Sum the valid \( n \) values to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the equation \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\) using binomial identities.
How to Achieve: Use the identity \(\binom{m}{k} = \binom{m}{m-k}\) if needed, and explore relationships between \(\binom{21}{11}\) and \(\binom{20}{n}\). Move \(\binom{20}{10}\) to the right to isolate \(\binom{20}{n}\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[
\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}
\]
Isolate \(\binom{20}{n}\):
\[
\binom{20}{n} = \binom{21}{11} - \binom{20}{10}
\]
To proceed, express \(\binom{21}{11}\) in terms of binomial coefficients with base 20, if possible. Use the Pascalâ€™s identity:
\[
\binom{m+1}{k} = \binom{m}{k} + \binom{m}{k-1}
\]
For \( m = 20, k = 11 \):
\[
\binom{21}{11} = \binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10}
\]
Substitute into the equation:
\[
\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10} - \binom{20}{10} = \binom{20}{11}
\]
Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find all integer \( n \) such that \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\).
How to Achieve: Use the property of binomial coefficients that \(\binom{m}{k} = \binom{m}{m-k}\) to find \( n \). Ensure \( n \) is an integer within the valid range \( 0 \leq n \leq 20 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\), and we know \(\binom{m}{k} = \binom{m}{m-k}\), set:
\[
n = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad n = 20 - 11 = 9
\]
Thus, \( n = 9 \) or \( n = 11 \) satisfies \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\). Check the range:
- \( n = 9 \): Valid, since \( 0 \leq 9 \leq 20 \).
- \( n = 11 \): Valid, since \( 0 \leq 11 \leq 20 \).
No other integers \( n \) satisfy \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\), as binomial coefficients are distinct for different \( n \) within the range.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( n = 9 \) and \( n = 11 \) satisfy the original equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 9 \) and \( n = 11 \) back into \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\) and check equality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = 9 \):
\[
\binom{20}{9} + \binom{20}{10} \stackrel{?}{=} \binom{21}{11}
\]
Since \(\binom{20}{9} = \binom{20}{11}\), rewrite:
\[
\binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}
\]
This holds, as shown in Step 2: \(\binom{21}{11} = \binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10}\).

For \( n = 11 \):
\[
\binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10} \stackrel{?}{=} \binom{21}{11}
\]
Again, this is:
\[
\binom{20}{11} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}
\]
This is true by the same identity. Thus, both \( n = 9 \) and \( n = 11 \) are valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all integer \( n \) for which \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify all integer \( n \) satisfying the equation (completed: \( n = 9, 11 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the valid \( n \) values (pending).
Current Goal: Sum the valid \( n \) values.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum of the valid \( n \) values.
How to Achieve: Add the integers \( n = 9 \) and \( n = 11 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the valid \( n \):
\[
9 + 11 = 20
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Confirm the final answer by ensuring all steps are correct.
How to Achieve: Review the solution path and recheck the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solution path:
- Simplified \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\).
- Found \( n = 9, 11 \) using \(\binom{20}{n} = \binom{20}{11}\).
- Verified both satisfy the original equation.
- Summed: \( 9 + 11 = 20 \).
Recheck sum:
\[
9 + 11 = 20
\]
The answer is consistent.
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The sum of all integer values \( n \) for which \(\binom{20}{n} + \binom{20}{10} = \binom{21}{11}\) is \( 20 \).

\[ \boxed{20} \]
