Goal of this step: Rearrange the given equation $ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 $ into a more manageable form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We begin by moving all terms to one side of the equation:  
$$
ab - 6a + 5b - 373 = 0
$$  
Next, to simplify the equation, we add and subtract a constant to complete the factorization. Group terms involving $ a $ and $ b $:  
$$
ab - 6a + 5b = 373
$$  
We aim to factor it. To do so, we might add and subtract a constant to both sides to make the left-hand side factorable. Observe that:  
$$
ab - 6a + 5b = (a + 5)(b - 6) - 30
$$  
This can be verified through expansion. Let's expand $ (a + 5)(b - 6) $:  
$$
(a + 5)(b - 6) = ab - 6a + 5b - 30
$$  
Adding 30 to both sides, the original equation becomes:  
$$
ab - 6a + 5b - 373 = 0 \Rightarrow ab - 6a + 5b = 373
\Rightarrow (a + 5)(b - 6) = 373 + 30 = 403
$$  
Thus, the equation simplifies to:  
$$
(a + 5)(b - 6) = 403
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine all positive integer pairs $ (a, b) $ such that $ (a + 5)(b - 6) = 403 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $ 403 $ is a positive integer, and $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, $ a + 5 $ and $ b - 6 $ must also be positive integers. Therefore, we find all factor pairs of 403 such that:  
$$
(a + 5)(b - 6) = 403
$$  
Factor pairs of 403 are:  
$$
(1, 403), (13, 31), (31, 13), (403, 1)
$$  
We now solve for $ a $ and $ b $ in each case:  

1. For $ (a + 5, b - 6) = (1, 403) $:  
   $$
   a + 5 = 1 \Rightarrow a = -4 \quad \text{(invalid, since $ a $ must be positive)}
   $$

2. For $ (a + 5, b - 6) = (13, 31) $:  
   $$
   a + 5 = 13 \Rightarrow a = 8, \quad b - 6 = 31 \Rightarrow b = 37
   $$

3. For $ (a + 5, b - 6) = (31, 13) $:  
   $$
   a + 5 = 31 \Rightarrow a = 26, \quad b - 6 = 13 \Rightarrow b = 19
   $$

4. For $ (a + 5, b - 6) = (403, 1) $:  
   $$
   a + 5 = 403 \Rightarrow a = 398, \quad b - 6 = 1 \Rightarrow b = 7
   $$

Thus, the valid pairs $ (a, b) $ are:  
$$
(8, 37), (26, 19), (398, 7)
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $ |a - b| $ for each valid pair $ (a, b) $ and determine the minimal value.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For the valid pairs $ (a, b) $:  

1. $ (8, 37) $:  
   $$
   |a - b| = |8 - 37| = 29
   $$

2. $ (26, 19) $:  
   $$
   |a - b| = |26 - 19| = 7
   $$

3. $ (398, 7) $:  
   $$
   |a - b| = |398 - 7| = 391
   $$

The minimal possible value of $ |a - b| $ among these is $ 7 $.

1. Equation Transformation:  
   The original equation $ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 $ was transformed to $ (a + 5)(b - 6) = 403 $ via algebraic manipulation.  
   - Expansion of $ (a + 5)(b - 6) $ yields $ ab - 6a + 5b - 30 $.  
   - Adding 30 to both sides of the original equation gives $ ab - 6a + 5b = 403 $, which matches the transformed equation.  
   **Conclusion**: The transformation is correct.

2. Factorization of 403:  
   The prime factorization of 403 is $ 13 \times 31 $.  
   All positive integer factor pairs of 403 were listed: $ (1, 403), (13, 31), (31, 13), (403, 1) $.
