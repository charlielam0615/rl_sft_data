### Problem Restatement
We need to solve the system of equations \( y = 7 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \) and find the sum of the solutions for \( x \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the system of equations and compute the sum of \( x \)-values:  
1. Substitute \( y = 7 \) into the second equation to form a single equation in \( x \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Identify all possible solutions for \( x \).  
4. Compute the sum of the \( x \)-values.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Substitute \( y = 7 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \) to form an equation in \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Replace \( y \) with 7 in the second equation and simplify to obtain a quadratic equation in \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( y = 7 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \):  
\[ x^2 + 7^2 = 100 \]  
\[ x^2 + 49 = 100 \]  
\[ x^2 = 100 - 49 \]  
\[ x^2 = 51 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( x^2 = 51 \) for \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the square root of both sides, considering both positive and negative roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve \( x^2 = 51 \):  
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{51} \]  
The solutions are \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \) by substituting back into the original equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each \( x \)-value along with \( y = 7 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \) and check if the equation holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = \sqrt{51} \):  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = (\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2 = 51 + 49 = 100 \]  
This satisfies \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \), and \( y = 7 \) is given.  

For \( x = -\sqrt{51} \):  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = (-\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2 = 51 + 49 = 100 \]  
This also satisfies \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \), and \( y = 7 \) is given.  

Both solutions are valid.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the solutions for \( x \) in the system \( y = 7 \), \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( y = 7 \) into the second equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed: \( x = \sqrt{51}, -\sqrt{51} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solutions (completed: both solutions valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of the \( x \)-values (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the \( x \)-values.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the solutions for \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Add the \( x \)-values obtained: \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the solutions:  
\[ x_1 + x_2 = \sqrt{51} + (-\sqrt{51}) = \sqrt{51} - \sqrt{51} = 0 \]  
The sum of the solutions for \( x \) is 0.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of the solutions for \( x \) is \( \boxed{0} \).
