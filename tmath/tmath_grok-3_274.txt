### Problem Restatement
We need to solve the system of equations \( y = 7 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \), and find the sum of the solutions for \( x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the system of equations, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( y = 7 \) into the second equation to eliminate \( y \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Identify all possible solutions for \( x \).  
4. Compute the sum of the solutions for \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute \( y = 7 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \) to obtain an equation in terms of \( x \).  
Description: Replace \( y \) with 7 in the second equation, simplify, and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 7 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \):  
\[ x^2 + 7^2 = 100 \]  
\[ x^2 + 49 = 100 \]  
\[ x^2 = 100 - 49 \]  
\[ x^2 = 51 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{51} \]  
The solutions for \( x \) are \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \) satisfy both equations.  
Description: Substitute each \( x \) value along with \( y = 7 \) into both equations to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check \( x = \sqrt{51} \), \( y = 7 \):**  
- First equation: \( y = 7 \), which is satisfied.  
- Second equation: \( x^2 + y^2 = (\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2 = 51 + 49 = 100 \), which is satisfied.  

**Check \( x = -\sqrt{51} \), \( y = 7 \):**  
- First equation: \( y = 7 \), which is satisfied.  
- Second equation: \( x^2 + y^2 = (-\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2 = 51 + 49 = 100 \), which is satisfied.  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the solutions for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( y = 7 \) into the second equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) (completed, solutions: \( x = \sqrt{51}, -\sqrt{51} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of the solutions for \( x \) (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Sum of solutions for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( y = 7 \) (done).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) (done, \( x = \sqrt{51}, -\sqrt{51} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions (done).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute sum (current).  
Current goal: Compute the sum of the solutions for \( x \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the sum of the solutions for \( x \).  
Description: Add the solutions \( x = \sqrt{51} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{51} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the solutions:  
\[ x = \sqrt{51} + (-\sqrt{51}) = \sqrt{51} - \sqrt{51} = 0 \]  
The sum of the solutions for \( x \) is 0.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of the solutions for \( x \) is \( 0 \).
