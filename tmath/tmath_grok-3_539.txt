### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( y \) for the point \( Q(4, y) \) such that the slope of the line passing through points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \) is \( \frac{-3}{2} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Recall the formula for the slope of a line given two points.
2. Set up the slope equation using points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \).
3. Set the slope equal to \( \frac{-3}{2} \) and solve for \( y \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve the formula for the slope of a line given two points, as this is the foundation for setting up the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
This formula will be used to compute the slope for points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to set up the slope equation using points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \), set it equal to \( \frac{-3}{2} \), and solve for \( y \). This will be achieved by substituting the coordinates into the slope formula and solving the resulting equation.

[IMP]
Using the slope formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \), where \( P(-2, 7) = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q(4, y) = (x_2, y_2) \):
\[
m = \frac{y - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{y - 7}{4 + 2} = \frac{y - 7}{6}
\]
Set the slope equal to \( \frac{-3}{2} \):
\[
\frac{y - 7}{6} = \frac{-3}{2}
\]
Solve for \( y \):
\[
y - 7 = \frac{-3}{2} \cdot 6 = -9
\]
\[
y = -9 + 7 = -2
\]
Thus, \( y = -2 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that the slope of the line through \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, -2) \) is indeed \( \frac{-3}{2} \). This will be achieved by recomputing the slope using the found value of \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( y = -2 \) into the slope formula for points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, -2) \):
\[
m = \frac{-2 - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{-9}{6} = \frac{-3}{2}
\]
The calculated slope matches \( \frac{-3}{2} \), confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the value of \( y \) such that the slope of the line through \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \) is \( \frac{-3}{2} \).
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the slope formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the slope equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).
Current goal: None, as the main goal has been achieved with \( y = -2 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( y \) is \( -2 \).
