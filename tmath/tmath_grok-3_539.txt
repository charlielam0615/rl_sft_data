**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( y \) for the point \( Q(4, y) \) such that the slope of the line passing through points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \) is \( \frac{-3}{2} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recall the formula for the slope of a line given two points.  
2. Set up the slope equation using points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \).  
3. Equate the slope to \( \frac{-3}{2} \) and solve for \( y \).

### Step 2: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the formula for the slope of a line given two points, as it is foundational for setting up the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The slope \( m \) of a line through points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:  
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]  
This formula will be used to compute the slope for points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the slope equation using points \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \), equate it to \( \frac{-3}{2} \), and solve for \( y \). This will be achieved by applying the slope formula and solving the resulting equation.

[IMP]
Using the slope formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \), substitute \( P(-2, 7) \) as \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( Q(4, y) \) as \( (x_2, y_2) \):  
\[ m = \frac{y - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{y - 7}{4 + 2} = \frac{y - 7}{6} \]  
Given the slope \( m = \frac{-3}{2} \), set up the equation:  
\[ \frac{y - 7}{6} = \frac{-3}{2} \]  
Solve for \( y \):  
Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominator:  
\[ y - 7 = \frac{-3}{2} \cdot 6 = -9 \]  
Add 7 to both sides:  
\[ y = -9 + 7 = -2 \]  
Thus, \( y = -2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Verify the solution by checking if the slope of the line through \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, -2) \) is indeed \( \frac{-3}{2} \). This will be done by recomputing the slope with \( y = -2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( Q(4, -2) \) into the slope formula:  
\[ m = \frac{-2 - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{-9}{6} = \frac{-3}{2} \]  
The calculated slope matches the given slope \( \frac{-3}{2} \), confirming the solution is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( y \) such that the slope of the line through \( P(-2, 7) \) and \( Q(4, y) \) is \( \frac{-3}{2} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the slope formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the slope equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The solution \( y = -2 \) has been validated.

**Final Answer**: The value of \( y \) is \( -2 \).
