**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified form of the expression \( 4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9) \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^2 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the coefficients in each term of the expression.  
2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.  
3. Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Distribute the coefficients in each term of the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the distributive property to each part of the expression: \( 4(x - x^3) \), \( -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) \), and \( 2(4x^2 - x^9) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute each term:  
- First term: \( 4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 \).  
- Second term: \( -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 \).  
- Third term: \( 2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  

The expression becomes:  
\( (4x - 4x^3) + (-3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5) + (8x^2 - 2x^9) \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine like terms to simplify the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Group terms with the same exponent of \( x \) (i.e., \( x, x^2, x^3, x^5, x^9 \)) and sum their coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\( 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  

Group like terms:  
- \( x^2 \)-terms: \( -3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2 \).  
- \( x^3 \)-terms: \( -4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3 \).  
- \( x^5 \)-terms: \( -3x^5 \).  
- \( x^9 \)-terms: \( -2x^9 \).  
- \( x \)-terms: \( 4x \).  

Simplified expression:  
\( 4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the simplified expression and extract the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The simplified expression is \( 4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9 \).  
The term involving \( x^2 \) is \( 5x^2 \), so the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 5.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the simplification and the coefficient of \( x^2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the distribution and combination of terms to ensure no errors were made.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Redistribute:  
- \( 4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 \).  
- \( -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 \).  
- \( 2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  

Combine: \( 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  
Group:  
- \( x^2 \): \( -3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3 \).  
- Others: \( 4x - 3x^5 - 2x^9 \).  

The expression is again \( 4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9 \), confirming the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 5.
