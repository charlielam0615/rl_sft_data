### Problem Statement
We need to find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified form of the expression \( 4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the constants through each parenthetical expression.  
2. Collect all terms in the resulting expression.  
3. Identify and sum the coefficients of the \( x^2 \) terms.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to distribute the constants (4, -3, and 2) through each parenthetical expression in \( 4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9) \). This will be achieved by applying the distributive property to each term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute each constant:  
- First term: \( 4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 \).  
- Second term: \( -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 \).  
- Third term: \( 2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  

The expression becomes:  
\( (4x - 4x^3) + (-3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5) + (8x^2 - 2x^9) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to collect all like terms in the expression \( 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 \). This will be achieved by grouping terms with the same exponent and combining their coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Group like terms:  
- \( x^9 \): \( -2x^9 \).  
- \( x^5 \): \( -3x^5 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3 \).  
- \( x^2 \): \( -3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2 \).  
- \( x \): \( 4x \).  

The simplified expression is:  
\( -2x^9 - 3x^5 - x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the simplified expression \( -2x^9 - 3x^5 - x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x \) is correct by rechecking the distribution and combination steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck distribution:  
- \( 4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 \).  
- \( -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 \).  
- \( 2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  

Combine: \( 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 \).  
Group:  
- \( x^9 \): \( -2x^9 \).  
- \( x^5 \): \( -3x^5 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3 \).  
- \( x^2 \): \( -3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2 \).  
- \( x \): \( 4x \).  

The expression matches: \( -2x^9 - 3x^5 - x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x \). The simplification is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression \( -2x^9 - 3x^5 - x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x \). This will be achieved by examining the term involving \( x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The term involving \( x^2 \) is \( 5x^2 \). Thus, the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 5.
