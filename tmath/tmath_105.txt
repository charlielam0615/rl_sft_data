Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Expand the given expression by distributing the constants to each term inside the parentheses.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the expression:

$$ 4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9) $$

Distribute the constants to each term in the parentheses:

- $ 4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 $
- $ -3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 $
- $ 2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9 $

The expanded expression is:

$$ 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms in the expanded expression.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expanded expression is:

$$ 4x - 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5 + 8x^2 - 2x^9 $$

Now, combine like terms:

- $x^3$ terms: $-4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3$
- $x^2$ terms: $-3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2$
- Other terms remain as is: $4x - 3x^5 - 2x^9$

The simplified expression becomes:

$$ 4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the coefficient of $x^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the simplified expression:  

$$ 4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9 $$

The term containing $x^2$ is $5x^2$, and its coefficient is $5$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Expansion Verification**:
   - $4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3$: Correct. Distributed 4 to both terms.
   - $-3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5$: Correct. Distributed -3 to all three terms.
   - $2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9$: Correct. Distributed 2 to both terms.

2. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - $x^3$ terms: $-4x^3 + 3x^3 = -x^3$: Correct. Arithmetic is valid.
   - $x^2$ terms: $-3x^2 + 8x^2 = 5x^2$: Correct. Combining coefficients -3 + 8 = 5.
   - Other terms ($4x$, $-3x^5$, $-2x^9$) remain unchanged: Correct. No like terms to combine.

3. **Final Coefficient Extraction**:
   - Simplified expression: $4x + 5x^2 - x^3 - 3x^5 - 2x^9$: Valid. All terms accounted for.
   - Coefficient of $x^2$ is $5$: Correct. No conflicting terms or miscalculations.

No errors detected in any step. The coefficient of $x^2$ is indeed $5$.
