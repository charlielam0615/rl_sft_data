**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the probability that Mary and James, who each choose a seat at random from a row of 7 chairs, do not sit next to each other.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of possible seating arrangements for Mary and James.  
2. Determine the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other.  
3. Subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of non-adjacent arrangements.  
4. Compute the probability by dividing the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total arrangements.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of possible seating arrangements for Mary and James.  
How to Achieve: Since there are 7 chairs and Mary and James each choose one seat at random (with all other chairs empty), we calculate the number of ways to assign 2 distinct people to 7 distinct chairs, where order matters (permutations).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of ways to seat Mary and James in 2 of the 7 chairs is given by the permutation formula \( P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)! \), where \( n = 7 \) (chairs) and \( k = 2 \) (people).  
\[ P(7, 2) = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]  
So, there are 42 possible seating arrangements for Mary and James.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other.  
How to Achieve: Treat Mary and James as a single "block" to account for them sitting next to each other, then calculate the number of ways to place this block in the row and arrange the two people within the block.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider Mary and James as a single block. Since they must sit next to each other, the block occupies 2 adjacent chairs. In a row of 7 chairs, there are \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) pairs of adjacent chairs (chairs 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7).  
For each pair, Mary and James can be arranged within the block in 2 ways (Mary-James or James-Mary).  
Thus, the number of arrangements where they sit next to each other is:  
\[ 6 \text{ (pairs)} \times 2 \text{ (arrangements within the pair)} = 12 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of possible seating arrangements (completed: 42 arrangements).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other (completed: 12 arrangements).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of non-adjacent arrangements (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability by dividing the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total arrangements.  
Current Goal: Subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of non-adjacent arrangements.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of non-adjacent arrangements.  
How to Achieve: Use the results from previous steps (total arrangements = 42, adjacent arrangements = 12) to compute the number of arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other is:  
\[ 42 \text{ (total arrangements)} - 12 \text{ (adjacent arrangements)} = 30 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability by dividing the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total arrangements.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of non-adjacent arrangements (30) by the total number of arrangements (42) to find the probability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is:  
\[ \frac{\text{Number of non-adjacent arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{30}{42} = \frac{5}{7} \]  
The probability, expressed as a fraction, is \( \frac{5}{7} \).  
As a decimal (optional), this is approximately \( 0.7143 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the current path and calculations.  
How to Achieve: Verify the calculations for total arrangements, adjacent arrangements, non-adjacent arrangements, and the final probability to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Total arrangements**: \( P(7, 2) = 7 \times 6 = 42 \). This is correct since we are choosing 2 seats out of 7 for 2 distinct people.  
- **Adjacent arrangements**: There are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs (1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7), and for each pair, Mary and James can be arranged in \( 2! = 2 \) ways, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \). This is correct.  
- **Non-adjacent arrangements**: \( 42 - 12 = 30 \). This subtraction is correct.  
- **Probability**: \( \frac{30}{42} = \frac{5}{7} \). Simplifying 30/42 by dividing numerator and denominator by 6 confirms the fraction is correct.  
The calculations are consistent and align with the problemâ€™s requirements.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \( \frac{5}{7} \) (approximately 0.7143).
