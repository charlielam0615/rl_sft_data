### Problem Restatement
We need to find the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \). This equation resembles the general form of a circle, so we will interpret it as the equation of a circle and calculate its area.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the given equation in the standard form of a circle by completing the square.  
2. Identify the center and radius of the circle from the standard form.  
3. Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a circle, \( A = \pi r^2 \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \) in the standard form of a circle, \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \). This will allow us to identify the center and radius.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \).

Group the \( x \)-terms and \( y \)-terms:  
\[ x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 24y = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 + 10x = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25 \]

Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 + 24y = (y^2 + 24y + 144) - 144 = (y + 12)^2 - 144 \]

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 12)^2 - 144 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 - 169 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = 169 \]

This is the standard form of a circle, where the center is \( (-5, -12) \) and the radius is \( r = \sqrt{169} = 13 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the standard form \( (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = 169 \) correctly represents the original equation and that the center and radius are accurate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, expand the standard form back to check if it matches the original equation:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \]  
\[ (y + 12)^2 = y^2 + 24y + 144 \]  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 24y + 144 = 169 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y + 169 = 169 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \]

The expanded form matches the original equation, confirming correctness. The center is \( (-5, -12) \), and the radius is \( r = \sqrt{169} = 13 \), which is consistent since \( 13^2 = 169 \).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the area of the circle using the radius \( r = 13 \) and the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The radius of the circle is \( r = 13 \). The area of a circle is given by:  
\[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 13^2 = 169\pi \]

Thus, the area is \( 169\pi \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the area enclosed by the region defined by \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center and radius (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area using \( A = \pi r^2 \) (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer and ensure all subgoals have been addressed. The area has been calculated as \( 169\pi \), and all subgoals are complete.

### Final Answer
The area enclosed by the region defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \) is \( 169\pi \) square units.
