**Problem Statement**: Find the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the area into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the given equation in standard form to identify the geometric shape.  
2. Determine the type of region (e.g., circle, ellipse) and its properties (e.g., radius, center).  
3. Calculate the area using the appropriate formula for the identified shape.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \) in standard form. This will be achieved by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms to identify the shape and its properties.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \]

Group the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms:  
\[ (x^2 + 10x) + (y^2 + 24y) = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 + 10x = (x + 5)^2 - 25 \]

Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 + 24y = (y + 12)^2 - 144 \]

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 12)^2 - 144 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 - 169 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = 169 \]

This is the standard form of a circle with center \( (-5, -12) \) and radius \( \sqrt{169} = 13 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the standard form \( (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = 169 \) correctly represents the original equation and confirms the shape as a circle with radius 13. This will be achieved by expanding the standard form and checking if it matches the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( (x + 5)^2 + (y + 12)^2 = 169 \):  
\[ (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \]  
\[ (y + 12)^2 = y^2 + 24y + 144 \]

So:  
\[ x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 24y + 144 = 169 \]

Combine and simplify:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y + 169 = 169 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \]

This matches the original equation, confirming the standard form is correct. The shape is a circle with radius 13.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the area of the circle with radius 13. This will be achieved using the formula for the area of a circle, \( A = \pi r^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The radius of the circle is \( r = 13 \). The area of a circle is given by:  
\[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 13^2 = 169\pi \]

Thus, the area is \( 169\pi \) square units.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the area enclosed by the region defined by \( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 24y = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the shape and its properties (completed: circle with center \((-5, -12)\), radius 13).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area (completed: area is \( 169\pi \)).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer and ensure all steps are complete. Since the area has been calculated and validated, the main goal is achieved.  

**Final Answer**: The area enclosed by the region is \( 169\pi \) square units.
