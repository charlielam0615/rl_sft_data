**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two distinct natural numbers chosen from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 1. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  
2. Identify all pairs of numbers whose GCD is 1 (i.e., coprime pairs).  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of coprime pairs to total pairs.  
4. Express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This can be achieved by using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the size of the set and k is the number of items to choose.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} has 6 elements. We need to choose 2 distinct numbers, so we calculate C(6, 2):  
C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = (6 × 5) / (2 × 1) = 30 / 2 = 15.  
Thus, there are 15 possible pairs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all pairs of distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} whose GCD is 1. This can be achieved by listing all possible pairs and checking their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
List all pairs of distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and compute their GCD:  
- (1, 2): GCD(1, 2) = 1 (coprime)  
- (1, 3): GCD(1, 3) = 1 (coprime)  
- (1, 4): GCD(1, 4) = 1 (coprime)  
- (1, 5): GCD(1, 5) = 1 (coprime)  
- (1, 6): GCD(1, 6) = 1 (coprime)  
- (2, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1 (coprime)  
- (2, 4): GCD(2, 4) = 2  
- (2, 5): GCD(2, 5) = 1 (coprime)  
- (2, 6): GCD(2, 6) = 2  
- (3, 4): GCD(3, 4) = 1 (coprime)  
- (3, 5): GCD(3, 5) = 1 (coprime)  
- (3, 6): GCD(3, 6) = 3  
- (4, 5): GCD(4,  Radiation Therapy5) = 1 (coprime)  
- (4, 6): GCD(4, 6) = 2  
- (5, 6): GCD(5, 6) = 1 (coprime)  

Coprime pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6).  
Total coprime pairs: 11.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the coprime pairs and the total number of pairs. This can be achieved by rechecking the GCD calculations and confirming the combination formula result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute C(6, 2): (6 × 5) / (2 × 1) = 15, which matches Step 2.  
Recheck coprime pairs by confirming GCD = 1:  
- For (1, n), GCD is always 1 (5 pairs: n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
- For (2, 3), (2, 5): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(2, 5) = 1 (2 pairs).  
- For (3, 4), (3, 5): GCD(3, 4) = 1, GCD(3, 5) = 1 (2 pairs).  
- For (4, 5): GCD(4, 5) = 1 (1 pair).  
- For (5, 6): GCD(5, 6) = 1 (1 pair).  
Total: 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 coprime pairs, confirming Step 3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of coprime pairs to total pairs and express it as a common fraction. This can be achieved by dividing the number of coprime pairs by the total number of pairs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Number of coprime pairs: 11.  
Total pairs: 15.  
Probability = 11 / 15.  
The fraction 11/15 is in its simplest form (11 and 15 are coprime, as 11 is prime and 15 = 3 × 5).  
[/IMP]
