**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two different natural numbers selected from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 1. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve it systematically. First, I need to determine the total number of ways to select two different numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Next, I will identify the pairs of numbers whose GCF is 1 (i.e., they are coprime). Finally, I will calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (coprime pairs) by the total number of possible pairs.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to select two different numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n=6 and k=2, so I will compute C(6, 2).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculating the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 6:  
C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = (6 * 5 * 4!) / (2 * 1 * 4!) = (6 * 5) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.  
So, there are 15 possible pairs of different numbers.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify and count the pairs of numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} whose GCF is 1.  
How to Achieve: List all possible pairs of numbers from the set and check each pair to see if their GCF is 1 (i.e., they share no common factors other than 1). I will systematically go through each number and pair it with others, calculating the GCF for each pair.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Listing all pairs and checking their GCF:  
- Pair (1, 2): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (1, 3): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (1, 4): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (1, 5): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (1, 6): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (2, 3): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (2, 4): GCF = 2 (not coprime)  
- Pair (2, 5): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (2, 6): GCF = 2 (not coprime)  
- Pair (3, 4): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (3, 5): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (3, 6): GCF = 3 (not coprime)  
- Pair (4, 5): GCF = 1 (coprime)  
- Pair (4, 6): GCF = 2 (not coprime)  
- Pair (5, 6): GCF = 1 (coprime)  

Counting the coprime pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6).  
There are 11 pairs where the GCF is 1.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability that a randomly selected pair of numbers has a GCF of 1.  
How to Achieve: Compute the probability as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (coprime pairs) to the total number of possible outcomes (total pairs). Use the results from the previous steps: favorable pairs = 11, total pairs = 15.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Probability = Number of coprime pairs / Total number of pairs = 11 / 15.  
The fraction 11/15 is already in its simplest form since 11 is a prime number and does not divide 15 evenly.  
Therefore, the probability is 11/15.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the GCF of two different numbers selected from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 1.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of ways to select two different numbers. (Completed: Total pairs = 15)  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and count the pairs with GCF = 1. (Completed: Coprime pairs = 11)  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability as the ratio of coprime pairs to total pairs. (Completed: Probability = 11/15)  

Current Goal: Confirm the final answer and ensure all steps are consistent.

**Final Answer**: The probability that the greatest common factor of two different numbers selected from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 1 is 11/15.
