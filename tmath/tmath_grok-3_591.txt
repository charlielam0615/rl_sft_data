**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where each card must be from a different suit, and the order of selection does not matter.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Identify the suits available and how to select 3 different suits.  
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 1 card from each selected suit.  
3. Calculate the total number of ways by combining the choices.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Identify the suits available and calculate the number of ways to select 3 different suits.  
**How to Achieve**: A standard deck has 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). We need to choose 3 distinct suits, which can be done using combinations since order doesn’t matter.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The number of ways to choose 3 suits from 4 is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).  
For \( n = 4 \), \( k = 3 \):  
\( C(4, 3) = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{24}{6 \cdot 1} = 4 \).  
Thus, there are 4 ways to choose 3 different suits.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Determine the number of ways to choose 1 card from each of the 3 selected suits.  
**How to Achieve**: Each suit in a standard deck has 13 cards. For each of the 3 chosen suits, select 1 card from the 13 available in that suit.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For each suit, there are 13 choices for a card. Since we select 1 card from each of the 3 suits:  
Number of ways = \( 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 13^3 \).  
Calculate: \( 13^3 = 13 \times 169 = 2197 \).  
Thus, there are 2197 ways to choose 1 card from each of 3 suits.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from different suits.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 suits by the number of ways to choose 1 card from each suit.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From Step 2: 4 ways to choose 3 suits.  
From Step 3: 2197 ways to choose 1 card from each of 3 suits.  
Total ways = \( 4 \times 2197 \).  
Calculate: \( 2197 \times 4 = 8788 \).  
Thus, the total number of ways is 8788.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated total.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculations and logic by recomputing key steps and considering an alternative approach to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
**Recheck Calculations**:  
- Ways to choose 3 suits: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \). Correct.  
- Ways to choose cards: \( 13^3 = 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 2197 \). Correct.  
- Total: \( 4 \times 2197 = 8788 \). Correct.  

**Alternative Approach**: Consider choosing suits sequentially:  
- Choose 1st suit: 4 choices.  
- Choose 2nd suit (different): 3 choices.  
- Choose 3rd suit (different): 2 choices.  
- Total suit selections: \( 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \). Since order doesn’t matter, divide by \( 3! = 6 \): \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \). Matches Step 2.  
- For each suit, choose 1 card: \( 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 2197 \). Matches Step 3.  
- Total: \( 4 \times 2197 = 8788 \). Matches Step 4.  

The calculations and logic are consistent across both methods.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, each from a different suit, order doesn’t matter.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and select 3 different suits (completed: 4 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Choose 1 card from each selected suit (completed: 2197 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute total ways (completed: 8788).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: confirmed correct).  

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 8788 ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where each card is from a different suit, and the order does not matter.
