**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where all three cards must be of different suits, and the order of selection does not matter.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 cards, each from a different suit, without regard to order. Subgoals:  
1. Identify the structure of a standard deck and the suits available.  
2. Determine the process for selecting one card from each of three different suits.  
3. Account for the constraint that order does not matter (combinations, not permutations).  
4. Calculate the total number of valid selections.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the structure of a standard deck and the suits available. This will be achieved by recalling the composition of a standard deck and noting the number of suits and cards per suit.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), with each suit containing 13 cards (Ace through King).  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the process for selecting one card from each of three different suits. This will be achieved by choosing 3 distinct suits from the 4 available, then selecting one card from each chosen suit.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Choose 3 different suits from the 4 suits: The number of ways to choose 3 suits is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{3} \).  
- For each chosen suit, select 1 card from the 13 available in that suit.  
Thus, the process involves:  
1. Selecting 3 suits: \( \binom{4}{3} \).  
2. For each suit, selecting 1 card: \( 13 \times 13 \times 13 \).  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, with all three cards from different suits, order not mattering.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the structure of a standard deck (completed: 4 suits, 13 cards each).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the process for selecting one card from each of three different suits (completed: choose 3 suits, then 1 card per suit).  
  - Subgoal 3: Account for the constraint that order does not matter (pending: ensure calculation reflects combinations).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the total number of valid selections (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Account for the constraint that order does not matter and proceed to calculate the total number of selections.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to account for the constraint that order does not matter and calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from different suits. This will be achieved by computing the number of combinations using the process defined in Step 3.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 suits: \( \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \).  
- For each suit, choose 1 card from 13: \( 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 13^3 \).  
- Since order does not matter, the selection of one card per suit for 3 distinct suits inherently accounts for combinations (no permutations needed, as the suits are distinct and the cards within each suit are chosen independently).  
- Total number of ways: \( \binom{4}{3} \times 13^3 = 4 \times 13^3 \).  
- Compute \( 13^3 = 13 \times 13 \times 13 = 169 \times 13 = 2197 \).  
- Then, \( 4 \times 2197 = 8788 \).  

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the logic and ensuring all constraints are met. This will be achieved by reviewing the steps and confirming the mathematical accuracy.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Logic Check**: The calculation assumes 3 distinct suits are chosen (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)), and for each suit, 1 of 13 cards is selected (\( 13^3 \)). The constraint that all cards must be from different suits is satisfied by selecting one card per suit. The order of selection does not matter, and the combination formula for suits accounts for this.  
- **Math Check**:  
  - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
  - \( 13^3 = 13 \times 13 = 169 \), \( 169 \times 13 = 169 \times (10 + 3) = 1690 + 507 = 2197 \).  
  - \( 4 \times 2197 = 4 \times (2000 + 197) = 8000 + 788 = 8788 \).  
- **Constraint Check**: The calculation ensures all three cards are from different suits, and the combination formula avoids overcounting due to order.  
The calculation appears correct.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming all steps align with the problem’s requirements. Retrieve and summarize information from previous steps to ensure completeness.  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- **Summary of Relevant Information**:  
  - Step 2: A standard deck has 4 suits, each with 13 cards.  
  - Step 3: The process involves choosing 3 distinct suits (\( \binom{4}{3} \)) and 1 card per suit (\( 13^3 \)).  
  - Step 5: Calculated total ways as \( 4 \times 13^3 = 4 \times 2197 = 8788 \).  
  - Step 6: Validated the calculation, confirming the logic and math.  
- **Conclusion**: The problem’s requirements (3 cards, different suits, order does not matter) are fully addressed by the calculation \( \binom{4}{3} \times 13^3 = 8788 \).  

[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 8788 ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where all three cards are from different suits, and the order of selection does not matter.
