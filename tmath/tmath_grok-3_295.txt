**Problem Statement:**

We need to find the product of the quadratic equation $18t^2 + 36t - 500 = 0$. For a quadratic equation of the form \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \), the product of the roots is given by \( \frac{c}{a} \), where \( a \) is the coefficient of \( t^2 \), \( b \) is the coefficient of \( t \), and \( c \) is the constant term.

### Step 1:**

[PLANNING] **Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:

1. Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the quadratic equation \( 18t^2 + 36t - 500 = 0 \).

2. Apply the formula for the product of the roots, \( \frac{c}{a} \).

3. Compute the numerical value of \( \frac{c}{a} \).

### Step 2:**

[PLANNING] **Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the equation \( 18t^2 + 36t - 500 = 0 \). This will be achieved by comparing the given equation to the standard quadratic form \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \).

[IMP]

The given equation is \( 18t^2 + 36t - 500 = 0 \).

Comparing to \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \):

- Coefficient of \( t^2 \): \( a = 18 \)

- Coefficient of \( t \): \( b = 36 \)

- Constant term: \( c = -500 \)

### Step 3:**

[PLANNING] **Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the formula for the product of the roots, \( \frac{c}{a} \), using the identified coefficients \( a = 18 \) and \( c = -500 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

For a quadratic equation \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \), the product of the roots is \( \frac{c}{a} \).

Using the coefficients:

\[ \frac{c}{a} = \frac{-500}{18} \]

### Step 4:**

[PLANNING] **Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data:** The current goal is to compute the numerical value of \( \frac{-500}{18} \) and simplify it to find the product of the roots.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Calculate:

\[ \frac{-500}{18} \]

Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both 500 and 18 are divisible by 2:

\[ \frac{-500 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{-250}{9} \]

Check if \( \frac{-250}{9} \) can be simplified further. The numerator 250 (\( 2 \times 5^3 \)) and denominator 9 (\( 3^2 \)) share no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is in its simplest form.

Thus, the product of the roots is:

\[ \frac{-250}{9} \]

To express as a mixed number (optional for clarity):

\[ 250 \div 9 = 27 \text{ remainder } 7 \quad \text{(since } 9 \times 27 = 243, \text{ and } 250 - 243 = 7\text{)} \]

\[ \frac{-250}{9} = - \left( 27 + \frac{7}{9} \right) = -27 \frac{7}{9} \]

The product of the roots is \( \frac{-250}{9} \) or equivalently \( -27 \frac{7}{9} \).

### Step 5:**

[PLANNING] **Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the computed product of the roots by checking the coefficients and calculations for accuracy.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

Reconfirm the coefficients:

- Equation: \( 18t^2 + 36t - 500 = 0 \)

- \( a = 18 \), \( b = 36 \), \( c = -500 \)

Recalculate the product of the roots:

\[ \frac{c}{a} = \frac{-500}{18} = \frac{-250}{9} \]

The calculation is consistent. To further validate, consider the nature of the roots. The product \( \frac{-250}{9} \approx -27.777 \) is negative, suggesting one root is positive and one is negative, which is plausible since the quadratic has a positive \( a \) and negative \( c \).

The computation appears correct.
