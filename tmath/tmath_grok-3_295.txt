**Problem Statement**: Find the product of the roots of the quadratic equation \(18t^2 + 45t - 500 = 0\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the product of the roots. Subgoals:  
1. Identify the quadratic equation’s coefficients.  
2. Apply the formula for the product of the roots of a quadratic equation.  
3. Compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the quadratic equation’s coefficients. This will be achieved by comparing the given equation \(18t^2 + 45t - 500 = 0\) to the standard form \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\) and extracting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The equation is \(18t^2 + 45t - 500 = 0\). Comparing with \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\), we get:  
- \(a = 18\)  
- \(b = 45\)  
- \(c = -500\)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the formula for the product of the roots of a quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\), the product of the roots is given by \(\frac{c}{a}\). Use the coefficients \(a = 18\) and \(c = -500\) to compute the product.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The product of the roots is:  
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{-500}{18}
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\frac{-500}{18} = -\frac{500 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = -\frac{250}{9}
\]  
Thus, the product is \(-\frac{250}{9}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of the product of the roots. This will be achieved by confirming the coefficients and recalculating the product to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reconfirm the coefficients: \(a = 18\), \(c = -500\).  
Recalculate the product:  
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{-500}{18} = -\frac{250}{9}
\]  
The calculation is consistent, confirming the product is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
