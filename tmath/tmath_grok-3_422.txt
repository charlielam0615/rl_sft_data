We need to find the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) that lies below the line \( y = x - 3 \). This involves determining the region defined by the given equation, identifying the portion below the line \( y = x - 3 \), and computing its area.

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Simplify the given equation to understand the curve it represents.  
2. Determine the intersection points between the curve and the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
3. Identify the region enclosed by the curve that lies below the line.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation to identify the type of curve.  
**How to Achieve**: Rearrange the equation \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) into a standard form to recognize the conic section it represents.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \]

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 - 21 - 11y + y^2 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 8y + 49 = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 - 14x = (x - 7)^2 - 49 \]

Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 - 8y = (y - 4)^2 - 16 \]

Substitute back:  
\[ (x - 7)^2 - 49 + (y - 4)^2 - 16 + 49 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 - 16 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]

This is the equation of a circle with center \( (7, 4) \) and radius \( 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the intersection points of the circle \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \) with the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = x - 3 \) into the circle’s equation and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = x - 3 \) into \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \):  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (x - 3 - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (x - 7)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ 2(x - 7)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 = 8 \]  
\[ x - 7 = \pm \sqrt{8} = \pm 2\sqrt{2} \]  
\[ x = 7 \pm 2\sqrt{2} \]

Find corresponding \( y \)-values:  
For \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \):  
\[ y = (7 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} \]

For \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \):  
\[ y = (7 - 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 - 2\sqrt{2} \]

Intersection points are \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \) and \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the region below \( y = x - 3 \) is meaningful for the circle.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the position of the circle’s center relative to the line and confirm the intersection points define a chord.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The line \( y = x - 3 \) has points where \( y = x - 3 \). Test the center \( (7, 4) \):  
\[ y = 7 - 3 = 4 \]  
The center lies on the line \( y = x - 3 \), indicating the line is a chord passing through the center (a diameter if it spans the circle, but we need the region below).

The intersection points \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \) and \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \) suggest a chord. Since the center is on the line, the chord is a diameter, splitting the circle into two semicircles. We need the area below \( y = x - 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The line \( y = x - 3 \) is a diameter of the circle, so the region below it is the lower semicircle. Adjust the subgoal to focus on computing the area of the semicircle below \( y = x - 3 \). New subgoals:  
1. Determine the orientation of the semicircle relative to \( y = x - 3 \).  
2. Set up the integral for the area of the lower semicircle.  
3. Compute the area.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the orientation of the semicircle below \( y = x - 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Parameterize the circle and identify points below the line by testing points or using the geometry of the diameter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( y = x - 3 \) passes through the center \( (7, 4) \), it’s a diameter. Parameterize the circle:  
\[ x = 7 + 4 \cos \theta, \quad y = 4 + 4 \sin \theta, \quad \theta \in [0, 2\pi] \]

Substitute into the line equation to find the chord’s endpoints:  
\[ y = x - 3 \]  
\[ 4 + 4 \sin \theta = (7 + 4 \cos \theta) - 3 \]  
\[ 4 \sin \theta = 4 + 4 \cos \theta \]  
\[ \sin \theta = 1 + \cos \theta \]  
\[ \sin \theta - \cos \theta = 1 \]

Solve using \( \sin \theta - \cos \theta = \sqrt{2} \sin (\theta - \pi/4) \):  
\[ \sqrt{2} \sin (\theta - \pi/4) = 1 \]  
\[ \sin (\theta - \pi/4) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sin (\pi/4) \]  
\[ \theta - \pi/4 = \pi/4 + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad \theta - \pi/4 = \pi - \pi/4 + 2k\pi \]  
\[ \theta = \pi/2 + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = 3\pi/4 + 2k\pi \]

For \( k = 0 \):  
\[ \theta = \pi/2 \]: \( x = 7, y = 4 + 4 = 8 \), point \( (7, 8) \).  
\[ \theta = 3\pi/4 \]: \( x = 7 + 4 \cos (3\pi/4) = 7 - 4/\sqrt{2} = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \), \( y = 4 + 4 \sin (3\pi/4) = 4 + 4/\sqrt{2} = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} \), point \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \).

Test points to determine the “below” region:  
Take \( \theta = \pi \): \( x = 7, y = 4 + 4 \sin \pi = 4 \). Check: \( y = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \), lies on the line.  
Take \( \theta = 3\pi/2 \): \( x = 7, y = 4 + 4 \sin (3\pi/2) = 4 - 4 = 0 \). Check: \( 0 < 7 - 3 = 4 \), so \( (7, 0) \) is below the line.

The arc from \( \theta = \pi/2 \) to \( \theta = 3\pi/2 \) (via \( \theta = \pi \)) includes points below the line, corresponding to the lower semicircle.

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute the area of the region enclosed by the circle \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \) below the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (completed: circle with center \( (7, 4) \), radius 4).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find intersection points (completed: \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \), \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the region below the line (completed: lower semicircle, \( \theta \) from \( \pi/2 \) to \( 3\pi/2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the area of the lower semicircle (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the area of the lower semicircle.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the area of the lower semicircle below \( y = x - 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the line is a diameter, the area below is half the circle’s area. Alternatively, set up an integral in the \( x \)-direction over the lower half of the circle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The circle’s total area is:  
\[ \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi \]

Since \( y = x - 3 \) is a diameter, the area below is half the circle’s area:  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{16\pi}{2} = 8\pi \]

To confirm, use integration. Solve for \( y \) in the circle’s equation:  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ (y - 4)^2 = 16 - (x - 7)^2 \]  
\[ y - 4 = \pm \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  
\[ y = 4 \pm \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]

The lower half is \( y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \). The line \( y = x - 3 \) at intersection points:  
\[ x = 7 \pm 2\sqrt{2} \]

Integrate from \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \) to \( 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \), where \( y_{\text{circle}} \leq y_{\text{line}} \). Check:  
At \( x = 7 \), \( y_{\text{line}} = 7 - 3 = 4 \), \( y_{\text{lower circle}} = 4 - \sqrt{16 - 0} = 4 \). The lower circle is below or equal to the line.

Area = \( \int_{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}^{7 + 2\sqrt{2}} (y_{\text{line}} - y_{\text{lower circle}}) \, dx \):  
\[ y_{\text{line}} = x - 3 \]  
\[ y_{\text{lower circle}} = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  
\[ \text{Area} = \int_{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}^{7 + 2\sqrt{2}} \left( (x - 3) - \left( 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \right) \right) dx \]  
\[ = \int_{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}^{7 + 2\sqrt{2}} \left( x - 7 + \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \right) dx \]

Substitute \( u = x - 7 \), \( du = dx \), limits \( u = -2\sqrt{2} \) to \( 2\sqrt{2} \):  
\[ \int_{-2\sqrt{ pluralsight.com2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} \left( u + \sqrt{16 - u^2} \right) du = \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} u \, du + \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{16 - u^2} \, du \]

First integral:  
\[ \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} u \, du = \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} - \frac{(-2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} - \frac{8}{2} = 0 \]

Second integral (area under semicircle \( y = \sqrt{16 - u^2} \)):  
\[ \int_{-4}^{4} \sqrt{16 - u^2} \, du \]  
This is the area of a semicircle of radius 4:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 4^2 = 8\pi \]

Total area:  
\[ 0 + 8\pi = 8\pi \]

Both methods confirm the area is \( 8\pi \).

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the computed area.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the geometric interpretation and ensure the region matches the problem’s requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The line \( y = x - 3 \) is a diameter, so the lower semicircle’s area is half the circle’s area, \( 8\pi \). The integration method agrees. To ensure correctness, test a point below the line, e.g., \( (7, 0) \):  
- Circle: \( (7 - 7)^2 + (0 - 4)^2 = 16 \), satisfied.  
- Line: \( y = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \), so \( y = 0 < 4 \), confirming it’s below.

The region is the lower semicircle, and the area \( 8\pi \) is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The area of the region enclosed by the circle \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) below the line \( y = x - 3 \) is \( 8\pi \).  

\[ \boxed{8\pi} \]
