**Problem Restatement**: Find the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) that lies below the line \( y = x - 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the area of the region, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation to express it in a standard form (e.g., a conic section).  
2. Identify the type of conic section and its properties (e.g., vertices, foci, or axes).  
3. Determine the points of intersection between the conic section and the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
4. Define the region below the line \( y = x - 3 \) and within the conic section.  
5. Set up and compute the integral to find the area of the specified region.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the given equation to identify the conic section.  
How to Achieve: Rearrange all terms of the equation \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) to one side, combine like terms, and express it in a recognizable form for a conic section.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \]  

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 - (21 + 11y - y^2) = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 - 21 - 11y + y^2 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 14x + 3y - 11y + 70 - 21 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 14x - 8y + 49 = 0 \]  

Complete the square for \( x \) and \( y \):  
For \( x \): \( x^2 - 14x = (x - 7)^2 - 49 \).  
For \( y \): \( -8y = -8\left(y + 4\right) = -8\left(y + \frac{8}{2}\right) = -(y + 4)^2 + 16 \), but let’s correct by grouping:  
Rewrite:  
\[ (x^2 - 14x) + y^2 - 8y = -49 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 - 49 + (y - 4)^2 - 16 = -49 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 - 49 - 16 + 49 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \]  

This is the equation of a circle with center \( (7, 4) \) and radius \( r = \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the intersection points of the circle and the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( y = x - 3 \) into the circle’s equation \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \), solve for \( x \), and find corresponding \( y \)-values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Circle equation: \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \).  
Line equation: \( y = x - 3 \).  

Substitute \( y = x - 3 \) into the circle equation:  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + ((x - 3) - 4)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 + (x - 7)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ 2 (x - 7)^2 = 16 \]  
\[ (x - 7)^2 = 8 \]  
\[ x - 7 = \pm \sqrt{8} = \pm 2\sqrt{2} \]  
\[ x = 7 \pm 2\sqrt{2} \]  

Find corresponding \( y \)-values:  
For \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \):  
\[ y = (7 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} \]  
For \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \):  
\[ y = (7 - 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 - 2\sqrt{2} \]  

Intersection points: \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \) and \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the area of the region enclosed by the circle that lies below the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (Completed: Identified as a circle \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \)).

  - Subgoal 3: Find intersection points (Completed: Points \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \), \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \)).

  - Subgoal 5: Compute the area via integration (Pending).  

Current Goal: Define the region below the line \( y = x - 3 \) within the circle.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the region below the line \( y = x - 3 \) within the circle.  
How to Achieve: Determine the portion of the circle where \( y \leq x - 3 \), and express the boundary curves for integration (e.g., circle’s equation solved for \( y \), and the line \( y = x - 3 \)).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The circle’s equation is \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \). Solve for \( y \):  
\[ (y - 4)^2 = 16 - (x - 7)^2 \]  
\[ y - 4 = \pm \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  
\[ y = 4 \pm \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  

- Upper semicircle: \( y = 4 + \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \).  
- Lower semicircle: \( y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \).  

The line is \( y = x - 3 \). The region below the line satisfies \( y \leq x - 3 \).  

To define the region, find where the circle lies below the line. Check the intersection points to determine the \( x \)-bounds:  
- At \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \approx 4.172 \), \( y = 4 - 2\sqrt{2} \approx 1.172 \).  
- At \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 9.828 \), \( y = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 6.828 \).  

The circle exists for \( x \in [3, 11] \) (since \( x = 7 \pm 4 \)). Test points to confirm the region:  
- Center \( (7, 4) \): On the line, \( y = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \). The center lies on the line.  
- Check a point, e.g., \( x = 7 \), \( y = 0 \) (lower semicircle): \( 0 < 7 - 3 = 4 \), so below the line.  

The region below \( y = x - 3 \) is bounded by the lower semicircle \( y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \) from \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \) to \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \), up to the line \( y = x - 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the area of the region using integration.  
How to Achieve: Set up the integral for the area between the line \( y = x - 3 \) and the lower semicircle \( y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \) from \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \) to \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Area is given by:  
\[ \text{Area} = \int_{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}^{7 + 2\sqrt{2}} \left[ (x - 3) - \left(4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2}\right) \right] dx \]  

Simplify the integrand:  
\[ (x - 3) - \left(4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2}\right) = x - 3 - 4 + \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} = x - 7 + \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  

Let \( u = x - 7 \), so \( du = dx \), and adjust limits:  
- When \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \), \( u = -2\sqrt{2} \).  
- When \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \), \( u = 2\sqrt{2} \).  

The integral becomes:  
\[ \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} \left( u + \sqrt{16 - u^2} \right) du = \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} u \, du + \int_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{16 - u^2} \, du \]  

- First integral:  
\[ \int u \, du = \frac{u^2}{2} \Big|_{-2\sqrt{2}}^{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} - \frac{(-2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} - \frac{8}{2} = 0 \]  

- Second integral (area under semicircle \( y = \sqrt{16 - u^2} \)):  
Recognize \( \sqrt{16 - u^2} \) as the upper half of the circle \( u^2 + y^2 = 16 \). For \( u \in [-4, 4] \), the integral over \( [-2\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2}] \) requires computation. Use substitution:  
Let \( u = 4 \sin \theta \), \( du = 4 \cos \theta \, d\theta \), \( \sqrt{16 - u^2} = \sqrt{16 - 16 \sin^2 \theta} = 4 \cos \theta \).  
Limits:  
- \( u = -2\sqrt{2} \): \( 4 \sin \theta = -2\sqrt{2} \), \( \sin \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{4} \).  
- \( u = 2\sqrt{2} \): \( 4 \sin \theta = 2\sqrt{2} \), \( \sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \).  

\[ \int \sqrt{16 - u^2} \, du = \int (4 \cos \theta) (4 \cos \theta) d\theta = 16 \int \cos^2 \theta \, d\theta \]  
\[ \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \], so:  
\[ 16 \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4} \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} d\theta = 8 \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4} (1 + \cos 2\theta) d\theta = 8 \left[ \theta + \frac{\sin 2\theta}{2} \right]_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4} \]  
\[ = 8 \left[ \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\sin (\pi/2)}{2} \right) - \left( -\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\sin (-\pi/2)}{2} \right) \right] = 8 \left[ \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \right) - \left( -\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right] \]  
\[ = 8 \left[ \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \right] = 8 \left[ \frac{\pi}{2} + 1 \right] = 4\pi + 8 \]  

Total area:  
\[ 0 + (4\pi + 8) = 4\pi + 8 \]  

Verify: The integral represents the area between the line and the lower semicircle. Alternatively, compute the area geometrically by considering the circle’s sector and triangle formed by the intersection points, but the integral is direct.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the computed area.  
How to Achieve: Check the integral setup, confirm intersection points, and consider an alternative method (e.g., geometric area calculation) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Intersection Points**: Recheck:  
  Substitute \( y = x - 3 \) into \( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \):  
  \[ (x - 7)^2 + (x - 7)^2 = 16 \], consistent with Step 3. Points \( (7 \pm 2\sqrt{2}, 4 \pm 2\sqrt{2}) \) are correct.  

- **Integral Setup**:  
  The integrand \( x - 7 + \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \) represents the vertical distance from \( y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \) to \( y = x - 3 \). The limits \( x = 7 - 2\sqrt{2} \) to \( x = 7 + 2\sqrt{2} \) cover the intersection points.  

- **Alternative Geometric Approach**:  
  The line \( y = x - 3 \) passes through the center \( (7, 4) \). The intersection points form a chord. The region below the line is half the circle (since the line bisects the circle).  
  Circle’s area: \( \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi \).  
  Area below the line (lower half): \( \frac{16\pi}{2} = 8\pi \).  
  However, the integral gave \( 4\pi + 8 \), suggesting the region is not simply half the circle.  

  Recompute the chord’s sector:  
  Angle between intersection points: Vectors from center \( (7, 4) \):  
  - Point \( (7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \): Vector \( (2\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2}) \).  
  - Point \( (7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2}) \): Vector \( (-2\sqrt{2}, -2\sqrt{2}) \).  
  Cosine of angle:  
  \[ \cos \theta = \frac{(2\sqrt{2})(-2\sqrt{2}) + (2\sqrt{2})(-2\sqrt{2})}{4 \cdot 4} = \frac{-8 - 8}{16} = -1 \]  
  Angle is \( \theta = \pi \), confirming points are diametrically opposite.  

  Area of semicircle below the chord requires adjusting the integral result. The integral \( 4\pi + 8 \) may include additional area. Reconsider the region:  
  The line \( y = x - 3 \) bisects the circle. The lower semicircle integral should yield half the circle’s area:  
  \[ \text{Half circle area} = \frac{16\pi}{2} = 8\pi \]  

  The discrepancy suggests an error in the integrand. Correct the integral:  
  Area should be:  
  \[ \int_{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}^{7 + 2\sqrt{2}} \left[ (x - 3) - \left(4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2}\right) \right] dx \]  
  But the correct region is below the line, so recompute:  
  Use the lower semicircle directly:  
  \[ y = 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \]  
  Area below \( y = x - 3 \):  
  \[ \int_{3}^{11} \left( 4 - \sqrt{16 - (x - 7)^2} \right) dx \text{ where } y_{\text{circle}} \leq x - 3 \]  

  Since the line bisects, compute half the circle area directly:  
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{16\pi}{2} = 8\pi \]  

The validated area, considering the geometric insight, is \( 8\pi \).

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{8\pi} \]
