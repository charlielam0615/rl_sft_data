Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $9x + 16 = -2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$$
9x + 16 = -2 \\
9x = -2 - 16 \\
9x = -18 \\
x = -2
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $2x - 14 = -2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$$
2x - 14 = -2 \\
2x = -2 + 14 \\
2x = 12 \\
x = 6
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check domain validity of solutions and correctness of algebraic manipulations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Solution x = -2 from 9x + 16 = -2:
   - Domain condition: x < 2
   - Check: -2 < 2 ✔️
   - Algebra verification:
     9(-2) + 16 = -18 + 16 = -2 ✔️

2. Solution x = 6 from 2x - 14 = -2:
   - Domain condition: x ≥ 2
   - Check: 6 ≥ 2 ✔️
   - Algebra verification:
     2(6) - 14 = 12 - 14 = -2 ✔️

3. Sum calculation:
   -2 + 6 = 4 ✔️

All domain conditions are satisfied, algebra is correct, and summation is accurate.
\boxed{correct}
[/VERIFY]
[ANSWER]
The sum of all possible values of x is $\boxed{4}$.
