**Problem Statement**: We need to find the degree of the polynomial \( g(x) \), given that \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \), the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6, and the degree of \( f(x) \) is 2.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the degree of \( g(x) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between the degrees of \( h(x) \), \( f(x) \), and \( g(x) \).  
2. Use the given degrees of \( h(x) \) (6) and \( f(x) \) (2) to set up an equation for the degree of \( f(g(x)) + g(x) \).  
3. Solve for the degree of \( g(x) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the degree of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \). Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 2 and \( h(x) \) has degree 6, we need to express the degree of the composite function \( f(g(x)) \) and the sum \( f(g(x)) + g(x) \). This involves applying polynomial degree rules and solving for the degree of \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the degree of \( g(x) \) be \( n \). Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 2, the degree of the composite polynomial \( f(g(x)) \) is the degree of \( f(x) \) times the degree of \( g(x) \), i.e., \( 2n \). The polynomial \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \) has degree 6, so we need to find the degree of the sum \( f(g(x)) + g(x) \).  

For two polynomials \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) of degrees \( m \) and \( n \), the degree of their sum \( p(x) + q(x) \) is typically the maximum of \( m \) and \( n \), unless the leading terms cancel, in which case it could be lower. Here, \( f(g(x)) \) has degree \( 2n \), and \( g(x) \) has degree \( n \). Since \( 2n > n \) for \( n \geq 1 \), the degree of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \) is generally determined by the degree of \( f(g(x)) \), which is \( 2n \), assuming no cancellation of leading terms.  

Given that the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6, we set up the equation:  
\[ 2n = 6 \]  
Solving:  
\[ n = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]  
Thus, the degree of \( g(x) \) is likely 3, assuming the leading term of \( f(g(x)) \) does not cancel with the leading term of \( g(x) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the degree of \( g(x) \) being 3 satisfies the condition that \( h(x) \) has degree 6, and check if leading term cancellation could affect the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, consider the degrees and leading terms. Let \( f(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \) (degree 2, with leading coefficient \( a_2 \neq 0 \)) and \( g(x) = b_n x^n + \text{lower terms} \) (degree \( n \), with leading coefficient \( b_n \neq 0 \)). Then:  
- \( f(g(x)) = a_2 (g(x))^2 + a_1 g(x) + a_0 \).  
- The leading term of \( g(x) \) is \( b_n x^n \), so \( (g(x))^2 \) has leading term \( b_n^2 x^{2n} \), and \( f(g(x)) = a_2 (g(x))^2 + \text{lower terms} \) has leading term \( a_2 b_n^2 x^{2n} \), giving degree \( 2n \).  
- \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \) has leading term \( a_2 b_n^2 x^{2n} + b_n x^n \). Since \( 2n > n \), the degree of \( h(x) \) is \( 2n \), unless the coefficient \( a_2 b_n^2 = 0 \), but \( a_2 \neq 0 \) and \( b_n \neq 0 \), so no cancellation occurs.  

If \( n = 3 \):  
- Degree of \( f(g(x)) \) is \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \).  
- Degree of \( g(x) \) is 3.  
- Degree of \( h(x) \) is \( \max(6, 3) = 6 \), which matches the given degree of \( h(x) \).  

Now, check for cancellation. The leading term of \( f(g(x)) \) is \( a_2 b_n^2 x^{2n} \), and the leading term of \( g(x) \) is \( b_n x^n \). These have different degrees (\( 2n \neq n \)), so they cannot cancel. Thus, the degree of \( h(x) \) is indeed \( 2n \). Setting \( 2n = 6 \), we confirm \( n = 3 \).  

Could \( n \neq 3 \)? If \( n = 2 \), degree of \( f(g(x)) = 4 \), and \( h(x) \) has degree at most 4, which is less than 6. If \( n = 4 \), degree of \( f(g(x)) = 8 \), and \( h(x) \) has degree at most 8, which exceeds 6. Thus, \( n = 3 \) is consistent, and cancellation would require specific coefficients to reduce the degree, which is not typical without additional constraints.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the degree of \( g(x) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the degree relationship for \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the degree equation using \( \deg(h(x)) = 6 \) and \( \deg(f(x)) = 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking for leading term cancellation.  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the degree of \( g(x) \) is 3 and finalize the solution.  

The degree of \( g(x) \) was calculated as 3, and validation confirmed that the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6 when \( \deg(g(x)) = 3 \), with no leading term cancellation under general conditions.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the degree of \( g(x) \) based on the previous calculations and validation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The degree of \( g(x) \) is 3, as it satisfies \( \deg(h(x)) = 2 \cdot \deg(g(x)) = 6 \), and validation shows no leading term cancellation under standard polynomial assumptions.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The degree of \( g(x) \) is 3.
