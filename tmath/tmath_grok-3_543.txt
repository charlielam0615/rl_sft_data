### Problem Statement
We need to find the degree of the polynomial \( g(x) \), given that \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \), the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6, and the degree of \( f(x) \) is 2.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to determine the degree of \( g(x) \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between the degrees of \( h(x) \), \( f(x) \), and \( g(x) \).  
2. Express the degree of \( h(x) \) in terms of the degrees of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).  
3. Solve for the degree of \( g(x) \) using the given degrees of \( h(x) \) and \( f(x) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the degree of \( h(x) \) based on the degrees of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Since \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \), we need to determine the degree of the composite polynomial \( f(g(x)) \) and how it combines with \( g(x) \). We will use the fact that the degree of a polynomial sum is the maximum degree of the terms, provided the leading terms do not cancel.

[IMP]
Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 2, let’s denote it as \( f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \), where \( a \neq 0 \). Let the degree of \( g(x) \) be \( n \), so \( g(x) \) is a polynomial of degree \( n \). The composition \( f(g(x)) \) involves substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \), so:  
- The leading term of \( f(g(x)) \) comes from \( a (g(x))^2 \), since the degree of \( f(x) \) is 2.  
- If the leading term of \( g(x) \) is \( k x^n \) (where \( k \neq 0 \)), then \( (g(x))^2 \approx (k x^n)^2 = k^2 x^{2n} \).  
- Thus, \( f(g(x)) \approx a (k^2 x^{2n}) = a k^2 x^{2n} \), so the degree of \( f(g(x)) \) is \( 2n \).  

Now, \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \). The degree of \( h(x) \) is determined by the term with the highest degree:  
- Degree of \( f(g(x)) \) is \( 2n \).  
- Degree of \( g(x) \) is \( n \).  
- If \( 2n > n \) (i.e., \( n > 0 \)), the degree of \( h(x) \) is \( 2n \), assuming no cancellation of leading terms.  
- If the leading terms cancel, we need to consider lower-degree terms, but we’ll assume no cancellation for now (standard for generic polynomials).  

Given that the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6, we set up the equation:  
\[ 2n = 6 \]  
\[ n = 3 \]  
So, the degree of \( g(x) \) is likely 3.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the degree of \( g(x) \) being 3 satisfies the condition that the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6. We will check if the degree calculation holds and consider the possibility of leading-term cancellation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Assume \( \deg(g(x)) = 3 \), so \( g(x) = k x^3 + \text{lower terms} \). Then:  
- \( f(g(x)) \) has degree \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), since \( \deg(f(x)) = 2 \).  
- \( g(x) \) has degree 3.  
- For \( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \), the degree is \( \max(6, 3) = 6 \), unless the leading terms cancel.  

To check for cancellation:  
- Let \( f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \), and \( g(x) = k x^3 + m x^2 + p x + q \).  
- The leading term of \( f(g(x)) \) is \( a (k x^3)^2 = a k^2 x^6 \).  
- The leading term of \( g(x) \) is \( k x^3 \).  
- Thus, \( h(x) \approx a k^2 x^6 + k x^3 + \text{lower terms} \).  
- The degree of \( h(x) \) is 6 unless \( a k^2 = 0 \), which is not possible since \( a \neq 0 \) (as \( \deg(f) = 2 \)) and \( k \neq 0 \) (as \( \deg(g) = 3 \)).  

Thus, no cancellation occurs, and \( \deg(h(x)) = 6 \), which matches the given condition.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the degree of \( g(x) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the relationship between degrees of \( h(x) \), \( f(x) \), and \( g(x) \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the degree of \( h(x) \) in terms of degrees of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) (completed, \( \deg(h) = 2 \cdot \deg(g) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( \deg(g) \) (computed as 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (confirmed degree 3 works).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing all steps.  
The degree of \( g(x) \) is 3, as it satisfies \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), and validation shows no leading-term cancellation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the degree of \( g(x) \) by recalling information about degree calculations and assumptions made. Retrieve details from previous steps to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Relevant information:  
- From Step 2: \( \deg(f(g(x))) = 2 \cdot \deg(g) \), and since \( \deg(h) = 6 \), we derived \( \deg(g) = 3 \).  
- From Step 3: Validation confirmed that with \( \deg(g) = 3 \), \( \deg(f(g(x))) = 6 \), and no leading-term cancellation occurs for generic polynomials.  
- Assumption: The leading terms of \( f(g(x)) \) and \( g(x) \) do not cancel, which holds since \( f \) and \( g \) are arbitrary polynomials with non-zero leading coefficients.  

This confirms \( \deg(g(x)) = 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The degree of \( g(x) \) is 3.  
\[ \boxed{3} \]
