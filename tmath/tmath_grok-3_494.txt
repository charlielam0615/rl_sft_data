**Problem Statement**: We need to find the distance between the x-intercepts of two lines: one with a slope of 3 and the other with a slope of 5, both intersecting at the point (10, 15).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution:  
1. Find the equations of the two lines using their slopes and the given intersection point (10, 15).  
2. Determine the x-intercepts of both lines by setting y = 0 in their equations.  
3. Calculate the distance between the x-intercepts.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the equations of the two lines. Use the point-slope form of a line, y - y₁ = m(x - x₁), with the given point (10, 15) and slopes 3 and 5, respectively.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the line with slope 3:  
Using point-slope form: y - 15 = 3(x - 10)  
y - 15 = 3x - 30  
y = 3x - 15  

For the line with slope 5:  
Using point-slope form: y - 15 = 5(x - 10)  
y - 15 = 5x - 50  
y = 5x - 35  

The equations are:  
- Line 1: y = 3x - 15  
- Line 2: y = 5x - 35  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-intercepts of both lines. Set y = 0 in each equation and solve for x.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For Line 1 (y = 3x - 15):  
0 = 3x - 15  
3x = 15  
x = 5  
x-intercept: (5, 0)  

For Line 2 (y = 5x - 35):  
0 = 5x - 35  
5x = 35  
x = 7  
x-intercept: (7, 0)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the distance between the x-intercepts (5, 0) and (7, 0). Since both points lie on the x-axis, the distance is the absolute difference between their x-coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distance = |7 - 5| = 2  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the distance between the x-intercepts of the two lines.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the equations of the two lines (completed: y = 3x - 15 and y = 5x - 35).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the x-intercepts of both lines (completed: (5, 0) and (7, 0)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the distance between the x-intercepts (completed: distance = 2).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by reviewing the steps.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations. Recheck the line equations, x-intercepts, and distance calculation to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Verify line equations**:  
Line 1: At (10, 15), y = 3(10) - 15 = 30 - 15 = 15 (correct).  
Line 2: At (10, 15), y = 5(10) - 35 = 50 - 35 = 15 (correct).  

**Verify x-intercepts**:  
Line 1: 0 = 3x - 15 → x = 5 (correct).  
Line 2: 0 = 5x - 35 → x = 7 (correct).  

**Verify distance**:  
Distance = |7 - 5| = 2 (correct).  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The distance between the x-intercepts of the two lines is 2.
