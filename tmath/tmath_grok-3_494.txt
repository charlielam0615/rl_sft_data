[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the equation of the line with slope 3 passing through (10, 15).  
2. Find the equation of the line with slope 5 passing through (10, 15).  
3. Determine the x-intercept of each line.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find the equation of the line with slope 3 passing through (10, 15).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the point-slope form of a line equation, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( m = 3 \) and the point is (10, 15), then convert to slope-intercept form to identify the x-intercept later.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the point-slope form:  
\( y - 15 = 3(x - 10) \)  
\( y - 15 = 3x - 30 \)  
\( y = 3x - 15 \)  
The equation of the line with slope 3 is \( y = 3x - 15 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find the equation of the line with slope 5 passing through (10, 15).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the point-slope form with \( m = 5 \) and the point (10, 15), then convert to slope-intercept form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the point-slope form:  
\( y - 15 = 5(x - 10) \)  
\( y - 15 = 5x - 50 \)  
\( y = 5x - 35 \)  
The equation of the line with slope 5 is \( y = 5x - 35 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the x-intercept of each line.  
- **How to Achieve**: Set \( y = 0 \) in each lineâ€™s equation and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the line \( y = 3x - 15 \):  
\( 0 = 3x - 15 \)  
\( 3x = 15 \)  
\( x = 5 \)  
The x-intercept of the first line is (5, 0).  

For the line \( y = 5x - 35 \):  
\( 0 = 5x - 35 \)  
\( 5x = 35 \)  
\( x = 7 \)  
The x-intercept of the second line is (7, 0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the x-intercepts by checking if both lines pass through (10, 15).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 10 \) into both line equations and confirm \( y = 15 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( y = 3x - 15 \):  
\( y = 3(10) - 15 = 30 - 15 = 15 \)  
This satisfies the point (10, 15).  

For \( y = 5x - 35 \):  
\( y = 5(10) - 35 = 50 - 35 = 15 \)  
This also satisfies the point (10, 15).  

The equations are correct, and the x-intercepts are consistent with the given point.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the distance between the x-intercepts (5, 0) and (7, 0).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since both points lie on the x-axis, compute the absolute difference between their x-coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The x-intercepts are at \( x = 5 \) and \( x = 7 \).  
Distance = \( |7 - 5| = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the distance between the x-intercepts of two lines with slopes 3 and 5 passing through (10, 15).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the equation of the line with slope 3 (completed: \( y = 3x - 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the equation of the line with slope 5 (completed: \( y = 5x - 35 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the x-intercept of each line (completed: (5, 0) and (7, 0)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the distance between the x-intercepts (completed: 2).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as the distance has been calculated.
