**Problem Restatement**: Theresa buys one copy of each of the ten volumes of Theodore Sturgeon's collected works, available in paperback for $15 or hardcover for $25. Her total expenditure is $220. We need to determine how many hardcover volumes she bought.

### Step 1

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the number of hardcover and paperback volumes.  
2. Set up equations based on the total number of volumes and the total cost.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the number of hardcover volumes.  
4. Verify the solution ensures the total cost matches $220 and all volumes are accounted for.

### Step 2

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations for the number of hardcover and paperback volumes.  
How to Achieve: Let \( h \) be the number of hardcover volumes and \( p \) be the number of paperback volumes. Since Theresa buys one copy of each of the ten volumes, we have \( h + p = 10 \). The cost of hardcover volumes is $25 each, and paperback volumes cost $15 each, with a total cost of $220, so \( 25h + 15p = 220 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define:  
- \( h \): number of hardcover volumes.  
- \( p \): number of paperback volumes.  

Equations:  
1. \( h + p = 10 \) (total volumes).  
2. \( 25h + 15p = 220 \) (total cost).  

[/IMP]

### Step 3

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the number of hardcover volumes.  
How to Achieve: Use the equations \( h + p = 10 \) and \( 25h + 15p = 220 \). Solve the first equation for \( p \), substitute into the second, and solve for \( h \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( h + p = 10 \), we get \( p = 10 - h \).  
Substitute into \( 25h + 15p = 220 \):  
\[ 25h + 15(10 - h) = 220 \]  
\[ 25h + 150 - 15h = 220 \]  
\[ 10h + 150 = 220 \]  
\[ 10h = 70 \]  
\[ h = 7 \]  

Then, \( p = 10 - h = 10 - 7 = 3 \).  
So, \( h = 7 \) hardcover volumes and \( p = 3 \) paperback volumes.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the total cost and number of volumes match the problem constraints.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the total cost with 7 hardcover volumes and 3 paperback volumes and confirm it equals $220. Also, verify the total number of volumes is 10.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check total volumes:  
\[ h + p = 7 + 3 = 10 \]  
This satisfies the requirement of 10 volumes.  

Check total cost:  
\[ 25h + 15p = 25 \cdot 7 + 15 \cdot 3 = 175 + 45 = 220 \]  
This matches the total cost of $220.  

The solution is valid: 7 hardcover volumes and 3 paperback volumes satisfy both constraints.

### Step 5

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many hardcover volumes Theresa bought.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for hardcover and paperback volumes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations for total volumes and cost (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).  

Current Goal: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  

The solution is 7 hardcover volumes.

**Final Answer**: Theresa bought 7 hardcover volumes.
