### Problem Restatement
Theresa buys a copy of each of the ten volumes of Theodore Sturgeon's collected works. Each volume is available in paperback for $15 or in hardcover for $25. The total cost of her purchase is $220. We need to determine how many hardcover volumes she bought.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the number of hardcover and paperback volumes.  
2. Set up equations based on the total number of volumes and the total cost.  
3. Solve the equations to find the number of hardcover volumes.  
4. Validate the solution to ensure it meets the problem constraints.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations to represent the total number of volumes and the total cost. This will be achieved by assigning variables for the number of hardcover and paperback volumes, using the fact that there are 10 volumes in total and the total cost is $220.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( h \) represent the number of hardcover volumes, and \( p \) represent the number of paperback volumes. Since Theresa buys one copy of each of the 10 volumes, we have:  
\[ h + p = 10 \]  

Each hardcover volume costs $25, and each paperback volume costs $15. The total cost is $220, so:  
\[ 25h + 15p = 220 \]  

These two equations represent the problem constraints.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the number of hardcover volumes (\( h \)). This will be achieved by substituting one equation into the other and solving for \( h \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the first equation, \( h + p = 10 \), solve for \( p \):  
\[ p = 10 - h \]  

Substitute \( p = 10 - h \) into the second equation, \( 25h + 15p = 220 \):  
\[ 25h + 15(10 - h) = 220 \]  
\[ 25h + 150 - 15h = 220 \]  
\[ 10h + 150 = 220 \]  
\[ 10h = 70 \]  
\[ h = 7 \]  

So, Theresa bought 7 hardcover volumes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if 7 hardcover volumes and the corresponding number of paperback volumes satisfy the total cost and total volume constraints. This will be achieved by substituting \( h = 7 \) back into the equations and verifying the results.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
If \( h = 7 \), then:  
\[ p = 10 - h = 10 - 7 = 3 \]  

Check the total cost:  
\[ 25h + 15p = 25 \cdot 7 + 15 \cdot 3 = 175 + 45 = 220 \]  

The total cost matches the given amount of $220.  
Check the total number of volumes:  
\[ h + p = 7 + 3 = 10 \]  

The total number of volumes is 10, which satisfies the problem's conditions. The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of hardcover volumes Theresa bought.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for hardcover and paperback volumes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations for total volumes and total cost (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equations to find the number of hardcover volumes (completed, \( h = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed, solution satisfies constraints).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, as all subgoals have been addressed.

### Final Answer
Theresa bought 7 hardcover volumes.
