### Problem Restatement
We need to find the point \((a, b)\) on the line \(y = -5x + 18\) where a mouse, starting at \((4, -2)\), transitions from getting closer to a piece of cheese at \((12, 10)\) to getting farther away. Then, compute \(a + b\).

### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, we need to determine the point \((a, b)\) on the line \(y = -5x + 18\) where the distance from the mouse to the cheese stops decreasing and starts increasing. This suggests finding the point on the line closest to the cheese, as this is where the distance is minimized. We can break this down into:
1. Express the mouse's position on the line.
2. Compute the distance between the mouse and the cheese as a function of a parameter.
3. Find the point where this distance is minimized.
4. Calculate \(a + b\) at that point.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Parameterize the Mouse’s Position
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Represent the mouse’s position on the line \(y = -5x + 18\).
**How to Achieve**: Parameterize the line to express points in terms of a single variable. Since the line is given by \(y = -5x + 18\), let the x-coordinate be \(t\). Then, the y-coordinate is \(y = -5t + 18\). Thus, the mouse’s position at any point is \((t, -5t + 18)\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The line is \(y = -5x + 18\). Parameterizing, we let \(x = t\), so \(y = -5t + 18\). The mouse’s position on the line is \((t, -5t + 18)\). To confirm the mouse is on this line, check if the starting point \((4, -2)\) lies on it:
- Substitute \(x = 4\) into \(y = -5x + 18\): \(y = -5 \cdot 4 + 18 = -20 + 18 = -2\).
- This matches the y-coordinate, so \((4, -2)\) is on the line, corresponding to \(t = 4\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Define the Distance Function
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Formulate the distance from the mouse to the cheese as a function of \(t\).
**How to Achieve**: Use the distance formula between the mouse’s position \((t, -5t + 18)\) and the cheese at \((12, 10)\), then express it as a function to minimize.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The cheese is at \((12, 10)\), and the mouse is at \((t, -5t + 18)\). The distance \(D(t)\) is:
\[
D(t) = \sqrt{(t - 12)^2 + ((-5t + 18) - 10)^2} = \sqrt{(t - 12)^2 + (-5t + 8)^2}.
\]
To simplify minimization, use the squared distance (since the minimum of the square occurs at the same point as the minimum of the distance):
\[
D^2(t) = (t - 12)^2 + (-5t + 8)^2.
\]
Expand:
\[
(t - 12)^2 = t^2 - 24t + 144,
\]
\[
(-5t + 8)^2 = 25t^2 - 80t + 64.
\]
So:
\[
D^2(t) = t^2 - 24t + 144 + 25t^2 - 80t + 64 = 26t^2 - 104t + 208.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Minimize the Distance
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Find the value of \(t\) that minimizes the distance.
**How to Achieve**: Minimize \(D^2(t) = 26t^2 - 104t + 208\) by finding the critical point using calculus (derivative) or completing the square, as it’s a quadratic function.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(D^2(t) = 26t^2 - 104t + 208\) is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, its minimum occurs at the vertex. For a quadratic \(at^2 + bt + c\), the vertex is at \(t = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Here, \(a = 26\), \(b = -104\):
\[
t = -\frac{-104}{2 \cdot 26} = \frac{104}{52} = 2.
\]
Alternatively, take the derivative:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(26t^2 - 104t + 208) = 52t - 104.
\]
Set to zero:
\[
52t - 104 = 0 \implies t = 2.
\]
The second derivative is \(52 > 0\), confirming a minimum. Thus, the distance is minimized at \(t = 2\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Find the Coordinates \((a, b)\)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Determine the coordinates \((a, b)\) at \(t = 2\).
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(t = 2\) into the parameterized line equations to find \(x = a\) and \(y = b\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
At \(t = 2\):
- \(x = t = 2\), so \(a = 2\).
- \(y = -5t + 18 = -5 \cdot 2 + 18 = -10 + 18 = 8\), so \(b = 8\).
Thus, the point is \((a, b) = (2, 8)\).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Verify the Transition Point
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \((2, 8)\) is where the mouse transitions from getting closer to farther from the cheese.
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the distance function’s behavior around \(t = 2\) to ensure the distance decreases before and increases after.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(D^2(t) = 26t^2 - 104t + 208\) is a parabola opening upward with a minimum at \(t = 2\), the distance decreases for \(t < 2\) and increases for \(t > 2\). The mouse starts at \((4, -2)\), where \(t = 4\). Since \(4 > 2\), the mouse is moving in a direction where \(t\) increases or decreases along the line. To determine the direction, parameterize the line with a time parameter. Suppose the mouse moves along \(x = t\), \(y = -5t + 18\). At \(t = 4\), the position is \((4, -2)\). Check points before and after:
- At \(t = 3\): \(y = -5 \cdot 3 + 18 = 3\), so position is \((3, 3)\). Distance to \((12, 10)\):
  \[
  \sqrt{(3 - 12)^2 + (3 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{81 + 49} = \sqrt{130} \approx 11.4.
  \]
- At \(t = 2\): Position is \((2, 8)\). Distance:
  \[
  \sqrt{(2 - 12)^2 + (8 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 4} = \sqrt{104} \approx 10.2.
  \]
- At \(t = 4\): Position is \((4, -2)\). Distance:
  \[
  \sqrt{(4 - 12)^2 + (-2 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 144} = \sqrt{208} \approx 14.4.
  \]
Since \(t = 4 > 2\), if the mouse moves to decreasing \(t\), it reaches \(t = 2\) (distance ~10.2, closer), then to \(t = 3\) (distance ~11.4, farther), confirming the minimum at \(t = 2\).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Compute the Final Answer
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Calculate \(a + b\).
**How to Achieve**: Use the coordinates \((a, b) = (2, 8)\) and compute their sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The point is \((a, b) = (2, 8)\). Thus:
\[
a + b = 2 + 8 = 10.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Review Goals
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b\) where \((a, b)\) is the point on \(y = -5x + 18\) where the mouse transitions from getting closer to farther from the cheese at \((12, 10)\).
  - Subgoal 1: Parameterize the mouse’s position on the line (completed: position is \((t, -5t + 18)\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Formulate the distance function (completed: \(D^2(t) = 26t^2 - 104t + 208\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize the distance (completed: minimum at \(t = 2\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Find coordinates \((a, b)\) (completed: \((2, 8)\)).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the transition point (completed: distance decreases before \(t = 2\), increases after).
  - Subgoal 6: Compute \(a + b\) (completed: \(10\)).
**Current Goal**: Completed—calculate \(a + b = 10\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The point where the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese is \((2, 8)\), so:
\[
a + b = 2 + 8 = 10.
\]
**Final Answer: 10**
