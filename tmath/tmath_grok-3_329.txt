### Problem Statement
We need to find the point \((a, b)\) on the line \(y = -5x + 18\) where a mouse, starting at \((4, -2)\), transitions from getting closer to a piece of cheese at \((12, 10)\) to getting farther away. Then, compute \(a + b\). The mouse is moving along the line, and we need to determine the point where the distance to the cheese stops decreasing and begins increasing.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve this problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the distance function between the mouse’s position on the line and the cheese.  
2. Parameterize the mouse’s position on the line \(y = -5x + 18\).  
3. Find the point on the line where the distance to the cheese is minimized (the transition point).  
4. Compute the coordinates \((a, b)\) of this point and calculate \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the distance function between the mouse’s position on the line \(y = -5x + 18\) and the cheese at \((12, 10)\). This will be achieved by expressing the mouse’s position in terms of a parameter (e.g., \(x\)) and using the distance formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The mouse moves along the line \(y = -5x + 18\). Let the mouse’s position be \((x, y)\), where \(y = -5x + 18\). The cheese is at \((12, 10)\). The distance \(D\) between the mouse and the cheese is given by the Euclidean distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + (y - 10)^2}
\]

Since \(y = -5x + 18\), substitute \(y\):

\[
D = \sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + ((-5x + 18) - 10)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + (-5x + 8)^2}
\]

To simplify calculations, work with the squared distance (since minimizing the distance is equivalent to minimizing the squared distance):

\[
D^2 = (x - 12)^2 + (-5x + 8)^2
\]

Expand the expression:

\[
(x - 12)^2 = x^2 - 24x + 144
\]

\[
(-5x + 8)^2 = 25x^2 - 80x + 64
\]

\[
D^2 = x^2 - 24x + 144 + 25x^2 - 80x + 64 = 26x^2 - 104x + 208
\]

Thus, the squared distance function is:

\[
D^2(x) = 26x^2 - 104x + 208
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the point on the line where the distance to the cheese is minimized. This will be achieved by minimizing the squared distance function \(D^2(x) = 26x^2 - 104x + 208\) using calculus (taking the derivative and finding the critical point).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the point where the distance is minimized, take the derivative of \(D^2(x)\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

\[
D^2(x) = 26x^2 - 104x + 208
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx}(D^2) = 52x - 104
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
52x - 104 = 0
\]

\[
x = 2
\]

To confirm this is a minimum, check the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(D^2) = 52
\]

Since \(52 > 0\), the function has a minimum at \(x = 2\). Now, find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate using the line equation \(y = -5x + 18\):

\[
y = -5(2) + 18 = -10 + 18 = 8
\]

Thus, the point where the distance is minimized is \((2, 8)\). This is the point \((a, b)\), so \(a = 2\), \(b = 8\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \((2, 8)\) is the point where the mouse transitions from getting closer to farther from the cheese. This will be achieved by checking the mouse’s starting position, the direction of movement, and the behavior of the distance function around \(x = 2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The mouse starts at \((4, -2)\). Check if this point lies on the line \(y = -5x + 18\):

\[
y = -5(4) + 18 = -20 + 18 = -2
\]

The point \((4, -2)\) satisfies the line equation, confirming the mouse starts on the line. Next, determine the direction of movement. Parameterize the line using a parameter \(t\). Let \(x = t\), then \(y = -5t + 18\), so the position is \((t, -5t + 18)\). At the starting point \((4, -2)\):

\[
t = 4, \quad y = -5(4) + 18 = -2
\]

As \(t\) increases (e.g., \(t = 5\)), \(x = 5\), \(y = -5(5) + 18 = -7\), so the mouse moves to \((5, -7)\). Compute the distance to the cheese at \(t = 4\) and \(t = 5\):

- At \(t = 4\), position \((4, -2)\):

\[
D = \sqrt{(4 - 12)^2 + (-2 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-12)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 144} = \sqrt{208} \approx 14.42
\]

- At \(t = 2\), position \((2, 8)\):

\[
D = \sqrt{(2 - 12)^2 + (8 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 4} = \sqrt{104} \approx 10.20
\]

- At \(t = 5\), position \((5, -7)\):

\[
D = \sqrt{(5 - 12)^2 + (-7 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{(-7)^2 + (-17)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 289} = \sqrt{338} \approx 18.38
\]

The distance decreases from \(t = 4\) (14.42) to \(t = 2\) (10.20), then increases to \(t = 5\) (18.38), confirming that the distance is minimized at \(t = 2\), i.e., \((2, 8)\). Thus, \((a, b) = (2, 8)\) is the transition point.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b\) using the coordinates \((a, b) = (2, 8)\). This will be achieved by adding the coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \((a, b) = (2, 8)\):

\[
a + b = 2 + 8 = 10
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the point \((a, b)\) on the line \(y = -5x + 18\) where the mouse transitions from getting closer to farther from the cheese at \((12, 10)\), and compute \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the distance function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Parameterize the mouse’s position and minimize the distance (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the transition point (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(a + b\) (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming all steps are complete and the answer is correct. Since \(a + b = 10\) has been computed and validated, the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The point where the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese is \((2, 8)\), so:

\[
a + b = 2 + 8 = 10
\]

\[
\boxed{10}
