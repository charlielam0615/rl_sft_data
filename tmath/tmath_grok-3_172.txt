### Problem Statement
We need to find three consecutive integers such that the sum of the first and third integers is 118, and then determine the value of the second integer.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for the second integer.  
- Subgoal 1: Define the three consecutive integers in terms of a variable.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up an equation based on the given condition (sum of first and third integers equals 118).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find the integers.  
- Subgoal 4: Identify the second integer from the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to define the three consecutive integers and set up the equation. Define the first integer as \( n \), so the second is \( n+1 \), and the third is \( n+2 \). Use the condition that the sum of the first and third integers is 118 to form the equation \( n + (n+2) = 118 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the first integer be \( n \).  
Then, the three consecutive integers are:  
- First: \( n \)  
- Second: \( n+1 \)  
- Third: \( n+2 \)  
Given that the sum of the first and third integers is 118, we can write:  
\[ n + (n+2) = 118 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve the equation \( n + (n+2) = 118 \) to find the value of \( n \). Solve by simplifying the equation and isolating \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Simplify the equation:  
\[ n + (n+2) = 118 \]  
\[ 2n + 2 = 118 \]  
Subtract 2 from both sides:  
\[ 2n = 116 \]  
Divide by 2:  
\[ n = 58 \]  
So, the first integer is \( n = 58 \).  
The three consecutive integers are:  
- First: 58  
- Second: \( 58 + 1 = 59 \)  
- Third: \( 58 + 2 = 60 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the sum of the first and third integers (58 and 60) equals 118.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the sum of the first and third integers:  
\[ 58 + 60 = 118 \]  
The sum matches the given condition, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the second of three consecutive integers whose first and third sum to 118.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the three consecutive integers (completed: defined as \( n \), \( n+1 \), \( n+2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation \( n + (n+2) = 118 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find \( n = 58 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the second integer as \( n+1 = 59 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the solution (completed: 58 + 60 = 118).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the second integer.  
The second integer is 59, as calculated and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of the second integer is 59.
