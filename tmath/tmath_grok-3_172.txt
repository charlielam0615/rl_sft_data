**Problem Statement**: We need to find three consecutive integers such that the sum of the first and third integers equals 118. The goal is to determine the value of the second integer.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the three consecutive integers in terms of a variable.  
2. Set up an equation based on the given condition (sum of the first and third integers equals 118).  
3. Solve the equation to find the integers.  
4. Identify the second integer from the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the three consecutive integers and set up the equation for their sum. This will be achieved by representing the integers algebraically and using the problem's condition to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the first integer be \( n \). Since the integers are consecutive, the second integer is \( n + 1 \), and the third integer is \( n + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of the first and third integers is 118, so we can write the equation:  
\[ n + (n + 2) = 118 \]  
Simplify the equation:  
\[ 2n + 2 = 118 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 2n + 2 = 118 \) to find the value of \( n \), which will allow us to determine the three integers. This will be achieved by isolating \( n \) through algebraic manipulation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 2n + 2 = 118 \]  
Subtract 2 from both sides:  
\[ 2n = 116 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ n = 58 \]  
Thus, the first integer is \( n = 58 \), the second integer is \( n + 1 = 59 \), and the third integer is \( n + 2 = 60 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the integers satisfy the problem's condition. This will be achieved by checking if the sum of the first and third integers equals 118.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first integer is 58, and the third integer is 60. Their sum is:  
\[ 58 + 60 = 118 \]  
This matches the given condition, confirming the solution is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the second of three consecutive integers whose first and third sum to 118.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the three consecutive integers (completed: represented as \( n \), \( n + 1 \), \( n + 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation for the sum of the first and third integers (completed: \( n + (n + 2) = 118 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find the integers (completed: \( n = 58 \), so integers are 58, 59, 60).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: \( 58 + 60 = 118 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify the second integer (current).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the second integer from the solution.  
Based on the previous steps, the second integer is \( n + 1 = 58 + 1 = 59 \).
