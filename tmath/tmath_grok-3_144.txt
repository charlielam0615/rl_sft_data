**Problem Statement**: Given the ratios \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\), \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\), and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\), find the value of \(\frac{m}{q}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \(\frac{m}{q}\).  
1. Express \(m\) in terms of \(n\) using \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\).  
2. Express \(p\) in terms of \(n\) using \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\).  
3. Express \(p\) in terms of \(q\) using \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\).  
4. Relate \(n\) and \(q\) using the expressions for \(p\).  
5. Compute \(\frac{m}{q}\) using the relationships derived.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(m\) and \(p\) in terms of \(n\). Use the given ratios \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\) and \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\) to write \(m = 15n\) and \(p = 3n\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\), we get:  
\[ m = 15n \]  
From \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\), we get:  
\[ p = 3n \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(p\) in terms of \(q\) and relate it to \(p = 3n\). Use \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\) to write \(p = \frac{q}{10}\), then equate the two expressions for \(p\) to find a relationship between \(n\) and \(q\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\), we get:  
\[ p = \frac{q}{10} \]  
Since \(p = 3n\) from Step 2, equate the two expressions for \(p\):  
\[ 3n = \frac{q}{10} \]  
Solve for \(q\):  
\[ q = 30n \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\frac{m}{q}\). Use \(m = 15n\) from Step 2 and \(q = 30n\) from Step 3 to form the ratio \(\frac{m}{q}\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have:  
\[ m = 15n \]  
\[ q = 30n \]  
Compute:  
\[ \frac{m}{q} = \frac{15n}{30n} = \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computed value of \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\). Substitute the relationships back into the given ratios to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check consistency:  
- From \(m = 15n\) and \(q = 30n\), we have \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
- Verify using \(p\): From \(p = 3n\) and \(q = 30n\), compute \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{3n}{30n} = \frac{1}{10}\), which matches the given ratio.  
- The original ratios \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\) and \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\) are directly satisfied by \(m = 15n\) and \(p = 3n\).  
The solution is consistent.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(\frac{m}{q}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(m\) and \(p\) in terms of \(n\) (completed: \(m = 15n\), \(p = 3n\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Relate \(p\) to \(q\) and find \(q\) in terms of \(n\) (completed: \(p = \frac{q}{10}\), \(q = 30n\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(\frac{m}{q}\) (completed: \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: ratios are consistent).  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”solution validated.

**Final Answer**: \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\)
