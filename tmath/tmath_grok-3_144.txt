### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \(\frac{m}{q}\) given the following ratios:
- \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\)
- \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\)
- \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\)

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \(\frac{m}{q}\) into intermediate subgoals. To find \(\frac{m}{q}\), we need to express \(m\) and \(q\) in terms of a common variable or relate them using the given ratios. The given equations involve \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\), so we can:
1. Use \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\) to express \(m\) in terms of \(n\).
2. Use \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\) to express \(p\) in terms of \(n\).
3. Use \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\) to express \(q\) in terms of \(p\).
4. Combine these to find \(\frac{m}{q}\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(m\) and \(q\) using the given ratios. We will use the equations \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\), \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\), and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\) to derive expressions for \(m\) and \(q\), then compute \(\frac{m}{q}\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\), we get:
\[ m = 15n. \]

From \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\), we get:
\[ p = 3n. \]

From \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\), we get:
\[ p = \frac{q}{10} \quad \text{or} \quad q = 10p. \]

Substitute \(p = 3n\) into \(q = 10p\):
\[ q = 10 \cdot 3n = 30n. \]

Now, compute \(\frac{m}{q}\):
\[ \frac{m}{q} = \frac{15n}{30n}. \]

Simplify by canceling \(n\) (assuming \(n \neq 0\)):
\[ \frac{15n}{30n} = \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2}. \]

Thus, \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\). We will check if the derived value is consistent with all given ratios by substituting back and ensuring no contradictions arise.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We derived \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\). To validate, letâ€™s use the expressions:
- \(m = 15n\),
- \(p = 3n\),
- \(q = 30n\).

Compute \(\frac{m}{q}\):
\[ \frac{m}{q} = \frac{15n}{30n} = \frac{1}{2}, \]
which matches our result.

Verify the given ratios:
- \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{15n}{n} = 15\), which satisfies \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\).
- \(\frac{p}{n} = \frac{3n}{n} = 3\), which satisfies \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\).
- \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{3n}{30n} = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10}\), which satisfies \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\).

All ratios are consistent, confirming that \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\) is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find \(\frac{m}{q}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(m\) in terms of \(n\) using \(\frac{m}{n} = 15\).
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(p\) in terms of \(n\) using \(\frac{p}{n} = 3\).
  - Subgoal 3: Express \(q\) in terms of \(p\) using \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{10}\).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(\frac{m}{q}\) using the expressions.
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the result.

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to validate the result, which has been completed. The main goal of finding \(\frac{m}{q} = \frac{1}{2}\) has been achieved and verified.
