Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Divide the entire equation by the coefficient of $x^2$ to simplify it.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given equation is $11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0$. Dividing the entire equation by 11, we get:
$$ x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Move the constant term to the right-hand side.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting from the equation $x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0$, we move the constant $-9$ to the right-hand side by adding $9$ to both sides:  
$$ x^2 - 4x = 9 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Complete the square on the left-hand side.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To complete the square for $x^2 - 4x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is $-4$), square it, and add it to both sides. Half of $-4$ is $-2$, and $(-2)^2 = 4$. Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
$$ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9 + 4 $$
$$ (x - 2)^2 = 13 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $r$ and $s$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The equation $(x - 2)^2 = 13$ is in the form $(x + r)^2 = s$. Comparing, we find:  
$$ r = -2, \quad s = 13 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $r + s$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given $r = -2$ and $s = 13$, we calculate:
$$ r + s = -2 + 13 = 11 $$
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
Starting with the original equation $ 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 $:  

1. **Dividing by 11**:  
   $ x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 $.  
   This is correct because dividing all terms by 11 simplifies the equation.  

2. **Moving the constant term**:  
   $ x^2 - 4x = 9 $.  
   This is valid as adding 9 to both sides isolates the quadratic and linear terms.  

3. **Completing the square**:  
   - Coefficient of $ x $ is $-4$. Half of $-4$ is $-2$, and squaring it gives $4$.  
   - Adding 4 to both sides:  
     $ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9 + 4 $  
     $ (x - 2)^2 = 13 $.  
   This matches the standard form $ (x + r)^2 = s $, where $ r = -2 $ and $ s = 13 $.  

4. **Calculating $ r + s $**:  
   $ r = -2 $, $ s = 13 $, so $ r + s = -2 + 13 = 11 $.  

All steps align with standard methods for completing the square, and the arithmetic is verified to be correct. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
