**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the relationship between the changes in x and y values (e.g., find the slope of the line).  
2. Use this relationship to calculate the change in y when x increases by 9 units.  
3. Verify the solution aligns with the given condition.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the relationship between the changes in x and y, specifically the slope of the line. This can be achieved by calculating the ratio of the change in y to the change in x based on the given information (Δx = 3, Δy = 7).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given that when the x-value increases by 3 units (Δx = 3), the y-value increases by 7 units (Δy = 7), the slope of the line is:  
\[ \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
This slope represents the rate of change of y with respect to x, which is constant for a linear relationship.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the change in y when x increases by 9 units, using the slope determined in the previous step. This can be achieved by multiplying the slope by the new change in x (Δx = 9).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the slope \(\frac{7}{3}\), when the x-value increases by 9 units (Δx = 9), the change in y (Δy) is:  
\[ \Delta y = \text{slope} \times \Delta x = \frac{7}{3} \times 9 = 7 \times 3 = 21 \]  
Thus, the y-value increases by 21 units.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine by how many units the y-value increases when the x-value increases by 9 units.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the relationship between changes in x and y (completed: slope = \(\frac{7}{3}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the change in y for Δx = 9 (completed: Δy = 21).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution aligns with the given condition.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the calculated change in y (21 units for Δx = 9) is consistent with the given condition (Δy = 7 for Δx = 3). This can be achieved by checking if the slope remains consistent across both scenarios.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The slope from the given condition is \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7}{3}\). For Δx = 9, we calculated Δy = 21, so the slope is:  
\[ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{21}{9} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
Since the slope is the same (\(\frac{7}{3}\)) in both cases, the solution is consistent with the linear relationship of the line. Thus, the y-value increases by 21 units when the x-value increases by 9 units.

**Final Answer**: The y-value increases by 21 units when the x-value increases by 9 units.
