**Problem Statement**: In the Cartesian plane, when the x-value increases by 3 units, the y-value increases by 7 units. We need to determine how many units the y-value increases when the x-value increases by 9 units.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Determine the relationship between the changes in x and y values.  
2. Calculate the change in y when x increases by 9 units based on this relationship.  
3. Verify the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the relationship between the changes in x and y values.  
How to Achieve: Since the x-value increases by 3 units and the y-value increases by 7 units, this suggests a linear relationship. Calculate the rate of change (slope) as the ratio of the change in y to the change in x.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The change in x is 3 units, and the change in y is 7 units. The rate of change (slope) is:  
\[ \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
This means for every 1 unit increase in x, the y-value increases by \(\frac{7}{3}\) units.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the change in y when x increases by 9 units.  
How to Achieve: Use the slope (\(\frac{7}{3}\)) to find the change in y by multiplying it by the change in x (9 units).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The change in x is 9 units. Using the slope:  
\[ \Delta y = \text{slope} \times \Delta x = \frac{7}{3} \times 9 = 7 \times 3 = 21 \]  
So, the y-value increases by 21 units.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution.  
How to Achieve: Check if the proportional relationship holds by confirming that the change in y for 9 units in x is consistent with the given data. Since 9 units is 3 times 3 units, the change in y should be 3 times the change in y for 3 units.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given: When x increases by 3 units, y increases by 7 units.  
Since 9 units is \(9 \div 3 = 3\) times the given x increase, the y increase should be:  
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]  
This matches the calculated \(\Delta y = 21\), confirming the solution is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the y-value increase when the x-value increases by 9 units.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the relationship between changes in x and y (completed: slope = \(\frac{7}{3}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the change in y for a 9-unit increase in x (completed: \(\Delta y = 21\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: verified using proportionality).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, as the y-value increase is calculated and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: When the x-value increases by 9 units, the y-value increases by **21 units**.
