### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that when rolling six fair 6-sided dice, at least two dice show the same number. Each die has faces numbered 1 to 6, and all outcomes are equally likely.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice.
2. Calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers.
3. Use the complement to find the probability that at least two dice show the same number.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Achieve this by determining the number of outcomes for each die and multiplying across all six dice.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each die has 6 possible outcomes (numbers 1 to 6). Since there are 6 dice, and the rolls are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[ 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 46656. \]
So, there are 46,656 possible outcomes.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers. Achieve this by selecting distinct numbers for each die in sequence, accounting for the decreasing number of available choices.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To have all dice show different numbers, the first die can show any of the 6 numbers, the second die must show a different number (5 choices), the third a different number from the first two (4 choices), and so on. This is a permutation of 6 distinct numbers:
\[ P(6,6) = 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720. \]
So, there are 720 outcomes where all dice show different numbers.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that at least two dice show the same number.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes (completed: 46,656).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers (completed: 720).
  - Subgoal 3: Use the complement to find the probability (pending).
Current goal: Use the complement to find the probability.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find the probability that at least two dice show the same number using the complement. Achieve this by subtracting the probability of all dice showing different numbers from 1.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The probability that all dice show different numbers is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
\[ P(\text{all different}) = \frac{720}{46656}. \]
The probability that at least two dice show the same number is the complement:
\[ P(\text{at least two same}) = 1 - P(\text{all different}) = 1 - \frac{720}{46656}. \]
Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{720}{46656} = \frac{720 \div 72}{46656 \div 72} = \frac{10}{648} = \frac{5}{324}. \]
Thus:
\[ P(\text{at least two same}) = 1 - \frac{5}{324} = \frac{324 - 5}{324} = \frac{319}{324}. \]
To verify, compute numerically:
\[ \frac{720}{46656} \approx 0.015432, \quad 1 - 0.015432 = 0.984568, \quad \frac{319}{324} \approx 0.984568. \]
The fraction \(\frac{319}{324}\) is in simplest form (since 319 is prime and does not divide 324). The probability is:
\[ \frac{319}{324}. \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the calculated probability. Achieve this by checking the calculations and considering an alternative approach to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Recompute the key steps:
- Total outcomes: \( 6^6 = 46656 \), confirmed.
- Outcomes with all different numbers: \( 6! = 720 \), confirmed.
- Probability: \( 1 - \frac{720}{46656} = 1 - \frac{5}{324} = \frac{319}{324} \).
Alternatively, consider the probability for a smaller case (e.g., 2 dice) to check intuition:
- For 2 dice, total outcomes = \( 6^2 = 36 \).
- All different: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \).
- At least two same: \( 1 - \frac{30}{36} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \).
This is reasonable, as there are 6 outcomes where both dice show the same number (1,1; 2,2; etc.). For 6 dice, the probability should be much higher due to more opportunities for matches, and \(\frac{319}{324} \approx 0.9846\) aligns with this intuition.
The calculations are consistent, and the result is validated.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that at least two of the six dice show the same number is:
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{319}{324}} \]
