**Problem Statement**: Given the operation defined as \( x@y = xy - 2x \), we need to compute the value of \( (7@4) - (4@7) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the value of \( 7@4 \) using the given operation.  
2. Compute the value of \( 4@7 \) using the given operation.  
3. Subtract the result of \( 4@7 \) from the result of \( 7@4 \) to find the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( 7@4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the operation \( x@y = xy - 2x \) with \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the operation \( x@y = xy - 2x \):  
\( 7@4 = (7 \cdot 4) - (2 \cdot 7) = 28 - 14 = 14 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( 4@7 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the operation \( x@y = xy - 2x \) with \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 7 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the operation \( x@y = xy - 2x \):  
\( 4@7 = (4 \cdot 7) - (2 \cdot 4) = 28 - 8 = 20 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( (7@4) - (4@7) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the results from the previous steps (\( 7@4 = 14 \) and \( 4@7 = 20 \)) and perform the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the results:  
\( (7@4) - (4@7) = 14 - 20 = -6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for \( 7@4 \), \( 4@7 \), and the final subtraction.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate each step to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Recalculate \( 7@4 \): \( 7@4 = (7 \cdot 4) - (2 \cdot 7) = 28 - 14 = 14 \). Correct.  
- Recalculate \( 4@7 \): \( 4@7 = (4 \cdot 7) - (2 \cdot 4) = 28 - 8 = 20 \). Correct.  
- Recalculate the final result: \( 14 - 20 = -6 \). Correct.  
The calculations are consistent and valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( (7@4) - (4@7) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 7@4 \) (completed: \( 7@4 = 14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 4@7 \) (completed: \( 4@7 = 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( (7@4) - (4@7) \) (completed: \( 14 - 20 = -6 \)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, and the result is \( -6 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( -6 \)
