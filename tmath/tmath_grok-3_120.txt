**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of $(7@4) - (4@7)$, where the operation is defined as $x@y = xy - 2x$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the value of $7@4$ using the given operation.  
2. Compute the value of $4@7$ using the given operation.  
3. Subtract the result of $4@7$ from $7@4$ to find the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute $7@4$. Use the operation $x@y = xy - 2x$, substituting $x = 7$ and $y = 4$, and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the operation $x@y = xy - 2x$, for $x = 7$ and $y = 4$:  
$7@4 = (7 \cdot 4) - (2 \cdot 7) = 28 - 14 = 14$.  
So, $7@4 = 14$.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute $4@7$. Use the operation $x@y = xy - 2x$, substituting $x = 4$ and $y = 7$, and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the operation $x@y = xy - 2x$, for $x = 4$ and $y = 7$:  
$4@7 = (4 \cdot 7) - (2 \cdot 4) = 28 - 8 = 20$.  
So, $4@7 = 20$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute $(7@4) - (4@7)$. Use the results from previous steps ($7@4 = 14$ and $4@7 = 20$) and perform the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the results:  
$(7@4) - (4@7) = 14 - 20 = -6$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute $(7@4) - (4@7)$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute $7@4$ (completed: $7@4 = 14$).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute $4@7$ (completed: $4@7 = 20$).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute $(7@4) - (4@7)$ (completed: $14 - 20 = -6$).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final result, which has been computed as $-6$.  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of $(7@4) - (4@7)$ is $-6$.
