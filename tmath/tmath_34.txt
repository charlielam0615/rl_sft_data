Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total cost of the dirt bike using the given percentage and upfront payment.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are told that 10% of the cost of the dirt bike is $150. To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula:  

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \frac{\text{Upfront Payment}}{\text{Percentage as a Decimal}}
$$

Here, the upfront payment is $150 and the percentage is 10%, which is 0.10 in decimal form. Substituting these values:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \frac{150}{0.10}
$$

Performing the calculation:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = 1500
$$

So, the total cost of the dirt bike is $1500.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The upfront payment and the percentage it represents.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The upfront payment made by Max was $150, and this amount represents 10% of the total cost of the dirt bike.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the total cost calculation using percentage principles.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
To verify the calculation of the total cost:

1. **Understanding the given data**: Max paid $150 upfront, which is 10% of the total cost. This implies that $150 corresponds to 10% of the bike's price.

2. **Percentage interpretation**: 10% is equivalent to 0.10 in decimal form. The relationship between the upfront payment and the total cost is linear, as percentages represent proportional parts of a whole.

3. **Mathematical validation**: 
   - The formula used is **Total Cost = Upfront Payment / Percentage**. 
   - Substituting the values: $150 / 0.10 = $1500. 
   - This aligns with the percentage definition: 10% of $1500 is $150 (since 0.10 × 1500 = 150).

4. **Alternative verification method**: 
   - If 10% of the total cost is $150, then 1% is $15 (150 ÷ 10). 
   - Scaling this up, 100% would be 15 × 100 = $1500. 
   - This cross-check confirms the result.

5. **Error-checking**: 
   - No arithmetic errors in the calculation.
   - The percentage relationship was interpreted correctly (10% of the total, not a portion of the remaining amount).
   - The formula and substitution steps are logically consistent.

Conclusion: The reasoning and calculation are correct. The total cost of the bike is indeed $1500.
