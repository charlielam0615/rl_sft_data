**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \), find the value of \( f(3) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to evaluate \( f(3) \) for the function \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \). To achieve this, substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function and perform the arithmetic operations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \):  
\( f(3) = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculation \( f(3) = 10 \). This can be achieved by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the calculation:  
Given \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \), substitute \( x = 3 \):  
\( f(3) = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \).  
The calculation is consistent with the previous result.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-management system:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(3) \) for \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).  
  - Subgoal: Evaluate \( f(3) \) by substituting \( x = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Validate the calculation (completed).  
Current goal: No further goals remain, as the main goal is achieved with \( f(3) = 10 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = 10 \).
