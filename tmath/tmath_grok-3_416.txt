**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \), find the value of \( f(3) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to find \( f(3) \), which means substituting \( x = 3 \) into the function \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \). This can be achieved by performing the substitution and calculating the result using basic arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find \( f(3) \), substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function:  
\( f(3) = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculation \( f(3) = 10 \). This can be achieved by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the calculation:  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \):  
\( 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \).  
The result is consistent with the previous calculation, confirming \( f(3) = 10 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-management system:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(3) \) for the function \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).  
  - Subgoal: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function and calculate the result (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Validate the calculation to ensure correctness (completed).  
Current goal: The main goal has been achieved, and the result is \( f(3) = 10 \). No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = 10 \)
