Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The relationship between the terms in the sequence.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The problem states that each term after the first is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it. This means for any term $ a_n $ (where $ n > 1 $), the relationship can be written as:
$$ a_n = \frac{1}{3}(a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) $$

[IMP]
Let the first five terms of the sequence be $ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 $.  
We are given $ a_1 = 2 $ and $ a_4 = 34 $.  
The relationship for each term after the first is:  
$$ a_n = \frac{1}{3}(a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) $$  

Apply this relationship for $ n = 2 $:  
$$ a_2 = \frac{1}{3}(a_1 + a_3) \Rightarrow 3a_2 = a_1 + a_3 $$  
Apply this relationship for $ n = 3 $:  
$$ a_3 = \frac{1}{3}(a_2 + a_4) \Rightarrow 3a_3 = a_2 + a_4 $$  
Apply this relationship for $ n = 4 $:  
$$ a_4 = \frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_5) \Rightarrow 3a_4 = a_3 + a_5 $$  

Now substitute $ a_4 = 34 $ into the third equation to express $ a_5 $ in terms of $ a_3 $:  
$$ 3(34) = a_3 + a_5 \Rightarrow 102 = a_3 + a_5 \Rightarrow a_5 = 102 - a_3 $$  

We now have $ a_5 $ expressed in terms of $ a_3 $. To find $ a_3 $, we need to solve the system of equations involving $ a_2 $ and $ a_3 $.  
From the first equation:  
$$ 3a_2 = a_1 + a_3 \Rightarrow 3a_2 = 2 + a_3 \Rightarrow a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 $$  

Substitute $ a_3 $ into the second equation:  
$$ 3a_3 = a_2 + a_4 \Rightarrow 3(3a_2 - 2) = a_2 + 34 \Rightarrow 9a_2 - 6 = a_2 + 34 $$  

Simplify to solve for $ a_2 $:  
$$ 9a_2 - a_2 = 34 + 6 \Rightarrow 8a_2 = 40 \Rightarrow a_2 = 5 $$  

Now find $ a_3 $:  
$$ a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 $$  

Finally, substitute $ a_3 = 13 $ into the equation for $ a_5 $:  
$$ a_5 = 102 - a_3 = 102 - 13 = 89 $$

[VERIFY]
Let's verify each step of the solution:

1. **Recurrence relation application**:
   - For $ n=2 $: $ 3a_2 = a_1 + a_3 $  
     Substituted $ a_1 = 2 $: $ 3a_2 = 2 + a_3 $. Correct.
   - For $ n=3 $: $ 3a_3 = a_2 + a_4 $  
     Substituted $ a_4 = 34 $: $ 3a_3 = a_2 + 34 $. Correct.
   - For $ n=4 $: $ 3a_4 = a_3 + a_5 $  
     Substituted $ a_4 = 34 $: $ 102 = a_3 + a_5 $. Correct.

2. **Solving for $ a_2 $**:
   - From $ 3a_3 = a_2 + 34 $, substituted $ a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 $:  
     $ 3(3a_2 - 2) = a_2 + 34 \Rightarrow 9a_2 - 6 = a_2 + 34 $.  
     Simplified: $ 8a_2 = 40 \Rightarrow a_2 = 5 $. Correct.

3. **Solving for $ a_3 $**:
   - $ a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 = 3(5) - 2 = 13 $. Correct.

4. **Solving for $ a_5 $**:
   - $ a_5 = 102 - a_3 = 102 - 13 = 89 $. Correct.

5. **Consistency check**:
   - Verify $ a_5 = 89 $ satisfies $ 3a_4 = a_3 + a_5 $:  
     $ 3(34) = 13 + 89 \Rightarrow 102 = 102 $. Correct.
   - Verify $ a_3 = 13 $ satisfies $ 3a_3 = a_2 + a_4 $:  
     $ 3(13) = 5 + 34 \Rightarrow 39 = 39 $. Correct.
   - Verify $ a_2 = 5 $ satisfies $ 3a_2 = a_1 + a_3 $:  
     $ 3(5) = 2 + 13 \Rightarrow 15 = 15 $. Correct.

All derived values satisfy the recurrence relations. No errors detected in the reasoning or calculations.
