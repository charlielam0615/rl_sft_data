**Problem Statement**: Evaluate \(\log_8 2\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(\log_8 2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recall the definition of a logarithm.  
2. Express \(\log_8 2\) in terms of a known logarithm or simplify it using logarithm properties.  
3. Compute the numerical value if possible.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review)  
Meta-data: Retrieve the definition of a logarithm and relevant logarithm properties to serve as the foundation for evaluating \(\log_8 2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The logarithm \(\log_b a\) is defined as the exponent \(x\) such that \(b^x = a\). For \(\log_8 2\), we need \(8^x = 2\). Additionally, logarithm properties include:  
- Change of base formula: \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}\).  
- Power rule: \(\log_b (a^c) = c \log_b a\).  
These properties will guide the simplification of \(\log_8 2\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to express \(\log_8 2\) in a simpler form. Use the fact that \(8 = 2^3\) to rewrite the logarithm and simplify it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \(8 = 2^3\), we can rewrite \(\log_8 2\) as follows:  
\[
\log_8 2 = \log_{2^3} 2
\]
Using the logarithm property \(\log_{b^c} a = \frac{1}{c} \log_b a\), we get:  
\[
\log_{2^3} 2 = \frac{1}{3} \log_2 2
\]
Since \(\log_2 2 = 1\) (because \(2^1 = 2\)), this simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Thus, \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the result \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\) by checking if it satisfies the logarithm definition or using an alternative method.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, check if \(8^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2\):  
\[
8 = 2^3 \implies 8^{\frac{1}{3}} = (2^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2^1 = 2
\]
This satisfies the definition of \(\log_8 2\). Alternatively, use the change of base formula:  
\[
\log_8 2 = \frac{\log_2 2}{\log_2 8} = \frac{1}{\log_2 (2^3)} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Both methods confirm \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\log_8 2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall logarithm definition and properties (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify \(\log_8 2\) using \(8 = 2^3\) (completed, result: \(\frac{1}{3}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed, confirmed \(\frac{1}{3}\)).  
Current goal: None, as the main goal is achieved. The final answer is \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\)
