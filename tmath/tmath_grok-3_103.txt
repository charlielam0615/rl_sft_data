**Problem Statement**: Evaluate \(\log_8 2\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To evaluate \(\log_8 2\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Recognize that \(\log_8 2\) asks for the exponent \(x\) such that \(8^x = 2\).  
2. Express 8 in terms of base 2, since 2 is the argument of the logarithm.  
3. Apply logarithm properties to simplify and compute the value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express 8 as a power of 2 and use logarithm properties to evaluate \(\log_8 2\). This can be achieved by rewriting 8 as \(2^3\) and applying the change of base formula or logarithm properties.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \(8 = 2^3\), we can rewrite \(\log_8 2\) as \(\log_{2^3} 2\). Using the logarithm property \(\log_{a^b} c = \frac{1}{b} \log_a c\), we get:  
\[
\log_{2^3} 2 = \frac{1}{3} \log_2 2.
\]
Since \(\log_2 2 = 1\) (because \(2^1 = 2\)), this simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus, \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the result \(\log_8 2 = \frac{1}{3}\) by checking if \(8^{1/3} = 2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, compute \(8^{1/3}\):  
Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have \(8^{1/3} = (2^3)^{1/3} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = 2^1 = 2\).  
This satisfies the definition of \(\log_8 2\), as \(8^{1/3} = 2\). The result is correct.
