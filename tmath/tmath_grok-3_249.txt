**Problem Statement**: Determine the sum of all values of \( y \) for which the expression \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined. An expression is undefined when its denominator equals zero. We need to find the values of \( y \) that make the denominator zero and compute their sum.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Identify when the expression is undefined by finding when the denominator equals zero.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation to find the values of \( y \).  
3. Sum the values of \( y \) obtained.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find when the denominator \( y^2 - 5y + 4 \) equals zero. Achieve this by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving the resulting quadratic equation for \( y \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \]  
Factorize the quadratic:  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = (y - 4)(y - 1) = 0 \]  
Solve for \( y \):  
\[ y - 4 = 0 \implies y = 4 \]  
\[ y - 1 = 0 \implies y = 1 \]  
The expression is undefined at \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the values \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \) make the denominator zero and ensure no other solutions exist. Check the factorization and solutions of the quadratic equation.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the factorization:  
\[ (y - 4)(y - 1) = y^2 - y - 4y + 4 = y^2 - 5y + 4 \]  
The factorization is correct.  
Check the roots:  
- For \( y = 1 \): \( 1^2 - 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 - 5 + 4 = 0 \)  
- For \( y = 4 \): \( 4^2 - 5 \cdot 4 + 4 = 16 - 20 + 4 = 0 \)  
Both values make the denominator zero. Since the quadratic is a second-degree polynomial, it has at most two roots, and no other solutions exist.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all \( y \) values for which \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify when the denominator \( y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation to find \( y \). (Completed: \( y = 1, 4 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the \( y \) values. (Pending)  
**Current Goal**: Sum the values of \( y \) (i.e., \( 1 \) and \( 4 \)).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the \( y \) values (\( y = 1, 4 \)) where the expression is undefined. Achieve this by adding the values.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the values:  
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]  
The sum of all \( y \) values for which the expression is undefined is \( 5 \).  

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all values of \( y \) for which the expression \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined is \( 5 \).
