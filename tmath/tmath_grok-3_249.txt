### Problem Restatement
We need to find the values of \( y \) that make the expression \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) undefined and then compute their sum. An expression is undefined when its denominator is zero. Thus, we must identify the values of \( y \) for which \( y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \), solve for those values, and sum them.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the condition for the expression to be undefined (denominator equals zero).  
2. Solve the equation \( y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \) to find the values of \( y \).  
3. Sum the values of \( y \) obtained.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify when the expression is undefined by finding when the denominator \( y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \). This will be achieved by solving the quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find when the expression \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined, set the denominator equal to zero:  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \]  
Factorize the quadratic:  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = (y - 4)(y - 1) \]  
Solve for \( y \):  
\[ (y - 4)(y - 1) = 0 \]  
\[ y = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 1 \]  
Thus, the expression is undefined at \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \) make the expression undefined by checking the denominator and ensuring the numerator is non-zero at these points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 1 \) into the denominator:  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = 1^2 - 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 - 5 + 4 = 0 \]  
The denominator is zero. Check the numerator:  
\[ y + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \neq 0 \]  
The expression is undefined at \( y = 1 \).  

Substitute \( y = 4 \):  
\[ y^2 - 5y + 4 = 4^2 - 5 \cdot 4 + 4 = 16 - 20 + 4 = 0 \]  
The denominator is zero. Check the numerator:  
\[ y + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \neq 0 \]  
The expression is undefined at \( y = 4 \).  

Both values are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the values \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The values of \( y \) for which the expression is undefined are \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \).  
Sum these values:  
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all values of \( y \) for which \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify when the denominator \( y^2 - 5y + 4 = 0 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation to find \( y \). (Completed: \( y = 1, 4 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solutions make the expression undefined. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the values of \( y \). (Completed: Sum = 5)  

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to sum the values, which has been achieved. No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The sum of all values of \( y \) for which the expression \(\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}\) is undefined is \( 5 \).
