**Problem Statement**: Find the center of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20 \), where the center is the point \((x, y)\), and compute \( x + y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the center of the circle and compute \( x + y \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circleâ€™s equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) by completing the square.  
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form.  
3. Compute \( h + k \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20 \) in standard form by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms. This involves rearranging the equation, grouping like terms, and applying the completing the square technique.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20 \]  

Move all terms to the left-hand side:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y + 20 = 0 \]  

Group \( x \)- and \( y \)-related terms:  
\[ (x^2 - 8x) + (y^2 + 6y) + 20 = 0 \]  

Complete the square for \( x \):  
- For \( x^2 - 8x \), take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-8\), divide by 2 to get \(-4\), and square it: \((-4)^2 = 16\).  
- Add and subtract 16 inside the parentheses:  
\[ x^2 - 8x = (x^2 - 8x + 16) - 16 = (x - 4)^2 - 16 \]  

Complete the square for \( y \):  
- For \( y^2 + 6y \), take the coefficient of \( y \), which is 6, divide by 2 to get 3, and square it: \(3^2 = 9\).  
- Add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:  
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]  

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + 20 = 0 \]  

Simplify the constants:  
\[ -16 - 9 + 20 = -5 \]  
\[ (x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 5 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5 \]  

The equation is now in standard form: \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the standard form \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\) is correct by expanding it and comparing it to the original equation or confirming the steps of completing the square.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand the standard form to check:  
\[ (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \]  
\[ (y + 3)^2 = y^2 + 6y + 9 \]  
\[ (x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = (x^2 - 8x + 16) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y + 25 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y + 25 = 5 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y = 5 - 25 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y = -20 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20 \]  

This matches the original equation, confirming the standard form is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\) and compute \( h + k \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), compare:  
\[ (x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = (x - 4)^2 + (y - (-3))^2 = 5 \]  
The center is \((h, k) = (4, -3)\).  
Compute \( h + k \):  
\[ 4 + (-3) = 4 - 3 = 1 \]  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the center \((x, y)\) of the circle and compute \( x + y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((h, k)\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( h + k \) (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \( x + y \), which has been achieved as \( h + k = 1 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The center of the circle is \((4, -3)\), so \( x + y = 4 + (-3) = 1 \).  
\[ \boxed{1} \]
