**Problem Restatement**: We are given the equation of a circle, \(x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20\), and we need to find the center of this circle, which is a point \((x, y)\). Our goal is to determine the value of \(x + y\).

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to find the center of the circle. The equation provided is not in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center. My subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the given equation into the standard form by completing the square for both \(x\) and \(y\).  
2. Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form.  
3. Calculate \(x + y\), which is \(h + k\).

**Step 2**

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the circle's equation into standard form by completing the square.  
Description: I will rearrange the terms of the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20\) to group \(x\) and \(y\) terms together, then complete the square for both variables to express the equation in the form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).

[IMP]  
Starting with the given equation:  
\(x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20\)  

Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:  
\(x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 6y + 20 = 0\)  

Group the \(x\) and \(y\) terms:  
\((x^2 - 8x) + (y^2 + 6y) + 20 = 0\)  

Complete the square for \(x\):  
\(x^2 - 8x\) needs \((-8/2)^2 = 16\) to complete the square.  
So, \(x^2 - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16\).  

Complete the square for \(y\):  
\(y^2 + 6y\) needs \((6/2)^2 = 9\) to complete the square.  
So, \(y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9\).  

Substitute back into the equation:  
\((x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + 20 = 0\)  

Simplify the constants: \(-16 - 9 + 20 = -5\), so:  
\((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 5 = 0\)  

Thus:  
\((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\)  

The equation is now in standard form.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify the center of the circle from the standard form equation.  
Description: Using the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), I will extract the values of \(h\) and \(k\) from the rewritten equation \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the equation \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5\), I can see that:  
\(h = 4\) (since it's \(x - 4\)), and  
\(k = -3\) (since it's \(y + 3\), which is \(y - (-3)\)).  

Therefore, the center of the circle is the point \((4, -3)\).

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find \(x + y\) where \((x, y)\) is the center of the circle given by \(x^2 + y^2 = 8x - 6y - 20\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation into standard form (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((h, k)\) from the standard form (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \(x + y\) which is \(h + k\) (Current Goal).  

Current Goal: Calculate \(x + y\) using the values of the center coordinates.

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate \(x + y\) using the center coordinates.  
Description: I will add the \(x\) and \(y\) values of the center point \((4, -3)\) to find \(x + y\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The center of the circle is \((4, -3)\), so:  
\(x = 4\),  
\(y = -3\).  

Therefore, \(x + y = 4 + (-3) = 1\).  

The final answer is \(1\).
