**Problem Statement**: Find all solutions to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the cube root to simplify the equation.  
2. Solve the resulting linear equation for \(x\).  
3. Verify the solution(s) by substituting back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to eliminate the cube root in \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\). To achieve this, cube both sides of the equation to remove the cube root, then simplify the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Cube both sides of the equation:  
\(\left(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}}\right)^3 = (-3)^3\)  
This gives:  
\(2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the linear equation \(2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27\) for \(x\). Isolate \(x\) by performing algebraic operations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:  
\(2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27\)  
Subtract 2 from both sides:  
\(-\frac{x}{2} = -29\)  
Multiply both sides by -2:  
\(x = 58\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(x = 58\) by substituting it back into the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\). Check if the left-hand side equals the right-hand side.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = 58\) into the original equation:  
\(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{58}{2}} = \sqrt[3]{2 - 29} = \sqrt[3]{-27}\)  
Since \(\sqrt[3]{-27} = -3\), the equation holds:  
\(-3 = -3\)  
The solution \(x = 58\) is valid.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the cube root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting linear equation (completed, solution \(x = 58\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, \(x = 58\) is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm if there are other solutions or finalize the solution set.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm if there are other solutions to the equation. Analyze the function \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}}\) to determine if multiple solutions are possible, considering the cube root’s properties.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The cube root function \(y = \sqrt[3]{u}\) is one-to-one (injective), meaning each output \(y\) corresponds to exactly one input \(u\). Here, \(u = 2 - \frac{x}{2}\), and the equation requires \(\sqrt[3]{u} = -3\). Since the cube root is strictly increasing, there is only one \(u\) such that \(\sqrt[3]{u} = -3\), which we found as \(u = -27\). Solving \(2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27\) yielded \(x = 58\). No other real values of \(x\) can satisfy the equation, as the cube root’s monotonicity ensures a unique solution.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the cube root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting linear equation (completed, solution \(x = 58\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, \(x = 58\) is valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm uniqueness of the solution (completed, only one solution exists).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution set.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The only solution to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\) is \(x = 58\).
