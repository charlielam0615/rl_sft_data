**Problem Statement**: Find all solutions to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides.  
2. Solve the resulting linear equation for \(x\).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the cube root to simplify the equation.  
How to Achieve: Cube both sides of the equation to remove the cube root, resulting in a linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3
\]  
Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:  
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}}\right)^3 = (-3)^3
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the linear equation for \(x\).  
How to Achieve: Isolate \(x\) by performing algebraic operations on the equation \(2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the equation from the previous step:  
\[
2 - \frac{x}{2} = -27
\]  
Subtract 2 from both sides:  
\[
-\frac{x}{2} = -29
\]  
Multiply both sides by -2 to solve for \(x\):  
\[
x = 58
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \(x = 58\) satisfies the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 58\) into the original equation and check if the left-hand side equals the right-hand side.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 58\) into the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\):  
\[
2 - \frac{58}{2} = 2 - 29 = -27
\]  
\[
\sqrt[3]{-27} = \sqrt[3]{(-3)^3} = -3
\]  
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, so \(x = 58\) is a valid solution.  
Since the cube root function is one-to-one (injective) and defined for all real numbers, there are no other solutions to consider.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting linear equation for \(x\) (completed, \(x = 58\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, \(x = 58\) is valid).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution process, as all subgoals are completed.  
The solution to the equation is \(x = 58\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The only solution to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{2 - \frac{x}{2}} = -3\) is \(x = 58\).
