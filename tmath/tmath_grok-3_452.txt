**Problem Restatement**: June and Julia live 1 mile apart, and it takes June 4 minutes to ride her bike directly to Julia's house. We need to determine how many minutes it would take June to ride 3.5 miles to Bernard's house at the same rate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve this problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Calculate June's biking speed using the given distance and time.  
2. Use the speed to find the time required to ride 3.5 miles.  
3. Verify the solution for accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate June's biking speed. This can be achieved by dividing the distance (1 mile) by the time (4 minutes) to find the speed in miles per minute.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
June rides 1 mile in 4 minutes.  
Speed = Distance / Time = 1 mile / 4 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time to ride 3.5 miles. This can be achieved by dividing the distance (3.5 miles) by the speed (0.25 miles per minute) to find the time in minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time = Distance / Speed = 3.5 miles / 0.25 miles per minute = 3.5 * 4 = 14 minutes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution. This can be achieved by checking if the calculated time is consistent with the given rate and ensuring no computational errors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, confirm the speed: 1 mile / 4 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute.  
For 3.5 miles: 3.5 miles * (4 minutes / 1 mile) = 14 minutes.  
The calculation is consistent, and the units cancel appropriately (miles / (miles/minute) = minutes).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the time for June to ride 3.5 miles to Bernard's house.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate June's biking speed (completed: 0.25 miles per minute).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time to ride 3.5 miles (completed: 14 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: calculation is consistent).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the time to ride 3.5 miles is calculated and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: It would take June 14 minutes to ride 3.5 miles to Bernard's house.
