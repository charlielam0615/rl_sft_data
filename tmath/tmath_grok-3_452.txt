**Problem Statement**: June and Julia live 1 mile apart, and it takes June 4 minutes to ride her bike directly to Julia's house. We need to determine how many minutes it would take June to ride 3.5 miles to Bernard's house at the same rate.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward SubgoalingISMO: Planning  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals: calculate June's biking speed using the given distance and time, then use that speed to find the time required to bike 3.5 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to calculate June's biking speed. Use the distance (1 mile) and time (4 minutes) to find the speed in miles per minute.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
June rides 1 mile in 4 minutes.  
Speed = Distance / Time = 1 mile / 4 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to calculate the time to ride 3.5 miles. Use the speed (0.25 miles per minute) and the distance (3.5 miles) to find the time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time = Distance / Speed = 3.5 miles / 0.25 miles per minute = 14 minutes.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Verify the calculation by checking the logic and math to ensure the time to ride 3.5 miles is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
June’s speed is 0.25 miles per minute (1 mile / 4 minutes). For 3.5 miles:  
Time = 3.5 miles / 0.25 miles per minute = 3.5 × 4 = 14 minutes.  
The calculation is consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the time for June to ride 3.5 miles to Bernard’s house.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate June’s biking speed (completed: 0.25 miles per minute).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time to ride 3.5 miles (completed: 14 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: verified).  
**Current Goal**: Provide the final answer.  
The calculations are complete, and the answer is 14 minutes.
