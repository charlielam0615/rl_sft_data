### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect, given that \( f \) is an invertible function defined for all real \( x \). The graphs intersect at points where \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \), and we must find how many such points exist.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, we need to find the points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect. This occurs when \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, we can use the property that \( f(a) = f(b) \) implies \( a = b \). Let’s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) and use the invertibility of \( f \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation to find all possible \( x \)-values.  
3. Verify that these solutions correspond to intersection points on the graphs.  
4. Consider whether the nature of \( f \) (e.g., specific forms or general properties) affects the number of solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the equation \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) to find the \( x \)-values where the graphs intersect.  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( f \) is invertible, if \( f(a) = f(b) \), then \( a = b \). Apply this to \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) to obtain \( x^2 = x^4 \). Solve this equation to find the intersection points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \), since \( f \) is invertible, we have:  
\[ x^2 = x^4 \]  
Rewrite the equation:  
\[ x^4 - x^2 = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ x^2 (x^2 - 1) = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 (x - 1)(x + 1) = 0 \]  
The solutions are:  
\[ x^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 0, \quad x = 1, \quad x = -1 \]  
These \( x \)-values (\( x = 0, 1, -1 \)) are where \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \). Each solution corresponds to a point of intersection on the graphs, with \( y \)-coordinate given by \( y = f(x^2) = f(x^4) \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the solutions \( x = 0, 1, -1 \) are valid intersection points and check for any additional solutions or dependencies on the function \( f \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the solutions back into the equation to confirm they satisfy \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \). Also, analyze whether the invertibility of \( f \) or the nature of the graphs introduces additional considerations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let’s verify each solution:  
- For \( x = 0 \):  
  \[ x^2 = 0, \quad x^4 = 0 \]  
  \[ f(x^2) = f(0), \quad f(x^4) = f(0) \]  
  \[ f(0) = f(0) \]  
  This is true, so \( x = 0 \) gives an intersection point at \( (0, f(0)) \).  
- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ x^2 = 1, \quad x^4 = 1 \]  
  \[ f(x^2) = f(1), \quad f(x^4) = f(1) \]  
  \[ f(1) = f(1) \]  
  This is true, so \( x = 1 \) gives an intersection point at \( (1, f(1)) \).  
- For \( x = -1 \):  
  \[ x^2 = 1, \quad x^4 = 1 \]  
  \[ f(x^2) = f(1), \quad f(x^4) = f(1) \]  
  \[ f(1) = f(1) \]  
  This is true, so \( x = -1 \) gives an intersection point at \( (-1, f(1)) \).  

Next, we check if these are distinct points. The points are:  
- \( x = 0 \): \( (0, f(0)) \)  
- \( x = 1 \): \( (1, f(1)) \)  
- \( x = -1 \): \( (-1, f(1)) \)  

Since \( f \) is a function, \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \) are not necessarily equal unless specified. The points \( (1, f(1)) \) and \( (-1, f(1)) \) have the same \( y \)-coordinate but different \( x \)-coordinates, so they are distinct. The point \( (0, f(0)) \) has a different \( y \)-coordinate unless \( f(0) = f(1) \), but even if \( f(0) = f(1) \), the \( x \)-coordinates differ. Thus, we have three distinct points unless \( f \) has specific properties (e.g., constant function, but invertibility implies \( f \) is one-to-one, so it cannot be constant).

To ensure no other solutions exist, note that \( x^2 = x^4 \) is a polynomial equation of degree 4, which has at most 4 roots. Since \( x^4 - x^2 = x^2 (x^2 - 1) \), and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), the real roots are fully captured by \( x = 0, 1, -1 \). The invertibility of \( f \) ensures that \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) if and only if \( x^2 = x^4 \).  

Let’s consider the nature of \( f \). Since \( f \) is invertible, it is one-to-one, and no additional intersections arise from \( f \) mapping different inputs to the same output. To test generality, consider example functions:  
- If \( f(x) = x \), then \( y = f(x^2) = x^2 \), \( y = f(x^4) = x^4 \). Intersections occur when \( x^2 = x^4 \), yielding \( x = 0, 1, -1 \), with points \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 1) \), \( (-1, 1) \).  
- If \( f(x) = e^x \), then \( y = f(x^2) = e^{x^2} \), \( y = f(x^4) = e^{x^4} \). Intersections occur when \( e^{x^2} = e^{x^4} \), so \( x^2 = x^4 \), again yielding \( x = 0, 1, -1 \).  

The number of solutions depends only on \( x^2 = x^4 \), not on the specific form of \( f \), as long as \( f \) is invertible. Thus, there are exactly three intersection points.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Determine the number of points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) and use the invertibility of \( f \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation \( x^2 = x^4 \) to find all possible \( x \)-values. (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify that the solutions correspond to valid and distinct intersection points. (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 4: Check if the nature of \( f \) affects the number of solutions. (Completed in Step 3)  

**Current Goal**: Since all subgoals are completed, the current goal is to finalize the answer based on the completed steps. The solution indicates three intersection points at \( x = 0, 1, -1 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Double-check the solution to ensure no solutions were missed and confirm the number of intersection points is independent of the specific invertible function \( f \).  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the equation \( x^2 = x^4 \), consider the graphical interpretation of the intersection points, and test with another function to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate \( x^2 = x^4 \):  
\[ x^4 - x^2 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 (x^2 - 1) = 0 \]  
\[ x = 0, 1, -1 \]  
This confirms the solutions from Step 2. Graphically, the functions \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect where their \( y \)-values are equal for the same \( x \). Since \( x^2 \) and \( x^4 \) are both non-negative and \( x^4 \) grows faster than \( x^2 \), we analyze their equality at \( x^2 = x^4 \), which we’ve solved.

To further confirm, test with another invertible function, e.g., \( f(x) = x^3 \):  
- \( y = f(x^2) = (x^2)^3 = x^6 \)  
- \( y = f(x^4) = (x^4)^3 = x^{12} \)  
Intersections occur when:  
\[ x^6 = x^{12} \]  
\[ x^{12} - x^6 = 0 \]  
\[ x^6 (x^6 - 1) = 0 \]  
\[ x^6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^6 = 1 \]  
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^6 = 1 \]  
Since \( x^6 = 1 \) implies \( x^2 = 1 \) (because \( (x^2)^3 = 1 \)), we get:  
\[ x^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm 1 \]  
Thus, \( x = 0, 1, -1 \), consistent with previous results. The points are \( (0, f(0)) = (0, 0) \), \( (1, f(1)) = (1, 1) \), \( (-1, f(1)) = (-1, 1) \), all distinct.

The graphical perspective reinforces that \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) only at \( x^2 = x^4 \), and since \( f \) is one-to-one, no additional intersections arise. The polynomial \( x^4 - x^2 \) has exactly three real roots, confirming the solution is complete.

### Final Answer
The graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect at exactly **three points**, corresponding to \( x = 0, 1, -1 \).
