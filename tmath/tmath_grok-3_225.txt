### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect for a function \( f(x) \) that is defined for all real \( x \) and is invertible (i.e., \( f^{-1}(x) \) exists for all \( x \) in the range of \( f \)). The points of intersection occur where \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \).

### Step 1: Understand the condition for intersection
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To find the number of points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect, we need to identify the points \( (x, y) \) where \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \). This implies solving the equation \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(a) = f(b) \) implies \( a = b \). Thus, we need to solve \( x^2 = x^4 \).

### Step 2: Solve the equation for intersection points
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( x^2 = x^4 \) to find the \( x \)-coordinates of the intersection points. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \) implies \( x^2 = x^4 \). We will solve this equation algebraically to find all possible \( x \)-values.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the equation:
\[ x^2 = x^4 \]
Rearrange to bring all terms to one side:
\[ x^4 - x^2 = 0 \]
Factorize:
\[ x^2 (x^2 - 1) = 0 \]
\[ x^2 (x - 1)(x + 1) = 0 \]
Solve for \( x \):
\[ x^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0 \]
\[ x = 0, \quad x = 1, \quad x = -1 \]

These are the potential \( x \)-coordinates where the graphs intersect. To find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates, evaluate \( y = f(x^2) \) (or equivalently \( y = f(x^4) \), since \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \)) at each \( x \):
- For \( x = 0 \): \( x^2 = 0 \), so \( y = f(0) \). Point: \( (0, f(0)) \).
- For \( x = 1 \): \( x^2 = 1 \), so \( y = f(1) \). Point: \( (1, f(1)) \).
- For \( x = -1 \): \( x^2 = 1 \), so \( y = f(1) \). Point: \( (-1, f(1)) \).

### Step 3: Verify the number of distinct intersection points
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the points \( (0, f(0)) \), \( (1, f(1)) \), and \( (-1, f(1)) \) are distinct and represent all intersection points. We need to check if any points coincide (i.e., have the same \( (x, y) \)-coordinates) and confirm that no other solutions exist.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Examine the points:
- \( (0, f(0)) \): The \( y \)-coordinate is \( f(0) \).
- \( (1, f(1)) \): The \( y \)-coordinate is \( f(1) \).
- \( (-1, f(1)) \): The \( y \)-coordinate is also \( f(1) \).

Check if points coincide:
- The points \( (1, f(1)) \) and \( (-1, f(1)) \) have the same \( y \)-coordinate but different \( x \)-coordinates (\( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \)), so they are distinct.
- The point \( (0, f(0)) \) has a different \( x \)-coordinate (\( x = 0 \)). It coincides with \( (1, f(1)) \) or \( (-1, f(1)) \) only if \( f(0) = f(1) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(0) = f(1) \) implies \( 0 = 1 \), which is impossible. Thus, \( f(0) \neq f(1) \), and \( (0, f(0)) \) is distinct from the other two points.

Confirm all solutions:
The equation \( x^4 - x^2 = 0 \) is a fourth-degree polynomial with roots \( x = 0, 1, -1 \). Since \( x^2 = x^4 \) implies \( x^4 - x^2 = 0 \), and we have factored and solved it completely, these are all the real solutions.

Thus, there are three distinct intersection points: \( (0, f(0)) \), \( (1, f(1)) \), and \( (-1, f(1)) \).

### Step 4: Organize and confirm the goal hierarchy
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Determine the number of points where the graphs of \( y = f(x^2) \) and \( y = f(x^4) \) intersect.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Solve \( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \), which reduces to \( x^2 = x^4 \).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Find the \( x \)-coordinates by solving \( x^4 - x^2 = 0 \).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Verify that the intersection points are distinct and complete.
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the number of distinct intersection points.

Based on the previous steps, we solved \( x^2 = x^4 \), found \( x = 0, 1, -1 \), and verified that the points \( (0, f(0)) \), \( (1, f(1)) \), and \( (-1, f(1)) \) are distinct due to the invertibility of \( f \). The current goal is achieved, and the number of intersection points is three.
