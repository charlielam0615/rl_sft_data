**Problem Restatement**: Find the sum of all integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Identify the sequence of integers from \(-30\) to \(50\).  
2. Determine the number of terms in the sequence.  
3. Use an appropriate method (e.g., arithmetic series formula) to calculate the sum.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the sequence and confirm it is an arithmetic sequence. This will be achieved by listing the first few and last few terms and checking the common difference.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence of integers from \(-30\) to \(50\) is: \(-30, -29, -28, \ldots, 48, 49, 50\).  
To confirm itâ€™s an arithmetic sequence, check the common difference:  
- \((-29) - (-30) = 1\), \((-28) - (-29) = 1\), and so on, up to \(50 - 49 = 1\).  
The common difference is \(1\), so this is an arithmetic sequence with:  
- First term \(a_1 = -30\),  
- Last term \(a_n = 50\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of terms in the sequence. This will be achieved by using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence or by counting the inclusive range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For an arithmetic sequence, the \(n\)-th term is given by:  
\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), where \(a_1 = -30\), \(a_n = 50\), \(d = 1\).  
Set up the equation:  
\(50 = -30 + (n-1) \cdot 1\)  
\(50 = -30 + n - 1\)  
\(50 = n - 31\)  
\(n = 81\).  
Alternatively, count inclusively: \(50 - (-30) + 1 = 50 + 30 + 1 = 81\).  
The sequence has \(81\) terms.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the sequence using the arithmetic series formula. This will be achieved by applying the formula \(S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\), where \(n = 81\), \(a_1 = -30\), \(a_n = 50\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of an arithmetic series is:  
\(S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\).  
Substitute the known values:  
\(S_{81} = \frac{81}{2}(-30 + 50)\).  
Simplify:  
\(-30 + 50 = 20\),  
\(S_{81} = \frac{81}{2} \cdot 20 = 81 \cdot 10 = 810\).  
The sum is \(810\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the sum by using an alternative method, such as pairing terms or splitting the sequence into negative and non-negative parts. This ensures the correctness of the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Split the sequence into:  
- Negative integers: \(-30\) to \(-1\),  
- Non-negative integers: \(0\) to \(50\).  

For \(-30\) to \(-1\):  
Number of terms: \(-1 - (-30) + 1 = 30\).  
Sum using the formula:  
\(S = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \frac{30}{2}(-30 + (-1)) = 15 \cdot (-31) = -465\).  

For \(0\) to \(50\):  
Number of terms: \(50 - 0 + 1 = 51\).  
Sum:  
\(S = \frac{51}{2}(0 + 50) = \frac{51 \cdot 50}{2} = 51 \cdot 25 = 1275\).  

Total sum:  
\(-465 + 1275 = 810\).  

This matches the previous result, confirming the sum is correct.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of integers from \(-30\) to \(50\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the sequence (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of terms (completed, \(n = 81\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum (completed, sum = \(810\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the sum (completed, confirmed via alternative method).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the problem is solved.  
The main goal has been achieved, and all subgoals are completed.

**Final Answer**: The sum of the integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive, is \(810\).
