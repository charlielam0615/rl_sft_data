### Problem Statement
We need to find the sum of all integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive. This is an arithmetic series where the first term is \(-30\), the last term is \(50\), and the common difference is \(1\). We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of terms in the series from \(-30\) to \(50\).  
2. Identify the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.  
3. Apply the formula using the first term, last term, and number of terms.  
4. Compute the final sum.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of terms in the series from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive. To achieve this, subtract the first term from the last term, add \(1\) to account for inclusivity, and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the number of terms \(n\), use the formula for the number of integers from \(a\) to \(b\), inclusive:  
\[ n = b - a + 1 \]  
Here, \(a = -30\) and \(b = 50\).  
\[ n = 50 - (-30) + 1 = 50 + 30 + 1 = 81 \]  
So, there are \(81\) terms in the series.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This can be achieved by recalling the standard formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series with the first term \(a_1\) and last term \(a_n\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The sum \(S_n\) of an arithmetic series with \(n\) terms, first term \(a_1\), and last term \(a_n\) is given by:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \]  
This formula will be used in the next step to compute the sum.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of terms (completed: \(n = 81\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the sum formula (completed: \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final sum (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Apply the formula using the first term, last term, and number of terms.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the sum formula using the number of terms (\(n = 81\)), first term (\(a_1 = -30\)), and last term (\(a_n = 50\)). Substitute these values into the formula \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\) and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the formula \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\):  
\[ S_n = \frac{81}{2} ((-30) + 50) \]  
First, compute the sum of the first and last terms:  
\[ -30 + 50 = 20 \]  
Then:  
\[ S_n = \frac{81}{2} \cdot 20 = 81 \cdot 10 = 810 \]  
The sum is \(810\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed sum (\(810\)) by using an alternative method to ensure correctness. This can be done by applying the arithmetic series sum formula based on the first term and common difference.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
An alternative formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d] \]  
where \(d\) is the common difference. Here, \(a_1 = -30\), \(n = 81\), and \(d = 1\).  
Compute:  
\[ 2a_1 = 2 \cdot (-30) = -60 \]  
\[ n-1 = 81-1 = 80 \]  
\[ (n-1)d = 80 \cdot 1 = 80 \]  
\[ 2a_1 + (n-1)d = -60 + 80 = 20 \]  
\[ S_n = \frac{81}{2} \cdot 20 = 81 \cdot 10 = 810 \]  
This matches the previous result, confirming the sum is \(810\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Review the goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are completed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the number of terms (completed: \(n = 81\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the sum formula (completed: \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula (completed: sum = \(810\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final sum (completed: sum = \(810\)).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed. The final sum is \(810\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The sum of the integers from \(-30\) to \(50\), inclusive, is \(\boxed{810}\).
