**Problem Statement**: Find the inverse of the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the inverse of \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Understand the process of finding an inverse function.
2. Set up the equation by swapping \( x \) and \( y \).
3. Solve for \( y \) to express the inverse function.
4. Verify the solution by checking if the composition of the function and its inverse yields the identity function.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up the equation for the inverse by swapping \( x \) and \( y \).
Description: Replace \( f(x) \) with \( y \), then swap \( x \) and \( y \) to form the equation \( x = 4 - 5y \), which will be solved for \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the function \( y = 4 - 5x \). To find the inverse, swap \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ x = 4 - 5y \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( x = 4 - 5y \) for \( y \).
Description: Isolate \( y \) by performing algebraic operations to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[ x = 4 - 5y \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ x - 4 = -5y \]
Divide both sides by \(-5\):
\[ y = \frac{x - 4}{-5} \]
Simplify:
\[ y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{4}{5} \]
Thus, the inverse function is:
\[ f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{4}{5} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the inverse function by checking if \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).
Description: Compute the compositions of the original function and the inverse to confirm they yield the identity function.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \):
\[ f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left(-\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{4}{5}\right) = 4 - 5\left(-\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{4}{5}\right) \]
\[ = 4 - 5\left(-\frac{1}{5}x\right) - 5\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \]
\[ = 4 + x - 4 = x \]
This holds.

Verify \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \):
\[ f(x) = 4 - 5x \]
\[ f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(4 - 5x) = -\frac{1}{5}(4 - 5x) + \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ = -\frac{4}{5} + x + \frac{4}{5} = x \]
This also holds.

The inverse function is correct.
