**Problem Statement**: Find the inverse of the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the inverse of \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Verify that the function is one-to-one to ensure the inverse exists.
2. Set up the equation by replacing \( f(x) \) with \( y \), i.e., \( y = 4 - 5x \).
3. Swap \( x \) and \( y \) to form \( x = 4 - 5y \).
4. Solve for \( y \) to express the inverse function.
5. Verify the inverse by checking if \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).
6. Express the inverse in function notation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \) is one-to-one.
How to Achieve: A function is one-to-one if it is either strictly increasing or decreasing. Compute the derivative of \( f(x) \) to determine its monotonicity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute the derivative of \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \):
\[ f'(x) = -5 \]
Since \( f'(x) = -5 < 0 \) for all \( x \), the function is strictly decreasing, hence one-to-one, and an inverse exists.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up the equation and swap variables to find the inverse.
How to Achieve: Replace \( f(x) \) with \( y \), write \( y = 4 - 5x \), then swap \( x \) and \( y \) to get \( x = 4 - 5y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:
\[ y = 4 - 5x \]
Swap \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ x = 4 - 5y \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve for \( y \) in the equation \( x = 4 - 5y \).
How to Achieve: Isolate \( y \) by performing algebraic operations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve:
\[ x = 4 - 5y \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ x - 4 = -5y \]
Divide by \(-5\):
\[ y = \frac{x - 4}{-5} = -\frac{x - 4}{5} = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
So, the inverse is:
\[ y = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the inverse by checking \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \) into \( f(x) \) and vice versa, and simplify to confirm both equalities hold.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
1. Compute \( f(f^{-1}(x)) \):
\[ f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left(-\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5}\right) = 4 - 5\left(-\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5}\right) \]
\[ = 4 - 5\left(-\frac{x}{5}\right) - 5\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = 4 + x - 4 = x \]

2. Compute \( f^{-1}(f(x)) \):
\[ f(x) = 4 - 5x \]
\[ f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(4 - 5x) = -\frac{(4 - 5x)}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ = -\frac{4}{5} + x + \frac{4}{5} = x \]

Both checks confirm the inverse is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation \( y = 4 - 5x \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Swap \( x \) and \( y \) to get \( x = 4 - 5y \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for \( y \) to get \( y = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the inverse (completed: both compositions yield \( x \)).
  - Subgoal 6: Express the inverse in function notation (pending).
Current Goal: Express the inverse in function notation.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express the inverse in function notation.
How to Achieve: Use the result \( y = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \) and write it as \( f^{-1}(x) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The inverse function is:
\[ f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The inverse of \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \) is:
\[ f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{x}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \]
