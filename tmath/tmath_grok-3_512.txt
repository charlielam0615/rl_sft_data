### Problem Restatement
Find the sum of the two solutions to the quadratic equation \( 54 - 15x - x^2 = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( 54 - 15x - x^2 = 0 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
2. Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
3. Use the sum of roots formula for a quadratic equation, which is \( -\frac{b}{a} \).
4. Compute the sum of the roots.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form and identify coefficients.
Description: Rearrange \( 54 - 15x - x^2 = 0 \) to the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), then extract the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the equation:
\[ 54 - 15x - x^2 = 0 \]
Move all terms to one side and arrange in standard form:
\[ -x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0 \]
Multiply through by \(-1\) to make the leading coefficient positive:
\[ x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \]

Identify the coefficients:
- \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \))
- \( b = 15 \) (coefficient of \( x \))
- \( c = -54 \) (constant term)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum of the roots using the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \).
Description: Use the coefficients \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \) to calculate the sum of the roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:
\[ -\frac{b}{a} \]

Substitute the coefficients:
\[ -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{15}{1} = -15 \]

Thus, the sum of the two solutions is \(-15\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the sum of the roots.
Description: Solve the quadratic equation explicitly to find the roots, sum them, and confirm the result matches \(-15\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve \( x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = -54 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-54) = 225 + 216 = 441 \]

Compute the roots:
\[ x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-15 \pm 21}{2} \]

Roots are:
\[ x_1 = \frac{-15 + 21}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{-15 - 21}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \]

Sum of the roots:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = 3 + (-18) = -15 \]

The sum matches the result from the formula, confirming the solution.
