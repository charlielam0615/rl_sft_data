**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of the two solutions to the quadratic equation \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the sum of the solutions into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
2. Identify the method to find the solutions (e.g., quadratic formula).  
3. Calculate the sum of the solutions using the properties of quadratic equations.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
How to Achieve: Rearrange the given equation \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\) to the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) by reordering terms and adjusting signs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\):  
Move all terms to one side and arrange in standard form:  
\(-x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0\).  
Multiply through by \(-1\) to make the leading coefficient positive:  
\(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\).  
The equation is now in standard form: \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 15\), \(c = -54\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the equation is correctly rewritten in standard form.  
How to Achieve: Check that the rewritten equation is equivalent to the original by expanding and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Original equation: \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\).  
Rewritten equation: \(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\).  
Multiply the rewritten equation by \(-1\):  
\(-x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0\).  
Rearrange: \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\), which matches the original equation.  
The rewritten form is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\).  
How to Achieve: Use the property of quadratic equations that the sum of the roots is \(-b/a\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are coefficients from the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the equation \(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\), identify coefficients:  
- \(a = 1\) (coefficient of \(x^2\)),  
- \(b = 15\) (coefficient of \(x\)).  
The sum of the solutions (roots) is given by:  
\[
\text{Sum} = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{15}{1} = -15.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the sum of the solutions.  
How to Achieve: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to find the roots, then compute their sum to confirm it matches \(-15\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\), use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 15\), \(c = -54\).  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-54) = 225 + 216 = 441.
\]  
Find the roots:  
\[
x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-15 \pm 21}{2}.
\]  
- First root: \(x_1 = \frac{-15 + 21}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\).  
- Second root: \(x_2 = \frac{-15 - 21}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18\).  
Sum of the roots: \(3 + (-18) = -15\).  
This matches the sum calculated using \(-b/a = -15\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the two solutions to \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed: \(x^2 + 15x - 54 = 0\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of the solutions (completed: sum = \(-15\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the sum by solving for the roots (completed: roots are \(3\) and \(-18\), sum = \(-15\)).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as the sum has been calculated and verified.

**Final Answer**: The sum of the two solutions to the equation \(54 - 15x - x^2 = 0\) is \(-15\).
