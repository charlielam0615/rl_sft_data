**Problem Statement**: A ball is dropped from a height of 243 cm and bounces back up to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from which it falls after each bounce. We need to determine after how many bounces the ball first rises to a height less than 30 cm.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:
1. Model the ball's bounce height as a function of the number of bounces.
2. Set up an inequality to find when the bounce height is less than 30 cm.
3. Solve for the number of bounces.
4. Validate the solution to ensure it meets the condition of being the first bounce under 30 cm.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Model the ball's bounce height as a function of the number of bounces.
How to Achieve: The initial drop is from 243 cm. After each bounce, the height is multiplied by \(\frac{2}{3}\). Thus, after \(n\) bounces, the height is \(243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The height after \(n\) bounces can be expressed as:
\[
h_n = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n
\]
This geometric sequence represents the height the ball reaches after each bounce.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up an inequality to find when the bounce height is less than 30 cm.
How to Achieve: Using the height formula \(h_n = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\), set up the inequality \(243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < 30\) and solve for \(n\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Set up the inequality:
\[
243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < 30
\]
Divide both sides by 243:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < \frac{30}{243}
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{30}{243} = \frac{30 \div 3}{243 \div 3} = \frac{10}{81}
\]
So:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < \frac{10}{81}
\]
To solve for \(n\), take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
n \cdot \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) < \ln\left(\frac{10}{81}\right)
\]
Since \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln(2) - \ln(3) \approx 0.693 - 1.099 = -0.406\), and \(\frac{10}{81} \approx 0.123456\), we have \(\ln\left(\frac{10}{81}\right) \approx \ln(0.123456) \approx -2.092\). Thus:
\[
n \cdot (-0.406) < -2.092
\]
Since the natural log of a number less than 1 is negative, divide both sides by \(-0.406\), reversing the inequality:
\[
n > \frac{-2.092}{-0.406} \approx 5.153
\]
Since \(n\) must be an integer (representing the number of bounces), test \(n = 6\), as it is the smallest integer greater than 5.153.

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate that \(n = 6\) is the first bounce where the height is less than 30 cm.
How to Achieve: Calculate the height after 5 and 6 bounces to confirm that \(n = 6\) is the first time the height falls below 30 cm.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Calculate the height after 5 bounces:
\[
h_5 = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 = 243 \cdot \frac{32}{243} = 32
\]
Since \(32 > 30\), the height after 5 bounces is above 30 cm.
Calculate the height after 6 bounces:
\[
h_6 = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6 = 243 \cdot \frac{64}{729} = \frac{243 \cdot 64}{729} = \frac{15552}{729} \approx 21.33
\]
Since \(21.33 < 30\), the height after 6 bounces is below 30 cm.
Thus, \(n = 6\) is the first bounce where the height is less than 30 cm.
