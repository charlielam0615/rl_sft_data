### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of bounces after which a ball, dropped from a height of 243 cm and bouncing back to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height, first rises to less than 30 cm.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  

- Subgoal 1: Model the ball’s bounce height as a function of the number of bounces.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up an inequality to find when the bounce height is less than 30 cm.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve for the number of bounces that satisfies the inequality.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution to ensure it’s the first bounce below 30 cm.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Model the ball’s bounce height as a function of the number of bounces.  
- **How to Achieve**: The initial height is 243 cm, and each bounce reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the previous height. This forms a geometric sequence where the height after \(n\) bounces is \(243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The ball is dropped from 243 cm, so the height after the first bounce (bounce 1) is:  
\[ h_1 = 243 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 162 \text{ cm}. \]  
After the second bounce, the height is:  
\[ h_2 = 162 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2. \]  
Generalizing, the height after \(n\) bounces is:  
\[ h_n = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n. \]  
This formula represents the height the ball reaches after the \(n\)-th bounce.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up an inequality to find when the bounce height is less than 30 cm.  
- **How to Achieve**: Using the height formula \(h_n = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\), solve the inequality \(243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < 30\) for the smallest integer \(n\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set up the inequality:  
\[ 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < 30. \]  
Divide both sides by 243:  
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n < \frac{30}{243} = \frac{10}{81}. \]  
Since \(\frac{2}{3} < 1\), the left side decreases as \(n\) increases. Take the natural logarithm to solve for \(n\):  
\[ n \cdot \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) < \ln\left(\frac{10}{81}\right). \]  
Note that \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln 2 - \ln 3 < 0\), so divide both sides by \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\) and reverse the inequality:  
\[ n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{10}{81}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}. \]  
Calculate approximately:  
- \(\frac{10}{81} \approx 0.123457\), so \(\ln\left(\frac{10}{81}\right) \approx \ln(0.123457) \approx -2.092\).  
- \(\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667\), so \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx \ln(0.6667) \approx -0.4055\).  
- Thus:  
\[ n > \frac{-2.092}{-0.4055} \approx 5.158. \]  
Since \(n\) is the number of bounces (a positive integer), test \(n = 6\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check if \(n = 6\) is the first bounce where the height is less than 30 cm.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute the height for \(n = 5\) and \(n = 6\) using \(h_n = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\) and confirm that \(h_5 \geq 30\) and \(h_6 < 30\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the height after 5 bounces:  
\[ h_5 = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 = 243 \cdot \frac{32}{243} = 32 \text{ cm}. \]  
Since \(32 \geq 30\), the height after 5 bounces is not less than 30 cm.  

Calculate the height after 6 bounces:  
\[ h_6 = 243 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6 = 243 \cdot \frac{64}{729} = 32 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{64}{3} \approx 21.333 \text{ cm}. \]  
Since \(21.333 < 30\), the height after 6 bounces is less than 30 cm.  

Thus, \(n = 6\) is the first bounce where the height is less than 30 cm.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine after how many bounces the ball rises less than 30 cm.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the ball’s bounce height as a function of the number of bounces. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an inequality to find when the bounce height is less than 30 cm. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the number of bounces that satisfies the inequality. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution to ensure it’s the first bounce below 30 cm. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  

The solution indicates that after 6 bounces, the ball first rises less than 30 cm.

### Final Answer
The ball first rises less than 30 cm after **6 bounces**.
