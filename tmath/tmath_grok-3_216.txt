### Problem Statement
We need to determine the range of the function \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) and express it in interval notation. The range is the set of all possible output values \( y \) that \( r(x) \) can produce as \( x \) varies over its domain.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the range:  
1. Determine the domain of \( r(x) \).  
2. Analyze the behavior of \( r(x) \) over its domain to identify all possible output values.  
3. Express the range in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the domain of \( r(x) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify values of \( x \) for which \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) is defined by checking where the denominator is non-zero.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The function \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) is undefined when the denominator \( (1-x)^2 = 0 \), which occurs when \( 1-x = 0 \), i.e., \( x = 1 \). Thus, the domain is all real numbers except \( x = 1 \), or in interval notation, \( (-\infty, 1) \cup (1, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Analyze the behavior of \( r(x) \) to find all possible output values.  
**How to Achieve**: Evaluate \( r(x) \) over its domain, considering limits, critical points, and the function’s behavior to determine the set of \( y \)-values produced.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \), and the denominator \( (1-x)^2 \) is always positive for \( x \neq 1 \), we have \( r(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \) in the domain. Let’s explore the output values:

- **As \( x \to 1^- \) (approaching 1 from the left)**:  
  \( 1-x > 0 \), but \( 1-x \to 0^+ \), so \( (1-x)^2 \to 0^+ \), and \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \to +\infty \).

- **As \( x \to 1^+ \) (approaching 1 from the right)**:  
  \( 1-x < 0 \), but \( (1-x)^2 \to 0^+ \), so \( r(x) \to +\infty \).

- **As \( x \to \pm \infty \)**:  
  If \( x \to +\infty \), \( 1-x \to -\infty \), so \( (1-x)^2 \to +\infty \), and \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \to 0^+ \).  
  If \( x \to -\infty \), \( 1-x \to +\infty \), so \( (1-x)^2 \to +\infty \), and \( r(x) \to 0^+ \).

- **Test values to understand behavior**:  
  - At \( x = 0 \): \( r(0) = \frac{1}{(1-0)^2} = 1 \).  
  - At \( x = 2 \): \( r(2) = \frac{1}{(1-2)^2} = \frac{1}{(-1)^2} = 1 \).  
  - At \( x = 0.5 \): \( r(0.5) = \frac{1}{(1-0.5)^2} = \frac{1}{(0.5)^2} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).  
  - At \( x = 1.5 \): \( r(1.5) = \frac{1}{(1-1.5)^2} = \frac{1}{(-0.5)^2} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).

To find the range, solve \( y = r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) for \( x \):  
\[ y = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \implies (1-x)^2 = \frac{1}{y} \implies 1-x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} \implies x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}}. \]  
For \( x \) to be real, \( \frac{1}{y} \geq 0 \), so \( y > 0 \). For any \( y > 0 \), we can compute \( x = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} \) or \( x = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} \), both of which are real and not equal to 1. Thus, every \( y > 0 \) is achievable.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the range includes all positive real numbers and excludes others.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \( y \leq 0 \) is possible and confirm that all \( y > 0 \) are covered.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Can \( y \leq 0 \)?** Since \( (1-x)^2 > 0 \) for \( x \neq 1 \), we have \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} > 0 \). Thus, \( y = 0 \) or \( y < 0 \) is not possible.  
- **Are all \( y > 0 \) achievable?** From the previous step, for any \( y > 0 \), we can find \( x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}} \), which is in the domain (\( x \neq 1 \)). For example:  
  - If \( y = 2 \), then \( \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{2} \), so \( x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).  
  - Check: For \( x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), compute \( 1-x = 1 - (1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), so \( r(x) = \frac{1}{\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{4}} = 2 \).  
Thus, the range is all \( y > 0 \), or in interval notation, \( (0, \infty) \).
