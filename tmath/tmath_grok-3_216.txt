### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the range of the function \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \):  
1. Determine the domain of the function, as it affects the possible output values.  
2. Analyze the behavior of the function to identify all possible output values.  
3. Express the range in interval notation based on the function's behavior.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the domain of the function \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify values of \( x \) where the function is defined by checking for points where the denominator is zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The function \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) is undefined when the denominator \( (1-x)^2 = 0 \). Solving for \( x \):  
\[ 1 - x = 0 \implies x = 1 \]  
Thus, the function is undefined at \( x = 1 \). The domain is all real numbers except \( x = 1 \), i.e., \( (-\infty, 1) \cup (1, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Analyze the behavior of \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) to determine its range.  
- **How to Achieve**: Examine the output values of the function by evaluating its behavior as \( x \) varies over the domain, including limits at boundaries and critical points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \), the denominator \( (1-x)^2 \) is always positive for \( x \neq 1 \), so \( r(x) > 0 \). Let’s analyze the function’s behavior:  

- **As \( x \to 1^- \) (approaching 1 from the left)**:  
  \( 1 - x > 0 \), but \( 1 - x \to 0^+ \), so \( (1-x)^2 \to 0^+ \), and \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \to +\infty \).  

- **As \( x \to 1^+ \) (approaching 1 from the right)**:  
  \( 1 - x < 0 \), but \( (1-x)^2 > 0 \), and as \( x \to 1^+ \), \( (1-x)^2 \to 0^+ \), so \( r(x) \to +\infty \).  

- **As \( x \to -\infty \)**:  
  \( 1 - x \approx -x \), so \( (1-x)^2 \approx x^2 \), and \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \approx \frac{1}{x^2} \to 0^+ \).  

- **As \( x \to +\infty \)**:  
  \( 1 - x \approx -x \), so \( (1-x)^2 \approx x^2 \), and \( r(x) \approx \frac{1}{x^2} \to 0^+ \).  

- **Test values to understand the function’s behavior**:  
  - At \( x = 0 \): \( r(0) = \frac{1}{(1-0)^2} = 1 \).  
  - At \( x = 2 \): \( r(2) = \frac{1}{(1-2)^2} = \frac{1}{(-1)^2} = 1 \).  
  - At \( x = 0.5 \): \( r(0.5) = \frac{1}{(1-0.5)^2} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).  
  - At \( x = 1.5 \): \( r(1.5) = \frac{1}{(1-1.5)^2} = \frac{1}{(-0.5)^2} = 4 \).  

To find the minimum value, consider the function’s critical points. Let \( y = r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \). Instead of computing the derivative (since it’s complex for range analysis), consider the function’s structure. Let’s try a substitution to simplify: set \( u = 1 - x \), so \( r(x) = \frac{1}{u^2} \), where \( u \neq 0 \). As \( u \) ranges over all real numbers except 0 (since \( x \neq 1 \)), \( u^2 > 0 \), and \( \frac{1}{u^2} > 0 \).  

- As \( |u| \to \infty \), \( \frac{1}{u^2} \to 0^+ \).  
- As \( |u| \to 0 \), \( \frac{1}{u^2} \to +\infty \).  

The smallest value of \( \frac{1}{u^2} \) occurs as \( u^2 \to \infty \), approaching 0 from the positive side. To confirm if \( r(x) \) achieves a minimum, note that \( (1-x)^2 \geq 0 \), with equality only at \( x = 1 \) (undefined). The minimum positive value of \( r(x) \) occurs as \( |1-x| \) increases, but \( r(x) \) never equals 0; it approaches 0 asymptotically.  

To determine if all positive values are achieved, solve for \( x \) given a possible output \( y \):  
\[ r(x) = y \implies \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = y \implies (1-x)^2 = \frac{1}{y} \implies 1 - x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} \implies x = 1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}. \]  
For \( y > 0 \), \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} \) is defined, and \( x = 1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} \) gives two real solutions (one in \( x < 1 \), one in \( x > 1 \)), both in the domain. Thus, for any \( y > 0 \), there exists an \( x \neq 1 \) such that \( r(x) = y \).  

The range includes all \( y > 0 \), as \( r(x) \) is always positive and can achieve any positive value.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the range of \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \) is \( (0, \infty) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Double-check the function’s behavior and the solvability of \( r(x) = y \) for all \( y > 0 \), and confirm no negative or zero values are possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3, we derived that \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} > 0 \) for all \( x \neq 1 \), and for any \( y > 0 \), solving \( \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = y \) yields \( x = 1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} \), which are real and in the domain.  

- **Check for \( y \leq 0 \)**:  
  Since \( (1-x)^2 > 0 \), \( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} > 0 \), so \( r(x) \) cannot be zero or negative.  

- **Confirm continuity and coverage**:  
  The function is continuous on \( (-\infty, 1) \) and \( (1, \infty) \). Since \( r(x) \to 0^+ \) as \( |x| \to \infty \) and \( r(x) \to +\infty \) as \( x \to 1^\pm \), and given that \( r(x) = y \) has solutions for all \( y > 0 \), the range is continuous and covers all positive real numbers.  

Thus, the range is \( (0, \infty) \).
