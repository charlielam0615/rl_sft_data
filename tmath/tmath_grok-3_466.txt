**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine the area of a rectangle formed by adding a 3-inch by 3-inch square at each successive stage, specifically at Stage 6. The Asymptote code provided illustrates a sequence of unit squares placed horizontally, labeled as Stage 1 (one square), Stage 2 (three squares), and Stage 3 (five squares), suggesting a pattern in the number of squares added per stage.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the area at Stage 6:  
1. Understand the pattern of squares added at each stage based on the Asymptote code.  
2. Determine the number of squares at Stage 6.  
3. Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle formed by these squares.  
4. Compute the area of the rectangle in square inches.

**Step 2: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information from the Asymptote code to identify the pattern of squares added per stage. The code shows unit squares shifted horizontally, with Stage 1 having 1 square, Stage 2 having 3 squares, and Stage 3 having 5 squares.  

[REVIEW]  
The Asymptote code indicates:  
- Stage 1: 1 square (at x=0).  
- Stage 2: 3 squares (at x=0, 1.5, 2.5).  
- Stage 3: 5 squares (at x=0, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 5).  
This suggests the number of squares follows the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., corresponding to odd numbers, where the number of squares at stage \( n \) is \( 2n - 1 \). The squares are aligned horizontally, forming a rectangle with a height of 1 unit (or 3 inches, as each square is 3" by 3").

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the number of squares at Stage 6.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the pattern identified (number of squares = \( 2n - 1 \)) to calculate the number of squares at Stage 6, where \( n = 6 \).  

[IMP]  
For Stage 6 (\( n = 6 \)):  
Number of squares = \( 2 \cdot 6 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 \).  
So, Stage 6 has 11 squares, each 3 inches by 3 inches, arranged horizontally.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the pattern and number of squares for Stage 6.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the formula \( 2n - 1 \) holds for earlier stages and confirm for Stage 6.  

[IMP]  
Verify the pattern:  
- Stage 1 (\( n = 1 \)): \( 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 \) square (matches code: 1 square).  
- Stage 2 (\( n = 2 \)): \( 2 \cdot 2 - 1 = 3 \) squares (matches code: 3 squares).  
- Stage 3 (\( n = 3 \)): \( 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 5 \) squares (matches code: 5 squares).  
- Stage 6 (\( n = 6 \)): \( 2 \cdot 6 - 1 = 11 \) squares (consistent with pattern).  
The formula \( 2n - 1 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle at Stage 6.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the squares are arranged horizontally and each square is 3 inches by 3 inches, the rectangle’s width is the number of squares times 3 inches, and the height is 3 inches (as squares are stacked in a single row).  

[IMP]  
At Stage 6, there are 11 squares.  
- Width = 11 squares × 3 inches = 33 inches.  
- Height = 3 inches (single row of 3" by 3" squares).  
The rectangle’s dimensions are 33 inches (width) by 3 inches (height).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the area of the rectangle at Stage 6.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = width × height) with the dimensions from Step 5.  

[IMP]  
Area = width × height = 33 inches × 3 inches = 99 square inches.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the area of the rectangle at Stage 6.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the pattern of squares added per stage (completed: \( 2n - 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of squares at Stage 6 (completed: 11 squares).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the rectangle’s dimensions (completed: 33 inches × 3 inches).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the area (completed: 99 square inches).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the area calculation.  
The area of 99 square inches aligns with the pattern and dimensions derived.

**Final Answer**: The area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is 99 square inches.
