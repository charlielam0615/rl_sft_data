### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \((d-1)(e-1)\), where \(d\) and \(e\) are the solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \((d-1)(e-1)\).  
Subgoals:  
1. Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\) to find the roots \(d\) and \(e\).  
2. Compute the expression \((d-1)(e-1)\) using the roots.  
3. Simplify the expression to find the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\) to find the roots \(d\) and \(e\). This can be achieved by applying the quadratic formula, factoring, or another suitable method.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\), use the quadratic formula: for \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the roots are given by  
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\]
Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = -5\).  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49.
\]
Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4}.
\]
Roots are:  
\[
x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1, \quad x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -\frac{5}{2}.
\]
Thus, the roots are \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the roots \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\) by substituting them back into the original equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \(x = 1\):  
\[
2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 5 = 2 \cdot 1 + 3 - 5 = 2 + 3 - 5 = 0.
\]
Check \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\):  
\[
2\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) - 5 = 2 \cdot \frac{25}{4} - \frac{15}{2} - 5 = \frac{50}{4} - \frac{30}{4} - \frac{20}{4} = \frac{50 - 30 - 20}{4} = \frac{0}{4} = 0.
\]
Both roots satisfy the equation, confirming \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\) are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \((d-1)(e-1)\) using the roots \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\). This can be achieved by substituting the roots into the expression and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\):  
\[
d - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, \quad e - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = -\frac{7}{2}.
\]
Compute the product:  
\[
(d-1)(e-1) = 0 \cdot \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right) = 0.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \((d-1)(e-1)\), where \(d\) and \(e\) are roots of \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the quadratic equation to find roots \(d\) and \(e\). (Completed: \(d = 1\), \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the roots. (Completed: Roots satisfy the equation)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \((d-1)(e-1)\). (Completed: Result is 0)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final result of \((d-1)(e-1)\).  
The result of \((d-1)(e-1) = 0\) has been computed and aligns with the subgoals completed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \((d-1)(e-1) = 0\) by exploring an alternative method, such as using the properties of the quadratic equation (e.g., sum and product of roots).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the sum of roots is \(-\frac{b}{a}\) and the product is \(\frac{c}{a}\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = -5\).  
Sum of roots: \(d + e = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{3}{2}\).  
Product of roots: \(d \cdot e = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{-5}{2}\).  
Rewrite \((d-1)(e-1)\):  
\[
(d-1)(e-1) = d \cdot e - d - e + 1.
\]
Using the sum and product:  
\[
d \cdot e = -\frac{5}{2}, \quad d + e = -\frac{3}{2}.
\]
Thus:  
\[
d \cdot e - (d + e) + 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{5}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 1 = \frac{-5 + 3 + 2}{2} = \frac{0}{2} = 0.
\]
This confirms \((d-1)(e-1) = 0\), consistent with the previous calculation.

### Final Answer
The value of \((d-1)(e-1)\) is \(0\).  
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
