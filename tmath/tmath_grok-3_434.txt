### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \((d-1)(e-1)\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\) to find the roots \(d\) and \(e\).  
2. Compute the expression \((d-1)(e-1)\) using the roots.  
3. Simplify the expression to obtain the final value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\) to find the roots \(d\) and \(e\). This can be achieved by applying the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = -5\).

[IMP]
Using the quadratic formula for \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\):  
- Coefficients: \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = -5\).  
- Discriminant: \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49\).  
- Roots:  
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4}.
  \]
  - First root: \(x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1\).  
  - Second root: \(x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -\frac{5}{2}\).  
Thus, the roots are \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\) (or vice versa, as the expression is symmetric).

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \((d-1)(e-1)\) for the roots of \(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the quadratic equation to find roots \(d\) and \(e\). (Completed: \(d = 1\), \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \((d-1)(e-1)\). (Pending)  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the expression to obtain the final value. (Pending)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \((d-1)(e-1)\) using the roots \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \((d-1)(e-1)\) using the roots \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\). This can be achieved by substituting the values of \(d\) and \(e\) into the expression and simplifying.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(d = 1\) and \(e = -\frac{5}{2}\) into \((d-1)(e-1)\):  
- \(d - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\).  
- \(e - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = -\frac{7}{2}\).  
- Compute the product: \((d-1)(e-1) = 0 \cdot \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right) = 0\).  
Thus, \((d-1)(e-1) = 0\).

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \((d-1)(e-1) = 0\). This can be done by verifying the roots and recomputing the expression, or by using an alternative method to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, use the property of quadratic equations. For a quadratic \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the product of the roots minus 1 is related to the sum and product of the roots:  
- Sum of roots: \(d + e = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{3}{2}\).  
- Product of roots: \(de = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{-5}{2}\).  
Compute \((d-1)(e-1) = de - d - e + 1\):  
- \(de = -\frac{5}{2}\).  
- \(d + e = -\frac{3}{2}\).  
- \((d-1)(e-1) = de - (d + e) + 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{5}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\).  
This confirms the result from Step 4. Alternatively, since \(d = 1\), \(d - 1 = 0\), making the product zero, which is consistent. The result is valid.

### Final Answer
The value of \((d-1)(e-1)\) is \(0\).
