### Problem Restatement
We are given a custom operation defined as \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \). We need to find the value of \( a \) such that \( a * 5 = 9 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the value of \( a \).  
1. Use the given operation \( a * 5 = 9 \) and the definition \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \) to set up an equation.  
2. Solve the equation for \( a \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation derived from \( a * 5 = 9 \) using the operation \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( b = 5 \) into the operation definition and solving for \( a \).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the operation definition \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \), substitute \( b = 5 \):  
\[ a * 5 = 2a - 5^2 \]  
Since \( a * 5 = 9 \), we have:  
\[ 2a - 25 = 9 \]  
Add 25 to both sides:  
\[ 2a = 34 \]  
Divide by 2:  
\[ a = 17 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 17 \) satisfies the condition \( a * 5 = 9 \) using the operation \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 17 \) and \( b = 5 \) into the operation and checking if the result equals 9.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 17 \) and \( b = 5 \) into \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \):  
\[ a * 5 = 2(17) - 5^2 = 34 - 25 = 9 \]  
The result is 9, which matches the given condition \( a * 5 = 9 \). Thus, the solution \( a = 17 \) is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( a \) such that \( a * 5 = 9 \) using the operation \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation using the operation definition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation for \( a \) (completed, \( a = 17 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  
**Current Goal**: No further goals are needed as the solution has been found and verified.  
**Summary**: The value of \( a = 17 \) satisfies the condition \( a * 5 = 9 \), and the problem is solved.

### Final Answer
The value of \( a \) is 17.
