**Problem Statement**: We are given a binary operation defined as \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \). We need to find the value of \( a \) such that \( a * 5 = 9 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( a \), we need to use the given operation and condition \( a * 5 = 9 \). The forward subgoals are:  
1. Substitute the operation definition into the equation \( a * 5 = 9 \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute the operation definition into \( a * 5 = 9 \) and set up the equation. This will be achieved by applying the given formula \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \) with \( b = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the operation definition \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \), we compute \( a * 5 \):  
\[ a * 5 = 2a - 5^2 \]  
Since \( 5^2 = 25 \), this becomes:  
\[ a * 5 = 2a - 25 \]  
We are given that \( a * 5 = 9 \), so we set up the equation:  
\[ 2a - 25 = 9 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 2a - 25 = 9 \) for \( a \). This will be achieved by isolating \( a \) through algebraic manipulation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 2a - 25 = 9 \]  
Add 25 to both sides:  
\[ 2a - 25 + 25 = 9 + 25 \]  
\[ 2a = 34 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ a = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]  
So, \( a = 17 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 17 \) satisfies the original condition \( a * 5 = 9 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 17 \) and \( b = 5 \) into the operation definition and checking if the result equals 9.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 17 \) and \( b = 5 \) into \( a * b = 2a - b^2 \):  
\[ 17 * 5 = 2 \cdot 17 - 5^2 \]  
Compute:  
\[ 2 \cdot 17 = 34, \quad 5^2 = 25 \]  
\[ 34 - 25 = 9 \]  
Since \( 17 * 5 = 9 \), which matches the given condition \( a * 5 = 9 \), the solution \( a = 17 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management**:  
- Main goal: Find \( a \) such that \( a * 5 = 9 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute the operation definition into \( a * 5 = 9 \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( a \). (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution. (Completed in Step 4)  
**Current goal**: The main goal has been achieved, with \( a = 17 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( a \) is **17**.  

\[ \boxed{17} \]
