**Problem Restatement**: Given the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \), where \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) when \( x = 81 \), find the value of \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( y \) at \( x = 4 \), we need to:  
1. Determine the constant \( k \) using the given condition \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) at \( x = 81 \).  
2. Use the value of \( k \) to compute \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find the constant \( k \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 81 \) and \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) into the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \), and solve for \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute the given values into the equation:  
\[ 3\sqrt{2} = k \cdot 81^{\frac{1}{4}} \]  
Compute \( 81^{\frac{1}{4}} \):  
Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), we have \( 81^{\frac{1}{4}} = (3^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^1 = 3 \).  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 3\sqrt{2} = k \cdot 3 \]  
Solve for \( k \):  
\[ k = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{3} = \sqrt{2} \]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the constant \( k \) (completed, \( k = \sqrt{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( y \) using \( x = 4 \) and the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \) with \( k = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 4 \), and calculate \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( k = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 4 \) into the equation:  
\[ y = \sqrt{2} \cdot 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \]  
Compute \( 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \):  
Since \( 4 = 2^2 \), we have \( 4^{\frac{1}{4}} = (2^2)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{2}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \).  
Thus:  
\[ y = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution for \( y \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculations for \( k \) and \( y \), and ensure the result is consistent with the given condition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify \( k \):  
Using \( k = \sqrt{2} \), check the given condition \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) at \( x = 81 \):  
\[ y = \sqrt{2} \cdot 81^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 = 3\sqrt{2} \]  
This matches the given condition, so \( k = \sqrt{2} \) is correct.  
Verify \( y \):  
For \( x = 4 \), we calculated \( y = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2 \).  
The calculation of \( 4^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \) is correct since \( (2^{\frac{1}{2}})^2 = 2 \). The multiplication \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2 \) is also correct.  
The solution is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( y \) at \( x = 4 \) is \( 2 \).
