**Problem Statement**: Given the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \), where \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) when \( x = 81 \), find the value of \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the constant \( k \) using the given condition \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) at \( x = 81 \).  
2. Use the value of \( k \) to find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the constant \( k \). This can be achieved by substituting \( y = 3\sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 81 \) into the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \) and solving for \( k \).

[IMP]  
Substitute the given values into the equation:  
\[ 3\sqrt{2} = k \cdot 81^{\frac{1}{4}} \]  
Calculate \( 81^{\frac{1}{4}} \):  
Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), we have \( 81^{\frac{1}{4}} = (3^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3 \).  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 3\sqrt{2} = k \cdot 3 \]  
Solve for \( k \):  
\[ k = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{3} = \sqrt{2} \]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the constant \( k \) (completed: \( k = \sqrt{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use \( k \) to find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Use \( k = \sqrt{2} \) to find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( k = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 4 \) into the equation \( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( k = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 4 \) into the equation:  
\[ y = \sqrt{2} \cdot 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \]  
Calculate \( 4^{\frac{1}{4}} \):  
Since \( 4 = 2^2 \), we have \( 4^{\frac{1}{4}} = (2^2)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{2}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \).  
Thus:  
\[ y = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( y \) at \( x = 4 \) is \( 2 \).
