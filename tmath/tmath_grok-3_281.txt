**Problem Statement**: The point \((4, 7)\) lies on the graph of \(y = f(x)\). We need to determine a point that must be on the graph of the transformed function \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\), and compute the sum of its coordinates.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the point on the graph of \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\) and computing the sum of its coordinates into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between the given point \((4, 7)\) and the original function \(y = f(x)\).  
2. Determine how the transformation \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\) affects the point \((4, 7)\).  
3. Find the corresponding point on the transformed function’s graph.  
4. Calculate the sum of the coordinates of the resulting point.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine how the transformation \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\) affects the point \((4, 7)\). To achieve this, simplify the transformed equation to express \(y\) in terms of \(f(4x)\), and analyze how the input and output transformations modify the coordinates of the point.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given equation \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\). Solve for \(y\):  
\[
2y = 3f(4x) + 5 \implies y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}.
\]  
This represents the transformed function \(y = g(x) = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\). The transformations applied to \(f(x)\) are:  
- **Input transformation**: The argument is \(4x\), indicating a horizontal compression by a factor of \(\frac{1}{4}\). Thus, a point \((x, y)\) on \(f(x)\) corresponds to a point \(\left(\frac{x}{4}, y\right)\) before output transformations.  
- **Output transformations**: The function \(f(4x)\) is scaled by 3, shifted up by 5, and then divided by 2. So, if \(y = f(x)\), then for input \(x\), the output of the transformed function is \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\).  
Since \((4, 7)\) is on \(y = f(x)\), we have \(f(4) = 7\). We need to find a point \((x', y')\) on the graph of \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the specific point on the transformed function’s graph corresponding to \((4, 7)\). Use the input transformation \(x \to 4x\) to determine the appropriate \(x'\) value, and apply the output transformation to find the corresponding \(y'\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \((4, 7)\) on \(y = f(x)\), we know \(f(4) = 7\). The input transformation involves \(4x\). To find the new \(x\)-coordinate, consider the input to \(f\):  
- In the transformed function, the argument is \(4x\). We need \(4x' = 4\) (since the original point has \(x = 4\)).  
- Solve: \(4x' = 4 \implies x' = 1\).  
Now, compute the corresponding \(y'\) using the transformed function \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\):  
- At \(x' = 1\), the argument is \(4x' = 4 \cdot 1 = 4\).  
- Since \(f(4) = 7\), we have \(f(4 \cdot 1) = f(4) = 7\).  
- Apply the output transformation:  
  \[
  y' = \frac{3f(4 \cdot 1) + 5}{2} = \frac{3 \cdot 7 + 5}{2} = \frac{21 + 5}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13.
  \]  
Thus, the point on the graph of \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\) (or equivalently, \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\)) is \((1, 13)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the point \((1, 13)\) lies on the graph of \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\). Substitute \(x = 1\) and \(y = 13\) into the equation and check if it holds using \(f(4) = 7\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \((x, y) = (1, 13)\) into \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\):  
- Left side: \(2y = 2 \cdot 13 = 26\).  
- Right side: Compute \(4x = 4 \cdot 1 = 4\), so \(f(4x) = f(4) = 7\). Then, \(3f(4x) + 5 = 3 \cdot 7 + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26\).  
- Check: \(26 = 26\), so the equation holds.  
The point \((1, 13)\) satisfies the transformed equation, confirming the calculation.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the point on the graph of \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\) given \((4, 7)\) is on \(y = f(x)\), and compute the sum of its coordinates.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the relationship \((4, 7)\) implies \(f(4) = 7\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Analyze the transformation \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the corresponding point on the transformed function.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the point.  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the sum of the coordinates (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the coordinates of the point \((1, 13)\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the coordinates of the point \((1, 13)\). Add the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates to find the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The point is \((1, 13)\). Sum the coordinates:  
\[
1 + 13 = 14.
\]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the coordinates of the point is \(14\).
