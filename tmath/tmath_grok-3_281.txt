### Problem Statement
Given that the point \((4, 7)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\), we need to find a point that must be on the graph of the transformed function \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\). Then, we compute the sum of the coordinates of that point.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the transformation from \(y = f(x)\) to \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\).  
- Subgoal 2: Determine how the point \((4, 7)\) on \(y = f(x)\) transforms under the new function.  
- Subgoal 3: Find the coordinates of the transformed point.  
- Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of the coordinates of the transformed point.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the transformation from \(y = f(x)\) to \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\). To achieve this, rewrite the transformed equation in the form \(y = g(x)\) to clarify how the input and output are modified.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2y = 3f(4x) + 5 \]  
Solve for \(y\):  
\[ y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2} \]  
This shows that for the new function \(y = g(x)\), the input to \(f\) is scaled by 4 (i.e., \(f(4x)\)), the output of \(f(4x)\) is multiplied by 3, a constant 5 is added, and the result is divided by 2.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine how the point \((4, 7)\) on \(y = f(x)\) transforms under the new function \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\). To achieve this, find the corresponding \(x\)-value in the transformed function that relates to \(x = 4\) in the original function, and compute the new \(y\)-value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since the point \((4, 7)\) satisfies \(y = f(x)\), we have \(f(4) = 7\).  
In the transformed function \(y = \frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\), the input to \(f\) is \(4x\). To find the corresponding point, we need \(4x = 4\) (since the original point has \(x = 4\)):  
\[ 4x = 4 \implies x = 1 \]  
Now, compute the \(y\)-coordinate for \(x = 1\):  
\[ y = \frac{3f(4 \cdot 1) + 5}{2} = \frac{3f(4) + 5}{2} \]  
Since \(f(4) = 7\):  
\[ y = \frac{3 \cdot 7 + 5}{2} = \frac{21 + 5}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]  
Thus, the point on the graph of the transformed function corresponding to \((4, 7)\) is \((1, 13)\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the point \((1, 13)\) lies on the graph of \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\). To achieve this, substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 13\), and \(f(4) = 7\) into the original transformed equation to check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 13\) into \(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\):  
Left side:  
\[ 2y = 2 \cdot 13 = 26 \]  
Right side:  
\[ 4x = 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \implies f(4) = 7 \]  
\[ 3f(4x) + 5 = 3 \cdot f(4) + 5 = 3 \cdot 7 + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26 \]  
Since \(26 = 26\), the point \((1, 13)\) satisfies the equation, confirming it lies on the graph.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the coordinates of the point \((1, 13)\). To achieve this, add the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The point is \((1, 13)\). Sum the coordinates:  
\[ 1 + 13 = 14 \]  
[/IMP]
