### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( x \) at the point where the lines \( y = 4x - 19 \) and \( 2x + y = 95 \) intersect. This involves solving the system of equations to determine the coordinates of the intersection point and extracting the \( x \)-coordinate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the intersection point, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Solve the system of equations \( y = 4x - 19 \) and \( 2x + y = 95 \) to find the coordinates \((x, y)\).
2. Extract the \( x \)-coordinate from the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( y = 4x - 19 \) from the first equation into the second equation \( 2x + y = 95 \), solve for \( x \), and then find \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( y = 4x - 19 \) into \( 2x + y = 95 \):

\[
2x + (4x - 19) = 95
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2x + 4x - 19 = 95
\]

\[
6x - 19 = 95
\]

Add 19 to both sides:

\[
6x = 114
\]

Divide by 6:

\[
x = \frac{114}{6} = 19
\]

Now, find \( y \) using \( y = 4x - 19 \):

\[
y = 4 \cdot 19 - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57
\]

The intersection point is \((x, y) = (19, 57)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if \((x, y) = (19, 57)\) satisfies both equations.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 57 \) into both equations and confirm they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first equation \( y = 4x - 19 \):

\[
y = 4 \cdot 19 - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57
\]

This matches \( y = 57 \), so the first equation is satisfied.

Check the second equation \( 2x + y = 95 \):

\[
2 \cdot 19 + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95
\]

This equals 95, so the second equation is satisfied.

The solution \((19, 57)\) is valid.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) at the intersection of \( y = 4x - 19 \) and \( 2x + y = 95 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations to find \((x, y)\). (Completed: Found \((19, 57)\))
  - Subgoal 2: Extract the \( x \)-coordinate. (Pending)
Current Goal: Extract the \( x \)-coordinate from the intersection point.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Extract the \( x \)-coordinate from the intersection point.
How to Achieve: Identify the \( x \)-value from the solution \((19, 57)\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The intersection point is \((19, 57)\). The \( x \)-coordinate is \( x = 19 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) at the point of intersection is \( 19 \).
