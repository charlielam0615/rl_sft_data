### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x \) at the point where the lines \( y = 4x - 19 \) and \( 2x + y = 95 \) intersect.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the intersection point.  
- Subgoal 1: Express both equations in a compatible form to solve for \( x \) and \( y \).  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.  
- Subgoal 3: Extract the value of \( x \) from the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the intersection point. This can be achieved by substituting \( y = 4x - 19 \) from the first equation into the second equation \( 2x + y = 95 \) to form a single equation in terms of \( x \), then solving for \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 4x - 19 \) into \( 2x + y = 95 \):  
\[ 2x + (4x - 19) = 95 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ 2x + 4x - 19 = 95 \]  
\[ 6x - 19 = 95 \]  
Add 19 to both sides:  
\[ 6x = 114 \]  
Divide by 6:  
\[ x = 19 \]  
Now, find \( y \) using \( y = 4x - 19 \):  
\[ y = 4(19) - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57 \]  
The intersection point is \( (x, y) = (19, 57) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solution \( (x, y) = (19, 57) \) satisfies both equations to ensure correctness. This can be achieved by substituting \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 57 \) into both original equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the first equation \( y = 4x - 19 \):  
\[ y = 4(19) - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57 \]  
This matches \( y = 57 \).  
Check the second equation \( 2x + y = 95 \):  
\[ 2(19) + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95 \]  
This satisfies the equation.  
The solution \( (19, 57) \) is valid for both equations.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( x \) at the intersection of \( y = 4x - 19 \) and \( 2x + y = 95 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express equations in compatible form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations (completed, found \( x = 19, y = 57 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Extract the value of \( x \) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Extract the value of \( x \) from the solution.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract the value of \( x \) from the intersection point \( (19, 57) \). This can be achieved by directly stating the \( x \)-coordinate from the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The value of \( x \) at the point of intersection is \( x = 19 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) at the point of intersection is \( 19 \).
