**Problem Statement**: We have a rectangle with dimensions \(x - 2\) and \(2x + 5\), and its area is given as \(8x - 6\). We need to find the value of \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(x\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle using the given dimensions.  
2. Simplify and solve the resulting equation for \(x\).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid for the rectangle's dimensions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for the area of the rectangle. Achieve this by multiplying the dimensions \(x - 2\) and \(2x + 5\) and equating the result to the given area \(8x - 6\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The area of a rectangle is given by length × width. Thus:  
\((x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6\)  
This equation represents the area constraint provided in the problem.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify and solve the equation \((x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6\) for \(x\). Achieve this by expanding the left-hand side, moving all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation, and solving it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\((x - 2)(2x + 5) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 2x - 2 \cdot 5 = 2x^2 + 5x - 4x - 10 = 2x^2 + x - 10\)  

Equate to the given area:  
\(2x^2 + x - 10 = 8x - 6\)  

Move all terms to one side:  
\(2x^2 + x - 10 - 8x + 6 = 0\)  
\(2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\)  

Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -4\):  
Discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-4) = 49 + 32 = 81\)  
\(x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{7 \pm 9}{4}\)  

Solutions:  
\(x = \frac{7 + 9}{4} = \frac{16}{4} = 4\)  
\(x = \frac{7 - 9}{4} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}\)  

Thus, the possible values for \(x\) are \(4\) and \(-\frac{1}{2}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solutions \(x = 4\) and \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) to ensure they are valid for the rectangle’s dimensions. Achieve this by checking if the dimensions \(x - 2\) and \(2x + 5\) are positive and if the area matches \(8x - 6\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \(x = 4\):  
- Dimensions: \(x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\), \(2x + 5 = 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13\)  
- Both dimensions are positive.  
- Area: \(2 \cdot 13 = 26\)  
- Given area: \(8x - 6 = 8 \cdot 4 - 6 = 32 - 6 = 26\)  
- The area matches, so \(x = 4\) is valid.  

For \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\):  
- Dimensions: \(x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = -\frac{5}{2}\), \(2x + 5 = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4\)  
- The dimension \(x - 2 = -\frac{5}{2}\) is negative, which is not possible for a rectangle’s length or width.  
- Thus, \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) is invalid.  

Therefore, the only valid solution is \(x = 4\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(x\) for the rectangle with dimensions \(x - 2\) and \(2x + 5\) and area \(8x - 6\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the area equation \((x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify and solve the equation for \(x\). (Completed, solutions: \(x = 4\), \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solutions for validity. (Completed, \(x = 4\) is valid, \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) is invalid)  

**Current Goal**: The problem is solved, as the valid value of \(x = 4\) has been determined.

**Final Answer**: The value of \(x\) is \(4\).
