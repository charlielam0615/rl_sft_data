**Problem Statement**: We are given a rectangle with dimensions \( x - 2 \) by \( 2x + 5 \), and its area is \( 8x - 6 \). We need to find the value of \( x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( x \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set up the area equation using the given dimensions and area.  
2. Simplify the equation to a standard form.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
4. Validate the solution by checking the dimensions and area.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up the area equation for the rectangle.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the dimensions \( (x - 2) \) and \( (2x + 5) \) to get the area, and set it equal to the given area \( 8x - 6 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The area of a rectangle is given by length × width. Thus:  
\[ (x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6 \]  
This is the equation we need to solve.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation to a standard form.  
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side of the equation \( (x - 2)(2x + 5) \), collect all terms on one side, and simplify to form a quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\[ (x - 2)(2x + 5) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 2x - 2 \cdot 5 = 2x^2 + 5x - 4x - 10 = 2x^2 + x - 10 \]  

Set up the equation:  
\[ 2x^2 + x - 10 = 8x - 6 \]  

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ 2x^2 + x - 10 - (8x - 6) = 0 \]  
\[ 2x^2 + x - 10 - 8x + 6 = 0 \]  
\[ 2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0 \]  

This is the simplified quadratic equation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) to find the roots of \( 2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0 \), identify coefficients:  
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -4 \).  

Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-4)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 32}}{4} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{81}}{4} = \frac{7 \pm 9}{4} \]  

Calculate the roots:  
- \( x = \frac{7 + 9}{4} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \)  
- \( x = \frac{7 - 9}{4} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2} \)  

The solutions are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the solutions by checking the dimensions and area.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \) into the dimensions \( x - 2 \) and \( 2x + 5 \), ensure they are positive (since they represent lengths), and verify the area equals \( 8x - 6 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Check \( x = 4 \)**:  
- Dimensions:  
  - \( x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \)  
  - \( 2x + 5 = 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \)  
- Both dimensions are positive.  
- Area:  
  - Left-hand side: \( (x - 2)(2x + 5) = 2 \cdot 13 = 26 \)  
  - Right-hand side: \( 8x - 6 = 8 \cdot 4 - 6 = 32 - 6 = 26 \)  
- The area matches, so \( x = 4 \) is valid.  

**Check \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \)**:  
- Dimensions:  
  - \( x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = -\frac{5}{2} \)  
  - \( 2x + 5 = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 \)  
- The dimension \( x - 2 = -\frac{5}{2} \) is negative, which is not possible for a rectangle’s length.  
- Thus, \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \) is not valid.  

Only \( x = 4 \) satisfies the physical constraints.
