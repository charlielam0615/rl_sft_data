### Problem Restatement
Luke borrows $10,000 from a bank and must choose between two 10-year repayment plans. In Plan 1, the debt accrues 10% annual interest compounded quarterly, with Luke paying half the balance after 5 years and the remaining balance after 10 years. In Plan 2, the debt accrues 10% annual interest compounded annually, with Luke paying the full balance after 10 years. We need to calculate the total payments under each plan, find the positive difference between them, and round to the nearest dollar.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total payments for each plan and their difference:  
1. Calculate the balance for Plan 1 after 5 years with quarterly compounding.  
2. Determine the payment after 5 years (half the balance) for Plan 1.  
3. Calculate the remaining balance after the 5-year payment in Plan 1, then compute the balance after 10 years with quarterly compounding.  
4. Sum the payments for Plan 1 (5-year payment + 10-year payment).  
5. Calculate the balance for Plan 2 after 10 years with annual compounding (single payment).  
6. Compute the positive difference between total payments in Plan 1 and Plan 2.  
7. Round the difference to the nearest dollar.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the balance for Plan 1 after 5 years with 10% annual interest compounded quarterly.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 0.10 \), \( n = 4 \) (quarterly compounding), and \( t = 5 \) years.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 10,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.10}{4}\right)^{4 \times 5} = 10,000 \left(1 + 0.025\right)^{20} = 10,000 \times 1.025^{20} \).  
Compute \( 1.025^{20} \):  
\( 1.025^{20} \approx 1.638616 \).  
So, \( A \approx 10,000 \times 1.638616 = 16,386.16 \).  
The balance after 5 years for Plan 1 is approximately $16,386.16.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine the payment after 5 years for Plan 1 (half the balance).  
- **How to Achieve:** Take half of the balance calculated in Step 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The balance after 5 years is $16,386.16.  
The 5-year payment is half of this:  
\( \frac{16,386.16}{2} = 8,193.08 \).  
So, the payment after 5 years is $8,193.08.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the remaining balance after the 5-year payment in Plan 1, then compute the balance after 10 years with quarterly compounding.  
- **How to Achieve:** Subtract the 5-year payment from the 5-year balance to get the remaining balance, then apply the compound interest formula for the next 5 years (20 quarters) on the remaining balance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Remaining balance after 5-year payment:  
\( 16,386.16 - 8,193.08 = 8,193.08 \).  
Now, compute the balance after another 5 years (20 quarters) on $8,193.08:  
\( A = 8,193.08 \left(1 + \frac{0.10}{4}\right)^{20} = 8,193.08 \times 1.025^{20} \).  
Since \( 1.025^{20} \approx 1.638616 \),  
\( A \approx 8,193.08 \times 1.638616 \approx 13,425.12 \).  
The balance after 10 years (and the final payment) for Plan 1 is approximately $13,425.12.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Sum the payments for Plan 1 (5-year payment + 10-year payment).  
- **How to Achieve:** Add the 5-year payment from Step 3 and the 10-year payment from Step 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total payments for Plan 1:  
\( 8,193.08 + 13,425.12 = 21,618.20 \).  
So, total payments for Plan 1 are $21,618.20.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the balance for Plan 2 after 10 years with 10% annual interest compounded annually.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + r\right)^t \), where \( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 0.10 \), and \( t = 10 \) years.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the compound interest formula:  
\( A = 10,000 \left(1 + 0.10\right)^{10} = 10,000 \times 1.1^{10} \).  
Compute \( 1.1^{10} \):  
\( 1.1^{10} \approx 2.593742 \).  
So, \( A \approx 10,000 \times 2.593742 = 25,937.42 \).  
The balance (and total payment) for Plan 2 after 10 years is $25,937.42.

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the positive difference between total payments in Plan 1 and Plan 2.  
- **How to Achieve:** Subtract the smaller total payment from the larger one to ensure a positive difference, using the results from Steps 5 and 6.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total payments: Plan 1 = $21,618.20, Plan 2 = $25,937.42.  
Positive difference:  
\( 25,937.42 - 21,618.20 = 4,319.22 \).  
The difference is $4,319.22.

[IMP]
The difference is $4,319.22.  
Rounding to the nearest dollar: $4,319.22 \approx 4,319.  
So, the final difference is $4,319.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The positive difference between Luke's total payments under Plan 1 and Plan 2, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $4,319.
