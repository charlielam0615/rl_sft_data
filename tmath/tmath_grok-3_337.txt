### Problem Restatement
Luke is borrowing $10,000 from a bank and must choose between two 10-year repayment plans:
- **Plan 1**: The debt accumulates 10% annual interest, compounded quarterly. Luke pays half the balance after 5 years and the remaining balance after 10 years.
- **Plan 2**: The debt accumulates 10% annual interest, compounded annually. Luke pays the full balance after 10 years.
We need to calculate the total payments under each plan, find the positive difference between Plan 1 and Plan 2 payments, and round to the nearest dollar.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total payments for Plan 1 and Plan 2, then find their difference.  
Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the balance for Plan 1 after 5 years with quarterly compounding.  
2. Determine the payment for Plan 1 after 5 years (half the balance).  
3. Calculate the remaining balance for Plan 1 from year 5 to year 10, then determine the final payment.  
4. Calculate the total payments for Plan 1 (sum of payments at year 5 and year 10).  
5. Calculate the balance for Plan 2 after 10 years with annual compounding (single payment).  
6. Compute the positive difference between total payments in Plan 1 and Plan 2.  
7. Round the difference to the nearest dollar.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the balance for Plan 1 after 5 years with 10% annual interest compounded quarterly. Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 0.10 \), \( n = 4 \) (quarterly), and \( t = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For Plan 1, the initial principal is \( P = 10,000 \), annual interest rate is \( r = 0.10 \), compounded \( n = 4 \) times per year, over \( t = 5 \) years.  
The number of compounding periods is \( nt = 4 \times 5 = 20 \).  
The interest rate per period is \( \frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025 \).  
Using the compound interest formula:  
\[ A = 10,000 \left(1 + 0.025\right)^{20} = 10,000 \times 1.025^{20} \]  
Calculate \( 1.025^{20} \):  
\[ 1.025^{20} \approx 1.638616 \] (using a calculator for precision).  
\[ A = 10,000 \times 1.638616 \approx 16,386.16 \]  
The balance after 5 years for Plan 1 is approximately $16,386.16.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the payment for Plan 1 after 5 years, which is half the balance calculated in Step 2. Then, compute the remaining balance after this payment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The balance after 5 years for Plan 1 is $16,386.16.  
The payment at year 5 is half this balance:  
\[ \text{Payment} = \frac{16,386.16}{2} = 8,193.08 \]  
The remaining balance after the payment is:  
\[ 16,386.16 - 8,193.08 = 8,193.08 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the balance for Plan 1 from year 5 to year 10, starting with the remaining balance of $8,193.08, with 10% annual interest compounded quarterly. Then, determine the final payment at year 10.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with the remaining balance of $8,193.08, apply compound interest for another 5 years (years 5 to 10), with \( r = 0.10 \), \( n = 4 \), and \( t = 5 \).  
Number of compounding periods: \( nt = 4 \times 5 = 20 \).  
Interest rate per period: \( \frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025 \).  
Using the compound interest formula:  
\[ A = 8,193.08 \left(1 + 0.025\right)^{20} = 8,193.08 \times 1.025^{20} \]  
From Step 2, \( 1.025^{20} \approx 1.638616 \).  
\[ A = 8,193.08 \times 1.638616 \approx 13,425.33 \]  
The balance after 10 years is approximately $13,425.33, which is the final payment for Plan 1 at year 10.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the total payments for Plan 1 by summing the payments made at year 5 and year 10.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total payments for Plan 1:  
- Year 5 payment: $8,193.08  
- Year 10 payment: $13,425.33  
\[ \text{Total payments} = 8,193.08 + 13,425.33 = 21,618.41 \]  
Total payments for Plan 1 are $21,618.41.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the balance for Plan 2 after 10 years with 10% annual interest compounded annually, which is the single payment at year 10. Use the compound interest formula \( A = P \left(1 + r\right)^t \), where \( P = 10,000 \), \( r = 0.10 \), and \( t = 10 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For Plan 2, the initial principal is \( P = 10,000 \), annual interest rate is \( r = 0.10 \), compounded annually (\( n = 1 \)), over \( t = 10 \) years.  
Using the compound interest formula:  
\[ A = 10,000 \left(1 + 0.10\right)^{10} = 10,000 \times 1.1^{10} \]  
Calculate \( 1.1^{10} \):  
\[ 1.1^{10} \approx 2.593742 \] (using a calculator for precision).  
\[ A = 10,000 \times 2.593742 \approx 25,937.42 \]  
The balance after 10 years, which is the payment for Plan 2, is approximately $25,937.42.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the positive difference between total payments under Plan 1 and Plan 2, rounded to the nearest dollar.

  - Subgoal 2: Determine Plan 1 payment at year 5 and remaining balance (completed: payment $8,193.08, remaining balance $8,193.08).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate Plan 1 balance from year 5 to year 10 and final payment (completed: final payment $13,425.33).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate total payments for Plan 1 (completed: $21,618.41).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate Plan 2 balance after 10 years (completed: $25,937.42).  
  - Subgoal 6: Compute the positive difference between Plan 1 and Plan 2 payments (pending).  
  - Subgoal 7: Round the difference to the nearest dollar (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the positive difference between total payments in Plan 1 and Plan 2.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the positive difference between total payments in Plan 1 ($21,618.41) and Plan 2 ($25,937.42), then round to the nearest dollar.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total payments:  
- Plan 1: $21,618.41  
- Plan 2: $25,937.42  
Calculate the positive difference:  
\[ |21,618.41 - 25,937.42| = 4,319.01 \]  
Since Plan 2 payments are higher, the positive difference is:  
\[ 25,937.42 - 21,618.41 = 4,319.01 \]  
Round to the nearest dollar:  
\[ 4,319.01 \approx 4,319 \]  
The positive difference is $4,319.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The positive difference between Lukeâ€™s total payments under Plan 1 and Plan 2, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $4,319.
