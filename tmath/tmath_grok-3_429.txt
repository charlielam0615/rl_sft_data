**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine how many pennies Bob currently has. If Alex gives Bob a penny, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the number of pennies Alex and Bob currently have.  
2. Set up equations based on the two given conditions.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find Bob’s current number of pennies.  
4. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations for the given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Let Alex have \( A \) pennies and Bob have \( B \) pennies. Translate the two conditions into equations:  
- If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex has \( A - 1 \), Bob has \( B + 1 \), and Bob’s pennies are three times Alex’s: \( B + 1 = 3(A - 1) \).  
- If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob has \( B - 1 \), Alex has \( A + 1 \), and Bob’s pennies are twice Alex’s: \( B - 1 = 2(A + 1) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define variables:  
- Let \( A \) be the number of pennies Alex has.  
- Let \( B \) be the number of pennies Bob has.  

From the first condition:  
If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex has \( A - 1 \), and Bob has \( B + 1 \). Bob’s pennies are three times Alex’s:  
\[ B + 1 = 3(A - 1) \]  
\[ B + 1 = 3A - 3 \]  
\[ B = 3A - 4 \]  

From the second condition:  
If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob has \( B - 1 \), and Alex has \( A + 1 \). Bob’s pennies are twice Alex’s:  
\[ B - 1 = 2(A + 1) \]  
\[ B - 1 = 2A + 2 \]  
\[ B = 2A + 3 \]  

We now have the system of equations:  
1. \( B = 3A - 4 \)  
2. \( B = 2A + 3 \)  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find Bob’s number of pennies.  
How to Achieve: Equate the two expressions for \( B \) from the equations \( B = 3A - 4 \) and \( B = 2A + 3 \), solve for \( A \), then substitute to find \( B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
\[ 3A - 4 = 2A + 3 \]  
Subtract \( 2A \) from both sides:  
\[ 3A - 2A - 4 = 3 \]  
\[ A - 4 = 3 \]  
Add 4 to both sides:  
\[ A = 7 \]  

Substitute \( A = 7 \) into the second equation \( B = 2A + 3 \):  
\[ B = 2(7) + 3 \]  
\[ B = 14 + 3 \]  
\[ B = 17 \]  

So, Alex has 7 pennies, and Bob has 17 pennies.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking both conditions with \( A = 7 \) and \( B = 17 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( A = 7 \) and \( B = 17 \) into both scenarios to ensure they hold true.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the first condition:  
If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex has \( 7 - 1 = 6 \), and Bob has \( 17 + 1 = 18 \). Bob’s pennies should be three times Alex’s:  
\[ 18 = 3 \times 6 \]  
\[ 18 = 18 \]  
This holds true.  

Check the second condition:  
If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob has \( 17 - 1 = 16 \), and Alex has \( 7 + 1 = 8 \). Bob’s pennies should be twice Alex’s:  
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]  
\[ 16 = 16 \]  
This holds true.  

The solution satisfies both conditions.
