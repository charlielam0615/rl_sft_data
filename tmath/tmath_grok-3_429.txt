**Problem Statement**: We need to determine how many pennies Bob currently has based on two conditions: (1) If Alex gives Bob one penny, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex; (2) If Bob gives Alex one penny, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Define variables for Alex’s and Bob’s current pennies.  
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions.  
3. Solve the equations to find Bob’s pennies.  
4. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem’s conditions. Let Alex have \( A \) pennies and Bob have \( B \) pennies. Translate the two scenarios into algebraic equations to represent the relationships described.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( A \) be the number of pennies Alex currently has, and \( B \) be the number of pennies Bob currently has.  
- **Condition 1**: If Alex gives Bob one penny, Alex has \( A - 1 \) pennies, and Bob has \( B + 1 \) pennies. Bob’s pennies are three times Alex’s:  
  \[
  B + 1 = 3(A - 1)
  \]  
- **Condition 2**: If Bob gives Alex one penny, Bob has \( B - 1 \) pennies, and Alex has \( A + 1 \) pennies. Bob’s pennies are twice Alex’s:  
  \[
  B - 1 = 2(A + 1)
  \]  
These equations represent the problem’s conditions.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the value of \( B \), the number of pennies Bob has. Use algebraic methods to solve the equations simultaneously.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, we have:  
1. \( B + 1 = 3(A - 1) \)  
2. \( B - 1 = 2(A + 1) \)

Simplify the equations:  
- Equation 1: \( B + 1 = 3A - 3 \implies B = 3A - 4 \)  
- Equation 2: \( B - 1 = 2A + 2 \implies B = 2A + 3 \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal:  
\[
3A - 4 = 2A + 3
\]  
Solve for \( A \):  
\[
3A - 2A = 3 + 4 \implies A = 7
\]  
Substitute \( A = 7 \) into \( B = 3A - 4 \):  
\[
B = 3(7) - 4 = 21 - 4 = 17
\]  
So, Alex has 7 pennies, and Bob has 17 pennies.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if \( A = 7 \) and \( B = 17 \) satisfy both conditions of the problem.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check **Condition 1**: If Alex gives Bob one penny, Alex has \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) pennies, and Bob has \( 17 + 1 = 18 \) pennies. Is Bob’s amount three times Alex’s?  
\[
18 = 3 \times 6 \quad \text{(True)}
\]  
Check **Condition 2**: If Bob gives Alex one penny, Bob has \( 17 - 1 = 16 \) pennies, and Alex has \( 7 + 1 = 8 \) pennies. Is Bob’s amount twice Alex’s?  
\[
16 = 2 \times 8 \quad \text{(True)}
\]  
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.
