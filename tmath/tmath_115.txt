[IMP]
To find the roots of the quadratic equation $-b^2+7b-10 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:
$$ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} $$
In this case, $A = -1$, $B = 7$, and $C = -10$. Plugging these values into the formula:
$$ b = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 - 4(-1)(-10)}}{2(-1)} $$
$$ b = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 40}}{-2} $$
$$ b = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{9}}{-2} $$
$$ b = \frac{-7 \pm 3}{-2} $$
$$ b = \frac{-7 + 3}{-2} \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{-7 - 3}{-2} $$
$$ b = \frac{-4}{-2} \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{-10}{-2} $$
$$ b = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad b = 5 $$

Goal of this step: Determine the intervals where the inequality $-b^2+7b-10 \ge 0$ holds.

The roots of the quadratic equation $-b^2+7b-10 = 0$ are $b = 2$ and $b = 5$. These roots divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, 2)$, $(2, 5)$, and $(5, \infty)$.  

To determine the sign of the quadratic expression $-b^2+7b-10$ in each interval, we can test a value from each interval in the inequality:

1. **Interval $(-\infty, 2)$: Test $b = 0$**
   $$
   -0^2 + 7(0) - 10 = -10 < 0
   $$
   The expression is negative in this interval.

2. **Interval $(2, 5)$: Test $b = 3$**
   $$
   -3^2 + 7(3) - 10 = -9 + 21 - 10 = 2 \ge 0
   $$
   The expression is non-negative in this interval.

3. **Interval $(5, \infty)$: Test $b = 6$**
   $$
   -6^2 + 7(6) - 10 = -36 + 42 - 10 = -4 < 0
   $$
   The expression is negative in this interval.

Since the inequality is non-strict ($\ge 0$), we also include the endpoints $b = 2$ and $b = 5$ in the solution set. Therefore, the inequality holds for $b \in [2, 5]$.

Goal of this step: Identify the greatest value of $ b $ for which the inequality is true.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we have determined that the inequality $ -b^2 + 7b - 10 \ge 0 $ is satisfied for $ b \in [2, 5] $. The greatest value of $ b $ within this interval is $ b = 5 $.  
Thus, the greatest value of $ b $ such that the inequality holds is $ 5 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution to the quadratic inequality and the identification of the greatest value of b.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Root Calculation Verification**:
   - The quadratic equation -b² +7b -10 = 0 was solved using the quadratic formula with coefficients A = -1, B = 7, C = -10.
   - Discriminant: $7^2 - 4(-1)(-10) = 49 - 40 = 9$ (correct).
   - Roots: $\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{9}}{-2} = \frac{-7 \pm 3}{-2}$, yielding $b = 2$ and $b = 5$ (correct).

2. **Interval Analysis Verification**:
   - The parabola opens downward (A = -1), so the expression is non-negative between the roots (2 and 5) (correct).
   - Test values:
     - $b = 0 \in (-\infty, 2)$: $-0^2 +7(0) -10 = -10 < 0$ (negative, correct).
     - $b = 3 \in (2, 5)$: $-9 +21 -10 = 2 \ge 0$ (non-negative, correct).
     - $b = 6 \in (5, \infty)$: $-36 +42 -10 = -4 < 0$ (negative, correct).
   - Inclusion of endpoints (2 and 5) due to the non-strict inequality (≥ 0) is valid.

3. **Final Answer Verification**:
   - The interval [2, 5] is correctly derived, and the greatest value in this interval is indeed $b = 5$ (correct).

All steps and conclusions are logically sound and mathematically accurate. No errors detected.
