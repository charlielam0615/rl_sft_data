**Problem Statement**: We need to find two numbers whose sum is 30, and when the larger number is doubled and three times the smaller number is subtracted, the result is 5. We then need to calculate the positive difference between these two numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for the two numbers.
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the numbers.
4. Calculate the positive difference between the two numbers.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations based on the problem's conditions.
How to Achieve: Let the larger number be \( x \) and the smaller number be \( y \). Use the given conditions to form two equations: one for the sum of the numbers and another for the condition involving doubling the larger number and subtracting three times the smaller number.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the larger number be \( x \) and the smaller number be \( y \). From the problem:
1. The sum of the two numbers is 30: \( x + y = 30 \).
2. Doubling the larger number and subtracting three times the smaller number gives 5: \( 2x - 3y = 5 \).
These equations form a system to be solved.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
How to Achieve: Use the substitution or elimination method to solve the system of equations \( x + y = 30 \) and \( 2x - 3y = 5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the system:
\[
x + y = 30 \quad (1)
\]
\[
2x - 3y = 5 \quad (2)
\]
From equation (1), express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[
x = 30 - y
\]
Substitute into equation (2):
\[
2(30 - y) - 3y = 5
\]
\[
60 - 2y - 3y = 5
\]
\[
60 - 5y = 5
\]
\[
-5y = -55
\]
\[
y = 11
\]
Substitute \( y = 11 \) into equation (1):
\[
x + 11 = 30
\]
\[
x = 19
\]
So, the larger number \( x = 19 \) and the smaller number \( y = 11 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the values satisfy both conditions.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 11 \) into both equations to ensure they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first condition: \( x + y = 30 \)
\[
19 + 11 = 30
\]
This is satisfied.
Check the second condition: \( 2x - 3y = 5 \)
\[
2(19) - 3(11) = 38 - 33 = 5
\]
This is also satisfied. The solution \( x = 19 \), \( y = 11 \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the positive difference between the two numbers.
How to Achieve: Compute the absolute difference between the larger number (\( x = 19 \)) and the smaller number (\( y = 11 \)).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The positive difference is:
\[
|x - y| = |19 - 11| = 8
\]
[/IMP]
