### Problem Statement
We need to find two numbers whose sum is 30, and when the larger number is doubled and three times the smaller number is subtracted, the result is 5. We are tasked with finding the positive difference between these two numbers. Using the meta-cognitive action set (M), we will solve this step-by-step, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and formatting the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the two numbers and their positive difference:  
1. Define variables for the two numbers.  
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the numbers.  
4. Calculate the positive difference between the numbers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem's conditions. We will assign variables to the two numbers, ensuring one is larger, and translate the given conditions into mathematical equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the larger number be \( x \) and the smaller number be \( y \), where \( x \geq y \).  
From the problem:  
1. The sum of the two numbers is 30:  
   \( x + y = 30 \)  
2. Double the larger number minus three times the smaller number equals 5:  
   \( 2x - 3y = 5 \)  
We now have the system of equations:  
- \( x + y = 30 \)  
- \( 2x - 3y = 5 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \). We will use substitution or elimination to solve the equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
We have the equations:  
1. \( x + y = 30 \)  
2. \( 2x - 3y = 5 \)  

Solve the first equation for \( x \):  
\( x = 30 - y \)  

Substitute \( x = 30 - y \) into the second equation:  
\( 2(30 - y) - 3y = 5 \)  
\( 60 - 2y - 3y = 5 \)  
\( 60 - 5y = 5 \)  
\( -5y = 5 - 60 \)  
\( -5y = -55 \)  
\( y = 11 \)  

Now substitute \( y = 11 \) back into \( x = 30 - y \):  
\( x = 30 - 11 = 19 \)  

So, the larger number \( x = 19 \) and the smaller number \( y = 11 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 11 \) satisfy both conditions of the problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the first condition:  
\( x + y = 19 + 11 = 30 \), which satisfies \( x + y = 30 \).  

Check the second condition:  
\( 2x - 3y = 2(19) - 3(11) = 38 - 33 = 5 \), which satisfies \( 2x - 3y = 5 \).  

Since \( x = 19 \geq y = 11 \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the positive difference between the two numbers. The positive difference is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the larger and smaller numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The larger number is \( x = 19 \), and the smaller number is \( y = 11 \).  
The positive difference is:  
\( |x - y| = |19 - 11| = 8 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the positive difference between two numbers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for the two numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the problem's conditions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations to find the numbers (completed: \( x = 19 \), \( y = 11 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate the positive difference (completed: 8).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, which is the positive difference between the two numbers.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The positive difference between the two numbers is 8.
