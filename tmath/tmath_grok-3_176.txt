### Problem Statement
We need to find the dimensions of a rectangle with integer length and width that has a perimeter of 100 units and minimizes the area. The area is calculated as length Ã— width, and we need to express the final answer in square units.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the rectangle with a perimeter of 100 units and the least possible area.  
Subgoals:  
1. Express the perimeter in terms of length and width.  
2. Derive the area as a function of one variable.  
3. Minimize the area while ensuring length and width are integers.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it yields the smallest area.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the perimeter in terms of length and width and use it to formulate the area. We will define the perimeter equation and express one variable in terms of the other to set up the area function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) and the width be \( W \), both integers. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:  
\[ 2L + 2W = 100 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ L + W = 50 \]  
Solve for \( L \):  
\[ L = 50 - W \]  
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is:  
\[ A = L \cdot W = (50 - W) \cdot W = 50W - W^2 \]  
This gives us the area as a function of \( W \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to minimize the area \( A = 50W - W^2 \) while ensuring \( W \) and \( L = 50 - W \) are positive integers. We will find the integer value of \( W \) that minimizes the area by analyzing the quadratic function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The area function is \( A = 50W - W^2 \), or equivalently, \( A = -W^2 + 50W \). This is a quadratic function in \( W \), with a negative coefficient for \( W^2 \), so it opens downward, and the maximum area occurs at the vertex. To find the vertex:  
\[ W = \frac{-b}{2a} \]  
where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 50 \):  
\[ W = \frac{-50}{2(-1)} = 25 \]  
At \( W = 25 \), compute \( L \):  
\[ L = 50 - 25 = 25 \]  
The area is:  
\[ A = 25 \cdot 25 = 625 \]  
Since the parabola opens downward, the area decreases as \( W \) moves away from 25 in either direction. However, we need the minimum area, so we test integer values of \( W \) to find where the area is smallest while keeping \( L = 50 - W \) a positive integer (i.e., \( W < 50 \)).  
Try \( W = 1 \):  
\[ L = 50 - 1 = 49 \]  
\[ A = 1 \cdot 49 = 49 \]  
Try \( W = 2 \):  
\[ L = 50 - 2 = 48 \]  
\[ A = 2 \cdot 48 = 96 \]  
Try \( W = 49 \):  
\[ L = 50 - 49 = 1 \]  
\[ A = 49 \cdot 1 = 49 \]  
The areas at \( W = 1 \) and \( W = 49 \) are both 49, which is less than 625. Test a few more values to confirm:  
Try \( W = 3 \):  
\[ L = 50 - 3 = 47 \]  
\[ A = 3 \cdot 47 = 141 \]  
The area increases as \( W \) moves away from 1 or 49. Thus, the minimum area seems to be 49 square units when \( (L, W) = (49, 1) \) or \( (1, 49) \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether 49 square units is the least possible area by checking if other integer pairs \( (L, W) \) satisfying \( L + W = 50 \) yield a smaller area. We will test additional values of \( W \) systematically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test more values of \( W \):  
- \( W = 5 \):  
  \[ L = 50 - 5 = 45 \]  
  \[ A = 5 \cdot 45 = 225 \]  
- \( W = 10 \):  
  \[ L = 50 - 10 = 40 \]  
  \[ A = 10 \cdot 40 = 400 \]  
- \( W = 48 \):  
  \[ L = 50 - 48 = 2 \]  
  \[ A = 48 \cdot 2 = 96 \]  
Since \( L + W = 50 \), the pairs are symmetric (e.g., \( (L, W) = (1, 49) \) is equivalent to \( (49, 1) \)). The smallest area found is 49 square units when \( W = 1 \) or \( W = 49 \). To ensure no smaller area exists, note that \( W = 0 \) or \( W = 50 \) makes \( L = 50 - W \) non-positive, which is invalid for a rectangle. Thus, 49 appears to be the minimum.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the rectangle with integer length and width, perimeter 100 units, and least possible area.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the perimeter in terms of length and width (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the area as a function of one variable (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize the area with integer constraints (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the area of 49 square units is the least possible by finalizing the validation.  
The minimum area of 49 square units was found for \( (L, W) = (49, 1) \) or \( (1, 49) \). All tested integer pairs satisfying \( L + W = 50 \) yield areas greater than or equal to 49.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the minimum area by recalling all relevant calculations to ensure no smaller area was overlooked. We will summarize the area calculations for key integer pairs.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Recalling previous steps:  
- Perimeter constraint: \( L + W = 50 \).  
- Area function: \( A = W \cdot (50 - W) \).  
- Tested pairs:  
  - \( W = 1 \), \( L = 49 \): \( A = 49 \).  
  - \( W = 2 \), \( L = 48 \): \( A = 96 \).  
  - \( W = 3 \), \( L = 47 \): \( A = 141 \).  
  - \( W = 5 \), \( L = 45 \): \( A = 225 \).  
  - \( W = 10 \), \( L = 40 \): \( A = 400 \).  
  - \( W = 25 \), \( L = 25 \): \( A = 625 \).  
  - \( W = 49 \), \( L = 1 \): \( A = 49 \).  
The smallest area is consistently 49 square units at \( W = 1 \) or \( W = 49 \). No integer \( W \) (from 1 to 49) yields a smaller area, as the quadratic function increases as \( W \) moves away from these extremes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The least possible area of a rectangle with integer length and width and a perimeter of 100 units is 49 square units, achieved when the dimensions are \( (49, 1) \) or \( (1, 49) \).
