**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a rectangle with integer length and width, a perimeter of 100 units, and the smallest possible area in square units.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the rectangle with the least possible area given a perimeter of 100 units and integer dimensions, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Express the perimeter in terms of length and width.  
2. Derive the area as a function of one variable.  
3. Find integer dimensions that minimize the area while satisfying the perimeter constraint.  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the perimeter in terms of length and width.  
How to Achieve: Use the perimeter formula for a rectangle, \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width, and set it equal to 100. Solve for one variable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \( P = 2(l + w) \). Given \( P = 100 \), we have:  
\[ 2(l + w) = 100 \]  
\[ l + w = 50 \]  
\[ w = 50 - l \]  
This expresses the width \( w \) in terms of the length \( l \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Derive the area as a function of one variable.  
How to Achieve: Use the area formula \( A = l \cdot w \) and substitute \( w = 50 - l \) to express the area in terms of \( l \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The area of a rectangle is \( A = l \cdot w \). Substituting \( w = 50 - l \), we get:  
\[ A = l \cdot (50 - l) \]  
\[ A = 50l - l^2 \]  
This is a quadratic function in terms of \( l \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find integer dimensions that minimize the area while satisfying the perimeter constraint.  
How to Achieve: Since \( A = 50l - l^2 \) is a quadratic function opening downward (as the coefficient of \( l^2 \) is negative), the maximum area occurs at the vertex. To minimize the area, test integer values of \( l \) from 1 to 49 (since \( l + w = 50 \), and \( l, w \geq 1 \)). Compute the area for each and identify the minimum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The area function is \( A = 50l - l^2 \). Since \( l \) and \( w = 50 - l \) must be positive integers, \( l \) ranges from 1 to 49. The function can be rewritten as:  
\[ A = l(50 - l) \]  
Test integer values of \( l \):  
- For \( l = 1 \), \( w = 50 - 1 = 49 \), \( A = 1 \cdot 49 = 49 \).  
- For \( l = 2 \), \( w = 50 - 2 = 48 \), \( A = 2 \cdot 48 = 96 \).  
- For \( l = 3 \), \( w = 50 - 3 = 47 \), \( A = 3 \cdot 47 = 141 \).  
- For \( l = 10 \), \( w = 50 - 10 = 40 \), \( A = 10 \cdot 40 = 400 \).  
- For \( l = 25 \), \( w = 50 - 25 = 25 \), \( A = 25 \cdot 25 = 625 \).  
- For \( l = 49 \), \( w = 50 - 49 = 1 \), \( A = 49 \cdot 1 = 49 \).  

Notice the symmetry: \( A(l) = A(50 - l) \), since \( l \cdot (50 - l) = (50 - l) \cdot l \). The area increases as \( l \) approaches 25 (where \( l = w = 25 \), giving \( A = 625 \)) and decreases toward the extremes (\( l = 1 \) or \( l = 49 \)). The smallest area so far is 49 when \( l = 1, w = 49 \) or \( l = 49, w = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if 49 square units is the least possible area.  
How to Achieve: Check if other integer pairs yielding a perimeter of 100 produce a smaller area and confirm the perimeter constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The smallest area found is 49 square units when \( l = 1, w = 49 \) or \( l = 49, w = 1 \). Verify the perimeter:  
\[ 2(l + w) = 2(1 + 49) = 2 \cdot 50 = 100 \]  
This satisfies the perimeter constraint. Consider other possible integer pairs:  
- If \( l = 0 \), \( w = 50 \), then \( A = 0 \cdot 50 = 0 \), but a rectangle with zero length or width is degenerate and not typically valid.  
- All other pairs (e.g., \( l = 2, w = 48 \), \( A = 96 \)) yield larger areas, as seen in the previous step.  
Since \( l \) and \( w \) must be positive integers, and the area increases as \( l \) moves away from the extremes, the minimum area is indeed 49 square units.

  - Subgoal 2: Derive area as a function of one variable (completed: \( A = l(50 - l) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find integer dimensions minimizing area (completed: \( l = 1, w = 49 \) or \( l = 49, w = 1 \), area = 49).
