### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of possible combinations of one yogurt flavor and two different toppings, given that the yogurt shop offers four flavors and six different toppings.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the number of ways to choose one yogurt flavor.
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose two different toppings from the available toppings.
3. Combine the results to find the total number of combinations.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose one yogurt flavor.
How to Achieve: Since there are four yogurt flavors, count the number of choices for selecting one flavor.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With four yogurt flavors available, there are 4 ways to choose one flavor.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose two different toppings from six toppings.
How to Achieve: Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 6 \) (toppings) and \( k = 2 \) (toppings to choose). This accounts for selecting two toppings where the order does not matter.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( C(6, 2) \):
\[
C(6, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]
There are 15 ways to choose two different toppings from six.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine the results to find the total number of combinations.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of flavor choices by the number of topping pair choices, as each flavor can be paired with each unique pair of toppings.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the number of flavor choices (4) by the number of topping pair choices (15):
\[
4 \cdot 15 = 60
\]
There are 60 possible combinations of one flavor and two different toppings.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of combinations of one yogurt flavor and two different toppings.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose one yogurt flavor (completed: 4 ways).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two different toppings (completed: 15 ways).
  - Subgoal 3: Combine the results to find the total number of combinations (completed: 60 combinations).
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, with the final answer being 60 combinations.
