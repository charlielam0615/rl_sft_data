Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations $ x - y = 2 $ and $ x \cdot y = 120 $ to find $ x $ and $ y $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given the following two equations:  
1. $ x - y = 2 $  
2. $ x \cdot y = 120 $  

From the first equation, we can express $ x $ in terms of $ y $:  
$$ x = y + 2 $$  

Substitute $ x = y + 2 $ into the second equation:  
$$ (y + 2) \cdot y = 120 $$  
$$ y^2 + 2y = 120 $$  
$$ y^2 + 2y - 120 = 0 $$  

We now solve this quadratic equation. Factoring $ y^2 + 2y - 120 $:  
$$ (y + 12)(y - 10) = 0 $$  

This gives $ y = -12 $ or $ y = 10 $. Since we are told the numbers are positive integers, we discard $ y = -12 $ and take $ y = 10 $.  

Substitute $ y = 10 $ back into $ x = y + 2 $:  
$$ x = 10 + 2 = 12 $$  

Thus, the two numbers are $ x = 12 $ and $ y = 10 $.  

Finally, compute the correct sum:  
$$ x + y = 12 + 10 = 22 $$

[VERIFY]
1. Verify the system of equations:
   - Juan's subtraction: $ x - y = 2 $
   - Maria's multiplication: $ x \cdot y = 120 $
   These equations correctly model the problem constraints.

2. Check algebraic manipulation:
   - Substituting $ x = y + 2 $ into $ x \cdot y = 120 $:
     $ (y + 2)y = 120 \Rightarrow y^2 + 2y - 120 = 0 $
     This is algebraically correct.

3. Validate quadratic solution:
   - Factoring $ y^2 + 2y - 120 $:
     $ (y + 12)(y - 10) = 0 \Rightarrow y = -12 $ or $ y = 10 $
     This factorization is correct since $ (-12)(10) = -120 $ and $ (-12) + 10 = -2 $, but the middle term is +2, so the correct substitution should actually be $ y = 10 $.

4. Confirm solution validity:
   - For $ y = 10 $, $ x = 12 $:
     $ 12 - 10 = 2 $ ✓ (matches Juan's result)
     $ 12 \cdot 10 = 120 $ ✓ (matches Maria's result)

5. Final answer calculation:
   $ x + y = 12 + 10 = 22 $ ✓

All steps are logically sound and verify the solution. The correct answer is 22.
