### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the probability that, when 10 pieces of art (including 3 prints by Escher) are hung in a row in a random order, all three Escher prints are placed consecutively (i.e., they form a contiguous block).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Determine the total number of possible arrangements of the 10 pieces of art.
2. Calculate the number of favorable arrangements where the 3 Escher prints are consecutive.
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements of the 10 pieces of art.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the 10 pieces are distinct, compute the number of permutations of 10 items, which is 10 factorial (10!).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of possible arrangements is the number of ways to arrange 10 distinct pieces of art in a row. This is given by:
\[ 10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3,628,800 \]
So, there are 3,628,800 possible arrangements.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of favorable arrangements where the 3 Escher prints are consecutive.  
**How to Achieve**: Treat the 3 Escher prints as a single "block" or super-piece. This reduces the problem to arranging 8 units (the Escher block + the 7 non-Escher pieces). Then, account for the arrangements within the Escher block.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the number of favorable arrangements:
- Treat the 3 Escher prints as a single block. This gives us 8 units to arrange: the Escher block and the 7 other pieces.
- The number of ways to arrange these 8 units is \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320 \).
- Within the Escher block, the 3 Escher prints can be arranged among themselves in \( 3! = 6 \) ways.
- Thus, the total number of favorable arrangements is:
  \[ 8! \times 3! = 40,320 \times 6 = 241,920 \].
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability that the 3 Escher prints are consecutive.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable arrangements (from Step 3) by the total number of arrangements (from Step 2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability is the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{241,920}{3,628,800} \]
Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{241,920}{3,628,800} = \frac{241,920 \div 120}{3,628,800 \div 120} = \frac{2,016}{30,240} = \frac{2,016 \div 48}{30,240 \div 48} = \frac{42}{630} = \frac{42 \div 42}{630 \div 42} = \frac{1}{15} \]
Thus, the probability is:
\[ \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the probability calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Use an alternative approach to confirm the number of favorable arrangements and check the probability.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
An alternative way to compute the favorable arrangements is to choose 3 consecutive positions for the Escher prints:
- There are 10 positions in the row. For 3 consecutive positions, the block can start at positions 1 through 8 (e.g., positions 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 8-9-10), giving 8 possible starting points.
- For each starting point, the 3 Escher prints can be arranged in \( 3! = 6 \) ways.
- The remaining 7 positions are filled by the 7 non-Escher pieces in \( 7! = 5,040 \) ways.
- Total favorable arrangements:
  \[ 8 \times 3! \times 7! = 8 \times 6 \times 5,040 = 241,920 \]
This matches the result from Step 3, confirming the number of favorable arrangements.
The probability is:
\[ \frac{241,920}{3,628,800} = \frac{1}{15} \]
The calculation is consistent, so the result is valid.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that all three Escher prints are placed consecutively.
  - Subgoal 1: Compute the total number of arrangements (completed: 10! = 3,628,800).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the number of favorable arrangements where the 3 Escher prints are consecutive (completed: 241,920).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability (completed: \( \frac{1}{15} \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed: confirmed using alternative approach).
**Current Goal**: None (problem solved, all subgoals completed).

### Final Answer
The probability that all three Escher prints are placed consecutively when 10 pieces of art are hung in a random order is:
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{15}} \]
