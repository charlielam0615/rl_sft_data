**Problem Statement**: A jar contains 2 red marbles, 3 green marbles, and 10 white marbles, totaling 15 marbles. Two marbles are drawn randomly without replacement. We need to calculate the probability that both marbles drawn are red and express the answer as a common fraction.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability of drawing two red marbles:  
1. Determine the total number of marbles and possible outcomes for drawing two marbles.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where both marbles are red.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a fraction.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outcomes for drawing two marbles and the number of favorable outcomes where both are red. This will be achieved by using combinatorial methods to count the outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of marbles is 2 (red) + 3 (green) + 10 (white) = 15.  
- **Total outcomes**: The number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 15 without replacement is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).  
  \( C(15, 2) = \frac{15 \cdot 14}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{210}{2} = 105 \).  
- **Favorable outcomes**: There are 2 red marbles, so the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles is:  
  \( C(2, 2) = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \).  
The probability will be calculated in a later step after confirming these counts.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the total and favorable outcomes calculated in the previous step. This will be done by checking the combinatorial calculations and ensuring they align with the problemâ€™s constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Verify total outcomes**: The total number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 15 is \( C(15, 2) = \frac{15 \cdot 14}{2} = 105 \). This is correct, as the formula accounts for unordered selections without replacement.  
- **Verify favorable outcomes**: The number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 2 is \( C(2, 2) = 1 \), which is correct since there are exactly 2 red marbles, and we need both.  
- **Check constraints**: The problem specifies no replacement, and the marble counts (2 red, 3 green, 10 white) sum to 15, confirming the calculations are consistent with the problem setup.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability using the verified counts of favorable and total outcomes and express it as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The probability of drawing two red marbles is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  
- Favorable outcomes: 1 (from \( C(2, 2) \)).  
- Total outcomes: 105 (from \( C(15, 2) \)).  
Thus, the probability is:  
\[ \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{1}{105} \].  
The fraction \( \frac{1}{105} \) is in its simplest form, as 1 and 105 have no common factors other than 1.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that both marbles drawn are red, expressed as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of marbles and possible outcomes (completed: 15 marbles, 105 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (completed: 1 favorable outcome).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability as a fraction (completed: \( \frac{1}{105} \)).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer and ensure all subgoals are addressed. The probability \( \frac{1}{105} \) has been calculated and appears complete.

**Final Answer**: The probability that both marbles drawn are red is \( \frac{1}{105} \).
