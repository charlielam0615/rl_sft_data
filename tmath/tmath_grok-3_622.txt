**Problem Restatement**: A jar contains 2 red marbles, 3 green marbles, and 10 white marbles, making a total of 15 marbles. Two marbles are drawn randomly without replacement. We need to calculate the probability that both marbles drawn are red and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of marbles in the jar.  
2. Calculate the total number of ways to draw two marbles without replacement.  
3. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where both marbles drawn are red.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of marbles and calculate the total number of ways to draw two marbles without replacement. This can be achieved by summing the marbles to find the total and using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \) to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 marbles from the total.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The jar contains 2 red + 3 green + 10 white = 15 marbles.  
The total number of ways to draw 2 marbles from 15 without replacement is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 15 \) and \( k = 2 \):  
\[ \binom{15}{2} = \frac{15 \times 14}{2 \times 1} = \frac{210}{2} = 105 \]  
So, there are 105 possible outcomes when drawing 2 marbles.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where both marbles drawn are red. This can be achieved by using the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from the 2 available red marbles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
There are 2 red marbles. The number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 2 is:  
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2 \times 1}{2 \times 1 \times 1} = 1 \]  
So, there is exactly 1 favorable outcome where both marbles are red.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes and express it as a common fraction. This can be achieved by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (from Step 3) by the total number of outcomes (from Step 2).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability of drawing two red marbles is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:  
\[ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 red marbles}}{\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 marbles}} = \frac{1}{105} \]  
The fraction \( \frac{1}{105} \) is already in its simplest form, as 1 and 105 have no common factors other than 1.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculations by checking the total number of marbles, the combination calculations, and the probability computation. This can be achieved by reviewing the inputs and rechecking the formulas used.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Check total marbles**: 2 red + 3 green + 10 white = 15 marbles. Correct.  
- **Check total outcomes**: \( \binom{15}{2} = \frac{15 \times 14}{2} = 105 \). Correct, as \( 15 \times 14 = 210 \), and \( 210 \div 2 = 105 \).  
- **Check favorable outcomes**: \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \). Correct, as there are only 2 red marbles, so choosing both is 1 way.  
- **Check probability**: \( \frac{1}{105} \). The fraction is in simplest form, and the logic follows the rules of probability without replacement.  
The calculations are consistent and correct.
