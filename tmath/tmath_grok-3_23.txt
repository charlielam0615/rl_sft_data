**Problem Restatement**: We need to solve the quadratic equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\) and find the smallest possible value of the expression \(2a + 1\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the given equation by moving all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation.
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the possible values of \(a\).
3. Evaluate the expression \(2a + 1\) for each solution of \(a\).
4. Determine the smallest value of \(2a + 1\).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the given equation to form a standard quadratic equation.
How to Achieve: Move all terms to one side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 4 - 3 = 0 \]
Simplify:
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0 \]
The equation is now in standard quadratic form: \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\) to find the values of \(a\).
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where the coefficients are \(A = 6\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 1\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\), identify the coefficients:
- \(A = 6\)
- \(b = 5\)
- \(c = 1\)

Apply the quadratic formula:
\[ a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4Ac}}{2A} \]
Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4Ac = 5^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 25 - 24 = 1 \]
Now compute:
\[ a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{12} \]

This gives two solutions:
- \( a_1 = \frac{-5 + 1}{12} = \frac{-4}{12} = -\frac{1}{3} \)
- \( a_2 = \frac{-5 - 1}{12} = \frac{-6}{12} = -\frac{1}{2} \)

So, the solutions are \( a = -\frac{1}{3} \) and \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible value of \(2a + 1\) given \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation to standard quadratic form (Completed: \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation for \(a\) (Completed: \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\), \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Evaluate \(2a + 1\) for each solution of \(a\).
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the smallest value of \(2a + 1\).

Current Goal: Evaluate \(2a + 1\) for each solution of \(a\).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Evaluate the expression \(2a + 1\) for each solution of \(a\).
How to Achieve: Substitute \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\) and \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\) into the expression \(2a + 1\) and compute the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( a = -\frac{1}{3} \):
\[ 2a + 1 = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \]

For \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \):
\[ 2a + 1 = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 \]

The values of \(2a + 1\) are \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(0\).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the smallest value of \(2a + 1\).
How to Achieve: Compare the computed values of \(2a + 1\), which are \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(0\), to identify the smallest one.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the values:
- \(\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333\)
- \(0\)

Since \(0 < \frac{1}{3}\), the smallest value of \(2a + 1\) is \(0\).
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the solutions satisfy the original equation and confirm the smallest value.
How to Achieve: Substitute \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\) and \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\) back into the original equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\) to ensure correctness, and recheck the smallest value of \(2a + 1\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify for \( a = -\frac{1}{3} \):
\[ 6 \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + 4 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{9} - \frac{5}{3} + 4 = \frac{6}{9} - \frac{5}{3} + \frac{12}{3} = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{5}{3} + \frac{12}{3} = \frac{2 - 5 + 12}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]
The equation holds.

Verify for \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \):
\[ 6 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 4 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - \frac{5}{2} + 4 = \frac{6}{4} - \frac{5}{2} + \frac{8}{2} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{5}{2} + \frac{8}{2} = \frac{3 - 5 + 8}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
The equation holds.

Both solutions are valid. Recheck \(2a + 1\):
- For \( a = -\frac{1}{3} \): \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- For \( a = -\frac{1}{2} \): \( 0 \)

The smallest value is still \(0\).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The smallest possible value of \(2a + 1\) is \(0\).
