### Problem Restatement
We need to solve the quadratic equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\) and find the smallest possible value of the expression \(2a + 1\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation by moving all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation.  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the possible values of \(a\).  
3. Evaluate the expression \(2a + 1\) for each value of \(a\).  
4. Determine the smallest value of \(2a + 1\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\) into a standard quadratic form. This will be achieved by subtracting 3 from both sides to set the equation equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3 \]  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 4 - 3 = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard quadratic form: \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\) to find the values of \(a\). This will be achieved by applying the quadratic formula, where for a quadratic equation \(pa^2 + qa + r = 0\), the solutions are given by:  
\[ a = \frac{-q \pm \sqrt{q^2 - 4pr}}{2p} \]  
Here, \(p = 6\), \(q = 5\), and \(r = 1\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the quadratic formula to \(6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0\):  
- Coefficients: \(p = 6\), \(q = 5\), \(r = 1\).  
- Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = q^2 - 4pr = 5^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 25 - 24 = 1 \]  
- Solutions:  
\[ a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{12} \]  
Calculate the two roots:  
1. \[ a_1 = \frac{-5 + 1}{12} = \frac{-4}{12} = -\frac{1}{3} \]  
2. \[ a_2 = \frac{-5 - 1}{12} = \frac{-6}{12} = -\frac{1}{2} \]  
Thus, the possible values of \(a\) are \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\) and \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solutions \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\) and \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\) by substituting them back into the original equation \(6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3\) to ensure they are correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\):  
\[ 6\left(-\frac{1}{3}\ generalized^2 + 5\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + 4 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{9} - \frac{5}{3} + 4 = \frac{6}{9} - \frac{15}{9} + \frac{36}{9} = \frac{6 - 15 + 36}{9} = \frac{27}{9} = 3 \]  
This satisfies the equation.  

Substitute \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\):  
\[ 6\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 4 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - \frac{5}{2} + 4 = \frac{6}{4} - \frac{10}{4} + \frac{16}{4} = \frac{6 - 10 + 16}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]  
This also satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate the expression \(2a + 1\) for each value of \(a\) (\(-\frac{1}{3}\) and \(-\frac{1}{2}\)) to find its values, then identify the smallest one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Evaluate \(2a + 1\) for \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\):  
\[ 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]  

Evaluate \(2a + 1\) for \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\):  
\[ 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 \]  

Compare the values:  
- For \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\), \(2a + 1 = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333\).  
- For \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\), \(2a + 1 = 0\).  
The smallest value is \(0\).

The smallest possible value of \(2a + 1\) is \(0\).
