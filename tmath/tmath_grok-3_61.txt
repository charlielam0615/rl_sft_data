### Problem Statement
We need to find the 5th term of a sequence of positive integers where each term after the first is defined as one-third of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it. We are given that the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34.

Let’s denote the sequence as \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, \ldots \), where:
- \( a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_4 = 34 \)
- For each term \( n \geq 2 \), the sequence satisfies the condition:
  \[
  a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1})
  \]
We need to determine \( a_5 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( a_5 \). Since the sequence is defined by a recursive relationship, we can:
1. Use the given condition \( a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) \) to set up equations for the terms.
2. Leverage the known values \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( a_4 = 34 \) to derive other terms.
3. Solve for \( a_5 \) by working through the relationships, possibly by finding intermediate terms like \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \), or directly relating terms around \( a_4 \) and \( a_5 \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the sequence terms using the given condition and known values. We will apply the recursive formula \( a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) \) for terms around \( a_4 \) to find \( a_5 \), using \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( a_4 = 34 \). This involves setting up equations based on the recursive relationship and solving for unknown terms.

The recursive condition \( a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) \) can be rewritten for clarity:
\[
a_{n-1} + a_{n+1} = 3a_n
\]
Let’s apply this for \( n = 4 \), since we know \( a_4 = 34 \):
\[
a_3 + a_5 = 3 \cdot a_4 = 3 \cdot 34 = 102
\]
This gives us:
\[
a_3 + a_5 = 102 \quad (1)
\]
We need another equation to solve for \( a_5 \). Let’s try applying the condition for another term, such as \( n = 3 \):
\[
a_2 + a_4 = 3 \cdot a_3
\]
Substitute \( a_4 = 34 \):
\[
a_2 + 34 = 3a_3 \quad (2)
\]
We can also try \( n = 2 \):
\[
a_1 + a_3 = 3a_2
\]
Since \( a_1 = 2 \):
\[
2 + a_3 = 3a_2 \quad (3)
\]
Now we have three equations:
1. \( a_3 + a_5 = 102 \)
2. \( a_2 + 34 = 3a_3 \)
3. \( 2 + a_3 = 3a_2 \)

Let’s solve these. From equation (3):
\[
a_2 = \frac{2 + a_3}{3}
\]
Substitute into equation (2):
\[
\frac{2 + a_3}{3} + 34 = 3a_3
\]
Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
2 + a_3 + 102 = 9a_3
\]
\[
104 + a_3 = 9a_3
\]
\[
104 = 8a_3
\]
\[
a_3 = \frac{104}{8} = 13
\]
Now substitute \( a_3 = 13 \) into equation (1):
\[
13 + a_5 = 102
\]
\[
a_5 = 102 - 13 = 89
\]
Let’s compute \( a_2 \) to ensure consistency using equation (3):
\[
2 + 13 = 3a_2
\]
\[
15 = 3a_2
\]
\[
a_2 = 5
\]
Verify using equation (2):
\[
a_2 + 34 = 3a_3
\]
\[
5 + 34 = 39
\]
\[
3 \cdot 13 = 39
\]
The equations are consistent, suggesting \( a_2 = 5 \), \( a_3 = 13 \), and \( a_5 = 89 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed value of \( a_5 = 89 \). We will check if the sequence terms satisfy the recursive condition for all relevant terms and ensure the terms are positive integers, as required.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have:
- \( a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_2 = 5 \)
- \( a_3 = 13 \)
- \( a_4 = 34 \)
- \( a_5 = 89 \)

Check the recursive condition \( a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) \):
- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[
  a_2 = \frac{1}{3} (a_1 + a_3) = \frac{1}{3} (2 + 13) = \frac{15}{3} = 5
  \]
  This holds.
- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[
  a_3 = \frac{1}{3} (a_2 + a_4) = \frac{1}{3} (5 + 34) = \frac{39}{3} = 13
  \]
  This holds.
- For \( n = 4 \):
  \[
  a_4 = \frac{1}{3} (a_3 + a_5) = \frac{1}{3} (13 + 89) = \frac{102}{3} = 34
  \]
  This holds.
All terms are positive integers, and the recursive condition is satisfied for all relevant terms. The solution appears correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find the 5th term (\( a_5 \)) of the sequence.
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the recursive relationship using \( a_n = \frac{1}{3} (a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}) \).
  - Subgoal 2: Use given values \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( a_4 = 34 \) to derive equations.
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( a_5 \) and intermediate terms \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution by checking the recursive condition.

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer for \( a_5 \).

The calculations yielded \( a_5 = 89 \), and validation confirmed that the sequence \( a_1 = 2 \), \( a_2 = 5 \), \( a_3 = 13 \), \( a_4 = 34 \), \( a_5 = 89 \) satisfies all conditions. All subgoals have been addressed.
