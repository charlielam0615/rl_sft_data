### Problem Restatement
We need to find the 5th term of a sequence of positive integers where each term after the first satisfies the condition that it is one-third of the sum of the preceding and following terms. Given that the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34, we need to determine the 5th term.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the 5th term:
1. Define the sequence and the given condition mathematically.
2. Use the given terms (1st term = 2, 4th term = 34) to set up equations.
3. Solve for the 5th term using the relationships derived from the sequence rule.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define the sequence rule mathematically and set up equations based on the given terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Express the sequence condition as an equation for each term after the first, using the rule that each term is one-third of the sum of the preceding and following terms. Use the known terms (a₁ = 2, a₄ = 34) to form equations and initiate solving for a₅.

Let the sequence be \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, \ldots \), where \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( a_4 = 34 \). The problem states that each term after the first is one-third of the sum of the term before it and the term after it. For the \( n \)-th term (\( n \geq 2 \)):

\[
a_n = \frac{1}{3}(a_{n-1} + a_{n+1})
\]

Multiplying through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
3a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}
\]

Rearrange to form a recurrence relation:

\[
a_{n+1} = 3a_n - a_{n-1}
\]

This is a second-order linear recurrence relation. We can apply it to the terms around the known values. For \( n = 2 \):

\[
a_3 = 3a_2 - a_1
\]

Since \( a_1 = 2 \):

\[
a_3 = 3a_2 - 2
\]

For \( n = 3 \):

\[
a_4 = 3a_3 - a_2
\]

Since \( a_4 = 34 \), substitute:

\[
34 = 3a_3 - a_2
\]

For \( n = 4 \):

\[
a_5 = 3a_4 - a_3
\]

Since \( a_4 = 34 \):

\[
a_5 = 3 \cdot 34 - a_3 = 102 - a_3
\]

Now we have two key equations:
1. \( a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 \)
2. \( 34 = 3a_3 - a_2 \)

Additionally, we need \( a_5 \):

\[
a_5 = 102 - a_3
\]

The next step is to solve for \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \), and subsequently \( a_5 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( a_5 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equations \( a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 \) and \( 34 = 3a_3 - a_2 \) to solve for \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \), then compute \( a_5 = 102 - a_3 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, we have:

\[
a_3 = 3a_2 - 2
\]

\[
34 = 3a_3 - a_2
\]

Substitute \( a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 \) into the second equation:

\[
34 = 3(3a_2 - 2) - a_2
\]

\[
34 = 9a_2 - 6 - a_2
\]

\[
34 = 8a_2 - 6
\]

\[
8a_2 = 40
\]

\[
a_2 = 5
\]

Now, find \( a_3 \):

\[
a_3 = 3a_2 - 2 = 3 \cdot 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

Verify \( a_4 \):

\[
a_4 = 3a_3 - a_2 = 3 \cdot 13 - 5 = 39 - 5 = 34
\]

This matches the given \( a_4 = 34 \), confirming our calculations. Now compute \( a_5 \):

\[
a_5 = 102 - a_3 = 102 - 13 = 89
\]

So, the 5th term is \( a_5 = 89 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the computed 5th term satisfies the sequence’s rule.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if \( a_4 = \frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_5) \) holds using \( a_3 = 13 \), \( a_4 = 34 \), and \( a_5 = 89 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence rule for \( n = 4 \):

\[
a_4 = \frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_5)
\]

Substitute \( a_3 = 13 \), \( a_4 = 34 \), \( a_5 = 89 \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}(13 + 89) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 102 = 34
\]

This satisfies \( a_4 = 34 \), confirming that \( a_5 = 89 \) is consistent with the sequence rule.
