Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Let the three numbers be $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $. 
   1.1. The given sums are $ a + b = 29 $, $ a + c = 46 $, and $ b + c = 53 $.
2. Add all three equations to derive the total sum $ a + b + c $.
3. Solve for the total sum $ a + b + c $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Add all three equations $ a + b = 29 $, $ a + c = 46 $, and $ b + c = 53 $ to derive $ 2a + 2b + 2c $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Adding the three equations:

$$
(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 29 + 46 + 53
$$

$$
2a + 2b + 2c = 128
$$

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

$$
a + b + c = \frac{128}{2} = 64
$$

1. **Equation Setup Validation**:  
   The original problem states pairwise sums $ a + b = 29 $, $ a + c = 46 $, and $ b + c = 53 $. Adding these equations yields:  
   $$
   (a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 29 + 46 + 53
   $$  
   Simplifying the left-hand side (LHS):  
   $ 2a + 2b + 2c $, which is equivalent to $ 2(a + b + c) $.  
   This step is logically sound.

2. **Arithmetic Calculation Check**:  
   Summing the right-hand side (RHS):  
   $ 29 + 46 = 75 $, and $ 75 + 53 = 128 $.  
   This calculation is correct.

3. **Final Division Validation**:  
   Dividing both sides by 2:  
   $ a + b + c = \frac{128}{2} = 64 $.  
   This step is mathematically valid and correctly executed.

4. **Consistency Check**:  
   Substituting $ a + b + c = 64 $ into the original equations:  
   - $ c = 64 - (a + b) = 64 - 29 = 35 $.  
   - $ b = 64 - (a + c) = 64 - 46 = 18 $.  
   - $ a = 64 - (b + c) = 64 - 53 = 11 $.  
   Verifying pairwise sums:  
   - $ a + b = 11 + 18 = 29 $ ✔️  
   - $ a + c = 11 + 35 = 46 $ ✔️  
   - $ b + c = 18 + 35 = 53 $ ✔️  
   All values satisfy the original conditions.  

**Conclusion**: No errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The final result is consistent with all given constraints.
