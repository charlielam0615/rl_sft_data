**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( g \) such that \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \), where the operation is defined as \( a \bowtie b = a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \cdots}}} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( g \).  
1. Understand the operation \( a \bowtie b \) and express it mathematically.  
2. Set up the equation based on the given condition \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation to find \( g \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the operation \( a \bowtie b = a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \cdots}}} \) mathematically. This involves modeling the infinite nested radical. Let the nested radical \( \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \cdots}}} \) be denoted as \( x \). Since the expression inside the square root is the same as \( x \), we can set up the equation \( x = \sqrt{b + x} \). Then, \( a \bowtie b = a + x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( x = \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \cdots}}} \).  
Since the expression inside the square root is identical to \( x \), we write:  
\[ x = \sqrt{b + x} \]  
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[ x^2 = b + x \]  
Rearrange into a quadratic equation:  
\[ x^2 - x - b = 0 \]  
Thus, the operation is:  
\[ a \bowtie b = a + x \]  
where \( x \) satisfies \( x^2 - x - b = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for the given condition \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \). Using the expression from the previous step, substitute \( a = 7 \), \( b = g \), and set the result equal to 9. Solve for \( x \), then use the quadratic equation to find \( g \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \), we have:  
\[ 7 \bowtie g = 7 + x = 9 \]  
where \( x = \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \cdots}}} \).  
From \( 7 + x = 9 \), solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = 9 - 7 = 2 \]  
Now, \( x \) satisfies the equation \( x^2 - x - g = 0 \). Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ 2^2 - 2 - g = 0 \]  
\[ 4 - 2 - g = 0 \]  
\[ 2 - g = 0 \]  
\[ g = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( g = 2 \). Substitute \( g = 2 \) back into the original operation to check if \( 7 \bowtie 2 = 9 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( 7 \bowtie 2 \):  
\[ 7 \bowtie 2 = 7 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \cdots}}} \]  
Let \( x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \cdots}}} \). Then:  
\[ x = \sqrt{2 + x} \]  
Square both sides:  
\[ x^2 = 2 + x \]  
\[ x^2 - x - 2 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation:  
\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2} \]  
\[ x = 2 \text{ or } x = -1 \]  
Since \( x \) represents a nested radical, take the positive root \( x = 2 \).  
Thus:  
\[ 7 \bowtie 2 = 7 + x = 7 + 2 = 9 \]  
The condition holds, so \( g = 2 \) is valid.
