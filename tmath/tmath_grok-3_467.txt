**Problem Statement**: We need to solve for \( g \) in the equation \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \), where the operation \( \bowtie \) is defined as \( a \bowtie b = a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{b + \dots}}} \). This implies an infinite nested radical, and we need to find the value of \( g \) that satisfies the equation.

### Step 1: Understand the Operation and Set Up the Equation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Interpret the infinite nested radical \( \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \dots}}} \).  
2. Define the nested radical as a variable and set up an equation based on its infinite nature.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( g \).

### Step 2: Define the Nested Radical
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to interpret the infinite nested radical \( \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \dots}}} \) and express \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \). The approach is to define the nested radical as a variable \( x \) and use its self-referential property to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the infinite nested radical be \( x = \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \sqrt{g + \dots}}} \). Since the expression inside the outer square root is the same as \( x \), we can write:  
\[ x = \sqrt{g + x} \]  
From the definition of the operation, \( 7 \bowtie g = 7 + x \), and the equation states \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \). Thus:  
\[ 7 + x = 9 \]  
Solving for \( x \):  
\[ x = 9 - 7 = 2 \]  
Now we have:  
\[ x = \sqrt{g + x} \]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ 2 = \sqrt{g + 2} \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( g \)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 2 = \sqrt{g + 2} \) for \( g \). The approach is to square both sides to eliminate the square root and solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with:  
\[ 2 = \sqrt{g + 2} \]  
Square both sides to remove the square root:  
\[ 2^2 = (\sqrt{g + 2})^2 \]  
\[ 4 = g + 2 \]  
Solve for \( g \):  
\[ g = 4 - 2 = 2 \]  
Thus, \( g = 2 \).

### Step 4: Validate the Solution
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( g = 2 \) satisfies the original equation \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \). The approach is to substitute \( g = 2 \) into the operation and check if the result equals 9.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( g = 2 \) into the operation \( 7 \bowtie g \):  
\[ 7 \bowtie 2 = 7 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}} \]  
Let the nested radical be \( x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}} \). Then:  
\[ x = \sqrt{2 + x} \]  
Square both sides:  
\[ x^2 = 2 + x \]  
\[ x^2 - x - 2 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \), \( c = -2 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = -1 \]  
Since \( x \) represents a square root, \( x \geq 0 \), so \( x = 2 \).  
Now compute:  
\[ 7 \bowtie 2 = 7 + x = 7 + 2 = 9 \]  
This matches the given equation \( 7 \bowtie g = 9 \). The solution \( g = 2 \) is valid.
