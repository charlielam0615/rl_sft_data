**Problem Statement**: Point \( M(3,7) \) is the midpoint of segment \( \overline{AB} \). Point \( A \) has coordinates \( (9,3) \). We need to find the coordinates of point \( B \) and compute the sum of its coordinates.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coordinates of point \( B \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of \( B \).  
2. Solve these equations to find the coordinates of \( B \).  
3. Compute the sum of the coordinates of \( B \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of \( B \).  
**Description**: The midpoint formula states that for points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \), the midpoint \( M \) has coordinates \( \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \). Given \( M(3,7) \) and \( A(9,3) \), set up equations to solve for the coordinates of \( B(x_2, y_2) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the coordinates of \( B \) be \( (x, y) \). Using the midpoint formula:  
- For the x-coordinate: \( \frac{9 + x}{2} = 3 \)  
- For the y-coordinate: \( \frac{3 + y}{2} = 7 \)  

Solve for \( x \):  
\[ 9 + x = 6 \]  
\[ x = 6 - 9 = -3 \]  

Solve for \( y \):  
\[ 3 + y = 14 \]  
\[ y = 14 - 3 = 11 \]  

Thus, the coordinates of \( B \) are \( (-3, 11) \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the coordinates of \( B(-3, 11) \) are correct.  
**Description**: Check that \( M(3,7) \) is the midpoint of \( A(9,3) \) and \( B(-3,11) \) by applying the midpoint formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute the midpoint of \( A(9,3) \) and \( B(-3,11) \):  
- x-coordinate: \( \frac{9 + (-3)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)  
- y-coordinate: \( \frac{3 + 11}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \)  

The midpoint is \( (3,7) \), which matches \( M(3,7) \). The coordinates of \( B \) are valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the coordinates of point \( B \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for \( B \)’s coordinates (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the coordinates of \( B \) (completed, \( B(-3, 11) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the coordinates of \( B \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of \( B \)’s coordinates (current).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the coordinates of \( B(-3, 11) \).

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of the coordinates of \( B(-3, 11) \).  
**Description**: Add the x- and y-coordinates of point \( B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The coordinates of \( B \) are \( (-3, 11) \).  
Sum of coordinates: \( -3 + 11 = 8 \).  

**Final Answer**: The sum of the coordinates of point \( B \) is \( 8 \).
