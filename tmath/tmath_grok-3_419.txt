**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coordinates of point \( B \) and their sum, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of point \( B \).  
2. Calculate the sum of the coordinates of point \( B \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the coordinates of point \( B \). Since \( M(3,7) \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), use the midpoint formula: if \( A(x_A, y_A) = (9,3) \) and \( B(x_B, y_B) \), the midpoint \( M \) has coordinates \( \left( \frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, \frac{y_A + y_B}{2} \right) = (3,7) \). Solve for \( x_B \) and \( y_B \).

Using the midpoint formula:  
- For the x-coordinate: \( \frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = 3 \). Since \( x_A = 9 \), we have:  
  \( \frac{9 + x_B}{2} = 3 \)  
  \( 9 + x_B = 6 \)  
  \( x_B = 6 - 9 = -3 \).  
- For the y-coordinate: \( \frac{y_A + y_B}{2} = 7 \). Since \( y_A = 3 \), we have:  
  \( \frac{3 + y_B}{2} = 7 \)  
  \( 3 + y_B = 14 \)  
  \( y_B = 14 - 3 = 11 \).  
Thus, the coordinates of point \( B \) are \( (-3, 11) \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the coordinates of point \( B \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the coordinates of point \( B \) (completed: \( B(-3, 11) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of the coordinates of point \( B \) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the coordinates of point \( B \).

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the coordinates of point \( B(-3, 11) \). Add the x- and y-coordinates: \( x_B + y_B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The coordinates of point \( B \) are \( (-3, 11) \).  
Sum of coordinates: \( x_B + y_B = -3 + 11 = 8 \).

### Final Answer  
The sum of the coordinates of point \( B \) is \( 8 \).
