### Problem Statement
We are given a table of values for a function \( f(x) \):

| \( x \)   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 5  | 8  | 13 |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| \( f(x) \) | 3  | 13 | 8  | 1  | 0  | 5  |

We need to find \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)}\right) \), assuming the inverse function \( f^{-1} \) exists.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)}\right) \).

1. Verify that \( f^{-1} \) exists by checking if \( f(x) \) is one-to-one (injective).
2. Determine the values of \( f^{-1}(5) \), \( f^{-1}(13) \), and \( f^{-1}(1) \) using the table.
3. Compute the expression \( \frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} \).
4. Find \( f^{-1} \) of the result from step 3.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( f^{-1} \) exists. This requires checking if \( f(x) \) is one-to-one by ensuring all \( f(x) \) values in the table are distinct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To determine if \( f^{-1} \) exists, \( f(x) \) must be injective, meaning no two distinct \( x \)-values produce the same \( f(x) \)-value. From the table:

- \( f(1) = 3 \)
- \( f(2) = 13 \)
- \( f(3) = 8 \)
- \( f(5) = 1 \)
- \( f(8) = 0 \)
- \( f(13) = 5 \)

The \( f(x) \) values are: 3, 13, 8, 1, 0, 5. Since all values (3, 13, 8, 1, 0, 5) are distinct except for 5, which appears for \( x = 13 \) only (noting the table provides a single mapping per \( x \)), we consider the function as defined by the table. For the given points, each \( y \)-value corresponds to at most one \( x \)-value, suggesting \( f \) is injective over this domain, so \( f^{-1} \) exists for these points.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( f^{-1}(5) \), \( f^{-1}(13) \), and \( f^{-1}(1) \). This involves identifying the \( x \)-values such that \( f(x) = 5 \), \( f(x) = 13 \), and \( f(x) = 1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the table:
- For \( f(x) = 5 \), we have \( x = 13 \), so \( f^{-1}(5) = 13 \).
- For \( f(x) = 13 \), we have \( x = 2 \), so \( f^{-1}(13) = 2 \).
- For \( f(x) = 1 \), we have \( x = 5 \), so \( f^{-1}(1) = 5 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( \frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} \). Using the values from the previous step, substitute and calculate the expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the results:
- \( f^{-1}(5) = 13 \)
- \( f^{-1}(13) = 2 \)
- \( f^{-1}(1) = 5 \)

Compute:
\[
\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} = \frac{13 + 2}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( f^{-1}(3) \), since the previous step gave \( \frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} = 3 \). Identify the \( x \)-value such that \( f(x) = 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the table, for \( f(x) = 3 \), we have \( x = 1 \). Thus:
\[
f^{-1}(3) = 1
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal to ensure all steps align with solving the problem.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Compute \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)}\right) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Verify that \( f^{-1} \) exists (completed: \( f \) is injective).
  - Subgoal 2: Find \( f^{-1}(5) \), \( f^{-1}(13) \), \( f^{-1}(1) \) (completed: 13, 2, 5).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( \frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} \) (completed: 3).
  - Subgoal 4: Find \( f^{-1}(3) \) (completed: 1).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the computation.

The final answer is \( f^{-1}(3) = 1 \).
