### Problem Statement
We need to find the maximum height of a ball traveling on a parabolic path, where the height is given by the expression \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \), and \( t \) is the time after launch in seconds. The maximum height occurs at the vertex of the parabola.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the maximum height:  
1. Identify the mathematical approach to find the maximum height of a quadratic function.  
2. Calculate the time \( t \) at which the maximum height occurs (vertex of the parabola).  
3. Substitute this time into the height equation to compute the maximum height.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the mathematical approach to find the maximum height of a quadratic function. Since the height function \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \) is a quadratic equation, the maximum height occurs at the vertex. For a quadratic function \( at^2 + bt + c \), the vertex is at \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The height function is \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \), which is a quadratic equation in the form \( at^2 + bt + c \). Here, \( a = -16 \), \( b = 32 \), and \( c = 15 \). The maximum height of a parabola occurs at the vertex, where the time \( t \) is given by the formula \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \). This will be computed in the next step.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time \( t \) at which the maximum height occurs. Use the vertex formula \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \) with \( a = -16 \) and \( b = 32 \), then compute the value of \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the vertex formula \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \):  
- \( a = -16 \), \( b = 32 \).  
- \( t = -\frac{32}{2 \cdot (-16)} = -\frac{32}{-32} = 1 \).  
The maximum height occurs at \( t = 1 \) second.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the maximum height by substituting \( t = 1 \) into the height equation \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( t = 1 \) into \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \):  
- \( h(1) = -16(1)^2 + 32(1) + 15 = -16 + 32 + 15 = 31 \).  
The maximum height is 31 feet.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the maximum height by checking the calculation and ensuring the vertex time and height are correct. Recalculate the vertex time and height, and confirm the parabola opens downward.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recalculate the vertex time: \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{32}{2 \cdot (-16)} = 1 \).  
- Recalculate the height at \( t = 1 \): \( h(1) = -16(1)^2 + 32(1) + 15 = -16 + 32 + 15 = 31 \).  
- Confirm the parabola opens downward: Since \( a = -16 < 0 \), the parabola opens downward, indicating a maximum at the vertex.  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the maximum height is 31 feet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the maximum height of the ball.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the mathematical approach (use vertex formula for quadratic).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the time at the vertex (\( t = 1 \) second).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the height at \( t = 1 \) (31 feet).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the maximum height has been calculated and validated.  
The maximum height of the ball is 31 feet.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The maximum height of the ball is 31 feet.
