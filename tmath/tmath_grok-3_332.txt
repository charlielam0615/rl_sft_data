### Problem Statement
We need to find the maximum height of a ball traveling on a parabolic path, where the height (in feet) is given by the expression \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \), and \( t \) is the time after launch in seconds.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the maximum height of a parabolic path, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Recognize that the height function \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \) is a quadratic equation, and the maximum height occurs at the vertex of the parabola.  
2. Determine the time \( t \) at which the maximum height occurs using the vertex formula for a quadratic function.  
3. Substitute this time back into the height function to calculate the maximum height.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the time \( t \) at which the maximum height occurs. Since the height function \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \) is a quadratic equation of the form \( at^2 + bt + c \), the time at the vertex can be found using the formula \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \), where \( a = -16 \) and \( b = 32 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the time at the vertex:  
For \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \), identify coefficients: \( a = -16 \), \( b = 32 \).  
Using the vertex formula:  
\[ t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{32}{2 \cdot (-16)} = -\frac{32}{-32} = 1 \]  
The maximum height occurs at \( t = 1 \) second.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the maximum height by substituting \( t = 1 \) into the height function \( h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 15 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = 1 \) into the height function:  
\[ h(1) = -16(1)^2 + 32(1) + 15 = -16 + 32 + 15 = 31 \]  
The height at \( t = 1 \) is 31 feet.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the maximum height by checking the parabolic nature of the function and ensuring the vertex calculation is correct. Since the coefficient of \( t^2 \) is negative (\( a = -16 \)), the parabola opens downward, confirming a maximum at the vertex. Recalculate the vertex time and height to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the vertex time:  
\[ t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{32}{2 \cdot (-16)} = 1 \]  
Recompute the height at \( t = 1 \):  
\[ h(1) = -16(1)^2 + 32(1) + 15 = -16 + 32 + 15 = 31 \]  
The calculations are consistent. Additionally, test nearby points to confirm the maximum:  
At \( t = 0.9 \):  
\[ h(0.9) = -16(0.9)^2 + 32(0.9) + 15 = -16(0.81) + 28.8 + 15 = -12.96 + 28.8 + 15 = 30.84 \]  
At \( t = 1.1 \):  
\[ h(1.1) = -16(1.1)^2 + 32(1.1) + 15 = -16(1.21) + 35.2 + 15 = -19.36 + 35.2 + 15 = 30.84 \]  
Since \( h(0.9) = 30.84 \) and \( h(1.1) = 30.84 \) are both less than \( h(1) = 31 \), the maximum height is confirmed at 31 feet.

### Step 5

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the maximum height of the ball.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time at which the maximum height occurs (completed: \( t = 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the height at that time (completed: 31 feet).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed: calculations and nearby points confirm 31 feet).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the maximum height has been calculated and validated.  
The maximum height of the ball is 31 feet.

### Final Answer
The maximum height of the ball is 31 feet.
