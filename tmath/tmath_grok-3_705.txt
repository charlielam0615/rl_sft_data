### Problem Restatement
At a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shakes hands exactly once with every other gymnast from all teams, excluding themselves. After these handshakes, a coach shakes hands only with each gymnast on her own team. The total number of handshakes (gymnast-to-gymnast and coach-to-gymnast) is 281. We need to determine the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the fewest number of coach handshakes, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Model the gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes based on the total number of gymnasts and teams.  
2. Model the coach-to-gymnast handshakes based on the size of the coach’s team.  
3. Set up an equation for the total handshakes (281) using both models.  
4. Minimize the number of coach handshakes while ensuring the total equals 281 and the number of teams and gymnasts are integers.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Model the gymnast-to-gymnast and coach-to-gymnast handshakes mathematically.  
- **How to Achieve**: Assume there are \( n \) gymnasts across all teams and the coach’s team has \( k \) gymnasts. Calculate gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes as the number of ways to choose 2 gymnasts (\( \binom{n}{2} \)). The coach shakes hands with \( k \) gymnasts. The total handshakes are given as 281.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s denote:  
- \( n \): total number of gymnasts.  
- \( k \): number of gymnasts on the coach’s team (i.e., number of coach handshakes).  

**Gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes**: Each gymnast shakes hands with every other gymnast exactly once, so the number of handshakes is the number of ways to choose 2 gymnasts:  
\[ \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]

**Coach-to-gymnast handshakes**: The coach shakes hands only with the \( k \) gymnasts on her team, contributing \( k \) handshakes.

**Total handshakes**: The problem states there are 281 handshakes in total, so:  
\[ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + k = 281 \]

**Objective**: Find the smallest possible \( k \) (number of coach handshakes) such that the equation holds, and \( n \) and \( k \) are positive integers with \( k \leq n \) (since the coach’s team is a subset of all gymnasts).

Rewrite the equation:  
\[ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 281 - k \]  
\[ n(n-1) = 2(281 - k) = 562 - 2k \]

To minimize \( k \), maximize \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) (i.e., make \( 281 - k \) as large as possible), but ensure \( n(n-1) = 562 - 2k \) is a product of two consecutive integers (\( n \) and \( n-1 \)), and \( k \leq n \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the equation \( n(n-1) = 562 - 2k \) produces integer solutions for \( n \) and \( k \), and check if \( k \) can be minimized.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test values of \( k \) starting from small positive integers to find the smallest \( k \) that makes \( 562 - 2k \) equal to \( n(n-1) \) for integer \( n \). Ensure \( k \leq n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s test small values of \( k \) to find when \( 562 - 2k = n(n-1) \) yields an integer \( n \):  

- For \( k = 1 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 1 = 560 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 560 \). Check if 560 is a product of consecutive integers:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 560 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 560 = 2241 \). Since \( \sqrt{2241} \approx 47.33 \), not a perfect square, \( n \) is not an integer.

- For \( k = 2 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 2 = 558 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 558 \).  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 558 = 2233 \), not a perfect square. No integer \( n \).

- For \( k = 3 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 3 = 556 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 556 \).  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 556 = 2225 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 4 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 4 = 554 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 554 \).  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 554 = 2217 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 11 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 11 = 540 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 540 \).  
  Check: \( 23 \cdot 24 = 552 \), \( 22 \cdot 23 = 506 \). Since 540 is between 506 and 552, try the quadratic:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 540 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 540 = 2161 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 23 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 23 = 516 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 516 \).  
  Check: \( 22 \cdot 23 = 506 \), \( 23 \cdot 24 = 552 \). Since 516 is between, try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 516 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 516 = 2065 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 29 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 29 = 504 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 504 \).  
  Check: \( 22 \cdot 23 = 506 \), \( 21 \cdot 22 = 462 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 504 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 504 = 2017 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 31 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 31 = 500 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 500 \).  
  Check: \( 22 \cdot 23 = 506 \), \( 21 \cdot 22 = 462 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 500 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 500 = 2001 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 46 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 46 = 470 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 470 \).  
  Check: \( 21 \cdot 22 = 462 \), \( 22 \cdot 23 = 506 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 470 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 470 = 1881 \). Since \( \sqrt{1881} \approx 43.37 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 91 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 91 = 380 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 380 \).  
  Check: \( 19 \cdot 20 = 380 \). This works! So, \( n = 20 \).  
  Verify:  
  \[ \frac{20 \cdot 19}{2} = 190 \]  
  \[ 190 + 91 = 281 \]  
  Total handshakes match. Check constraint: \( k = 91 \leq n = 20 \)? No, since \( 91 > 20 \), this is invalid.

- For \( k = 136 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 136 = 290 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 290 \).  
  Check: \( 17 \cdot 18 = 306 \), \( 16 \cdot 17 = 272 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 290 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 290 = 1161 \). Since \( \sqrt{1161} \approx 34.07 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 181 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 181 = 200 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 200 \).  
  Check: \( 14 \cdot 15 = 210 \), \( 13 \cdot 14 = 182 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 200 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 200 = 801 \). Since \( \sqrt{801} \approx 28.3 \), not a perfect square.

Notice that as \( k \) increases, \( 562 - 2k \) decreases, and we need \( n(n-1) \) to be a product of consecutive integers. Let’s try a larger \( k \):  

- For \( k = 235 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 235 = 92 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 92 \).  
  Check: \( 9 \cdot 10 = 90 \), \( 10 \cdot 11 = 110 \). Try:  
  \[ n^2 - n - 92 = 0 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 92 = 369 \). Since \( \sqrt{369} \approx 19.21 \), not a perfect square.

- For \( k = 253 \):  
  \[ 562 - 2 \cdot 253 = 56 \]  
  Solve \( n(n-1) = 56 \).  
  Check: \( 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \). This works! So, \( n = 8 \).  
  Verify:  
  \[ \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} = 28 \]  
  \[ 28 + 253 = 281 \]  
  Total handshakes match. Check constraint: \( k = 253 \leq n = 8 \)? No, since \( 253 > 8 \), this is invalid.

Since small \( k \) values yield non-integer \( n \), and large \( k \) values yield \( k > n \), let’s try values of \( n \) to find valid \( k \):  

For \( n(n-1) = 2(281 - k) \), compute:  
\[ k = 281 - \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]  
Test integer \( n \):  

- \( n = 8 \):  
  \[ \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} = 28 \]  
  \[ k = 281 - 28 = 253 \]  
  Invalid since \( 253 > 8 \).

- \( n = 20 \):  
  \[ \frac{20 \cdot 19}{2} = 190 \]  
  \[ k = 281 - 190 = 91 \]  
  Invalid since \( 91 > 20 \).

- \( n = 24 \):  
  \[ \frac{24 \cdot 23}{2} = 276 \]  
  \[ k = 281 - 276 = 5 \]  
  Valid since \( 5 \leq 24 \). Verify:  
  \[ 276 + 5 = 281 \]  
  This satisfies the total handshakes.

- \( n = 25 \):  
  \[ \frac{25 \cdot 24}{2} = 300 \]  
  \[ k = 281 - 300 = -19 \]  
  Invalid since \( k \) is negative.

Thus, \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \) is a candidate. Let’s check if a smaller \( k \) is possible by testing \( k < 5 \):  

- If \( k = 4 \):  
  \[ 281 - 4 = 277 \]  
  \[ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 277 \]  
  \[ n(n-1) = 554 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 1 + 4 \cdot 554 = 2217 \), not a perfect square.

- If \( k = 3 \):  
  \[ n(n-1) = 556 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 2225 \), not a perfect square.

Since \( k = 5 \) works and smaller \( k \) values do not yield integer \( n \), this may be the minimum.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes (\( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Model coach-to-gymnast handshakes (\( k \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + k = 281 \) for integer \( n \), \( k \), minimizing \( k \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions ensuring \( k \leq n \).  

**Current Goal**: Validate if \( k = 5 \) is the minimum by considering team constraints and rechecking calculations.

**Updates**:  
- Found \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \) satisfies \( 276 + 5 = 281 \).  
- Smaller \( k \) (e.g., 3, 4) yielded non-integer \( n \).  
- Need to ensure the solution aligns with multiple teams and \( k \leq n \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The problem mentions multiple teams, but \( k = 5 \) with \( n = 24 \) assumes the coach’s team has 5 gymnasts, and there are at least two teams. Adjust subgoals to:  
1. Confirm \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \) is feasible with multiple teams (e.g., team sizes summing to 24, one team of size 5).  
2. Recheck for smaller \( k \) by considering team configurations.  
3. Finalize the minimum \( k \).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify if \( k = 5 \) is feasible with multiple teams and check for smaller \( k \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Assume at least two teams with total gymnasts \( n = 24 \), one team of size \( k = 5 \). Test team configurations and recheck the equation for smaller \( k \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verify \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \)**:  
- Total gymnasts: \( n = 24 \).  
- Coach’s team: \( k = 5 \) gymnasts.  
- Gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes: \( \frac{24 \cdot 23}{2} = 276 \).  
- Coach handshakes: \( k = 5 \).  
- Total: \( 276 + 5 = 281 \).  
- Team configuration: Possible, e.g., teams of sizes 5 (coach’s team), 10, 9 (or 5, 5, 5, 9, etc.), summing to 24. Since gymnasts shake hands across all teams, the number of teams doesn’t affect gymnast-to-gymnast handshakes, only that \( k \leq n \).

**Recheck smaller \( k \)**:  
- For \( k = 1 \):  
  \[ n(n-1) = 2(281 - 1) = 560 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 2241 \), not a perfect square.  
- For \( k = 2 \):  
  \[ n(n-1) = 558 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 2233 \), not a perfect square.  
- For \( k = 3 \):  
  \[ n(n-1) = 556 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 2225 \), not a perfect square.  
- For \( k = 4 \):  
  \[ n(n-1) = 554 \]  
  Discriminant: \( 2217 \), not a perfect square.

**Team constraint**: \( k \) is the size of one team. Since there are multiple teams, \( k \leq n - m \) where \( m \geq 1 \) is the size of at least one other team. For \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \), we can have another team of size say 1+ m= 19 \), satisfying the condition.

Since \( k < 5 \) yields no integer solutions, and \( k = 5 \) fits the equation and team constraints, it appears minimal.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation (Final)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm \( k = 5 \) is the minimum by ensuring no valid solutions exist for \( k \) and validating the team configurations.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recompute for \( k < 5 \), confirm team feasibility, and finalize.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Recheck \( k < 5 \)**:  
- \( k = 1 \): \( n(n-1) = 560 \), non-integer.  
- \( k = 2 \): \( n(n-1) = 558 \), non-integer.  
- \( k = 3 \): \( n(n-1) = 556 \), non-integer.  
- \( k = 4 \): \( n(n-1) = 554 \), non-integer.

**Team feasibility**:  
- For \( n = 24 \), \( k = 5 \): Can have teams like 5, 10, 9 or 5, 5, 5, 9, etc. The coach shakes hands with her 5 gymnasts. The problem doesn’t specify team sizes, only that there are multiple teams, so this is valid.

**Conclusion**: No \( k < 5 \) yields integer \( n \), and \( k = 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Thus, the fewest coach handshakes is 5.

**Final Answer**:  
\[ \boxed{5} \]
