**Problem Restatement**: We need to rationalize the denominator of the expression \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\) so that the answer is in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\), where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are integers, \(C\) is positive, and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime. Then, we compute \(A + B + C\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\).  
2. Express the result in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\).  
3. Ensure \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are integers, \(C > 0\), and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime.  
4. Compute \(A + B + C\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\). To achieve this, multiply the numerator and denominator by terms involving \(\sqrt[3]{5}\) to eliminate the cube root in the denominator, aiming for an integer denominator.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To rationalize \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\), note the denominator is \(2\sqrt[3]{5}\). Since \(\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}\), we aim to make the denominator a perfect cube or an integer. Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt[3]{5^2} = \sqrt[3]{25}\):  

\[
\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{25}}{\sqrt[3]{25}} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{25}}{2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{5} \cdot \sqrt[3]{25}} = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{5 \cdot 25}} = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{125}}.
\]

Since \(\sqrt[3]{125} = \sqrt[3]{5^3} = 5\), the denominator becomes:  
\[
2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{125} = 2 \cdot 5 = 10.
\]

The numerator is \(3 \sqrt[3]{25}\). Thus, the expression is:  
\[
\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}.
\]

This is in the form \(\frac{A \sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\), with \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\) is correct and meets all conditions: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) are integers, \(C > 0\), and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the expression \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\):  
- **Form**: Matches \(\frac{A \sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\) with \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\).  
- **Integers**: \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\) are all integers.  
- **Positive \(C\)**: \(C = 10 > 0\).  
- **\(B\) condition**: \(B = 25 = 5^2\). A cube of a prime is of the form \(p^3\). Since \(5^2\) is not divisible by \(5^3 = 125\) (or any other primeâ€™s cube, e.g., \(2^3 = 8\)), \(B = 25\) satisfies the condition.  
- **Correctness**: Verify by reverting:  
  \[
  \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10} = \frac{3 \cdot 5^{2/3}}{10} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 5^{1/3}} = \frac{3}{2 \sqrt[3]{5}}.
  \]
  This matches the original expression, confirming correctness.  

The expression is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one:  
- Main goal: Compute \(A + B + C\) for the rationalized form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rationalize the denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express in form \(\frac{A \sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\) (completed: \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure conditions on \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(A + B + C\) (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(A + B + C\).  
From the previous step, the rationalized form is \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\), with:  
- \(A = 3\)  
- \(B = 25\)  
- \(C = 10\)  

All subgoals up to computing \(A + B + C\) have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(A + B + C\) using \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\). Add these values to find the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[
A + B + C = 3 + 25 + 10 = 38.
\]

Thus, \(A + B + C = 38\).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
