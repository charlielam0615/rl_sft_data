### Problem Statement
We need to rationalize the denominator of the expression \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\) and express the result in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\), where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are integers, \(C\) is positive, and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime. Then, we compute \(A + B + C\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to rationalize the denominator and compute \(A + B + C\).  
Subgoals:  
1. Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\).  
2. Express the result in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\).  
3. Ensure \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are integers, \(C > 0\), and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime.  
4. Compute \(A + B + C\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\). To achieve this, multiply the numerator and denominator by terms involving \(\sqrt[3]{5}\) to make the denominator a rational number, likely using the cube root property where \((\sqrt[3]{5})^3 = 5\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To rationalize \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\), rewrite the denominator \(2\sqrt[3]{5} = 2 \cdot 5^{1/3}\). The goal is to eliminate the cube root in the denominator. Since \((\sqrt[3]{5})^3 = 5\), consider multiplying numerator and denominator by \((\sqrt[3]{5})^2 = 5^{2/3}\) to adjust the denominator:

\[
\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{5}^2}{\sqrt[3]{5}^2} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{5}^2}{2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{5} \cdot \sqrt[3]{5}^2} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{25}}{2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{5^3}} = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}.
\]

The expression is now \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\) has a rational denominator and matches the required form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\). Check if the denominator is rational, and verify if \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) satisfy the conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The denominator of \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\) is 10, which is an integer, confirming the denominator is rationalized. Compare with the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\):  
- Numerator: \(3 \sqrt[3]{25} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{25}\), so \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\).  
- Denominator: \(C = 10\).  

Check conditions:  
- \(A = 3\), \(C = 10\) are integers, and \(C = 10 > 0\).  
- For \(B = 25 = 5^2\), check if it’s divisible by the cube of any prime. Since \(5^2\) has no prime factors raised to the third power or higher, \(B = 25\) satisfies the condition.  

The expression \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\) fits the required form.

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{3}{2\sqrt[3]{5}}\) and find \(A + B + C\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rationalize the denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\) (completed: \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are integers, \(C > 0\), and \(B\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime (verified).  
  - **Subgoal 4 (Current)**: Compute \(A + B + C\).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \(A + B + C\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(A + B + C\) using \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), and \(C = 10\). Perform the arithmetic to find the sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), and \(C = 10\), compute:

\[
A + B + C = 3 + 25 + 10 = 38.
\]

Thus, \(A + B + C = 38\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(A + B + C = 38\) and ensure all problem requirements are met. Recheck the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), and confirm the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Reverify:  
- From Step 3, \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\) gives \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), \(C = 10\).  
- Recalculate: \(3 + 25 + 10 = 28 + 10 = 38\).  
- Conditions: \(A = 3\), \(C = 10\) are integers, \(C > 0\), and \(B = 25 = 5^2\) is not divisible by any prime’s cube.  

The computation is correct, and all conditions are satisfied.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The rationalized expression is \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{25}}{10}\), with \(A = 3\), \(B = 25\), and \(C = 10\). Thus:

\[
A + B + C = 3 + 25 + 10 = 38.
\]

**Final Answer**: \(38\)
