**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the probability problem, break it down into the following subgoals:
1. Determine the possible outcomes for the first die (numbers less than 3).
2. Determine the possible outcomes for the second die (numbers greater than 3).
3. Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes by combining the results from both dice.
4. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for rolling two six-sided dice.
5. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the possible outcomes for the first die (numbers less than 3).
How to Achieve: A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. Identify which numbers are less than 3 (i.e., 1 or 2).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A six-sided die has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Numbers less than 3 are 1 and 2. Thus, there are 2 possible outcomes for the first die.
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the possible outcomes for the second die (numbers greater than 3).
How to Achieve: Identify which numbers on a six-sided die are greater than 3 (i.e., 4, 5, or 6).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A six-sided die has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Thus, there are 3 possible outcomes for the second die.
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes by combining the results from both dice.
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of outcomes for the first die (less than 3) by the number of outcomes for the second die (greater than 3) to find the number of favorable combinations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, the first die has 2 possible outcomes (1 or 2). From Step 3, the second die has 3 possible outcomes (4, 5, or 6). Since the dice rolls are independent, the total number of favorable outcomes is 2 × 3 = 6.
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for rolling two six-sided dice.
How to Achieve: Each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, multiply the number of outcomes for each die (6 × 6).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each six-sided die has 6 possible outcomes. For two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 × 6 = 36.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability of rolling a number less than 3 on the first die and a number greater than 3 on the second die, expressed as a common fraction.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine possible outcomes for the first die (less than 3) — Completed (2 outcomes: 1 or 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine possible outcomes for the second die (greater than 3) — Completed (3 outcomes: 4, 5, or 6).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total favorable outcomes — Completed (2 × 3 = 6 favorable outcomes).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate total possible outcomes — Completed (6 × 6 = 36 possible outcomes).
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the probability as a fraction — Pending.

Current Goal: Compute the probability as a common fraction.

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, expressed as a common fraction.
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (6) by the total number of possible outcomes (36) and simplify the resulting fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the total number of possible outcomes is 36. The probability is 6/36. Simplifying the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives 1/6.
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculated probability.
How to Achieve: Verify the calculations by rechecking the number of favorable and total outcomes and ensuring the fraction is simplified correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rechecking:
- First die: Numbers less than 3 are 1 and 2 (2 outcomes).
- Second die: Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6 (3 outcomes).
- Favorable outcomes: 2 × 3 = 6.
- Total outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36.
- Probability: 6/36 = 1/6 (simplified by dividing by 6).
The calculations are consistent, and the fraction 1/6 is in its simplest form.

**Final Answer**

The probability that Nathan rolls a number less than 3 on the first die and a number greater than 3 on the second die is 1/6.
