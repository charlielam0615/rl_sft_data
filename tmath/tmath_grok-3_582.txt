**Problem Statement**: Calculate the probability that Nathan rolls a number less than 3 on the first six-sided die and a number greater than 3 on the second six-sided die, expressing the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the possible outcomes for each die.  
2. Identify favorable outcomes for the first die (less than 3).  
3. Identify favorable outcomes for the second die (greater than 3).  
4. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for rolling two dice.  
5. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition.  
6. Compute the probability as a fraction of favorable outcomes over total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the possible outcomes for each die and the total number of outcomes for rolling two dice. This can be achieved by recognizing that each die has 6 sides, and the outcomes are independent, so the total outcomes are calculated by multiplying the outcomes of each die.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die is six-sided, so the first die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and the second die also has 6 possible outcomes. Since the dice rolls are independent, the total number of possible outcomes for rolling two dice is:  
6 × 6 = 36.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify favorable outcomes for the first die (numbers less than 3). This can be achieved by listing the numbers on a six-sided die that satisfy the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the first die, numbers less than 3 are 1 and 2. Thus, there are 2 favorable outcomes for the first die.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify favorable outcomes for the second die (numbers greater than 3). This can be achieved by listing the numbers on a six-sided die that satisfy the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the second die, numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes for the second die.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the probability of rolling a number less than 3 on the first die and greater than 3 on the second die as a fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine possible outcomes for each die (completed: 6 outcomes per die, 36 total outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify favorable outcomes for the first die (completed: 2 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify favorable outcomes for the second die (completed: 3 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the probability as a fraction (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition (first die < 3 and second die > 3). This can be achieved by multiplying the number of favorable outcomes for each die, as the rolls are independent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The favorable outcomes for the first die are 2 (numbers 1, 2). The favorable outcomes for the second die are 3 (numbers 4, 5, 6). Since the rolls are independent, the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition is:  
2 × 3 = 6.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the number of favorable outcomes by listing the possible combinations to ensure correctness. This can be achieved by explicitly enumerating the pairs that satisfy the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
List the favorable outcomes (first die < 3, second die > 3):  
- (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)  
- (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)  
This gives the pairs: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6). Counting them, we have 6 favorable outcomes, confirming the calculation (2 × 3 = 6).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as a fraction of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. This can be achieved by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes and simplifying the fraction if necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the total number of outcomes is 36. The probability is:  
6 / 36 = 1 / 6.  
The fraction 1/6 is already in its simplest form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Review the hierarchy of goals to ensure all subgoals are completed and confirm the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the probability of rolling a number less than 3 on the first die and greater than 3 on the second die as a fraction (pending final confirmation).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine possible outcomes for each die (completed: 36 total outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify favorable outcomes for the first die (completed: 2 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify favorable outcomes for the second die (completed: 3 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the combined condition (completed: 6 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the probability as a fraction (completed: 1/6).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer aligns with the problem requirements.  
The calculated probability is 1/6, expressed as a common fraction, which satisfies the problem’s requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The probability that Nathan rolls a number less than 3 on the first die and a number greater than 3 on the second die is **1/6**.
