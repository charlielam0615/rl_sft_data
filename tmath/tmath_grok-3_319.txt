### Problem Statement
Antonette scores 70% on a 10-problem test, 80% on a 20-problem test, and 90% on a 30-problem test. We need to calculate her overall score as a percentage when the three tests are combined into one 60-problem test, rounded to the nearest percent.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the overall percentage score:  
1. Calculate the number of correct answers for each test based on the given percentages.  
2. Sum the correct answers across all tests to find the total number of correct answers.  
3. Determine the total number of problems (60) and calculate the overall percentage.  
4. Round the overall percentage to the nearest percent.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of correct answers for each test.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the percentage scores and the number of problems in each test to compute the number of correct answers. For each test, multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number of problems.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Test 1**: 70% on 10 problems = \( 0.7 \times 10 = 7 \) correct answers.  
- **Test 2**: 80% on 20 problems = \( 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \) correct answers.  
- **Test 3**: 90% on 30 problems = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) correct answers.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the correct answers and calculate the overall percentage.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the correct answers from all tests to get the total correct answers. Divide by the total number of problems (60) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total correct answers = \( 7 + 16 + 27 = 50 \).  
- Total problems = 60.  
- Overall percentage = \( \frac{50}{60} \times 100 = \frac{5000}{60} \approx 83.333\ldots\% \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Round the overall percentage to the nearest percent.  
**How to Achieve**: Take the calculated percentage (83.333…) and round to the nearest whole number based on standard rounding rules (if the decimal is 0.5 or higher, round up; otherwise, round down).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Calculated percentage = 83.333…%.  
- The decimal part is 0.333, which is less than 0.5.  
- Therefore, round 83.333…% to 83%.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Calculate Antonette’s overall score as a percentage for a combined 60-problem test, rounded to the nearest percent.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate correct answers for each test (completed: 7, 16, 27).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum correct answers and compute overall percentage (completed: 50/60 = 83.333…%).  
  - Subgoal 3: Round the percentage to the nearest percent (completed: 83%).  

**Current Goal**: Completed – the overall score is 83%.  
The goal hierarchy is complete, with all subgoals addressed, leading to the final answer.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Antonette’s overall score, rounded to the nearest percent, is **83%**.
