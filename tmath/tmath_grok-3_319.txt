**Problem Statement**: Antonette scored 70% on a 10-problem test, 80% on a 20-problem test, and 90% on a 30-problem test. We need to determine her overall score as a percentage when the three tests are combined into one 60-problem test, rounded to the nearest percent.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the overall percentage score.  
1. Calculate the number of correct answers for each test based on the given percentages and number of problems.  
2. Sum the correct answers across all tests to find the total number of correct answers.  
3. Calculate the total number of problems across all tests (given as 60, but verify).  
4. Compute the overall percentage by dividing the total correct answers by the total number of problems and multiplying by 100.  
5. Round the result to the nearest percent.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of correct answers for each test.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the percentage scores and the number of problems for each test to compute the number of correct answers. For each test, multiply the percentage (converted to a decimal) by the number of problems.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the 10-problem test: 70% = 0.7, so 0.7 × 10 = 7 correct answers.  
For the 20-problem test: 80% = 0.8, so 0.8 × 20 = 16 correct answers.  
For the 30-problem test: 90% = 0.9, so 0.9 × 30 = 27 correct answers.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sum the correct answers and verify the total number of problems.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the correct answers from each test to get the total correct answers. Confirm the total number of problems by summing the problems from each test.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total correct answers: 7 + 16 + 27 = 50.  
Total problems: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 (matches the problem’s statement).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the overall percentage score.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the total number of correct answers by the total number of problems, multiply by 100 to get the percentage, and round to the nearest percent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Overall percentage = (50 ÷ 60) × 100 = 83.333…%.  
Rounding 83.333…% to the nearest percent: Since the decimal part (0.333…) is less than 0.5, round down to 83%.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the number of correct answers, total problems, and percentage to confirm accuracy. Check the rounding step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate correct answers:  
- 10-problem test: 0.7 × 10 = 7.  
- 20-problem test: 0.8 × 20 = 16.  
- 30-problem test: 0.9 × 30 = 27.  
Total correct: 7 + 16 + 27 = 50.  
Total problems: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60.  
Percentage: (50 ÷ 60) × 100 = 83.333…%.  
Rounding check: 83.333…% rounds to 83% (since 0.333 < 0.5).  
All calculations are consistent.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate Antonette’s overall score as a percentage for the combined 60-problem test, rounded to the nearest percent.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate correct answers for each test (completed: 7, 16, 27).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum correct answers and verify total problems (completed: 50 correct, 60 total).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute overall percentage (completed: 83.333…%).  
  - Subgoal 4: Round to nearest percent (completed: 83%).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate calculations (completed: all consistent).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution as the validation is complete.  
**Final Answer**: Antonette’s overall score is 83%.
