The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. For the equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. Given the equation $ax^2 + 20x + c = 0$, we can identify $a$, $b = 20$, and $c$. Setting the discriminant to zero, we have:

$$
\Delta = 20^2 - 4ac = 0
$$

Solving this equation will allow us to find a relationship between $a$ and $c$.

I am focusing on solving the system of equations to find the values of $a$ and $c$. The current progress involves using the discriminant condition and the given sum $a + c = 29$.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations $20^2 - 4ac = 0$ and $a + c = 29$ to find the values of $a$ and $c$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the discriminant equation:  
$$
20^2 - 4ac = 0
$$  
$$
400 - 4ac = 0
$$  
$$
4ac = 400
$$  
$$
ac = 100
$$  

We now have the system of equations:  
1. $a + c = 29$  
2. $ac = 100$  

We can solve this system by substitution or using the quadratic identity. Let’s express $c$ in terms of $a$ from the first equation:  
$$
c = 29 - a
$$  

Substitute into the second equation:  
$$
a(29 - a) = 100
$$  
$$
29a - a^2 = 100
$$  
$$
a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0
$$  

Now solve this quadratic equation for $a$. Using the quadratic formula:  
$$
a = \frac{-(-29) \pm \sqrt{(-29)^2 - 4(1)(100)}}{2(1)}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{29 \pm \sqrt{841 - 400}}{2}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{29 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{29 \pm 21}{2}
$$  

This gives two solutions:  
$$
a = \frac{29 + 21}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
$$  
$$
a = \frac{29 - 21}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$  

Now, using $a + c = 29$, find the corresponding $c$ values:  
- If $a = 25$, then $c = 29 - 25 = 4$  
- If $a = 4$, then $c = 29 - 4 = 25$  

Given the condition $a < c$, we choose $a = 4$ and $c = 25$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Discriminant check**:  
   - The quadratic equation is $4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0$.  
   - Compute discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$:  
     $$
     \Delta = 20^2 - 4(4)(25) = 400 - 400 = 0
     $$  
     Since $\Delta = 0$, the equation has exactly one solution. ✅  

2. **Sum condition $a + c = 29$**:  
   $$
   a + c = 4 + 25 = 29
   $$  
   This satisfies the given condition. ✅  

3. **Inequality $a < c$**:  
   $$
   4 < 25
   $$  
   This holds true. ✅  

All conditions are satisfied. No inconsistencies or errors detected in the solution.
