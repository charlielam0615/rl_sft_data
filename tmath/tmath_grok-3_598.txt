### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the probability that a card randomly drawn from a box containing 100 cards, numbered 1 to 100 inclusive, has a number that is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:
1. Identify the total number of possible outcomes (cards).
2. Determine the numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
3. Count the favorable outcomes (numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5).
4. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
5. Express the probability as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify the total number of possible outcomes.
**How to Achieve**: Since the cards are numbered from 1 to 100 inclusive, count the total number of cards.

[IMP]
The box contains cards numbered 1 to 100, so there are 100 possible outcomes.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
**How to Achieve**: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5, accounting for overlaps.

[IMP]
To find the numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. Let:
- \( A \): Set of numbers divisible by 2.
- \( B \): Set of numbers divisible by 3.
- \( C \): Set of numbers divisible by 5.

The total count of numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 is given by:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

- **Numbers divisible by 2 (\( |A| \))**: The multiples of 2 are 2, 4, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2, common difference 2, and last term 100. The number of terms is:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 2 \rfloor = 50 \]
- **Numbers divisible by 3 (\( |B| \))**: Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, ..., 99. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 3 \rfloor = 33 \]
- **Numbers divisible by 5 (\( |C| \))**: Multiples of 5 are 5, 10, ..., 100. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 5 \rfloor = 20 \]

- **Numbers divisible by 2 and 3 (\( |A \cap B| \))**: These are multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6. Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, ..., 96. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 6 \rfloor = 16 \]
- **Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 (\( |B \cap C| \))**: LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. Multiples of 15 are 15, 30, ..., 90. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 15 \rfloor = 6 \]
- **Numbers divisible by 2 and 5 (\( |A \cap C| \))**: LCM of 2 and 5 is 10. Multiples of 10 are 10, 20, ..., 100. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 10 \rfloor = 10 \]
- **Numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 5 (\( |A \cap B \cap C| \))**: LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30. Multiples of 30 are 30, 60, 90. Number of terms:
  \[ \lfloor 100 / 30 \rfloor = 3 \]

Now apply inclusion-exclusion:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 6 - 10 + 3 = 74 \]

There are 74 numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the count of numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the inclusion-exclusion calculation by listing a few multiples and ensuring no double-counting or omissions.

[IMP]
To validate, consider the formula again:
- Multiples of 2: 2, 4, ..., 100 (50 numbers).
- Multiples of 3: 3, 6, ..., 99 (33 numbers).
- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, ..., 100 (20 numbers).
- Overlaps:
  - Multiples of 6 (2 and 3): 6, 12, ..., 96 (16 numbers).
  - Multiples of 15 (3 and 5): 15, 30, ..., 90 (6 numbers).
  - Multiples of 10 (2 and 5): 10, 20, ..., 100 (10 numbers).
  - Multiples of 30 (2, 3, and 5): 30, 60, 90 (3 numbers).

Recalculate:
\[ 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 6 - 10 + 3 = 74 \]

The calculation is consistent. To further validate, note that numbers like 6 (divisible by 2 and 3) are only counted once in the final sum due to subtraction of overlaps, and numbers like 30 (divisible by 2, 3, and 5) are correctly accounted for by adding back the triple overlap. The count of 74 is reasonable, as it’s less than the sum of individual multiples (103) due to overlaps.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability.
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

[IMP]
The number of favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5) is 74. The total number of outcomes is 100. The probability is:
\[ \frac{74}{100} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

The subgoal to express the probability as a common fraction requires simplifying the fraction \( \frac{74}{100} \). Adjust the subgoal to include simplification of the fraction to its lowest terms.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Simplify the fraction \( \frac{74}{100} \) to its lowest terms.
**How to Achieve**: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 74 and 100 and divide both numerator and denominator by it.

[IMP]
Calculate the GCD of 74 and 100:
- Factors of 74: 1, 2, 37, 74.
- Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.
- Common factors: 1, 2. GCD = 2.

Simplify:
\[ \frac{74 \div 2}{100 \div 2} = \frac{37}{50} \]

The fraction \( \frac{37}{50} \) is in lowest terms, as 37 is prime and 50 (2 × 5²) shares no common factors with 37 other than 1.
