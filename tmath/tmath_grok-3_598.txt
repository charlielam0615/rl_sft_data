### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that a card drawn at random from a box containing 100 cards, numbered 1 to 100 inclusive, has a number that is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability.

To solve this, we need to:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes (cards).
2. Identify the favorable outcomes (numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5).
3. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
4. Express the result as a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the total number of possible outcomes. This can be achieved by recognizing that there are 100 cards, each with a unique number from 1 to 100.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of possible outcomes is the number of cards in the box, which is 100.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5. This can be achieved using the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers divisible by at least one of these.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets:
- Let \( A \): numbers divisible by 2.
- Let \( B \): numbers divisible by 3.
- Let \( C \): numbers divisible by 5.

**Step 1: Calculate individual sets**
- Multiples of 2: \( \lfloor 100 / 2 \rfloor = 50 \).
- Multiples of 3: \( \lfloor 100 / 3 \rfloor = 33 \).
- Multiples of 5: \( \lfloor 100 / 5 \rfloor = 20 \).

**Step 2: Calculate pairwise intersections**
- Multiples of 2 and 3 (divisible by \( \text{lcm}(2,3) = 6 \)): \( \lfloor 100 / 6 \rfloor = 16 \).
- Multiples of 2 and 5 (divisible by \( \text{lcm}(2,5) = 10 \)): \( \lfloor 100 / 10 \rfloor = 10 \).
- Multiples of 3 and 5 (divisible by \( \text{lcm}(3,5) = 15 \)): \( \lfloor 100 / 15 \rfloor = 6 \).

**Step 3: Calculate triple intersection**
- Multiples of 2, 3, and 5 (divisible by \( \text{lcm}(2,3,5) = 30 \)): \( \lfloor 100 / 30 \rfloor = 3 \).

**Step 4: Apply inclusion-exclusion**
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]
\[
= 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74
\]
So, there are 74 numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes and express it as a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{74}{100}
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{74}{100} = \frac{74 \div 2}{100 \div 2} = \frac{37}{50}
\]
Since 37 is prime and 50 = 2 × 5², they share no common factors, so \( \frac{37}{50} \) is in simplest form.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the inclusion-exclusion counts and the probability computation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute key steps:
- Multiples of 2: \( \lfloor 100 / 2 \rfloor = 50 \).
- Multiples of 3: \( \lfloor 100 / 3 \rfloor = 33 \).
- Multiples of 5: \( \lfloor 100 / 5 \rfloor = 20 \).
- Multiples of 6: \( \lfloor 100 / 6 \rfloor = 16 \).
- Multiples of 10: \( \lfloor 100 / 10 \rfloor = 10 \).
- Multiples of 15: \( \lfloor 100 / 15 \rfloor = 6 \).
- Multiples of 30: \( \lfloor 100 / 30 \rfloor = 3 \).
- Inclusion-exclusion: \( 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74 \).
- Probability: \( \frac{74}{100} = \frac{37}{50} \).

The calculations are consistent. Alternatively, we could count numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5:
- Numbers divisible by none require the number to be coprime with \( \text{lcm}(2,3,5) = 30 \).
- Using Euler’s totient function: \( \phi(30) = 30 \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{2})(1 - \frac{1}{3})(1 - \frac{1}{5}) = 30 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 8 \).
- In each cycle of 30 numbers, 8 are coprime to 30. For 1 to 100, \( \lfloor 100 / 30 \rfloor = 3 \) full cycles (24 numbers), plus numbers from 91 to 100. Checking 91 to 100 manually or via computation confirms 2 additional numbers (91, 97), so 24 + 2 = 26 numbers are not divisible.
- Thus, divisible numbers: \( 100 - 26 = 74 \), confirming our count.
The fraction \( \frac{37}{50} \) is simplified correctly.
