**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
- Subgoal 2: Sum these multiples to obtain the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first ten positive multiples of 13. This can be achieved by multiplying 13 by the integers 1 through 10.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first ten positive multiples of 13 are:  
13 × 1 = 13  
13 × 2 = 26  
13 × 3 = 39  
13 × 4 = 52  
13 × 5 = 65  
13 × 6 = 78  
13 × 7 = 91  
13 × 8 = 104  
13 × 9 = 117  
13 × 10 = 130  

List of multiples: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the multiples identified in the previous step (13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130) to find their total. This can be achieved by adding these numbers together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the multiples:  
13 + 26 = 39  
39 + 39 = 78  
78 + 52 = 130  
130 + 65 = 195  
195 + 78 = 273  
273 + 91 = 364  
364 + 104 = 468  
468 + 117 = 585  
585 + 130 = 715  

The sum of the multiples is 715.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the sum calculated in the previous step. This can be achieved by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, where the multiples form a sequence with the first term 13, common difference 13, and 10 terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The multiples 13, 26, 39, ..., 130 form an arithmetic sequence with:  
- First term (a₁) = 13  
- Common difference (d) = 13  
- Number of terms (n) = 10  

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \]  
where \( a_n \) is the nth term (130).  

\[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \cdot (13 + 130) = 5 \cdot 143 = 715 \]  

The calculated sum is 715, which matches the previous result.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first ten positive multiples of 13 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum these multiples to obtain the final answer (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the sum using an alternative method (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, as the sum (715) has been calculated and validated.  
[/REVIEW]
