**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of these multiples.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply 13 by each integer from 1 to 10 to generate the sequence of multiples.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first ten positive multiples of 13 are:  
13 × 1 = 13  
13 × 2 = 26  
13 × 3 = 39  
13 × 4 = 52  
13 × 5 = 65  
13 × 6 = 78  
13 × 7 = 91  
13 × 8 = 104  
13 × 9 = 117  
13 × 10 = 130  

The sequence is: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the identified multiples.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that each number in the sequence is a multiple of 13 and that there are exactly ten numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify each number:  
- 13 ÷ 13 = 1 (integer)  
- 26 ÷ 13 = 2 (integer)  
- 39 ÷ 13 = 3 (integer)  
- 52 ÷ 13 = 4 (integer)  
- 65 ÷ 13 = 5 (integer)  
- 78 ÷ 13 = 6 (integer)  
- 91 ÷ 13 = 7 (integer)  
- 104 ÷ 13 = 8 (integer)  
- 117 ÷ 13 = 9 (integer)  
- 130 ÷ 13 = 10 (integer)  

The sequence has 10 numbers, and each is a multiple of 13. The sequence is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the multiples: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the numbers in the sequence. Alternatively, recognize the sequence as an arithmetic series with the first term 13, common difference 13, and 10 terms, and use the arithmetic series sum formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \), where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the arithmetic series formula:  
- Number of terms (\( n \)) = 10  
- First term (\( a_1 \)) = 13  
- Last term (\( a_n \)) = 130  
- Sum formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \)  
- \( S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(13 + 130) = 5 \times 143 = 715 \)  

To confirm, calculate the sum directly:  
13 + 26 + 39 + 52 + 65 + 78 + 91 + 104 + 117 + 130 = 715  

Both methods yield the same result: 715.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first ten positive multiples of 13 (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of these multiples (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the multiples (achieved, sum = 715).  
The goal hierarchy is complete, and no further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the final sum.  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the sum using an alternative method, such as the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series based on the number of terms and common difference: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d] \), where \( d \) is the common difference.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the alternative arithmetic series formula:  
- \( n = 10 \), \( a_1 = 13 \), \( d = 13 \)  
- \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d] \)  
- \( S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}[2 \times 13 + (10-1) \times 13] = 5[26 + 9 \times 13] = 5[26 + 117] = 5 \times 143 = 715 \)  

The result matches the previous calculation, confirming the sum is 715.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the first ten positive multiples of 13 is 715.
