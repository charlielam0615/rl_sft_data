### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of ways to choose four lines from a set of four horizontal and four vertical lines in a plane such that the selected lines enclose a rectangular region. A rectangle is formed by selecting two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating a closed rectangular region.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the total number of lines and their types.  
2. Determine the condition for forming a rectangle.  
3. Calculate the number of ways to select the required lines.  
4. Verify the selections form a rectangle.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the total number of lines and their types.  
**How to Achieve**: Count the given horizontal and vertical lines and clarify their roles in forming a rectangle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are four horizontal lines and four vertical lines, making a total of eight lines. To form a rectangle, we need two horizontal lines (to form the top and bottom edges) and two vertical lines (to form the left and right edges).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the condition for forming a rectangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the geometric requirement for the selected lines to enclose a rectangular region.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A rectangle is enclosed when two horizontal lines and two vertical lines intersect to form a closed shape with four right angles. The two horizontal lines must be distinct (non-overlapping) to define the top and bottom, and the two vertical lines must be distinct to define the left and right sides. The intersections of these lines form the four vertices of the rectangle.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to select the required lines.  
**How to Achieve**: Use combinatorial methods to select two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To form a rectangle, we need to choose:
- Two horizontal lines from the four available horizontal lines. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 4 is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), so \( C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \).
- Two vertical lines from the four available vertical lines, also \( C(4, 2) = 6 \).

Since the choices of horizontal and vertical lines are independent, the total number of ways to choose the lines is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36. \]

Each combination of two horizontal and two vertical lines forms a unique rectangle because the lines are distinct and their intersections define a unique rectangular region.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that each selection of two horizontal and two vertical lines forms a rectangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the combinatorial calculation accounts for all valid rectangles and excludes invalid cases.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each pair of distinct horizontal lines intersects each pair of distinct vertical lines at four points, forming a rectangle. There are no degenerate cases (e.g., parallel lines coinciding) since the problem states four distinct horizontal and four distinct vertical lines. The calculation \( C(4, 2) \times C(4, 2) = 36 \) accounts for all possible rectangles. To confirm, consider a grid formed by four horizontal and four vertical lines, creating a 3x3 grid of cells (since each pair of adjacent lines forms a cell). However, the problem asks for any rectangle, not just unit cells, so all combinations of two horizontal and two vertical lines are valid. The total of 36 ways is consistent.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the number of ways to choose four lines (two horizontal, two vertical) to enclose a rectangular region.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the total number of lines and their types (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for forming a rectangle (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of ways to select the required lines (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the selections form a rectangle (completed).

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.

The solution process is complete, with the answer being 36 ways to form a rectangle.

### Final Answer
The number of ways to choose four lines (two horizontal and two vertical) from four horizontal and four vertical lines to enclose a rectangular region is **36**.
