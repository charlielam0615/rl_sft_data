Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Generate the first ten positive multiples of $13$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first ten positive multiples of $13$ can be generated by multiplying $13$ by the integers from $1$ to $10$:
$$
13 \times 1 = 13 \\
13 \times 2 = 26 \\
13 \times 3 = 39 \\
13 \times 4 = 52 \\
13 \times 5 = 65 \\
13 \times 6 = 78 \\
13 \times 7 = 91 \\
13 \times 8 = 104 \\
13 \times 9 = 117 \\
13 \times 10 = 130
$$
The first ten positive multiples of $13$ are: $13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the sum of the first ten positive multiples of $13$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first ten positive multiples of $13$ are:  
$$
13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130
$$  
To find their sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:  
$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)
$$  
Where:  
- $n = 10$ (the number of terms),  
- $a_1 = 13$ (the first term),  
- $a_n = 130$ (the last term).  

Substituting into the formula:  
$$
S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(13 + 130) = 5 \times 143 = 715
$$  
The sum of the first ten positive multiples of $13$ is $715$.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The formula used for calculating the sum of an arithmetic sequence and the values of $n$, $a_1$, and $a_n$.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the sum calculation:  
- The sum of an arithmetic sequence is calculated using the formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where:  
  - $n = 10$ (number of terms),  
  - $a_1 = 13$ (first term),  
  - $a_n = 130$ (last term).  
- The sum $S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(13 + 130) = 5 \times 143 = 715$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the sum calculation for the first ten positive multiples of $13$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The sum was calculated using the arithmetic sequence formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n = 10$, $a_1 = 13$, and $a_n = 130$. Substituting these values gives $S_{10} = 5 \times 143 = 715$. To verify, the individual terms were manually added step-by-step:  
$$
13 + 26 + 39 + 52 + 65 + 78 + 91 + 104 + 117 + 130 = 715
$$  
Both methods yield the same result. The formula application is valid for an arithmetic sequence, and the manual summation confirms the calculation. No inconsistencies or errors are detected.  
\boxed{correct}
