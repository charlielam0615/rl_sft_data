**Problem Restatement**: We need to simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) into the form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(b\) is as small as possible, then find \(a + b\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Factorize 2700 into its prime factors.  
2. Simplify the cube root \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) by extracting perfect cubes.  
3. Express the result in the form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\) with \(b\) as small as possible.  
4. Compute \(a + b\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Factorize 2700 into its prime factors.  
How to Achieve: Divide 2700 by small prime numbers (2, 3, 5, etc.) until fully factorized.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with 2700:  
- Divide by 2: \(2700 \div 2 = 1350\)  
- Divide by 2: \(1350 \div 2 = 675\)  
- Divide by 3: \(675 \div 3 = 225\)  
- Divide by 3: \(225 \div 3 = 75\)  
- Divide by 3: \(75 \div 3 = 25\)  
- Divide by 5: \(25 \div 5 = 5\)  
- Divide by 5: \(5 \div 5 = 1\)  

Thus, \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) using the prime factorization.  
How to Achieve: Apply the cube root to \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\), extracting perfect cubes where possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\), compute:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2} = (2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} \cdot 3^{3/3} \cdot 5^{2/3} = 3 \cdot 2^{2/3} \cdot 5^{2/3}.
\]  
Rewrite:  
\[
2^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{2^2}, \quad 5^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{5^2}.
\]  
Combine:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2^2 \cdot 5^2} = \sqrt[3]{4 \cdot 25} = \sqrt[3]{100}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2700} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{100}.
\]  
So, \(a = 3\), \(b = 100\). Check if \(b\) can be smaller: Since \(100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2\), no perfect cubes can be extracted, so \(b = 100\) is minimal.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the simplified form \(3\sqrt[3]{100}\) is correct and \(b = 100\) is minimal.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the cube root and check for alternative simplifications.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{27 \cdot 100} = \sqrt[3]{27} \cdot \sqrt[3]{100} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{100}.
\]  
Check \(b\): Factorize \(100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2\). No perfect cubes exist in 100, so \(\sqrt[3]{100}\) cannot be simplified further. The form \(3\sqrt[3]{100}\) is correct with \(b = 100\) minimal.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).  
How to Achieve: Use \(a = 3\), \(b = 100\) from the simplified form and add them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[
a + b = 3 + 100 = 103.
\]  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b\) where \(\sqrt[3]{2700} = a\sqrt[3]{b}\), \(a, b\) positive integers, \(b\) minimal.  
  - Subgoal 1: Factorize 2700 (completed: \(2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) (completed: \(3\sqrt[3]{100}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express in form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\) (completed: \(a = 3, b = 100\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(a + b\) (completed: \(103\)).

**Final Answer**: \(a + b = 103\).
