**Problem Restatement**: We need to simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) into the form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(b\) is as small as possible, and then find \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of simplifying \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Factorize 2700 into its prime factors.  
2. Express \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) using the prime factorization.  
3. Simplify the cube root to the form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\).  
4. Ensure \(b\) is as small as possible.  
5. Compute \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Factorize 2700 into its prime factors.  
- **How to Achieve**: Divide 2700 by prime numbers systematically to find its prime factorization.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To factorize 2700:  
- Divide by 2: \(2700 \div 2 = 1350\).  
- Divide by 2: \(1350 \div 2 = 675\).  
- Divide by 3: \(675 \div 3 = 225\).  
- Divide by 3: \(225 \div 3 = 75\).  
- Divide by 3: \(75 \div 3 = 25\).  
- Divide by 5: \(25 \div 5 = 5\).  
- Divide by 5: \(5 \div 5 = 1\).  
Thus, \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Express \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) using the prime factorization and simplify to the form \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the prime factorization \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\) to compute the cube root, grouping exponents by multiples of 3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\),  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2} = 2^{2/3} \cdot 3^{3/3} \cdot 5^{2/3} = 3 \cdot 2^{2/3} \cdot 5^{2/3}.
\]
Rewrite:  
\[
2^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{2^2}, \quad 5^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{5^2}.
\]
Thus,  
\[
\sqrt[3]{2700} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{2^2 \cdot 5^2} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4 \cdot 25} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{100}.
\]
So, \(\sqrt[3]{2700} = 3\sqrt[3]{100}\), where \(a = 3\), \(b = 100\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check if \(b = 100\) is as small as possible.  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify if \(\sqrt[3]{100}\) can be simplified further by checking if 100 contains perfect cube factors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Factorize \(100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2\). Since neither \(2^2\) nor \(5^2\) is a perfect cube (exponents are not multiples of 3), \(\sqrt[3]{100}\) cannot be simplified further. Thus, \(b = 100\) is as small as possible.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the simplified form \(a = 3\), \(b = 100\) to calculate \(a + b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(a = 3\), \(b = 100\),  
\[
a + b = 3 + 100 = 103.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) to \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\) and find \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Factorize 2700 (completed: \(2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify \(\sqrt[3]{2700}\) to \(a\sqrt[3]{b}\) (completed: \(3\sqrt[3]{100}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure \(b\) is minimal (completed: \(b = 100\) is minimal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(a + b\) (completed: \(a + b = 103\)).  
**Current Goal**: Completed all subgoals; final answer is \(a + b = 103\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(a + b = 103\).
