**Problem Statement**: We are given the operation \( a \star b = \dfrac{\sqrt{a + b}}{\sqrt{a - b}} \), and we need to find \( x \) such that \( x \star 24 = 7 \). This means we need to solve the equation \( \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( x \star 24 = 7 \), we need to break it down into manageable subgoals. The operation is defined as \( a \star b = \dfrac{\sqrt{a + b}}{\sqrt{a - b}} \), so we can set up the equation \( \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \). The subgoals are:  
1. Set up the equation based on the given operation.  
2. Solve the equation algebraically to isolate \( x \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid within the domain of the operation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation \( \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \). To achieve this, we will start by writing the equation, then manipulate it algebraically to isolate \( x \), ensuring we account for the square roots and the domain where \( x - 24 > 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( x \star 24 = 7 \), we use the operation definition:  
\[ \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \]  

To eliminate the square roots, square both sides:  
\[ \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} \right)^2 = 7^2 \]  
\[ \dfrac{x + 24}{x - 24} = 49 \]  

Multiply both sides by \( x - 24 \) to clear the denominator:  
\[ x + 24 = 49 (x - 24) \]  

Distribute on the right:  
\[ x + 24 = 49x - 1176 \]  

Rearrange to isolate \( x \):  
\[ x - 49x = -1176 - 24 \]  
\[ -48x = -1200 \]  
\[ x = \dfrac{1200}{48} = 25 \]  

The solution to the equation is \( x = 25 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 25 \) satisfies the original equation and is valid within the domain of the operation. We will substitute \( x = 25 \) into \( x \star 24 \) and check if the result equals 7, while ensuring the expression is defined (i.e., \( x - 24 > 0 \)).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 25 \) into the operation:  
\[ x \star 24 = \dfrac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{25 + 24}}{\sqrt{25 - 24}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1}} = \dfrac{7}{1} = 7 \]  

The result matches the given condition \( x \star 24 = 7 \).  

Check the domain: The operation involves \( \sqrt{x - 24} \), so \( x - 24 > 0 \):  
\[ 25 - 24 = 1 > 0 \]  
The domain condition is satisfied.  

Thus, \( x = 25 \) is a valid solution.
