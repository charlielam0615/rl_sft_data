**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( x \).  
1. Substitute the given operation into the equation \( x \star 24 = 7 \).  
2. Set up the equation using the definition of the operation.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
4. Validate the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up the equation using the operation definition.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = x \) and \( b = 24 \) into the operation \( a \star b = \frac{\sqrt{a + b}}{\sqrt{a - b}} \), set it equal to 7, and simplify.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the operation definition, \( x \star 24 = \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \).  
This gives the equation:  
\[ \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \) for \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides, solve the resulting equation, and find \( x \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7 \]  
Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{x - 24} \):  
\[ \sqrt{x + 24} = 7 \sqrt{x - 24} \]  
Square both sides to eliminate square roots:  
\[ (\sqrt{x + 24})^2 = (7 \sqrt{x - 24})^2 \]  
\[ x + 24 = 49 (x - 24) \]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[ x + 24 = 49x - 1176 \]  
Rearrange all terms to one side:  
\[ x + 24 - 49x + 1176 = 0 \]  
\[ -48x + 1200 = 0 \]  
\[ 48x = 1200 \]  
\[ x = \frac{1200}{48} = 25 \]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 25 \) satisfies the original equation \( x \star 24 = 7 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 25 \) into the operation \( x \star 24 \) and check if the result equals 7.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 25 \) into the operation:  
\[ x \star 24 = \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = \frac{\sqrt{25 + 24}}{\sqrt{25 - 24}} = \frac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1}} = \frac{7}{1} = 7 \]  
The result is 7, which matches the given equation \( x \star 24 = 7 \). The solution is valid.
