Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the growth pattern of the bacteria colony.
2. Calculate the number of bacteria at the end of each day until it exceeds 100.
3. Identify the first day when the number of bacteria exceeds 100.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The initial number of bacteria and the growth pattern.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The bacteria colony starts with 3 bacteria and doubles every day. This means the number of bacteria at the end of each day follows the pattern: 3, 6, 12, 24, and so on.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of bacteria at the end of each day until it exceeds 100.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We can use the formula for exponential growth:  
$$ \text{Number of bacteria at the end of day } n = 3 \times 2^n $$  
Where $ n $ is the day number (starting from 0 for the initial day).  

Let's compute the number of bacteria for each day:  

- Day 0: $ 3 \times 2^0 = 3 $  
- Day 1: $ 3 \times 2^1 = 6 $  
- Day 2: $ 3 \times 2^2 = 12 $  
- Day 3: $ 3 \times 2^3 = 24 $  
- Day 4: $ 3 \times 2^4 = 48 $  
- Day 5: $ 3 \times 2^5 = 96 $  
- Day 6: $ 3 \times 2^6 = 192 $  

The first day where the number of bacteria exceeds 100 is day 6.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All calculations and logic in the implementation step.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. The formula used is 3 * 2^n, where n represents the day number (0-indexed). This aligns with the problem description of doubling every day starting from 3 bacteria.
2. Calculations for each day:
   - Day 0: 3 * 2^0 = 3 (correct)
   - Day 1: 3 * 2^1 = 6 (correct)
   - Day 2: 3 * 2^2 = 12 (correct)
   - Day 3: 3 * 2^3 = 24 (correct)
   - Day 4: 3 * 2^4 = 48 (correct)
   - Day 5: 3 * 2^5 = 96 (correct)
   - Day 6: 3 * 2^6 = 192 (correct)
3. The conclusion that day 6 is the first day exceeding 100 bacteria is valid since day 5 only reaches 96. All steps logically follow from the exponential growth pattern described. No arithmetic errors detected.

\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The first day which ends with the colony having more than 100 bacteria is day 6.
