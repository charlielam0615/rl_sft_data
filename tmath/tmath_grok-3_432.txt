**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the sum of all values of \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 = 7x - 12 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find all values of \( x \).  
3. Sum the solutions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
Description: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero, resulting in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 = 7x - 12 \]  
Subtract \( 7x \) and add 12 to both sides to get:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard form: \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \).  
Description: Factor the quadratic expression to find the roots, or use the quadratic formula if factoring is not straightforward.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider factoring the quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \). We need two numbers that multiply to 12 (the constant term) and add to \(-7\) (the coefficient of \( x \)).  
Test pairs:  
- \(-3\) and \(-4\): \((-3) \cdot (-4) = 12\), \(-3 + (-4) = -7\). This works.  
Thus, factor the equation:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0 \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3 \]  
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]  
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
Description: Substitute each solution back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy \( x^2 = 7x - 12 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = 3 \):  
Left side: \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
Right side: \( 7 \cdot 3 - 12 = 21 - 12 = 9 \)  
\[ 9 = 9 \] (True)  

For \( x = 4 \):  
Left side: \( 4^2 = 16 \)  
Right side: \( 7 \cdot 4 - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \)  
\[ 16 = 16 \] (True)  

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the sum of all solutions.  
Description: Add the values of \( x \) obtained from solving the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
Sum:  
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]  
[/IMP]
