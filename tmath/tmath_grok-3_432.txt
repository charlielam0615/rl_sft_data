**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find all values of \( x \).  
3. Sum the solutions to obtain the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
How to Achieve: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero, resulting in a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 = 7x - 12 \]  
Subtract \( 7x - 12 \) from both sides to bring all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard quadratic form: \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the quadratic equation is correctly formatted.  
How to Achieve: Check that all terms are on one side and the equation equals zero, ensuring it matches the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation from Step 2 is \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \).  
This matches the standard quadratic form where:  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( a = 1 \),  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( b = -7 \),  
- Constant term: \( c = 12 \).  
The equation is correctly formatted as \( 1 \cdot x^2 + (-7) \cdot x + 12 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \) to find all values of \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Factorize the quadratic equation to find its roots, or use the quadratic formula if factorization is not straightforward.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Attempt to factorize \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \).  
We need two numbers that multiply to \( 12 \) (the constant term) and add to \( -7 \) (the coefficient of \( x \)).  
Test pairs of factors of \( 12 \):  
- \( -1, -12 \): Product = \( 12 \), Sum = \( -13 \) (incorrect).  
- \( -2, -6 \): Product = \( 12 \), Sum = \( -8 \) (incorrect).  
- \( -3, -4 \): Product = \( 12 \), Sum = \( -7 \) (correct).  

Thus, the equation factors as:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0 \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3 \]  
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]  
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute each solution back into the original equation \( x^2 = 7x - 12 \) to confirm they satisfy it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \( x = 3 \):  
Left side: \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
Right side: \( 7 \cdot 3 - 12 = 21 - 12 = 9 \)  
\( 9 = 9 \), so \( x = 3 \) is valid.  

Check \( x = 4 \):  
Left side: \( 4^2 = 16 \)  
Right side: \( 7 \cdot 4 - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \)  
\( 16 = 16 \), so \( x = 4 \) is valid.  

Both solutions are correct.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all values of \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 = 7x - 12 \).

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
How to Achieve: Add the values of the solutions to compute their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \).  
Sum:  
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]  
The sum of all values of \( x \) is \( 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm the sum of the solutions is correct.  
How to Achieve: Use the property of quadratic equations that the sum of the roots of \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is \( -\frac{b}{a} \), and compare with the calculated sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \).  
The sum of the roots is:  
\[ -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-7}{1} = 7 \]  
This matches the calculated sum: \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).  
The sum is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**

The sum of all values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( x^2 = 7x - 12 \) is \( 7 \).
