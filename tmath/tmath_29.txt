Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The formula for the area and perimeter of a square.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
For a square, the area $ A $ is given by $ A = s^2 $, where $ s $ is the side length, and the perimeter $ P $ is given by $ P = 4s $. These formulas are essential for solving the problem.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the minimum side length of the square such that its area is at least 400 square feet.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The area of a square is given by $ A = s^2 $, where $ s $ is the side length. To satisfy the condition $ A \geq 400 $, we solve for $ s $ in the inequality:  

$$
s^2 \geq 400
$$

Taking the square root of both sides:

$$
s \geq \sqrt{400}
$$

$$
s \geq 20
$$

Thus, the minimum side length of the square must be 20 feet to ensure the area is at least 400 square feet.

The perimeter $ P $ of a square is calculated using the formula $ P = 4s $, where $ s $ is the side length of the square. This formula will be used to compute the amount of fencing required.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the perimeter of the square using the minimum side length.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The side length of the square is $ s = 20 $ feet. The perimeter $ P $ of a square is given by the formula $ P = 4s $. Substituting $ s = 20 $ into the formula:

$$
P = 4 \times 20 = 80
$$

Thus, the perimeter of the square is 80 feet.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Determine if the perimeter of 80 feet is the minimal fencing required for an area of at least 400 square feet.  
2. Verify that reducing the side length below 20 feet results in an area less than 400 square feet.  
3. Confirm that increasing the side length above 20 feet increases the amount of fencing required.
[/PLANNING]
[PLANNING]
Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that a side length of 20 feet is indeed the minimal value satisfying the area requirement and that the corresponding perimeter is minimized.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Area Requirement Check**:  
   - At $ s = 20 $ feet, area $ A = 20^2 = 400 $, which meets the "at least 400 square feet" condition.  
   - For $ s < 20 $, e.g., $ s = 19.9 $, $ A = (19.9)^2 = 396.01 $, which is **less than 400**. This violates the requirement.  
   - For $ s > 20 $, e.g., $ s = 21 $, $ A = 441 $, which exceeds 400 but uses **more fencing** (perimeter $ = 84 $ feet).  

2. **Perimeter Minimization**:  
   - The perimeter formula $ P = 4s $ is linear in $ s $. To minimize $ P $, $ s $ must be as small as possible while satisfying $ A \geq 400 $.  
   - Since $ s = 20 $ is the **smallest value** where $ A = 400 $, reducing $ s $ further violates the area constraint. Increasing $ s $ increases $ P $.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - The solution correctly identifies $ s = 20 $ as the minimal side length satisfying the area requirement.  
   - The corresponding perimeter $ P = 80 $ feet is indeed the minimal fencing required.  
   - No errors in logic or calculations are detected.

[ANSWER]
The side of the square should be 20 feet to use the least amount of fencing (80 feet) while covering at least 400 square feet.
