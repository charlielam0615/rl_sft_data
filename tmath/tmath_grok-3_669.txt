**Problem Statement**: A fair 6-sided die is rolled. If the roll is even, you win an amount in dollars equal to the number rolled (e.g., rolling a 4 wins $4). If the roll is odd, you win $0. We need to calculate the expected value of the winnings, expressed as a dollar value.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the expected value of the winnings, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the possible outcomes of rolling a fair 6-sided die.  
2. Determine the winnings for each outcome based on whether the roll is even or odd.  
3. Calculate the probability of each outcome.  
4. Compute the expected value using the formula for expected value: \( E[X] = \sum (x_i \cdot p_i) \), where \( x_i \) is the winning for outcome \( i \) and \( p_i \) is its probability.  
5. Express the final answer as a dollar value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible outcomes of rolling a fair 6-sided die and determine the winnings for each outcome. This will be achieved by listing the outcomes (1 through 6) and applying the rule: even numbers yield winnings equal to the number rolled, odd numbers yield $0.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A fair 6-sided die has outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  
- If the roll is even (2, 4, 6), the winnings are $2, $4, $6, respectively.  
- If the roll is odd (1, 3, 5), the winnings are $0.  
Thus, the winnings for each outcome are:  
- 1: $0  
- 2: $2  
- 3: $0  
- 4: $4  
- 5: $0  
- 6: $6  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability of each outcome. Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability, which can be computed as 1 divided by the number of possible outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A fair 6-sided die has 6 possible outcomes, each equally likely. The probability of each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is:  
\[ P(\text{outcome}) = \frac{1}{6} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the expected value of the winnings using the formula \( E[X] = \sum (x_i \cdot p_i) \), where \( x_i \) is the winning for each outcome and \( p_i \) is its probability. This will be achieved by multiplying each outcomeâ€™s winnings by its probability and summing the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the expected value formula \( E[X] = \sum (x_i \cdot p_i) \):  
- Outcome 1: \( 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 0 \)  
- Outcome 2: \( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
- Outcome 3: \( 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 0 \)  
- Outcome 4: \( 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)  
- Outcome 5: \( 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 0 \)  
- Outcome 6: \( 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \)  

Summing these:  
\[ E[X] = 0 + \frac{1}{3} + 0 + \frac{2}{3} + 0 + 1 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{3}{3} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \]  
The expected value is $2.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the expected value calculation by checking the logic and computations. This will be achieved by reviewing the winnings, probabilities, and the summation to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- **Outcomes and winnings**: Confirmed from Step 2: 1 ($0), 2 ($2), 3 ($0), 4 ($4), 5 ($0), 6 ($6).  
- **Probabilities**: Confirmed from Step 3: Each outcome has probability \( \frac{1}{6} \).  
- **Expected value calculation**: Recheck the sum:  
  \[ 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 0 + \frac{2}{6} + 0 + \frac{4}{6} + 0 + \frac{6}{6} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]  
The calculation is correct. Alternatively, since only even outcomes (2, 4, 6) contribute, we can compute:  
\[ E[X] = \frac{1}{6} \cdot (2 + 4 + 6) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 12 = 2 \]  
This confirms the expected value is $2.
