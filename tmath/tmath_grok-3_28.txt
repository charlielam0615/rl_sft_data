**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
2. Simplify \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
3. Subtract the results to obtain the final simplified expression.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
How to Achieve: The exponent \( \frac{1}{2} \) represents the square root. Compute the square root of 16.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \), since \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
How to Achieve: Compute the square root of 625.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{625} = 25 \), since \( 25 \times 25 = 625 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subtract the results to simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
How to Achieve: Use the simplified values from previous steps (\( \sqrt{16} = 4 \) and \( \sqrt{625} = 25 \)) and perform the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4 - 25 = -21 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the subtraction and ensure the expression is fully simplified.  
How to Achieve: Check the calculations for \( \sqrt{16} \), \( \sqrt{625} \), and the subtraction. Confirm that the result cannot be simplified further.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Confirm: \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \), since \( 4^2 = 16 \).  
- Confirm: \( \sqrt{625} = 25 \), since \( 25^2 = 625 \).  
- Confirm: \( 4 - 25 = -21 \).  
- The result, \(-21\), is a constant and cannot be simplified further.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \) (completed: \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \) (completed: \( \sqrt{625} = 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the results (completed: \( 4 - 25 = -21 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: \(-21\) is correct and simplified).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, problem solved).  
[/REVIEW]
