**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of simplifying \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \) into subgoals:  
1. Compute \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
2. Compute \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
3. Subtract the results.  
4. Simplify the final result if possible.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \). This can be achieved by recognizing that \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \) is the square root of 16, and calculating it directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{16} \), and \( 16 = 4^2 \), we have:  
\( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).  
Thus, \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \). This can be achieved by recognizing that \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \) is the square root of 625, and calculating it directly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{625} \), and \( 625 = 25^2 \), we have:  
\( \sqrt{625} = 25 \).  
Thus, \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = 25 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to subtract the results, i.e., compute \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \). This can be achieved by using the values computed in previous steps (\( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \), \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = 25 \)) and performing the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the results from previous steps:  
\( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} = 4 - 25 = -21 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( -21 \). This can be achieved by checking the calculations for \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \), \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \), and the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Recheck \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \): \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \), correct.  
- Recheck \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \): \( \sqrt{625} = 25 \), correct.  
- Recheck subtraction: \( 4 - 25 = -21 \), correct.  
The result \( -21 \) is valid.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} - 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 16^{\frac{1}{2}} \) (completed: \( 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 625^{\frac{1}{2}} \) (completed: \( 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the results (completed: \( 4 - 25 = -21 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the final result (completed: \( -21 \) is already simplified).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with the simplified result \( -21 \).

**Final Answer**: The simplified expression is \( -21 \).
