### Problem Statement
Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes and takes 20 minutes to return home using the same route. Her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour. We need to determine the total miles she walked.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Define the variables and relationships (e.g., distance, time, and speed).
2. Set up equations based on the given information (time to friend's house, return time, and average speed).
3. Solve for the distance.
4. Calculate the total distance walked (to and from the friend's house).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the variables and set up the equations.
How to Achieve: Let the distance to the friend's house be \( d \) miles. Use the times given (10 minutes to the friend's house, 20 minutes to return) and the average speed (4 miles per hour) to form equations. Convert times to hours for consistency with speed units.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( d \) be the distance from Margo's home to her friend's house (in miles).
- Time to friend's house: 10 minutes = \( \frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours.
- Time to return home: 20 minutes = \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) hours.
- Total time for the trip: \( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) hours.
- Total distance walked: \( d + d = 2d \) miles (since she walks to the friend's house and back).
- Average speed for the entire trip is given as 4 miles per hour.

Average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{1}{2}} = 4d = 4
\]
Solving for \( d \):
\[
4d = 4 \implies d = 1
\]
Thus, the distance to the friend's house is 1 mile.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution for consistency.
How to Achieve: Check if the calculated distance satisfies the given conditions, including the average speed and the different walking times.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the solution:
- Distance to friend's house: \( d = 1 \) mile.
- Time to friend's house: \( \frac{1}{6} \) hours. Speed = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}} = 6 \) miles per hour.
- Time to return: \( \frac{1}{3} \) hours. Speed = \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}} = 3 \) miles per hour.
- Total distance: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) miles.
- Total time: \( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \) hours.
- Average speed: \( \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \) miles per hour, which matches the given average speed.

The solution is consistent, as the average speed is 4 miles per hour, and the different times (10 minutes and 20 minutes) are accounted for by different walking speeds.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total distance walked.
How to Achieve: Use the distance \( d = 1 \) mile to compute the total distance (to and from the friend's house).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total distance walked = \( d + d = 1 + 1 = 2 \) miles.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total miles Margo walked.
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the distance (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the total distance walked (completed in Step 4).

Current Goal: Completed (total distance calculated as 2 miles).
The goal hierarchy is updated, and all subgoals are resolved.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Margo walked a total of 2 miles.
