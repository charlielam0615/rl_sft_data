**Problem Statement**: Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes and returns home using the same route in 20 minutes. Her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour. We need to determine the total distance she walked.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for the total distance walked.  
1. Calculate the total time for the round trip.  
2. Use the average speed and total time to find the total distance.  
3. Verify the solution accounts for the different walking times.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total time for the round trip. This can be achieved by converting the given times (10 minutes to the friend's house and 20 minutes back) into hours and summing them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Convert the walking times to hours:  
- To the friend's house: 10 minutes = 10/60 = 1/6 hours.  
- Back home: 20 minutes = 20/60 = 1/3 hours.  
Total time = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 hours.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total distance using the average speed and total time. This can be achieved by applying the formula: distance = speed × time.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given the average speed is 4 miles per hour and total time is 1/2 hours:  
Total distance = 4 miles/hour × 1/2 hours = 2 miles.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the total distance Margo walked.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total time for the round trip (completed: 1/2 hours).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the average speed and total time to find the total distance (completed: 2 miles).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution accounts for the different walking times (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution accounts for the different walking times.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the total distance accounts for the different walking times. This can be achieved by checking if the average speed of 4 miles per hour is consistent with the given times and the calculated distance.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The total distance for the round trip is 2 miles, and the total time is 1/2 hours, giving an average speed of 2 miles ÷ 1/2 hours = 4 miles per hour, which matches the given average speed.  
To further validate, assume the distance to the friend's house is \(d\) miles. Then:  
- Outbound speed = \(d / (1/6)\) = 6d miles per hour.  
- Return speed = \(d / (1/3)\) = 3d miles per hour.  
- Average speed = total distance / total time = (d + d) / (1/6 + 1/3) = 2d / (1/2) = 4d miles per hour.  
Given the average speed is 4 miles per hour:  
4d = 4 → d = 1 mile.  
Thus, total distance = 2d = 2 miles, consistent with the earlier calculation.  
The different walking times (10 minutes and 20 minutes) imply different speeds, but the average speed condition holds, confirming the solution.

### Final Answer
Margo walked a total of 2 miles.
