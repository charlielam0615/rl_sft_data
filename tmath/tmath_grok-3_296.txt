**Problem Statement**: Determine the domain of the function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) and express it in interval notation.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the domain of \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \).  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the mathematical constraints for the function to be defined.  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy these constraints.  
- Subgoal 3: Express the valid \( x \)-values in interval notation.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the mathematical constraints for \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) to be defined.  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze the function to determine where it is undefined, considering the square root and division operations.

[IMP]  
The function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) involves a square root and division. For the function to be defined:  
1. The expression under the square root, \( x \), must be non-negative to ensure \( \sqrt{x} \) is real (i.e., \( x \geq 0 \)).  
2. The denominator, \( \sqrt{x} \), must not be zero to avoid division by zero (i.e., \( \sqrt{x} \neq 0 \), so \( x \neq 0 \)).  
Combining these, \( x \) must be strictly positive: \( x > 0 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( x > 0 \) correctly defines the domain.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test boundary and non-boundary values to confirm where the function is defined and undefined.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the function at key points:  
- At \( x = 0 \): \( u(0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0}} \), which is undefined due to division by zero.  
- At \( x = -1 \): \( u(-1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}} \), which is undefined since \( \sqrt{-1} \) is not real.  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( u(1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} = 1 \), which is defined.  
- At \( x = 4 \): \( u(4) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \), which is defined.  
Thus, the function is defined for \( x > 0 \) and undefined for \( x \leq 0 \), confirming the constraint \( x > 0 \).

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the domain of \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify mathematical constraints (completed: \( x > 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine valid \( x \)-values (completed: \( x > 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the valid \( x \)-values (\( x > 0 \)) in interval notation.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Express the domain \( x > 0 \) in interval notation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Convert the inequality \( x > 0 \) into standard interval notation format.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The values of \( x \) where the function is defined are \( x > 0 \). In interval notation, this is expressed as \( (0, \infty) \).

**Final Answer**: The domain of the function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) is \( (0, \infty) \).
