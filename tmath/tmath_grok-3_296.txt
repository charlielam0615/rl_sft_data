**Problem Statement**: Determine the domain of the function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) and express it in interval notation.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the domain of \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the mathematical constraints for the function to be defined.  
2. Determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy these constraints.  
3. Express the valid \( x \)-values in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the mathematical constraints for \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) to be defined. This involves ensuring the expression inside the square root is valid and the denominator is not zero. Analyze the function to determine these constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) involves a square root and a division. For the function to be defined:  
1. The expression under the square root, \( x \), must be non-negative because the square root of a negative number is not real. Thus, \( x \geq 0 \).  
2. The denominator, \( \sqrt{x} \), must not be zero, as division by zero is undefined. Since \( \sqrt{x} = 0 \) when \( x = 0 \), \( x \neq 0 \).  
Combining these constraints, \( x \) must be greater than 0. Therefore, \( x > 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x > 0 \) correctly defines the domain by checking if the function is defined for all such \( x \) and undefined otherwise. Test specific values to confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test values to validate:  
- For \( x = 1 \): \( u(1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} = 1 \), which is defined.  
- For \( x = 0 \): \( u(0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0}} \), which is undefined (division by zero).  
- For \( x = -1 \): \( u(-1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}} \), which is undefined (square root of a negative number).  
The constraint \( x > 0 \) holds, as the function is defined for positive \( x \) and undefined at \( x = 0 \) or for negative \( x \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the domain of \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify mathematical constraints (completed: \( x > 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine valid \( x \)-values (completed: \( x > 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the domain \( x > 0 \) in interval notation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the domain \( x > 0 \) in interval notation. Convert the inequality into the standard interval notation format.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The inequality \( x > 0 \) corresponds to the interval where \( x \) is greater than 0 but does not include 0, extending to positive infinity. In interval notation, this is written as \( (0, \infty) \).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The domain of the function \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) in interval notation is \( (0, \infty) \).
