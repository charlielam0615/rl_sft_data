Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $7@4$ using the given operation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The operation is defined as $x@y = xy - 2x$.  
To calculate $7@4$, substitute $x = 7$ and $y = 4$ into the formula:  
$$
7@4 = (7)(4) - 2(7) = 28 - 14 = 14
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $4@7$ using the given operation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the operation $x@y = xy - 2x$, substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 7$ into the formula:  
$$
4@7 = (4)(7) - 2(4) = 28 - 8 = 20
$$

Goal of this step: Subtract the result of $4@7$ from $7@4$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have calculated:  
$$
7@4 = 14 \quad \text{and} \quad 4@7 = 20
$$  
Now, subtract:  
$$
(7@4) - (4@7) = 14 - 20 = -6

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All steps in the solution process, including operation definition, calculations of 7@4 and 4@7, and the final subtraction.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Operation definition verification:  
   The operation $x@y = xy - 2x$ is explicitly defined. This is a non-commutative operation since the term $-2x$ depends only on the first operand. This property explains why $7@4 \neq 4@7$.

2. Calculation of $7@4$:  
   - Multiplication step: $7 \times 4 = 28$ ✅  
   - Subtraction step: $28 - (2 \times 7) = 28 - 14 = 14$ ✅  
   The arithmetic follows the defined operation correctly.

3. Calculation of $4@7$:  
   - Multiplication step: $4 \times 7 = 28$ ✅  
   - Subtraction step: $28 - (2 \times 4) = 28 - 8 = 20$ ✅  
   The operation is applied consistently with the definition.

4. Final subtraction:  
   - $14 - 20 = -6$ ✅  
   The result aligns with the calculated values.

5. Cross-verification via algebraic manipulation:  
   Let’s derive a general formula for $(x@y) - (y@x)$:  
   $$
   (xy - 2x) - (yx - 2y) = xy - 2x - xy + 2y = -2x + 2y = 2(y - x)
   $$  
   For $x=7, y=4$: $2(4 - 7) = 2(-3) = -6$ ✅  
   This algebraic approach confirms the numerical result.

All components of the solution are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No discrepancies or errors are detected in any step.
