**Problem Statement**: The bacteria in a lab dish double in number every four hours. Starting with 500 bacteria cells, we need to determine in how many hours there will be exactly 32,000 bacteria.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the time required for the bacteria to reach 32,000.  
- Subgoal 1: Model the bacteria growth using an exponential growth formula.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up an equation to find the number of doubling periods needed to reach 32,000 bacteria.  
- Subgoal 3: Convert the number of doubling periods into hours.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the bacteria growth. Since the bacteria double every four hours, we can use the exponential growth formula \( N = N_0 \cdot 2^t \), where \( N_0 \) is the initial number of bacteria, \( N \) is the final number, and \( t \) is the number of doubling periods.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The initial number of bacteria is 500, and the final number is 32,000. The formula is:  
\[ 32,000 = 500 \cdot 2^t \]  
Simplify by dividing both sides by 500:  
\[ 64 = 2^t \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( t \), the number of doubling periods, in the equation \( 64 = 2^t \). This can be achieved by expressing 64 as a power of 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( 64 = 2^6 \), we have:  
\[ 2^6 = 2^t \]  
Thus, \( t = 6 \). This means it takes 6 doubling periods to reach 32,000 bacteria.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if 6 doubling periods result in 32,000 bacteria. Substitute \( t = 6 \) back into the growth formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the formula \( N = 500 \cdot 2^t \):  
\[ N = 500 \cdot 2^6 = 500 \cdot 64 = 32,000 \]  
The calculation confirms that after 6 doubling periods, the number of bacteria is exactly 32,000, validating the solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the number of doubling periods into hours. Since each doubling period is 4 hours, multiply the number of doubling periods by 4.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
With \( t = 6 \) doubling periods and each period lasting 4 hours:  
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the time in hours for the bacteria to reach 32,000.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the bacteria growth (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the number of doubling periods (completed, \( t = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Convert doubling periods to hours (completed, 24 hours).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the time calculated.  
The main goal has been achieved, with the answer being 24 hours.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
It will take 24 hours for the bacteria to reach exactly 32,000.
