### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many hours it will take for a population of 500 bacteria, which doubles every 4 hours, to reach exactly 32,000 bacteria.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve this, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Model the bacterial growth mathematically.  
2. Set up an equation to find the time when the population reaches 32,000.  
3. Solve the equation for the number of hours.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the bacterial growth. Since the bacteria double every 4 hours, use an exponential growth model of the form \( P = P_0 \cdot 2^{t/T} \), where \( P_0 \) is the initial population, \( t \) is time in hours, and \( T \) is the doubling time.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The initial population is 500 bacteria, and the doubling time is 4 hours. Thus, the population at time \( t \) is:  
\[ P(t) = 500 \cdot 2^{t/4} \]  
This equation represents the number of bacteria after \( t \) hours.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an equation for when the population reaches 32,000. Using the model \( P(t) = 500 \cdot 2^{t/4} \), set \( P(t) = 32,000 \) and prepare to solve for \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the population equal to 32,000:  
\[ 500 \cdot 2^{t/4} = 32,000 \]  
Divide both sides by 500:  
\[ 2^{t/4} = \frac{32,000}{500} = 64 \]  
Thus, the equation to solve is:  
\[ 2^{t/4} = 64 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( 2^{t/4} = 64 \) for \( t \). Recognize that 64 is a power of 2, so express 64 as \( 2^6 \), then equate exponents to find \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 64 = 2^6 \), rewrite the equation:  
\[ 2^{t/4} = 2^6 \]  
Equate the exponents:  
\[ \frac{t}{4} = 6 \]  
Multiply both sides by 4:  
\[ t = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \]  
So, \( t = 24 \) hours.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( t = 24 \) hours. Substitute \( t = 24 \) into the growth model \( P(t) = 500 \cdot 2^{t/4} \) and check if the population equals 32,000.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = 24 \):  
\[ P(24) = 500 \cdot 2^{24/4} = 500 \cdot 2^6 = 500 \cdot 64 = 32,000 \]  
The population is exactly 32,000, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the time for 500 bacteria to reach 32,000, doubling every 4 hours.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the bacterial growth (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation for 32,000 bacteria (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation for time (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution is verified.  
The solution is \( t = 24 \) hours.

### Final Answer
It will take **24 hours** for the bacteria population to reach exactly 32,000.
