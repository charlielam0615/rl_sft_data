**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
- Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equation \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \).  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified equation for \( x \).  
- Subgoal 3: Apply the condition \( x \neq 0 \) to exclude invalid solutions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \). This will be achieved by factoring the equation to identify possible solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Factor the equation:  
\[ x^2 - 2x = 0 \]  
\[ x(x - 2) = 0 \]  
This gives the solutions \( x = 0 \) or \( x - 2 = 0 \), so \( x = 2 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \) against the condition \( x \neq 0 \). This will be achieved by checking which solutions satisfy the constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solutions from the factored equation are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).  
Given the condition \( x \neq 0 \), exclude \( x = 0 \).  
Thus, the valid solution is \( x = 2 \).  
To confirm, substitute \( x = 2 \) into the original equation:  
\[ 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  
The equation holds true, so \( x = 2 \) is valid.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \) where \( x \neq 0 \) to find the value of \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (completed: factored to \( x(x - 2) = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified equation (completed: solutions \( x = 0 \), \( x = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the condition \( x \neq 0 \) (completed: excluded \( x = 0 \), validated \( x = 2 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final solution.  
The valid solution, after applying the constraint \( x \neq 0 \), is \( x = 2 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) is \( 2 \).
