**Problem Restatement**: We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \) for \( x \), given that \( x \neq 0 \), and find the value of \( x \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \) with \( x \neq 0 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in a solvable form.  
2. Solve for \( x \).  
3. Exclude any solutions where \( x = 0 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in a solvable form.  
Description: Factorize the equation \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \) to simplify it and prepare for solving.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \), factor out the common term:  
\[ x(x - 2) = 0 \]  
This gives the factored form of the equation.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \( x \).  
Description: Use the factored equation \( x(x - 2) = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( x(x - 2) = 0 \), set each factor equal to zero:  
1. \( x = 0 \)  
2. \( x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2 \)  
The solutions are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Exclude any solutions where \( x = 0 \).  
Description: Apply the condition \( x \neq 0 \) to the solutions \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( x \neq 0 \), discard \( x = 0 \). The remaining solution is \( x = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the solution \( x = 2 \).  
Description: Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation to verify it satisfies \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  
The equation holds true. Additionally, \( x = 2 \neq 0 \), satisfying the given condition.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( x^2 - 2x = 0 \) for \( x \), given \( x \neq 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in a solvable form (completed: factored as \( x(x - 2) = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) (completed: solutions \( x = 0, 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Exclude solutions where \( x = 0 \) (completed: kept \( x = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified \( x = 2 \)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution \( x = 2 \) has been reached and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) is \( 2 \).
