### Problem Statement
We need to determine the minimum number of times three fair six-sided dice must be thrown to guarantee that at least two throws result in the same sum. Each die has six faces (1 through 6), and the sum of a throw is the total of the numbers on the three dice.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, we need to break down the goal into manageable subgoals:
1. Calculate the possible sums when rolling three six-sided dice.
2. Determine the number of possible unique sums.
3. Find the minimum number of throws required to ensure at least two throws produce the same sum, using the pigeonhole principle.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the possible sums when rolling three six-sided dice.
How to Achieve: For each throw, compute the sum of the numbers on the three dice. Identify the minimum and maximum sums, and list all possible sums in between.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The minimum sum occurs when all dice show 1: \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).
The maximum sum occurs when all dice show 6: \(6 + 6 + 6 = 18\).
Thus, the possible sums range from 3 to 18, inclusive.
To confirm, consider a few examples:
- (1, 1, 1) → 3
- (1, 1, 2) → 4
- ...
- (6, 6, 6) → 18
The sums are integers from 3 to 18, so there are \(18 - 3 + 1 = 16\) possible sums.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the number of possible unique sums.
How to Achieve: Ensure that all integer sums from 3 to 18 are achievable by checking if each sum can be formed by some combination of three dice rolls.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, we check if each sum from 3 to 18 is possible:
- Sum 3: (1, 1, 1) → Valid.
- Sum 4: (1, 1, 2) → Valid.
- Sum 5: (1, 1, 3), (1, 2, 2) → Valid.
- Sum 6: (1, 1, 4), (1, 2, 3), (2, 2, 2) → Valid.
- ...
- Sum 18: (6, 6, 6) → Valid.
Since the dice values are 1 to 6, and sums increase incrementally, all integers from 3 to 18 are achievable (as confirmed by combinatorial methods in probability). Thus, there are exactly 16 possible sums.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the minimum number of throws to ensure at least two throws have the same sum.
How to Achieve: Use the pigeonhole principle. The "pigeons" are the throws, and the "pigeonholes" are the possible sums. We need the smallest number of throws such that at least two throws must share the same sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are 16 possible sums (pigeonholes). To guarantee that at least two throws (pigeons) produce the same sum, we need one more throw than the number of possible sums, because if each throw had a unique sum, we could have at most 16 throws. Thus, the minimum number of throws is:
\[ 16 + 1 = 17 \]
This ensures that at least two throws must have the same sum.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the minimum number of throws to ensure the same sum is rolled twice.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the possible sums (Completed: Sums are 3 to 18).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of unique sums (Completed: 16 sums).
  - Subgoal 3: Find the minimum number of throws (Completed: 17 throws).
Current Goal: Verify the solution for correctness.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that 17 throws are necessary and sufficient.
How to Achieve: Check if 16 throws can all have unique sums (making 16 insufficient) and confirm that 17 throws guarantee a repeated sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Check 16 throws**: With 16 possible sums, it’s possible to have 16 throws where each throw produces a unique sum (e.g., one throw for each sum from 3 to 18). Thus, 16 throws do not guarantee a repeated sum.
- **Check 17 throws**: With only 16 possible sums, 17 throws must include at least two throws with the same sum, as per the pigeonhole principle (\(17 > 16\)).
Therefore, 17 is the smallest number of throws that guarantees at least two throws with the same sum.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The minimum number of times you must throw three fair six-sided dice to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice is **17**.
