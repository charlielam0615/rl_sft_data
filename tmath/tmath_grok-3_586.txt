### Problem Statement
We need to determine the minimum number of throws of three fair six-sided dice required to guarantee that at least two throws result in the same sum, regardless of the outcomes.

### Step 1

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Identify the possible sums when rolling three six-sided dice.  
2. Determine the number of possible unique sums (pigeonholes).  
3. Apply the pigeonhole principle to find the minimum number of throws (pigeons) needed to ensure at least two throws have the same sum.  
4. Verify the solution for correctness.

### Step 2

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible sums when rolling three six-sided dice. This can be achieved by calculating the minimum and maximum sums and listing all possible sums in between.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Each die has faces numbered 1 to 6. For three dice:  
- **Minimum sum**: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (all dice show 1).  
- **Maximum sum**: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 (all dice show 6).  
- **Possible sums**: All integers from 3 to 18 are achievable. For example:  
  - Sum = 4: (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1).  
  - Sum = 18: (6, 6, 6).  
Thus, the possible sums are {3, 4, 5, ..., 18}.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of possible unique sums. This can be achieved by counting the distinct sums identified in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The possible sums range from 3 to 18, inclusive.  
Count the number of integers:  
18 − 3 + 1 = 16.  
There are 16 possible unique sums.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the pigeonhole principle to find the minimum number of throws needed to ensure at least two throws have the same sum. This can be achieved by treating the possible sums as pigeonholes and the throws as pigeons, requiring at least two pigeons in one pigeonhole.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Pigeonholes**: The 16 possible sums (3 to 18).  
- **Pigeons**: The throws of the dice.  
- To guarantee that at least one sum appears twice, we need the number of throws to exceed the number of possible sums, ensuring at least one pigeonhole has two or more pigeons.  
- By the pigeonhole principle, with 16 possible sums, after 16 throws, it’s possible to have each sum exactly once (no repeats). However, on the 17th throw, the sum must match one of the previous 16 sums, ensuring at least one sum appears twice.  
Thus, the minimum number of throws is 16 + 1 = 17.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the solution (17 throws). This can be achieved by checking if 16 throws could result in all unique sums and confirming that 17 throws guarantee a repeat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check for 16 throws**: There are exactly 16 possible sums (3 to 18). It’s possible to have 16 throws where each sum occurs exactly once (e.g., throw 1: sum 3, throw 2: sum 4, ..., throw 16: sum 18). Thus, 16 throws do not guarantee a repeated sum.  
- **Check for 17 throws**: With only 16 possible sums, a 17th throw must produce a sum between 3 and 18, which matches one of the sums from the previous 16 throws. This guarantees at least one sum appears twice.  
- **Edge case**: Confirm the sums are well-defined. Each throw produces a sum from 3 to 18, and no other sums are possible, so the pigeonhole setup is valid.  
The solution of 17 throws is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the minimum number of throws to ensure the same sum is rolled twice.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible sums (completed: sums are 3 to 18).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine number of unique sums (completed: 16 sums).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply pigeonhole principle (completed: 17 throws).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solution (completed: 17 is correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The solution process is complete, with all subgoals addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The minimum number of times you must throw three fair six-sided dice to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice is **17**.
