Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Analyze the function $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $ and determine the condition under which $ -2 $ is in its range.

[IMP]
The function $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $ is a quadratic function. Its range depends on whether the parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is positive). The minimum value of $ f(x) $ occurs at the vertex of the parabola.

The vertex of a quadratic function $ ax^2 + bx + c $ is at $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. For $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $, we have $ a = 1 $ and $ b = 3 $, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

$$
x = -\frac{3}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{3}{2}
$$

Substitute $ x = -\frac{3}{2} $ into $ f(x) $ to find the minimum value:

$$
f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + c
$$

$$
f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + c = -\frac{9}{4} + c
$$

So the minimum value of $ f(x) $ is $ -\frac{9}{4} + c $. For $ -2 $ to be in the range of $ f(x) $, it must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. Therefore, we require:

$$
-2 \geq -\frac{9}{4} + c
$$

Solving for $ c $:

$$
-2 + \frac{9}{4} \geq c
$$

$$
\frac{1}{4} \geq c
$$

The largest value of $ c $ such that $ -2 $ is in the range of $ f(x) $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the largest value of $ c $ such that $ -2 $ is in the range of $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we found that the minimum value of the function $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $ is $ -\frac{9}{4} + c $. For $-2$ to be in the range of $ f(x) $, it must satisfy the condition:

$$
-2 \geq -\frac{9}{4} + c
$$

Rewriting this inequality:

$$
-2 + \frac{9}{4} \geq c
$$

$$
\frac{1}{4} \geq c
$$

Thus, the largest value of $ c $ such that $ -2 $ is in the range of $ f(x) $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $.

This is the final result, as it satisfies the constraint that $ -2 $ must be at least the minimum value of the function.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the inequality derivation and the conclusion that the largest value of $ c $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
We need to confirm that the logic leading to $ c \leq \frac{1}{4} $ is sound. 

1. **Vertex Calculation**: The vertex of $ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c $ is at $ x = -\frac{3}{2} $. Substituting this into the function gives the minimum value $ f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -\frac{9}{4} + c $. This is correct because:
   - $ \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4} $
   - $ 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -\frac{9}{2} $
   - Total: $ \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + c = -\frac{9}{4} + c $.

2. **Range Condition**: For $-2$ to be in the range of $ f(x) $, it must satisfy $-2 \geq \text{(minimum value)}$. This is valid because the parabola opens upwards, so the range is $[- \frac{9}{4} + c, \infty)$. Thus, $-2$ must be $ \geq -\frac{9}{4} + c $.

3. **Inequality Solution**:
   - $-2 \geq -\frac{9}{4} + c$
   - Adding $ \frac{9}{4} $ to both sides: $-2 + \frac{9}{4} \geq c$
   - Simplifying: $ \frac{1}{4} \geq c $. This is algebraically correct.

4. **Conclusion**: The largest $ c $ satisfying $ \frac{1}{4} \geq c $ is $ c = \frac{1}{4} $. This ensures $-2$ is exactly the minimum value of the function, hence in the range.

No errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The conclusion is logically consistent with the problem constraints.
