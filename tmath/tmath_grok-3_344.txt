**Problem Statement**: Find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex of the parabola described by the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \), where the vertex is given as the point \( (m, n) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex of the parabola \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola.  
2. Compute the x-coordinate of the vertex (i.e., \( m \)).  
3. Substitute the x-coordinate back into the equation to find the y-coordinate (i.e., \( n \)).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). This can be achieved by recalling that the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation of the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is calculated using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). This formula is derived from the fact that the vertex lies on the axis of symmetry of the parabola.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the x-coordinate of the vertex (i.e., \( m \)) for the parabola \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \). This can be achieved by applying the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), where \( a = -3 \) and \( b = -30 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = -3 \)  
- \( b = -30 \)  
Using the vertex formula:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-30}{2 \cdot (-3)} = \frac{30}{-6} = -5 \]  
Thus, the x-coordinate of the vertex, \( m \), is \( -5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-coordinate of the vertex (i.e., \( n \)) by substituting \( x = -5 \) into the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \). This can be achieved by performing the substitution and simplifying the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -5 \) into the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \):  
\[ y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81 \]  
Calculate each term:  
- First term: \( -3(-5)^2 = -3 \cdot 25 = -75 \)  
- Second term: \( -30(-5) = 150 \)  
- Third term: \( -81 \)  
Combine:  
\[ y = -75 + 150 - 81 = 75 - 81 = -6 \]  
Thus, the y-coordinate of the vertex, \( n \), is \( -6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the vertex coordinates \( (m, n) = (-5, -6) \) are correct by checking the calculation of the y-coordinate and ensuring the x-coordinate aligns with the vertex formula. This can be achieved by recomputing the x-coordinate and y-coordinate and checking for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the x-coordinate:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-30}{2 \cdot (-3)} = \frac{30}{-6} = -5 \]  
This matches \( m = -5 \).  
Recompute the y-coordinate by substituting \( x = -5 \):  
\[ y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81 = -3 \cdot 25 + 150 - 81 = -75 + 150 - 81 = -6 \]  
This matches \( n = -6 \).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the vertex is at \( (-5, -6) \), and thus \( n = -6 \).

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex of the parabola \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex (completed: \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the x-coordinate \( m \) (completed: \( m = -5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the y-coordinate \( n \) (completed: \( n = -6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: vertex confirmed as \( (-5, -6) \)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with \( n = -6 \). No further subgoals are needed.
