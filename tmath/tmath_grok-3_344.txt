### Problem Statement
We need to find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex of the parabola described by the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \), where the vertex is given as the point \( (m, n) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the x-coordinate \( m \) of the vertex using the vertex formula for a parabola.  
2. Substitute \( m \) into the equation to compute the y-coordinate \( n \).  
3. Return the value of \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-coordinate \( m \) of the vertex. For a parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). We will identify the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) from the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \) and apply the formula.

The equation is \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \). Comparing with \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \):  
- \( a = -3 \)  
- \( b = -30 \)  

The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ m = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-30}{2 \cdot (-3)} = \frac{30}{-6} = -5 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex by substituting \( x = m = -5 \) into the equation \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -5 \) into the equation:  
\[ y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81 \]  
\[ = -3(25) + 150 - 81 \]  
\[ = -75 + 150 - 81 \]  
\[ = 75 - 81 \]  
\[ = -6 \]  

Thus, the y-coordinate \( n = -6 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the y-coordinate \( n \) of the vertex of the parabola \( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the x-coordinate \( m \) of the vertex (completed: \( m = -5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the y-coordinate \( n \) by substituting \( m \) into the equation (completed: \( n = -6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Return the value of \( n \) (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Return the value of \( n \).
