### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many four-digit numbers greater than 2999 can be formed such that the product of the middle two digits is greater than 5. A four-digit number is of the form \(ABCD\), where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are digits (0–9), and \(A \neq 0\). Since the number must be greater than 2999, specific constraints apply to the first digit \(A\). Additionally, the product of the middle two digits, \(B \cdot C\), must satisfy \(B \cdot C > 5\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to systematically approach the solution.  
- Subgoal 1: Define the constraints for a four-digit number greater than 2999.  
- Subgoal 2: Identify the possible values for the middle digits \(B\) and \(C\) such that their product \(B \cdot C > 5\).  
- Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of valid combinations for all digits \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation to ensure all conditions are met.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the constraints for a four-digit number greater than 2999. This involves determining the possible values for the first digit \(A\) and understanding the range of the other digits \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
A four-digit number \(ABCD\) has digits \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), where \(A \neq 0\) (since it’s a four-digit number). The number must be greater than 2999, so:  
- If \(A = 2\), the number must be at least 2999, meaning the digits \(BCD\) must form a number \(\geq 999\). Since 2999 itself is included (as \(2 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 162 > 5\)), \(A = 2\) is valid, and \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) must satisfy specific conditions.  
- If \(A \geq 3\), the number is automatically greater than 2999 (e.g., 3000 > 2999).  
Thus, possible values for \(A\) are \(A \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\) (8 choices).  
For \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), each digit can be any value from 0 to 9, unless constrained by the \(A = 2\) case or the product condition \(B \cdot C > 5\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible values for the middle digits \(B\) and \(C\) such that their product \(B \cdot C > 5\). This requires listing all digit pairs \((B, C)\) where both are from 0 to 9 and computing their product.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \(B\) and \(C\) are digits (0–9), compute the product \(B \cdot C\) for all possible pairs:  
- For \(B = 0\) or \(C = 0\), the product is 0, which is not greater than 5.  
- For \(B, C \geq 1\), calculate the product for each pair:  
  - \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\), \(1 \cdot 2 = 2\), \(1 \cdot 3 = 3\), \(1 \cdot 4 = 4\), \(1 \cdot 5 = 5\) (none satisfy \(> 5\)).  
  - \(1 \cdot 6 = 6\), \(1 \cdot 7 = 7\), \(1 \cdot 8 = 8\), \(1 \cdot 9 = 9\) (all satisfy).  
  - \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\), \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\), \(2 \cdot 5 = 10\), \(2 \cdot 6 = 12\), \(2 \cdot 7 = 14\), \(2 \cdot 8 = 16\), \(2 \cdot 9 = 18\).  
  - \(3 \cdot 2 = 6\), \(3 \cdot 3 = 9\), \(3 \cdot 4 = 12\), \(3 \cdot 5 = 15\), \(3 \cdot 6 = 18\), \(3 \cdot 7 = 21\), \(3 \cdot 8 = 24\), \(3 \cdot 9 = 27\).  
  - \(4 \cdot 2 = 8\), \(4 \cdot 3 = 12\), \(4 \cdot 4 = 16\), \(4 \cdot 5 = 20\), \(4 \cdot 6 = 24\), \(4 \cdot 7 = 28\), \(4 \cdot 8 = 32\), \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\).  
  - \(5 \cdot 2 = 10\), \(5 \cdot 3 = 15\), \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\), \(5 \cdot 5 = 25\), \(5 \cdot 6 = 30\), \(5 \cdot 7 = 35\), \(5 \cdot 8 = 40\), \(5 \cdot 9 = 45\).  
  - \(6 \cdot 1 = 6\), \(6 \cdot 2 = 12\), \(6 \cdot 3 = 18\), \(6 \cdot 4 = 24\), \(6 \cdot 5 = 30\), \(6 \cdot 6 = 36\), \(6 \cdot 7 = 42\), \(6 \cdot 8 = 48\), \(6 \cdot 9 = 54\).  
  - \(7 \cdot 1 = 7\), \(7 \cdot 2 = 14\), \(7 \cdot 3 = 21\), \(7 \cdot 4 = 28\), \(7 \cdot 5 = 35\), \(7 \cdot 6 = 42\), \(7 \cdot 7 = 49\), \(7 \cdot 8 = 56\), \(7 \cdot 9 = 63\).  
  - \(8 \cdot 1 = 8\), \(8 \cdot 2 = 16\), \(8 \cdot 3 = 24\), \(8 \cdot 4 = 32\), \(8 \cdot 5 = 40\), \(8 \cdot 6 = 48\), \(8 \cdot 7 = 56\), \(8 \cdot 8 = 64\), \(8 \cdot 9 = 72\).  
  - \(9 \cdot 1 = 9\), \(9 \cdot 2 = 18\), \(9 \cdot 3 = 27\), \(9 \cdot 4 = 36\), \(9 \cdot 5 = 45\), \(9 \cdot 6 = 54\), \(9 \cdot 7 = 63\), \(9 \cdot 8 = 72\), \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\).  
Pairs with \(B \cdot C > 5\) are those where at least one digit is \(\geq 6\), or both are sufficiently large (e.g., \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\)). Counting pairs:  
- Total possible pairs: \(10 \cdot 10 = 100\).  
- Exclude pairs where \(B = 0\) or \(C = 0\): \(10 + 10 - 1 = 19\) pairs (since \(0,0\) is counted once).  
- For \(B, C \in \{1, \ldots, 9\}\), there are \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\) pairs.  
- From the above, exclude pairs where \(B \cdot C \leq 5\):  
  - \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\), \(1 \cdot 2 = 2\), \(1 \cdot 3 = 3\), \(1 \cdot 4 = 4\), \(1 \cdot 5 = 5\), \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\), \(2 \cdot 2 = 4\), \(3 \cdot 1 = 3\), \(4 \cdot 1 = 4\), \(5 \cdot 1 = 5\).  
  - That’s 10 pairs with \(B \cdot C \leq 5\).  
- Valid pairs: \(81 - 10 = 71\).  
Thus, there are 71 valid \((B, C)\) pairs where \(B \cdot C > 5\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the subgoals based on progress. Since we’ve defined the constraints for \(A\) and the valid pairs for \(B\) and \(C\), refine the next subgoal to focus on handling the case when \(A = 2\) (where \(BCD \geq 999\)) separately from \(A \geq 3\), and then compute the total number of valid numbers.  
- Updated Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of valid four-digit numbers for \(A = 2\) (with \(BCD \geq 999\)) and for \(A \geq 3\), ensuring \(B \cdot C > 5\).  
- Subgoal 4 remains: Verify the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of four-digit numbers greater than 2999 with the product of middle digits \(B \cdot C > 5\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define constraints for a four-digit number greater than 2999 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify valid \((B, C)\) pairs where \(B \cdot C > 5\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of valid four-digit numbers for \(A = 2\) (with \(BCD \geq 999\)) and for \(A \geq 3\), ensuring \(B \cdot C > 5\) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation.  
**Current Goal**: Subgoal 3.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of valid four-digit numbers for \(A = 2\) (with \(BCD \geq 999\)) and for \(A \geq 3\), ensuring \(B \cdot C > 5\). This involves computing the number of valid combinations for each case and summing them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Case 1: \(A = 2\), \(BCD \geq 999\)**  
- \(BCD\) represents a three-digit number \(\geq 999\). Since \(BCD\) are digits, the only valid number is \(BCD = 999\).  
- Check the product: \(B = 9\), \(C = 9\), so \(B \cdot C = 9 \cdot 9 = 81 > 5\).  
- For \(A = 2\), \(B = 9\), \(C = 9\), \(D = 9\), the number is 2999, which is valid.  
- Number of valid numbers in this case: 1 (only 2999).  

**Case 2: \(A \in \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\)**  
- There are 7 choices for \(A\) (3 to 9).  
- For \(B\) and \(C\), use the 71 valid pairs from Step 3 where \(B \cdot C > 5\).  
- \(D\) can be any digit (0–9): 10 choices.  
- Total numbers: \(7 \cdot 71 \cdot 10 = 4970\).  

**Total**:  
- Case 1: 1 number (2999).  
- Case 2: 4970 numbers.  
- Total = \(1 + 4970 = 4971\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking the constraints and ensuring all conditions are met, particularly for the \(A = 2\) case and the product \(B \cdot C > 5\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Verify \(A = 2\) case**: The number must be \(\geq 2999\). Only \(BCD = 999\) was considered, giving 2999, with \(9 \cdot 9 = 81 > 5\). If \(BCD < 999\), e.g., 2998 (\(B=9, C=9, D=8\)), the number is 2998 < 2999, so it’s invalid. Thus, only 2999 is valid for \(A = 2\).  
- **Verify \(A \geq 3\) case**: All numbers with \(A \geq 3\) are > 2999. The 71 pairs for \(B, C\) satisfy \(B \cdot C > 5\), and \(D\) has 10 choices. Calculation: \(7 \cdot 71 \cdot 10 = 4970\) is consistent.  
- **Product check**: All pairs used have \(B \cdot C > 5\), as computed in Step 3.  
- **Total check**: \(1 + 4970 = 4971\). No overlaps or missing cases, as \(A = 2\) and \(A \geq 3\) are mutually exclusive.  
The calculation appears correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The number of four-digit numbers greater than 2999 such that the product of the middle two digits exceeds 5 is **4971**.
