Let’s solve the problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set (M) as specified, ensuring each step selects one action from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and follows the required format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks.

---

**Problem Restatement**: Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the parabola \( y = 4x^2 + 7x - 1 \), and the origin \( (0, 0) \) is the midpoint of segment \( \overline{AB} \). We need to find the square of the length of \( \overline{AB} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) on the parabola.  
2. Use the midpoint condition at the origin to relate the coordinates.  
3. Compute the length of \( \overline{AB} \) using the distance formula.  
4. Square the length to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) and use the midpoint condition. Let \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), where \( y_1 = 4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1 \) and \( y_2 = 4x_2^2 + 7x_2 - 1 \). Since the origin is the midpoint, the average of the x- and y-coordinates is zero. This will be achieved by setting up equations based on the midpoint formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since points \( A \) and \( B \) are on the parabola \( y = 4x^2 + 7x - 1 \), their coordinates are:  
- \( A = (x_1, 4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1) \)  
- \( B = (x_2, 4x_2^2 + 7x_2 - 1) \).  

The origin \( (0, 0) \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), so:  
- \( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 0 \implies x_1 + x_2 = 0 \implies x_2 = -x_1 \).  
- \( \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 0 \implies y_1 + y_2 = 0 \).  

Substitute \( y_1 = 4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1 \) and \( y_2 = 4x_2^2 + 7x_2 - 1 \), and use \( x_2 = -x_1 \):  
- \( y_2 = 4(-x_1)^2 + 7(-x_1) - 1 = 4x_1^2 - 7x_1 - 1 \).  
- Midpoint condition for y: \( y_1 + y_2 = (4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1) + (4x_1^2 - 7x_1 - 1) = 8x_1^2 - 2 = 0 \).  
- Solve: \( 8x_1^2 - 2 = 0 \implies 8x_1^2 = 2 \implies x_1^2 = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \implies x_1 = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).  

If \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), then \( x_2 = -\frac{1}{2} \). Compute y-coordinates:  
- \( y_1 = 4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{7}{2} - 1 = 1 + \frac{7}{2} - 1 = \frac{7}{2} \).  
- \( y_2 = 4\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 7\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 = 1 - \frac{7}{2} - 1 = -\frac{7}{2} \).  

Thus, \( A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) \), \( B = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{7}{2} \right) \). Verify midpoint:  
- x: \( \frac{\frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{2} = 0 \).  
- y: \( \frac{\frac{7}{2} + \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right)}{2} = 0 \).  

The coordinates satisfy the midpoint condition.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \) by ensuring they lie on the parabola and satisfy the midpoint condition. This will be achieved by substituting the x-coordinates into the parabola’s equation and rechecking the midpoint.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Points are \( A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) \), \( B = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{7}{2} \right) \). Check if they lie on \( y = 4x^2 + 7x - 1 \):  
- For \( A \): \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), compute \( y = 4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 = 1 + \frac{7}{2} - 1 = \frac{7}{2} \). Matches.  
- For \( B \): \( x_2 = -\frac{1}{2} \), compute \( y = 4\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 7\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 = 1 - \frac{7}{2} - 1 = -\frac{7}{2} \). Matches.  

Recheck midpoint: Already verified in Step 2 as \( (0, 0) \). The coordinates are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the square of the length of \( \overline{AB} \). Using points \( A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) \) and \( B = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{7}{2} \right) \), apply the distance formula and square the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distance \( AB \):  
\[ AB = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{7}{2} - \left(-\frac{7}{2}\right) \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{7}{2} + \frac{7}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{1 + 49} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}. \]  

Square the length:  
\[ AB^2 = (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 25 \cdot 2 = 50. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the square of the length of \( \overline{AB} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define coordinates of \( A \) and \( B \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use midpoint condition (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate coordinates (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute and square the length of \( \overline{AB} \) (completed in Step 4).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the square of the length is computed as 50.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The square of the length of \( \overline{AB} \) is **50**.
