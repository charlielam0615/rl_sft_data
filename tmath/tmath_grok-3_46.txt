### Problem Restatement
The function machine takes an input of 10 and processes it through a series of operations depicted in an Asymptote diagram. The operations include:
1. Multiply by 2.
2. Compare with 18, leading to two possible paths:
   - If the result is ≤ 18, add 8.
   - If the result is > 18, subtract 5.
3. Output the final result.
We need to determine the output when the input is 10.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the output:
1. Apply the "Multiply by 2" operation to the input (10).
2. Compare the result with 18 to determine the next operation.
3. Based on the comparison, apply either "Add 8" (if ≤ 18) or "Subtract 5" (if > 18).
4. Compute the final output.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the first operation, "Multiply by 2," to the input value of 10. This will be achieved by performing the multiplication 10 × 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute the first operation:  
Input = 10  
10 × 2 = 20  
Result after multiplication: 20
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compare the result (20) with 18 to determine the next operation. This will be achieved by checking if 20 is ≤ 18 or > 18.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the result with 18:  
20 > 18  
Since 20 is greater than 18, follow the "> 18" path, which leads to the "Subtract 5" operation.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the "Subtract 5" operation to the result (20). This will be achieved by performing the subtraction 20 - 5.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the "Subtract 5" operation:  
20 - 5 = 15  
Result after subtraction: 15
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed output (15) by retracing the steps to ensure correctness. This will be achieved by rechecking each operation and the decision point.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the path:  
1. Input = 10, multiply by 2: 10 × 2 = 20.  
2. Compare 20 with 18: 20 > 18, so take the "> 18" path (Subtract 5).  
3. Subtract 5: 20 - 5 = 15.  
All steps align with the diagram’s logic, confirming the output is correct.

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the output of the function machine with input 10.  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply input (10) by 2 → Result: 20.  
  - Subgoal 2: Compare result (20) with 18 → Result: 20 > 18, take "> 18" path.  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply "Subtract 5" operation → Result: 15.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result → Confirmed correct.  
**Current Goal**: Completed (output determined as 15).  
The hierarchy reflects the completed steps, with the final output computed.

### Final Answer
The output of the function machine with input 15 is **3**.  

\[ \boxed{3} \]
