### Problem Restatement
Given a function machine with an input of 10, determine the output by following these steps:
1. Multiply the input by 2.
2. Compare the result with 18.
3. If the result is less than or equal to 18, add 8.
4. If the result is greater than 18, subtract 5.
5. The final result is the output.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the output:  
- Subgoal 1: Multiply the input (10) by 2.  
- Subgoal 2: Compare the result with 18 to determine the path.  
- Subgoal 3: Based on the comparison, either add 8 or subtract 5 to obtain the output.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the input (10) by 2. This will be achieved by performing the arithmetic operation directly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the input by 2:  
10 × 2 = 20  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compare the result (20) with 18 to determine which path to take. This will be achieved by evaluating whether 20 is less than or equal to 18 or greater than 18.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare 20 with 18:  
20 > 18, so take the path for "greater than 18" (subtract 5).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to subtract 5 from the result (20) since it is greater than 18. This will be achieved by performing the subtraction to find the output.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Subtract 5 from 20:  
20 - 5 = 15  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the output of the function machine with input 10.  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply input (10) by 2 → Result: 20 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compare result (20) with 18 → Result: 20 > 18, take subtract 5 path (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract 5 from 20 → Result: 15 (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Completed (output determined as 15).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The output of the function machine with an input of 10 is 15.
