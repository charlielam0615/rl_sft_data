### Problem Statement
Evaluate the expression \( 81^{3/4} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem of evaluating \( 81^{3/4} \) into manageable subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the expression \( 81^{3/4} \) as a radical to simplify computation.  
2. Express 81 as a power of a base number to facilitate fractional exponentiation.  
3. Compute the exponentiation by applying the fractional exponent.  
4. Simplify the result to its numerical value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite \( 81^{3/4} \) as a radical to simplify computation. This can be achieved by expressing the fractional exponent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as \( 81^{3/4} = \sqrt[4]{81^3} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( 81^{3/4} \) using radical notation:  
\[ 81^{3/4} = (81^3)^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{81^3} \]  
Alternatively, it can be written as:  
\[ 81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 \]  
For simplicity, we will proceed with \( \sqrt[4]{81^3} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express 81 as a power of a base number. Since 81 is a power of 3 (\( 81 = 3^4 \)), rewrite \( 81^{3/4} \) using this base to simplify the exponentiation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Express 81 as \( 3^4 \):  
\[ 81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} \]  
Apply the power rule \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} \):  
\[ (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4 \cdot \frac{3}{4}} = 3^{4 \cdot \frac{3}{4}} = 3^3 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 3^3 \) and simplify to obtain the numerical value of \( 81^{3/4} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 3^3 \):  
\[ 3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27 \]  
Thus, \( 81^{3/4} = 27 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result by checking if \( 27^{4/3} \) equals 81, confirming that \( 27 = 81^{3/4} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, compute the inverse: if \( 81^{3/4} = 27 \), then \( 27^{4/3} \) should equal 81.  
Express 27 as \( 3^3 \):  
\[ 27^{4/3} = (3^3)^{4/3} = 3^{3 \cdot \frac{4}{3}} = 3^4 = 81 \]  
Since \( 27^{4/3} = 81 \), the result \( 81^{3/4} = 27 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \( 81^{3/4} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite \( 81^{3/4} \) as a radical (\( \sqrt[4]{81^3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express 81 as a power of 3 (\( 81 = 3^4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the exponentiation (\( (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^3 \)).
