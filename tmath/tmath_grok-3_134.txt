**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To evaluate \( 81^{3/4} \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the exponent \( 3/4 \) in a form that facilitates computation, such as using roots or powers.  
2. Express 81 as a power of a base number to simplify the expression.  
3. Apply the exponent to compute the numerical value.  
4. Verify the result for accuracy.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the exponent \( 3/4 \) and express 81 as a power of a base number. This can be achieved by interpreting \( 81^{3/4} \) as \( (81^{1/4})^3 \) or \( \sqrt[4]{81^3} \), and recognizing that \( 81 = 3^4 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( 81^{3/4} \):  
- The exponent \( 3/4 \) means raising 81 to the power of 3 and then taking the fourth root, or equivalently, taking the fourth root of 81 and raising it to the power of 3. Mathematically, \( 81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 = \sqrt[4]{81^3} \).  
- Express 81 as a power: \( 81 = 3^4 \).  
Thus, \( 81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} \).  
Using the power rule \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} \):  
\( (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4 \cdot 3/4} = 3^{3} = 27 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed result \( 81^{3/4} = 27 \). This can be achieved by using an alternative method to compute \( 81^{3/4} \) and checking for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validate using an alternative approach:  
- Compute \( 81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 \).  
- Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), the fourth root is \( 81^{1/4} = (3^4)^{1/4} = 3^{4/4} = 3^1 = 3 \).  
- Raise to the power of 3: \( (81^{1/4})^3 = 3^3 = 27 \).  
This matches the previous result.  
Additionally, approximate numerically: \( 81^{3/4} \approx 81^{0.75} \). Since \( 81^{0.5} = \sqrt{81} = 9 \) and \( 81^{1} = 81 \), \( 81^{0.75} \) should be between 9 and 81. Computing \( 3^3 = 27 \) fits this range and confirms the result.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \( 81^{3/4} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the exponent \( 3/4 \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express 81 as a power of a base number (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the exponent to compute the value (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is completed, with the result \( 81^{3/4} = 27 \). No further subgoals are active.

**Final Answer**:  
\( 81^{3/4} = 27 \)
