Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses.

[IMP]
The original expression is:  
$$
2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)
$$  
Distribute the negative sign across the terms in the parentheses:  
$$
2x + 8x^2 + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x^2
$$
[/IMP]

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Now combine the like terms:  
- For $x^2$ terms: $8x^2 + 8x^2 = 16x^2$  
- For $x$ terms: $2x + 2x = 4x$  
- For constant terms: $9 - 4 = 5$  

So the simplified expression is:  
$$
16x^2 + 4x + 5
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the simplified expression and the arithmetic operations performed.

[VERIFY]
1. Original expression: 2x + 8x² + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x²)  
   After distributing the negative sign:  
   2x + 8x² + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x²  
   This step is correct because distributing the negative sign changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses:  
   - (4) → -4, - (-2x) → +2x, - (-8x²) → +8x².

2. Combining like terms:  
   - x² terms: 8x² + 8x² = 16x² ✔️  
   - x terms: 2x + 2x = 4x ✔️  
   - Constant terms: 9 - 4 = 5 ✔️  

3. Final expression: 16x² + 4x + 5  
   All coefficients match the expected values, and no terms were omitted or miscalculated during the simplification process.  
   No contradictions or errors detected in the arithmetic operations or term grouping.  
   The expression is correctly simplified to the required form ax² + bx + c with a = 16, b = 4, c = 5.  
   $\boxed{correct}$
