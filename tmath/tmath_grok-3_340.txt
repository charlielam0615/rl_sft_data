**Problem Statement**: Billy's age is twice Joe's age, and the sum of their ages is 45. We need to determine Billy's age.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for Billy's and Joe's ages.  
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships.  
3. Solve the equations to find Billy's age.  
4. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the problem's relationships. Billy's age is twice Joe's age, and their ages sum to 45. Define Joe's age as a variable, express Billy's age in terms of Joe's, and create an equation for their sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let Joe's age be \( J \) years. Since Billy's age is twice Joe's age, Billy's age is \( 2J \). The sum of their ages is given as 45, so we can write the equation:  
\[ J + 2J = 45 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 3J = 45 \]  
Solve for \( J \):  
\[ J = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]  
Thus, Joe's age is 15 years, and Billy's age is \( 2J = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) years.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the calculated ages satisfy the problem's conditions. Substitute Joe's age (15) and Billy's age (30) into the given relationships to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the conditions:  
1. Billy's age is twice Joe's age: \( 30 = 2 \times 15 \), which is true.  
2. The sum of their ages is 45: \( 15 + 30 = 45 \), which is true.  
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine Billy's age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for Billy's and Joe's ages (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve equations based on the given relationships (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution and provide the final answer.  
Billy's age is 30 years, as calculated and verified.
