**Problem Statement**: Billy's age is twice Joe's age, and the sum of their ages is 45. We need to determine Billy's age.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for Billy's and Joe's ages.
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships.
3. Solve the equations to find Joe's age.
4. Calculate Billy's age using the relationship with Joe's age.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations based on the problem statement.
How to Achieve: Assign variables to represent Billy's and Joe's ages, then translate the problem's conditions (Billy's age is twice Joe's age, and their ages sum to 45) into mathematical equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let Joe's age be \( J \) years. Since Billy's age is twice Joe's age, Billy's age is \( 2J \). The sum of their ages is given as 45, so we can write the equation:
\[ J + 2J = 45 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 3J = 45 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find Joe's age.
How to Achieve: Simplify the equation \( 3J = 45 \) by dividing both sides by 3 to isolate \( J \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[ 3J = 45 \]
\[ J = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]
So, Joe's age is 15 years.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate Billy's age using the relationship with Joe's age.
How to Achieve: Since Billy's age is twice Joe's age, multiply Joe's age (15) by 2 to find Billy's age.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Billy's age is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]
So, Billy is 30 years old.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies the problem's conditions.
How to Achieve: Substitute Joe's age (15) and Billy's age (30) into the original conditions: Billy's age should be twice Joe's age, and their ages should sum to 45.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the conditions:
1. Billy's age (30) should be twice Joe's age (15):
   \[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \], which is correct.
2. The sum of their ages should be 45:
   \[ 15 + 30 = 45 \], which is correct.
The solution satisfies both conditions.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine Billy's age.
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for Billy's and Joe's ages (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the problem statement (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equations to find Joe's age (completed, Joe's age = 15).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate Billy's age (completed, Billy's age = 30).
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the solution (completed, solution verified).
Current Goal: None (problem solved).
