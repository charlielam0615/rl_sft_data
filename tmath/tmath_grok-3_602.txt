**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of positive, three-digit integers (from 100 to 999) that have at least one digit as 3 and no digits as 5.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
1. Calculate the total number of three-digit integers.  
2. Determine the number of three-digit integers with no digit as 5.  
3. From those, find the number of integers with at least one digit as 3.  
4. Use complementary counting to simplify calculations if needed.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of three-digit integers.  
How to Achieve: A three-digit integer ranges from 100 to 999. Count the numbers in this range inclusively.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The range of three-digit integers is from 100 to 999.  
Total numbers = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of three-digit integers with no digit as 5.  
How to Achieve: Each digit (hundreds, tens, units) can be any number from 0 to 9, excluding 5, except the hundreds digit cannot be 0. Calculate the number of valid choices for each digit.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Hundreds digit: Choices are 1 to 9, excluding 5 → {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 8 choices.  
- Tens digit: Choices are 0 to 9, excluding 5 → {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 9 choices.  
- Units digit: Same as tens → 9 choices.  
Total numbers with no digit as 5 = 8 × 9 × 9 = 648.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the number of three-digit integers with no digit as 5 and at least one digit as 3.  
How to Achieve: Use complementary counting. First, calculate the number of three-digit integers with no digit as 5 and no digit as 3. Subtract this from the total number of three-digit integers with no digit as 5.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For numbers with no digit as 5 and no digit as 3:  
  - Hundreds digit: Choices are 1 to 9, excluding 3 and 5 → {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 7 choices.  
  - Tens digit: Choices are 0 to 9, excluding 3 and 5 → {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 8 choices.  
  - Units digit: Same as tens → 8 choices.  
  Total numbers with no 5 and no 3 = 7 × 8 × 8 = 448.  
- Numbers with no 5 and at least one 3 = Total with no 5 - Total with no 5 and no 3 = 648 - 448 = 200.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation using an alternative method.  
How to Achieve: Directly count numbers with at least one 3 and no 5 by considering cases based on the position of the digit 3.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Consider three cases for at least one 3 (no digit is 5):  
1. **Hundreds digit is 3**:  
   - Hundreds: 3 (1 choice).  
   - Tens: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 9 choices.  
   - Units: 9 choices.  
   Total = 1 × 9 × 9 = 81.  
2. **Hundreds digit is not 3, tens digit is 3**:  
   - Hundreds: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 7 choices.  
   - Tens: 3 (1 choice).  
   - Units: 9 choices.  
   Total = 7 × 1 × 9 = 63.  
3. **Hundreds and tens digits are not 3, units digit is 3**:  
   - Hundreds: 7 choices.  
   - Tens: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} = 8 choices.  
   - Units: 3 (1 choice).  
   Total = 7 × 8 × 1 = 56.  
Sum cases (disjoint due to exactly one 3 in each case for simplicity, but adjust for overlaps):  
Total = 81 + 63 + 56 = 200.  
This matches the previous result, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of three-digit integers with at least one 3 and no 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total three-digit integers (completed: 900).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate numbers with no 5 (completed: 648).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate numbers with no 5 and at least one 3 (completed: 200).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: confirmed 200).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The number of positive, three-digit integers that contain at least one 3 as a digit but do not contain a 5 as a digit is 200.
