**Problem Restatement**: A club has 10 members, consisting of 5 boys and 5 girls. Two members are chosen at random. We need to calculate the probability that both selected members are girls.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 members from the 10 members.  
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 5 girls.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 girls) to total outcomes (choosing 2 members).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 members from 10 members.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of members and \( k \) is the number of members chosen. Here, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( C(10, 2) \):  
\[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]  
There are 45 possible ways to choose 2 members from 10.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5 girls.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) \), where \( n \) is the number of girls and \( k \) is the number of members chosen. Here, \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( C(5, 2) \):  
\[ C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]  
There are 10 possible ways to choose 2 girls from 5.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability that both selected members are girls.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 girls) by the total number of outcomes (choosing 2 members).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 girls}}{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 members}} = \frac{C(5, 2)}{C(10, 2)} = \frac{10}{45} = \frac{2}{9} \]  
The probability that both selected members are girls is \( \frac{2}{9} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the probability calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate using an alternative method (e.g., probability of individual selections) and check if the result matches.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Alternative approach: Consider the probability of selecting two girls in sequence (with order mattering, then adjust for combinations).  
- Probability of first member being a girl: \( \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \).  
- Probability of second member being a girl (after one girl is chosen): \( \frac{4}{9} \).  
- Probability of both being girls (with order): \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9} \).  
Since the order of selection doesnâ€™t matter, this confirms the combination method: \( \frac{C(5, 2)}{C(10, 2)} = \frac{10}{45} = \frac{2}{9} \).  
The calculations are consistent, so the probability \( \frac{2}{9} \) is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that both selected members are girls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total ways to choose 2 members (completed: 45 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate ways to choose 2 girls (completed: 10 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability (completed: \( \frac{2}{9} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: verified using sequential probability).

**Final Answer**: The probability that both chosen members are girls is \( \frac{2}{9} \).
