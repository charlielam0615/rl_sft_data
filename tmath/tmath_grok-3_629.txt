**Problem Restatement:**  
We have a club with 10 members, consisting of 5 boys and 5 girls. We need to find the probability that when 2 members are chosen at random, both of them are girls.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to calculate the probability of selecting 2 girls out of the 10 members. The subgoals are:  
1. Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 members from the 10 members.  
2. Determine the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 5 girls.  
3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 members from 10.  
Description: Use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!) to find the number of ways to select 2 members from 10, where order does not matter.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the combination formula C(10, 2):  
C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = (10 × 9) / (2 × 1) = 45.  
So, there are 45 possible ways to choose 2 members from the 10 club members.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5.  
Description: Use the combination formula again to find the number of ways to select 2 girls from the 5 girls.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the combination formula C(5, 2):  
C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4) / (2 × 1) = 10.  
So, there are 10 favorable outcomes where both selected members are girls.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of selecting 2 girls.  
Description: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (ways to choose 2 girls) by the total number of possible outcomes (ways to choose any 2 members).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 10 / 45 = 2 / 9.  
Therefore, the probability that both chosen members are girls is 2/9.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that 2 randomly chosen members are both girls.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 members from 10 (Completed: 45 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5 (Completed: 10 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability by dividing favorable outcomes by total outcomes (Completed: 2/9).  
Current Goal: Review the hierarchy and confirm completion of all subgoals.  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal has been achieved with the probability calculated as 2/9.
