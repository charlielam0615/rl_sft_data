Goal of this step: Find the equation of the perpendicular line using the point (5, 5).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The perpendicular line has a slope of $ -\frac{1}{2} $ and passes through the point $ (5, 5) $. Using the point-slope form of a line, $ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $, where $ (x_1, y_1) = (5, 5) $ and $ m = -\frac{1}{2} $, we substitute:  
$$
y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 5)
$$  
Simplify to get the equation in slope-intercept form:  
$$
y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2}
$$  
$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + 5
$$  
$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2}
$$  
Thus, the equation of the perpendicular line is $ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} $.

I am focusing on solving the system of equations formed by the given line $ y = 2x + 5 $ and the perpendicular line $ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} $ to find their intersection point.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now solve the system of equations:  
$$
y = 2x + 5 \quad \text{(1)}
$$  
$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} \quad \text{(2)}
$$  

Set the two expressions for $ y $ equal to each other:  
$$
2x + 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2}
$$  

Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
$$
4x + 10 = -x + 15
$$  

Solve for $ x $:  
$$
4x + x = 15 - 10
$$  
$$
5x = 5
$$  
$$
x = 1
$$  

Substitute $ x = 1 $ into equation (1) to find $ y $:  
$$
y = 2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7
$$  

Thus, the intersection point is $ (1, 7) $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Slope calculation verification**:  
   The original line has slope 2. The negative reciprocal is indeed -1/2. This matches the calculation in the implementation step.

2. **Perpendicular line equation verification**:  
   Using point-slope form with (5,5):  
   $ y - 5 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 5) $  
   Expanding:  
   $ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} + 5 $  
   $ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} $  
   This aligns with the implementation.

3. **System solution verification**:  
   - Equation setup: $ 2x + 5 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} $  
   - Multiplying by 2: $ 4x + 10 = -x + 15 $  
   - Solving: $ 5x = 5 \Rightarrow x = 1 $  
   - Substituting $ x = 1 $ into $ y = 2x + 5 $: $ y = 7 $  
   - Final point: $ (1, 7) $  

4. **Intersection validation**:  
   - $ (1,7) $ in $ y = 2x + 5 $: $ 7 = 2(1) + 5 \Rightarrow 7 = 7 $ (✓)  
   - $ (1,7) $ in $ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{15}{2} $: $ 7 = -\frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{15}{2} \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{14}{2} \Rightarrow 7 = 7 $ (✓)  

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically correct. The intersection point satisfies both equations.
