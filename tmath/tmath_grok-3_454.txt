**Problem Statement**: We need to find a complex number that, when added to \(3 - 5i\), results in \(2 + 7i\), where \(i^2 = -1\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Represent the unknown complex number to be added as \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.  
2. Set up an equation based on the given condition: \((3 - 5i) + (a + bi) = 2 + 7i\).  
3. Solve for \(a\) and \(b\) by equating real and imaginary parts.  
4. Verify the solution by checking the addition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation \((3 - 5i) + (a + bi) = 2 + 7i\) to find \(a + bi\). This will be achieved by simplifying the equation and equating the real and imaginary parts to form a system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).

Start with the equation:  
\[
(3 - 5i) + (a + bi) = 2 + 7i
\]  
Combine like terms on the left:  
\[
(3 + a) + (-5 + b)i = 2 + 7i
\]  
Equate real and imaginary parts:  
- Real part: \(3 + a = 2\)  
- Imaginary part: \(-5 + b = 7\)  

Solve for \(a\):  
\[
3 + a = 2 \implies a = 2 - 3 = -1
\]  
Solve for \(b\):  
\[
-5 + b = 7 \implies b = 7 + 5 = 12
\]  
Thus, the complex number to be added is \(-1 + 12i\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that adding \(-1 + 12i\) to \(3 - 5i\) yields \(2 + 7i\). This will be achieved by performing the addition and checking if the result matches the target.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add \(3 - 5i\) and \(-1 + 12i\):  
\[
(3 - 5i) + (-1 + 12i) = (3 - 1) + (-5 + 12)i = 2 + 7i
\]  
The result is \(2 + 7i\), which matches the target. The solution is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the complex number that, when added to \(3 - 5i\), gives \(2 + 7i\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Represent the unknown number as \(a + bi\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation \((3 - 5i) + (a + bi) = 2 + 7i\). (Completed, found \(a = -1\), \(b = 12\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed, verified \(2 + 7i\))  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the solution \(-1 + 12i\) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The number to add is \(-1 + 12i\).
