### Problem Statement
We need to find a complex number \( z \) such that adding it to \( 3 - 5i \) results in \( 2 + 7i \). That is, solve the equation:
\[
(3 - 5i) + z = 2 + 7i
\]
where \( i^2 = -1 \).

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express the unknown complex number \( z \) in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers.
2. Set up an equation by adding \( z \) to \( 3 - 5i \) to equal \( 2 + 7i \).
3. Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by equating real and imaginary parts.
4. Verify the solution by checking the addition.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the equation to find \( z \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( z = a + bi \) into the equation \( (3 - 5i) + z = 2 + 7i \), combine like terms, and equate the real and imaginary parts to form a system of equations. Solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[
(3 - 5i) + (a + bi) = 2 + 7i
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(3 + a) + (-5 + b)i = 2 + 7i
\]
Equate the real and imaginary parts:
- Real part: \( 3 + a = 2 \)
- Imaginary part: \( -5 + b = 7 \)

Solve the real part equation:
\[
3 + a = 2 \implies a = 2 - 3 \implies a = -1
\]
Solve the imaginary part equation:
\[
-5 + b = 7 \implies b = 7 + 5 \implies b = 12
\]
Thus, the complex number is:
\[
z = a + bi = -1 + 12i
\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that adding \( z = -1 + 12i \) to \( 3 - 5i \) yields \( 2 + 7i \).

**How to Achieve**: Perform the addition \( (3 - 5i) + (-1 + 12i) \) and check if the result equals \( 2 + 7i \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute:
\[
(3 - 5i) + (-1 + 12i) = (3 - 1) + (-5 + 12)i = 2 + 7i
\]
The result matches \( 2 + 7i \), confirming the solution is correct.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the complex number \( z \) such that \( (3 - 5i) + z = 2 + 7i \).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \( z \) as \( a + bi \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed)

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \( z = -1 + 12i \) has been found and verified.

**Summary**: All subgoals have been addressed, and the solution \( z = -1 + 12i \) satisfies the equation.

### Final Answer
The number that must be added to \( 3 - 5i \) to get \( 2 + 7i \) is:
\[
\boxed{-1 + 12i}
