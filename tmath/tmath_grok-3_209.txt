**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i)\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To simplify the expression \(5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i)\), break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Distribute \(5\) to the terms in \(3 - i\).
2. Distribute \(3i\) to the terms in \(5 - i\).
3. Combine the results from both distributions.
4. Simplify by combining like terms (real and imaginary parts).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Distribute \(5\) to the terms in \(3 - i\).
Description: Multiply \(5\) by each term inside the parentheses \(3 - i\), resulting in \(5 \cdot 3\) and \(5 \cdot (-i)\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the distribution:
\[
5(3 - i) = 5 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot (-i) = 15 - 5i
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Distribute \(3i\) to the terms in \(5 - i\).
Description: Multiply \(3i\) by each term inside the parentheses \(5 - i\), resulting in \(3i \cdot 5\) and \(3i \cdot (-i)\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the distribution:
\[
3i(5 - i) = 3i \cdot 5 + 3i \cdot (-i) = 15i - 3i^2
\]
Since \(i^2 = -1\), compute:
\[
-3i^2 = -3(-1) = 3
\]
Thus:
\[
15i - 3i^2 = 15i + 3
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine the results from both distributions.
Description: Add the results from the two distributions: \(15 - 5i\) and \(15i + 3\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Combine the expressions:
\[
(15 - 5i) + (15i + 3) = 15 - 5i + 15i + 3
\]
Group like terms:
- Real parts: \(15 + 3 = 18\)
- Imaginary parts: \(-5i + 15i = 10i\)
Thus:
\[
18 + 10i
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the simplification.
Description: Check the correctness of the final expression \(18 + 10i\) by recomputing the original expression or confirming the steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute directly to validate:
\[
5(3 - i) = 15 - 5i
\]
\[
3i(5 - i) = 15i - 3i^2 = 15i + 3 \quad (\text{since } i^2 = -1)
\]
Add:
\[
(15 - 5i) + (15i + 3) = 15 + 3 - 5i + 15i = 18 + 10i
\]
The result matches \(18 + 10i\), confirming correctness.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Simplify \(5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i)\)
  - Subgoal 1: Distribute \(5\) to \(3 - i\) (Completed: \(15 - 5i\))
  - Subgoal 2: Distribute \(3i\) to \(5 - i\) (Completed: \(15i + 3\))
  - Subgoal 3: Combine results (Completed: \(18 + 10i\))
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify by combining like terms (Completed: \(18 + 10i\))
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the result (Completed: Confirmed \(18 + 10i\))
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The final simplified expression is \(18 + 10i\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(18 + 10i\)
