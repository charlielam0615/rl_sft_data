**Problem Restatement**: Simplify the complex number expression \( 5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of simplifying \( 5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i) \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute \( 5 \) to \( (3 - i) \).  
2. Distribute \( 3i \) to \( (5 - i) \).  
3. Combine the results by adding the real and imaginary parts.  
4. Simplify the final expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Distribute \( 5 \) to \( (3 - i) \).  
Description: Multiply \( 5 \) by each term in \( (3 - i) \), i.e., compute \( 5 \cdot 3 \) and \( 5 \cdot (-i) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\( 5(3 - i) = 5 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot (-i) = 15 - 5i \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Distribute \( 3i \) to \( (5 - i) \).  
Description: Multiply \( 3i \) by each term in \( (5 - i) \), i.e., compute \( 3i \cdot 5 \) and \( 3i \cdot (-i) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\( 3i(5 - i) = 3i \cdot 5 + 3i \cdot (-i) = 15i - 3i^2 \)  
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( -3i^2 = -3(-1) = 3 \).  
Thus, \( 15i - 3i^2 = 15i + 3 = 3 + 15i \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Combine the results by adding the real and imaginary parts.  
Description: Add the results from the previous steps, \( 15 - 5i \) and \( 3 + 15i \), by combining like terms (real parts and imaginary parts).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\( (15 - 5i) + (3 + 15i) = (15 + 3) + (-5i + 15i) = 18 + 10i \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the simplified expression \( 18 + 10i \).  
Description: Recompute the original expression to verify the result by distributing and combining terms again.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\( 5(3 - i) = 15 - 5i \)  
\( 3i(5 - i) = 3i \cdot 5 + 3i \cdot (-i) = 15i - 3i^2 = 15i + 3 = 3 + 15i \)  
Add: \( (15 - 5i) + (3 + 15i) = (15 + 3) + (-5i + 15i) = 18 + 10i \)  
The result matches, confirming \( 18 + 10i \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \( 5(3 - i) + 3i(5 - i) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Distribute \( 5 \) to \( (3 - i) \). (Completed: \( 15 - 5i \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Distribute \( 3i \) to \( (5 - i) \). (Completed: \( 3 + 15i \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine the results by adding real and imaginary parts. (Completed: \( 18 + 10i \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the final expression. (Completed: \( 18 + 10i \))  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, final result achieved).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( 18 + 10i \)
