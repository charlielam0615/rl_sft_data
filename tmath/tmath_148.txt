Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $x=2$ into the function $f(x)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We substitute $x=2$ into $f(x)=2x^4+x^3+x^2-3x+r$ to get:
$$f(2)=2(2)^4+(2)^3+(2)^2-3(2)+r$$
$$f(2)=2(16)+8+4-6+r$$
$$f(2)=32+8+4-6+r$$
$$f(2)=38+r$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $f(2)=0$ for $r$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given $f(2)=0$, so we set the expression $38 + r = 0$ and solve for $r$:
$$38 + r = 0$$
$$r = -38$$

[VERIFY]
To verify the solution, let's re-express the problem and re-calculate:

1. Original function: f(x) = 2x⁴ + x³ + x² - 3x + r
2. Substituting x=2:
   - 2x⁴ = 2*(2⁴) = 2*16 = 32
   - x³ = 8
   - x² = 4
   - -3x = -6
3. Sum of polynomial terms (excluding r): 32 + 8 + 4 - 6 = 38
4. Equation becomes: 38 + r = 0 ⇒ r = -38

Rechecking arithmetic:
- 32 + 8 = 40
- 40 + 4 = 44
- 44 - 6 = 38 (Correct)
Rechecking algebra:
- f(2) = 38 + r = 0 ⇒ r = -38 (Correct)

No discrepancies found in calculations or algebraic manipulation. The solution is consistent and mathematically sound.
