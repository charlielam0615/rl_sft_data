**Problem Restatement**: Find the domain of the equation \( y = \frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4} \), which consists of all real numbers except \( x = A \) and \( x = B \), and compute \( A + B \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( A + B \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 \) equal to zero, as these values are excluded from the domain. The steps are:  
1. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve the resulting quadratic equation.  
2. Identify the roots, which are \( x = A \) and \( x = B \).  
3. Compute \( A + B \).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Simplify the quadratic equation by dividing through by 2, then solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the denominator: \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \).  
Divide through by 2 to simplify:  
\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \]  
The coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), \( c = 2 \). Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm 1}{2} \]  
This gives two solutions:  
\[ x = \frac{3 + 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]  
\[ x = \frac{3 - 1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]  
Thus, the denominator is zero at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \), so \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) are the correct roots of the denominator and ensure no other values make it zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) back into the original denominator to confirm they yield zero, and check if the quadratic has other roots by factoring or re-evaluating the discriminant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 \):  
\[ 2(1)^2 - 6(1) + 4 = 2 - 6 + 4 = 0 \]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ 2(2)^2 - 6(2) + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0 \]  
Both values make the denominator zero, confirming they are correct.  
To ensure no other roots, factor the simplified quadratic \( x^2 - 3x + 2 \):  
\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0 \]  
This confirms roots at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \). The discriminant of the quadratic \( x^2 - 3x + 2 \) is \( b^2 - 4ac = 9 - 8 = 1 \), indicating exactly two real roots, so no other values make the denominator zero.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( A + B \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are the values of \( x \) that make the denominator \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \) to find \( A \) and \( B \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the roots are correct. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( A + B \). (Pending)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( A + B \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( A + B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the roots \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \) identified in Step 2 and add them together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the roots are \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \). Compute:  
\[ A + B = 1 + 2 = 3 \]  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ A + B = 3 \]
