### Problem Statement
We need to find the domain of the equation \( y = \frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4} \), which is the set of all real numbers except for \( x = A \) and \( x = B \), and then compute \( A + B \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the domain and compute \( A + B \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Identify the domain by determining where the denominator \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \).  
2. Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) (i.e., \( A \) and \( B \)).  
3. Compute \( A + B \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Simplify the quadratic equation by dividing through by 2, then solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, solve:  
\[ 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \]  
Divide through by 2:  
\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \]  
Use the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm 1}{2} \]  
This gives:  
\[ x = \frac{3 + 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{3 - 1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]  
Thus, the denominator is zero at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \), so \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) are the correct roots of the denominator and ensure no other values make the denominator zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) back into the denominator to confirm it equals zero, and check if the quadratic has other roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the denominator \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 \):  
\[ 2(1)^2 - 6(1) + 4 = 2 - 6 + 4 = 0 \]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ 2(2)^2 - 6(2) + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0 \]  
Both values make the denominator zero. Since the equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) is a quadratic (degree 2), it has at most two real roots, which are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \). No other values make the denominator zero.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
List all goals and highlight the current goal to provide context for computing \( A + B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( A + B \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are the values excluded from the domain of \( y = \frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the domain by finding where the denominator is zero (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \) (completed, found \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \)).  
  - **Current Subgoal**: Compute \( A + B \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( A + B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \) from the quadratic solution and add them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \), compute:  
\[ A + B = 1 + 2 = 3 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The values excluded from the domain are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \), so \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), and:  
\[ A + B = 3 \]  
Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{3} \).
