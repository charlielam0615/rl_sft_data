### Problem Statement
We need to determine the first day in a bacterial colony where the number of bacteria exceeds 100, given that the colony starts with 3 bacteria and doubles every day (e.g., 6 at the end of day 1, 12 at the end of day 2, etc.).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the first day with more than 100 bacteria into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Model the growth of the bacteria population mathematically.  
2. Set up an inequality to find when the population exceeds 100.  
3. Solve for the smallest day (integer) that satisfies the inequality.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the growth of the bacteria population. Since the colony starts with 3 bacteria and doubles daily, we can use an exponential growth formula: \( N = 3 \cdot 2^d \), where \( N \) is the number of bacteria and \( d \) is the day number.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The number of bacteria at the end of day \( d \) is given by:  
\[ N = 3 \cdot 2^d \]  
For example:  
- End of day 1: \( 3 \cdot 2^1 = 6 \)  
- End of day 2: \( 3 \cdot 2^2 = 12 \)  
- End of day 3: \( 3 \cdot 2^3 = 24 \)  
This confirms the formula matches the problem's pattern.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve an inequality to find the first day \( d \) where the number of bacteria exceeds 100. Using the formula \( N = 3 \cdot 2^d \), we need \( 3 \cdot 2^d > 100 \), and we will solve for the smallest integer \( d \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set up the inequality:  
\[ 3 \cdot 2^d > 100 \]  
Divide both sides by 3:  
\[ 2^d > \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.333 \]  
Take the base-2 logarithm to solve for \( d \):  
\[ d > \log_2(33.333) \]  
Estimate \( \log_2(33.333) \):  
Since \( 2^5 = 32 \) and \( 2^6 = 64 \), and \( 33.333 \) is slightly above 32, we approximate:  
\[ \log_2(33.333) \approx \log_2(32) + \text{small increment} \approx 5 + \log_2\left(\frac{33.333}{32}\right) \approx 5 + \log_2(1.0417) \]  
Using the approximation \( \log_2(1 + x) \approx x / \ln(2) \) for small \( x \):  
\[ \log_2(1.0417) \approx 0.0417 / 0.693 \approx 0.06 \]  
Thus:  
\[ \log_2(33.333) \approx 5.06 \]  
So, \( d > 5.06 \). Since \( d \) is a day (integer), test the smallest integer \( d = 6 \):  
- For \( d = 5 \): \( 3 \cdot 2^5 = 3 \cdot 32 = 96 \leq 100 \)  
- For \( d = 6 \): \( 3 \cdot 2^6 = 3 \cdot 64 = 192 > 100 \)  
Thus, day 6 is the first day where the population exceeds 100.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if day 6 is indeed the first day with more than 100 bacteria and confirming that day 5 does not satisfy the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute for confirmation:  
- Day 5: \( 3 \cdot 2^5 = 96 \), which is \(\leq 100\).  
- Day 6: \( 3 \cdot 2^6 = 192 \), which is \(> 100\).  
Check intermediate days: Since \( d \) is an integer, no days between 5 and 6 exist. The transition from 96 to 192 confirms day 6 as the first day exceeding 100.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the first day where the bacteria population exceeds 100.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the bacteria growth (\( N = 3 \cdot 2^d \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the inequality \( 3 \cdot 2^d > 100 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking days 5 and 6.  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”first day with more than 100 bacteria is day 6.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The first day when the bacterial colony has more than 100 bacteria is **day 6**.
