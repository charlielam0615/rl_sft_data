**Problem Statement**: In a bacterial colony starting with 3 bacteria, the population doubles daily (6 at end of day 1, 12 at end of day 2, etc.). Find the first day when the colony exceeds 100 bacteria at day's end.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the first day when the colony exceeds 100 bacteria, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Model the bacterial growth mathematically.  
2. Determine the day when the population first exceeds 100.  
3. Verify the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Model the bacterial growth mathematically.  
How to Achieve: Since the colony starts with 3 bacteria and doubles daily, express the population at the end of day \( n \) as a function. The initial population is 3, and it doubles each day, suggesting an exponential model.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The population doubles every day, so for day \( n \):  
- Day 0: 3 bacteria (initial).  
- Day 1: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).  
- Day 2: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \), or \( 3 \times 2^2 \).  
- Day 3: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \), or \( 3 \times 2^3 \).  
Thus, the population at the end of day \( n \) is \( 3 \times 2^n \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the day when the population first exceeds 100.  
How to Achieve: Use the model \( 3 \times 2^n \) to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( 3 \times 2^n > 100 \). Solve the inequality algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve \( 3 \times 2^n > 100 \):  
1. Divide both sides by 3: \( 2^n > \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.333 \).  
2. Estimate \( n \): Since \( 2^n \) is exponential, try integer values:  
   - \( 2^5 = 32 \), so \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \leq 100 \).  
   - \( 2^6 = 64 \), so \( 3 \times 64 = 192 > 100 \).  
3. Thus, \( n = 6 \) is a candidate. Check if \( n = 5 \) is sufficient: \( 3 \times 2^5 = 96 \), which is not > 100.  
So, day 6 is the first day where the population exceeds 100.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution.  
How to Achieve: Confirm calculations for days 5 and 6, and check intermediate days if necessary, to ensure day 6 is the first day exceeding 100 bacteria.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Day 5: \( 3 \times 2^5 = 3 \times 32 = 96 \). Since \( 96 \leq 100 \), day 5 does not exceed 100.  
- Day 6: \( 3 \times 2^6 = 3 \times 64 = 192 \). Since \( 192 > 100 \), day 6 does exceed 100.  
- No fractional days exist, as the problem specifies the population at the end of each day.  
The transition occurs between day 5 and day 6, confirming day 6 as the first day.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the first day when the colony exceeds 100 bacteria.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the bacterial growth mathematically (completed: \( 3 \times 2^n \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the day when the population exceeds 100 (completed: day 6)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: confirmed day 6)).  
Current Goal: Completed (all subgoals achieved).  
The solution indicates day 6 is the first day the colony has more than 100 bacteria.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The first day when the colony has more than 100 bacteria at the end of the day is day 6.
