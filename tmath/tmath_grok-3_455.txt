### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\) for the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \\
3y - 6x &= b,
\end{align*}
assuming the system has a solution and \(b \neq 0\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \(\frac{a}{b}\), we need to find a relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) such that the system has a solution. This involves:
1. Expressing one variable in terms of another using the equations.
2. Ensuring the system is consistent (has at least one solution).
3. Deriving the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to manipulate the system of equations to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) or vice versa, ensuring the system has a solution. This can be achieved by simplifying the equations, eliminating variables, or solving the system directly.  

Let’s start by rewriting the second equation for clarity:
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \tag{1} \\
3y - 6x &= b. \tag{2}
\end{align*}
Notice that the second equation can be simplified:
\[ 3y - 6x = b \implies -6x + 3y = b \implies 3(-2x + y) = b \implies -2x + y = \frac{b}{3}. \]
This gives us a modified system:
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \tag{1} \\
-2x + y &= \frac{b}{3}. \tag{3}
\end{align*}
Now, we can add equations (1) and (3) to eliminate variables.

Adding equations (1) and (3):
\[ (2x - y) + (-2x + y) = a + \frac{b}{3}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 0 = a + \frac{b}{3}. \]
Solving for \(a\):
\[ a = -\frac{b}{3}. \]
Now, compute the ratio:
\[ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{-\frac{b}{3}}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}. \]
This suggests \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\), but we need to ensure the system has a solution.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the system has a solution when \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\). This involves substituting \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\) into the system and checking for consistency (i.e., whether solutions for \(x\) and \(y\) exist).  

Substitute \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\) into the first equation:
\[ 2x - y = -\frac{b}{3}. \]
The modified system becomes:
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= -\frac{b}{3}, \tag{4} \\
-2x + y &= \frac{b}{3}. \tag{3}
\end{align*}
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Adding equations (4) and (3):
\[ (2x - y) + (-2x + y) = -\frac{b}{3} + \frac{b}{3} = 0. \]
This is an identity (\(0 = 0\)), indicating the equations are dependent, meaning the system has infinitely many solutions when \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\). To confirm, solve for one variable:
From equation (3):
\[ y = 2x + \frac{b}{3}. \]
Substitute into equation (4):
\[ 2x - \left(2x + \frac{b}{3}\right) = -\frac{b}{3} \implies 2x - 2x - \frac{b}{3} = -\frac{b}{3} \implies -\frac{b}{3} = -\frac{b}{3}. \]
This confirms consistency. The system has solutions (infinitely many, as \(x\) can be any value, and \(y = 2x + \frac{b}{3}\)). Thus, \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\) is valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find \(\frac{a}{b}\) such that the system has a solution, assuming \(b \neq 0\).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Manipulate the system to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) (completed in Step 2).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Verify the system has a solution for the derived \(a\) (completed in Step 3).
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer and ensure all steps align.

The current goal is to finalize the solution. The ratio \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\) was derived, and the system was shown to have solutions when \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to double-check if the system has no solution or a unique solution for other values of \(a\), ensuring \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\) is the only condition for a solution.  

Consider the system again:
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \\
-2x + y &= \frac{b}{3}.
\end{align*}
If \(a \neq -\frac{b}{3}\), add the equations:
\[ 0 = a + \frac{b}{3}. \]
If \(a \neq -\frac{b}{3}\), this becomes:
\[ 0 = a + \frac{b}{3} \neq 0, \]
a contradiction, meaning no solution exists unless \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
This confirms that the system has a solution only when \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\), i.e., \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\). For other values of \(a\), the system is inconsistent (no solution). Since the problem asks for \(\frac{a}{b}\) when the system has a solution, and we’ve shown solutions exist (infinitely many) when \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\), the result is consistent.

### Final Answer
The ratio \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\).  
\[ \boxed{-\dfrac{1}{3}} \]
