### Problem Restatement
We are given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \\
3y - 6x &= b,
\end{align*}
\]
and need to find \(\frac{a}{b}\) assuming the system has a solution and \(b \neq 0\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(\frac{a}{b}\), we need to find a relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) that holds when the system has a solution. Let’s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Express the system in a form that allows us to check for solutions (e.g., solve for \(x\) and \(y\) or analyze consistency).  
2. Derive a condition relating \(a\) and \(b\) based on the existence of a solution.  
3. Compute \(\frac{a}{b}\) from this condition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the system to facilitate solving for \(x\) and \(y\) or checking consistency.  
How to Achieve: Transform the second equation to simplify it, then use elimination or substitution to relate \(a\) and \(b\). Notice that the second equation \(3y - 6x = b\) can be simplified by factoring, and the first equation \(2x - y = a\) can be used to eliminate variables.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the second equation:  
\[
3y - 6x = b \implies 3(y - 2x) = b \implies y - 2x = \frac{b}{3}.
\]  
Now the system is:  
\[
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= a, \\
y - 2x &= \frac{b}{3}.
\end{align*}
\]  
Rewrite the first equation as \(y = 2x - a\). Substitute into the second equation:  
\[
(2x - a) - 2x = \frac{b}{3} \implies -a = \frac{b}{3} \implies a = -\frac{b}{3}.
\]  
This gives a relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\) ensures the system has a solution.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\) back into the system, solve for \(x\) and \(y\), and check if the solution is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\). Use the simplified system:  
\[
\begin{align*}
2x - y &= -\frac{b}{3}, \\
y - 2x &= \frac{b}{3}.
\end{align*}
\]  
From the second equation, \(y = 2x + \frac{b}{3}\). Substitute into the first:  
\[
2x - \left(2x + \frac{b}{3}\right) = -\frac{b}{3} \implies 2x - 2x - \frac{b}{3} = -\frac{b}{3} \implies -\frac{b}{3} = -\frac{b}{3}.
\]  
This is an identity, indicating the system is consistent (has solutions) when \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\). To find a specific solution, assume a value for \(x\). Let \(x = t\), then:  
\[
y = 2t + \frac{b}{3}.
\]  
Check the first equation:  
\[
2t - \left(2t + \frac{b}{3}\right) = -\frac{b}{3} \implies -\frac{b}{3} = -\frac{b}{3}.
\]  
The system holds for any \(x = t\), confirming infinitely many solutions (a line of solutions).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(\frac{a}{b}\) using the relationship \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\).  
How to Achieve: Directly calculate \(\frac{a}{b}\) from the derived condition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\), compute:  
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{-\frac{b}{3}}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]  
Since \(b \neq 0\), this is well-defined.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure we’ve addressed the problem:  
- Main Goal: Find \(\frac{a}{b}\) assuming the system has a solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the system to analyze solutions (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the condition relating \(a\) and \(b\) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the system’s consistency (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(\frac{a}{b}\) (completed in Step 4).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as we’ve computed \(\frac{a}{b}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(\frac{a}{b}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify system → Achieved by rewriting equations.  
  - Subgoal 2: Relate \(a\) and \(b\) → Found \(a = -\frac{b}{3}\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate consistency → Confirmed system has solutions.  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(\frac{a}{b}\) → Result is \(-\frac{1}{3}\).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved with \(\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{1}{3}\).
