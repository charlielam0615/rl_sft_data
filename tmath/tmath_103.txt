The logarithmic expression $\log_8 2$ asks the question: "8 raised to what power gives 2?" This is equivalent to solving the equation $8^x = 2$ for $x$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the change of base formula to simplify the expression.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The change of base formula states that $\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}$, where $c$ is any positive number. A common choice is base 10 or base $e$. For simplicity, we will use base 10. Applying the formula to $\log_8 2$, we get:  
$$
\log_8 2 = \frac{\log_{10} 2}{\log_{10} 8}
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Perform the calculation using the simplified expression.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have:  
$$
\log_8 2 = \frac{\log_{10} 2}{\log_{10} 8}
$$  
Next, we calculate the values of $\log_{10} 2$ and $\log_{10} 8$.  

Using approximate values:  
- $\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.3010$  
- $\log_{10} 8 = \log_{10} (2^3) = 3 \cdot \log_{10} 2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.3010 = 0.9030$  

Substituting these values into the formula:  
$$
\log_8 2 = \frac{0.3010}{0.9030} \approx 0.3333
$$

[VERIFY]
To verify the correctness of the solution for $\log_8 2$:  

1. **Algebraic Method**:  
   By definition, $\log_8 2 = x$ implies $8^x = 2$. Since $8 = 2^3$, substitute into the equation:  
   $$
   (2^3)^x = 2 \implies 2^{3x} = 2^1 \implies 3x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{3}.
   $$  
   This algebraic derivation directly yields $x = \frac{1}{3}$, confirming the answer without relying on approximations.  

2. **Change of Base Formula**:  
   The formula $\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}$ was applied with base $c = 10$. This step is valid for any positive $c \neq 1$, and the choice of base 10 is standard. The simplification $\log_{10} 8 = 3 \cdot \log_{10} 2$ is correct because $8 = 2^3$ and $\log_{10} (2^3) = 3 \log_{10} 2$.  

3. **Numerical Approximation**:  
   Using $\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.3010$, the calculation becomes:  
   $$
   \log_8 2 = \frac{0.3010}{3 \cdot 0.3010} = \frac{0.3010}{0.9030} \approx 0.3333.
   $$  
   This numerical result aligns with the exact value $1/3$, demonstrating consistency between symbolic and numeric methods.  

4. **Cross-Verification**:  
   The algebraic method (exact) and numerical method (approximate) both produce the same result. The approximation error in the decimal representation (0.3333) is negligible and does not affect the conclusion.  

All steps are logically sound, and the final answer is consistent across multiple methods.
