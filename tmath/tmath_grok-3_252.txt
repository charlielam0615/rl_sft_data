### Problem Statement
We need to express the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 5x \) in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \) and determine the value of \( k \). This form is the vertex form of a quadratic, where \( k \) represents the y-coordinate of the vertex.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of expressing \( x^2 - 5x \) in vertex form into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic by completing the square.  
2. Identify the constants \( a \), \( h \), and \( k \) in the resulting expression.  
3. Extract the value of \( k \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite \( x^2 - 5x \) by completing the square to match the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \). This involves manipulating the expression to create a perfect square trinomial and isolating the constant term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To complete the square for \( x^2 - 5x \):  
1. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, so \( a = 1 \).  
2. Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-5\), divide by 2 to get \(-\frac{5}{2}\), and square it: \(\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}\).  
3. Add and subtract \(\frac{25}{4}\) inside the expression:  
   \[
   x^2 - 5x = x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} = \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{4}.
   \]
4. The expression is now in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( a = 1 \), \( h = \frac{5}{2} \), and \( k = -\frac{25}{4} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \) is equivalent to \( x^2 - 5x \) by expanding and comparing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \):  
\[
\left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot \frac{5}{2} + \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4}.
\]
Subtract \(\frac{25}{4}\):  
\[
x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} = x^2 - 5x.
\]
This matches the original expression, confirming the vertex form is correct.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Express \( x^2 - 5x \) in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \) and find \( k \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic by completing the square (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \( a \), \( h \), and \( k \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the rewritten form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Extract the value of \( k \) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Extract the value of \( k \).  
From Step 2, the expression is \( \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \), so \( k = -\frac{25}{4} \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to state the value of \( k \) based on the vertex form derived.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the vertex form \( \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \), we have \( k = -\frac{25}{4} \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( k \) is \(-\frac{25}{4}\).
