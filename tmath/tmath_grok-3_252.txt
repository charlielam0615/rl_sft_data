**Problem Restatement**: We need to express the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 5x \) in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \) and determine the value of \( k \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to convert \( x^2 - 5x \) into the vertex form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \). This involves completing the square to rewrite the expression, then identifying \( k \), the constant term in the vertex form. The subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic by completing the square.  
2. Express the result in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \).  
3. Identify the value of \( k \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite \( x^2 - 5x \) by completing the square to match the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \). This will be achieved by manipulating the expression to create a perfect square trinomial and adjusting the constant term.

Start with the expression \( x^2 - 5x \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, we have \( a = 1 \). To complete the square:  
1. Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-5\), divide by 2 to get \(-5/2\), and square it: \((-5/2)^2 = 25/4\).  
2. Rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting \( 25/4 \):  
   \[
   x^2 - 5x = x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} = \left( x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} \right) - \frac{25}{4}.
   \]  
3. The expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square:  
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} = \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2.
   \]  
4. Thus, the expression becomes:  
   \[
   \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4}.
   \]  
This is now in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( a = 1 \), \( h = 5/2 \), and \( k = -25/4 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the expression \( \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \) is equivalent to \( x^2 - 5x \) and confirm the value of \( k \). This will be achieved by expanding the vertex form and comparing it to the original expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \( \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} \):  
\[
\left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot \frac{5}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 = x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4}.
\]  
Subtract the constant:  
\[
x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} = x^2 - 5x.
\]  
This matches the original expression \( x^2 - 5x \), confirming the correctness of the vertex form. The value of \( k \) is \( -25/4 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Express \( x^2 - 5x \) in the form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \) and find \( k \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic by completing the square (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the result in vertex form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify \( k \) (completed in Step 2, validated in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final value of \( k \).  
The value of \( k = -25/4 \) was determined in Step 2 and validated in Step 3. All subgoals have been addressed.

### Final Answer
The value of \( k \) is \( -\frac{25}{4} \).
