**Problem Restatement**: Bao invests $1,000 in a bank account with 10% annual interest, compounded annually. We need to calculate the total interest earned after 3 years in dollars.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Identify the formula for compound interest to calculate the total amount after 3 years.
2. Calculate the total amount in the account after 3 years.
3. Subtract the initial investment from the total amount to find the total interest earned.
4. Present the final interest amount in dollars.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the formula for compound interest.
How to Achieve: Recall or derive the standard compound interest formula, which accounts for annual compounding over a specified time period.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The compound interest formula is \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after time \( t \),
- \( P \) is the principal (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.
For this problem, since interest is compounded annually:
- \( n = 1 \),
- The formula simplifies to \( A = P (1 + r)^t \).
Given:
- \( P = 1,000 \),
- \( r = 10\% = 0.10 \),
- \( t = 3 \),
- \( n = 1 \).
The formula to use is \( A = 1,000 (1 + 0.10)^3 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total amount in the account after 3 years.
How to Achieve: Use the compound interest formula \( A = 1,000 (1 + 0.10)^3 \) to compute the total amount.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate:
\( A = 1,000 (1 + 0.10)^3 = 1,000 (1.10)^3 \).
First, compute \( (1.10)^3 \):
- \( 1.10 \times 1.10 = 1.21 \),
- \( 1.21 \times 1.10 = 1.331 \).
So, \( (1.10)^3 = 1.331 \).
Now, \( A = 1,000 \times 1.331 = 1,331 \).
The total amount after 3 years is $1,331.

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the total amount calculation.
How to Achieve: Recompute the total amount using the formula and verify the arithmetic steps to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( A = 1,000 (1.10)^3 \):
- \( 1.10 \times 1.10 = 1.21 \),
- \( 1.21 \times 1.10 = 1.21 \times (1.1) = 1.21 \times 1 + 1.21 \times 0.1 = 1.21 + 0.121 = 1.331 \),
- \( 1,000 \times 1.331 = 1,331 \).
The calculation is consistent: $1,331.
To further validate, consider the compound interest pattern:
- Year 1: \( 1,000 \times 1.10 = 1,100 \),
- Year 2: \( 1,100 \times 1.10 = 1,210 \),
- Year 3: \( 1,210 \times 1.10 = 1,331 \).
Both methods yield $1,331, confirming the calculation is correct.

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total interest earned.
How to Achieve: Subtract the initial investment ($1,000) from the total amount ($1,331) to find the interest.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Interest = Total amount - Principal = $1,331 - $1,000 = $331.
The total interest earned is $331.

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total interest earned after 3 years.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the compound interest formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total amount after 3 years (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the initial investment to find the interest (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Present the final interest amount in dollars (pending).
Current Goal: Present the final interest amount in dollars.

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Present the final interest amount in dollars.
How to Achieve: State the calculated interest amount clearly as the final answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total interest Bao will have earned after 3 years is $331.
