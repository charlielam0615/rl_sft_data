**Problem Restatement**: Bao invests $1,000 in a bank account with a 10% annual interest rate, compounded annually. We need to calculate the total interest earned after 3 years in dollars.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for compound interest.  
2. Calculate the total amount in the account after 3 years using the compound interest formula.  
3. Subtract the initial principal from the total amount to find the interest earned.  
4. Present the final answer in dollars.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the formula for compound interest.  
How to Achieve: Recall the standard formula for compound interest, which calculates the total amount in an account given the principal, interest rate, and time period.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The compound interest formula is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  
where:  
- \( A \) is the total amount after time \( t \),  
- \( P \) is the principal (initial investment),  
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),  
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,  
- \( t \) is the time in years.  
Since the problem states the interest is compounded annually, \( n = 1 \). Thus, the formula simplifies to:  
\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

  - Subgoal 3: Subtract the initial principal from the total amount to find the interest earned.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total amount in the account after 3 years.  
How to Achieve: Use the compound interest formula \( A = P (1 + r)^t \) with \( P = 1000 \), \( r = 0.10 \), and \( t = 3 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
- \( P = 1000 \) dollars,  
- \( r = 10\% = 0.10 \),  
- \( t = 3 \) years,  
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually).  
Using the formula \( A = P (1 + r)^t \):  
\[ A = 1000 (1 + 0.10)^3 \]  
\[ A = 1000 (1.10)^3 \]  
Calculate \( (1.10)^3 \):  
\[ 1.10 \times 1.10 = 1.21 \]  
\[ 1.21 \times 1.10 = 1.331 \]  
So:  
\[ A = 1000 \times 1.331 = 1331 \]  
The total amount in the account after 3 years is $1,331.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subtract the initial principal from the total amount to find the interest earned.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the principal ($1,000) from the total amount ($1,331) to calculate the interest earned.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total amount after 3 years: $1,331.  
Initial principal: $1,000.  
Interest earned = Total amount - Principal:  
\[ 1331 - 1000 = 331 \]  
The total interest earned is $331.
