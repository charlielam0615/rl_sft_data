**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\), where \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) denotes the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\)) and \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function (the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\frac{5}{4}\) and evaluate \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil\).  
2. Compute \(-\frac{5}{4}\) and evaluate \(\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\).  
3. Add the results from subgoals 1 and 2 to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil\). Divide 5 by 4 to get the decimal value, then apply the ceiling function to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \(\frac{5}{4}\):  
\(5 \div 4 = 1.25\).  

Apply the ceiling function:  
\(\left\lceil 1.25 \right\rceil = 2\), since 2 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1.25.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\). Compute \(-\frac{5}{4}\) by negating the result of \(\frac{5}{4}\), then apply the floor function to find the largest integer less than or equal to the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \(\frac{5}{4}\):  
\(5 \div 4 = 1.25\).  

Negate the result:  
\(-\frac{5}{4} = -1.25\).  

Apply the floor function:  
\(\left\lfloor -1.25 \right\rfloor = -2\), since -2 is the largest integer less than or equal to -1.25.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\). Use the results from the previous steps (\(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil = 2\) and \(\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor = -2\)) and add them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Add the results:  
\(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor = 2 + (-2) = 0\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by recomputing the expression to ensure correctness. Re-evaluate \(\frac{5}{4}\), \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil\), \(-\frac{5}{4}\), \(\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\), and their sum to confirm the result is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute \(\frac{5}{4}\):  
\(5 \div 4 = 1.25\).  
\(\left\lceil 1.25 \right\rceil = 2\).  

Recompute \(-\frac{5}{4}\):  
\(-\frac{5}{4} = -1.25\).  
\(\left\lfloor -1.25 \right\rfloor = -2\).  

Recompute the sum:  
\(2 + (-2) = 0\).  

The result matches the previous calculation, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil\). (Completed: Result = 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor\). (Completed: Result = -2)  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results. (Completed: Result = 0)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution. (Completed: Result confirmed as 0)  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.  

The solution process is complete, and the final answer is consistent across computations.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor -\frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor = 0\).
