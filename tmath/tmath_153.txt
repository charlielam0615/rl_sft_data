Goal of this step: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the given equation $ 2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The quadratic formula is given by:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
Here, the quadratic equation is $ 2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 $, so the coefficients are:  
- $ a = 2 $  
- $ b = -5 $  
- $ c = -4 $  

Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(-4)}}{2(2)} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 32}}{4}
$$  
Simplify inside the square root:  
$$
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}
$$  
Thus, the roots are in the form $ x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p} $, where $ m = 5 $, $ n = 57 $, and $ p = 4 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the values of $ m $, $ n $, and $ p $ and ensure their greatest common divisor is 1.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we found that the roots are $ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4} $.  
- $ m = 5 $  
- $ n = 57 $  
- $ p = 4 $  

Now, we check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $ m $, $ n $, and $ p $.  
- $ \text{GCD}(5, 57, 4) $  

The factors of 5 are 1 and 5.  
The factors of 57 are 1, 3, 19, and 57.  
The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.  

The only common factor is 1, so the GCD is 1, which satisfies the requirement.  

Thus, the values $ m = 5 $, $ n = 57 $, and $ p = 4 $ are in the required form with GCD 1.

1. Confirm the correctness of the solution by reversing the process to reconstruct the original equation from the derived form $ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4} $.  
2. Verify that the values $ m = 5 $, $ n = 57 $, and $ p = 4 $ lead to the correct quadratic equation.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the derived values $ m = 5 $, $ n = 57 $, and $ p = 4 $ by reconstructing the original quadratic equation and verifying GCD conditions.

1. **Reconstructing the quadratic equation**:  
   The roots are $ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4} $. Let $ r_1 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{57}}{4} $ and $ r_2 = \frac{5 - \sqrt{57}}{4} $.  
   - Sum of roots: $ r_1 + r_2 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{57}}{4} + \frac{5 - \sqrt{57}}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2} $.  
   - Product of roots: $ r_1 \cdot r_2 = \left( \frac{5 + \sqrt{57}}{4} \right)\left( \frac{5 - \sqrt{57}}{4} \right) = \frac{25 - 57}{16} = \frac{-32}{16} = -2 $.  
   The quadratic equation is $ x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + (r_1 \cdot r_2) = 0 $, which simplifies to $ x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 2 = 0 $. Multiplying through by 2 eliminates fractions: $ 2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 $, matching the original equation.  

2. **GCD verification**:  
   - $ \text{GCD}(5, 57, 4) $:  
     - Factors of 5: $ \{1, 5\} $.  
     - Factors of 57: $ \{1, 3, 19, 57\} $.  
     - Factors of 4: $ \{1, 2, 4\} $.  
     The only common factor is 1, confirming $ \text{GCD} = 1 $.  

3. **Form validity**:  
   The expression $ \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4} $ aligns with $ x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p} $, where $ m = 5 $, $ n = 57 $, and $ p = 4 $.  

No inconsistencies or errors are detected in the reasoning, calculations, or conditions.
