### Problem Restatement
We need to find the length of the segment on the number line where the endpoints satisfy the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \). This means identifying the points \( x \) that are exactly 3 units away from \( \sqrt[5]{16} \) on the number line and calculating the distance between these points.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Solve the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) to find the endpoint values of \( x \).  
2. Determine the positions of these endpoints on the number line.  
3. Calculate the length of the segment by finding the distance between the endpoints.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) to find the endpoints. This can be achieved by interpreting the absolute value equation, which gives two possible equations: \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = 3 \) or \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = -3 \). Solve each to find the values of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the absolute value equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \):  
- Case 1: \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = 3 \)  
  \=> \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \)  
- Case 2: \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = -3 \)  
  \=> \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \)  

Thus, the endpoints are \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \). Check if both solutions satisfy \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) by substituting them back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the solutions:  
- For \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \):  
  \( |(\sqrt[5]{16} + 3) - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |3| = 3 \), which satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \):  
  \( |(\sqrt[5]{16} - 3) - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |-3| = 3 \), which satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the length of the segment between the endpoints \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \). Since these are points on the number line, compute the absolute difference between them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the length:  
Length = \( |(\sqrt[5]{16} + 3) - (\sqrt[5]{16} - 3)| = |\sqrt[5]{16} + 3 - \sqrt[5]{16} + 3| = |6| = 6 \).  

The length of the segment is 6 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure all steps are complete:  
- Main goal: Find the length of the segment whose endpoints satisfy \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate the solutions (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the length between endpoints (completed in Step 4).  
**Current goal**: Confirm that all subgoals are addressed, and the solution is complete.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
All subgoals have been addressed: the endpoints are \( \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \), validated to satisfy the equation, and the length between them is 6. The main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The length of the segment on the number line whose endpoints satisfy \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) is 6 units.
