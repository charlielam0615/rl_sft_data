### Problem Restatement
We need to find the length of the segment on the number line defined by the points that satisfy the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \). This equation describes points \( x \) on the number line that are exactly 3 units away from \( \sqrt[5]{16} \). The segment is formed by the two endpoints (solutions to the equation), and we need to compute the distance between them.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) to find the two endpoints.  
2. Compute the length of the segment by finding the distance between these endpoints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) to find the endpoints. This involves interpreting the absolute value equation, which gives two points equidistant from \( \sqrt[5]{16} \), and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) means \( x \) is 3 units away from \( \sqrt[5]{16} \) on the number line. This gives two cases:  
- **Case 1**: \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = 3 \)  
  Solving: \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \).  
- **Case 2**: \( x - \sqrt[5]{16} = -3 \)  
  Solving: \( x = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \).  

Thus, the endpoints are \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \) satisfy the equation \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \). This involves substituting both values back into the equation to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check both solutions:  
- For \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \):  
  \( |x_1 - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |(\sqrt[5]{16} + 3) - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |3| = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \):  
  \( |x_2 - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |(\sqrt[5]{16} - 3) - \sqrt[5]{16}| = |-3| = 3 \). This also satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the length of the segment defined by \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) to find endpoints (completed: endpoints are \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \), \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the length of the segment (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute the length of the segment between \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the length of the segment between the endpoints \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \). This involves finding the absolute difference between the two points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The length of the segment is the distance between the endpoints:  
\[ |x_1 - x_2| = |(\sqrt[5]{16} + 3) - (\sqrt[5]{16} - 3)| = |\sqrt[5]{16} + 3 - \sqrt[5]{16} + 3| = |6| = 6. \]  

Thus, the length of the segment is 6 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the length calculation by confirming the distance between \( x_1 = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 \) and \( x_2 = \sqrt[5]{16} - 3 \). This involves recomputing the distance or using an alternative method to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the distance:  
\[ x_1 - x_2 = (\sqrt[5]{16} + 3) - (\sqrt[5]{16} - 3) = \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 - \sqrt[5]{16} + 3 = 6. \]  
The absolute value is \( |6| = 6 \).  

Alternatively, note that the points are symmetrically placed around \( \sqrt[5]{16} \) at a distance of 3 units each, so the total distance is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \). Both methods confirm the length is 6 units.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The length of the segment on the number line whose endpoints satisfy \( |x - \sqrt[5]{16}| = 3 \) is **6 units**.
