Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Expand the first equation $(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz)=25$ to derive an expression involving $x+y+z$, $xy+xz+yz$, and $xyz$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We expand the left-hand side:  
$$
(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz) = x(xy+xz+yz) + y(xy+xz+yz) + z(xy+xz+yz)
$$  
$$
= x^2y + x^2z + xyz + xy^2 + xyz + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2 + xyz
$$  
$$
= x^2y + x^2z + xy^2 + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2 + 3xyz
$$  
We now rewrite this as:  
$$
(x^2y + x^2z + xy^2 + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2) + 3xyz
$$  
But the second given equation is:  
$$
x^2(y+z) + y^2(x+z) + z^2(x+y) = 7
$$  
Expanding this:  
$$
x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y = 7
$$  
This is the same as the expanded form of the first equation's left-hand side, except that it lacks the $3xyz$ term.  
Thus, we can equate the two:  
$$
(x^2y + x^2z + xy^2 + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2) + 3xyz = 25
$$  
$$
(x^2y + x^2z + xy^2 + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2) = 7
$$  
Subtracting the two equations:  
$$
25 - 7 = 3xyz \Rightarrow 18 = 3xyz
$$  
$$
xyz = 6
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the algebraic manipulations and logical consistency of the solution to ensure no errors were introduced during expansion or substitution.

[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of Expansion Step**:  
   - The expansion of $(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz)$ was performed term-by-term, resulting in $x^2y + x^2z + xy^2 + y^2z + xz^2 + yz^2 + 3xyz$. This matches standard algebraic identities for symmetric polynomials.  

2. **Verification of Second Equation Alignment**:  
   - The second equation $x^2(y+z) + y^2(x+z) + z^2(x+y) = 7$ expands to $x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y = 7$, which indeed corresponds to the non-constant terms of the first expanded equation. The difference between the two equations isolates $3xyz = 25 - 7 = 18$, leading to $xyz = 6$.  

3. **Alternative Verification via Symmetric Identities**:  
   - Using identities for symmetric sums:  
     - Let $S = x + y + z$, $P = xy + xz + yz$, and $Q = xyz$.  
     - The first equation gives $SP = 25$.  
     - The second equation, rewritten using $x^2(S - x) + y^2(S - y) + z^2(S - z) = 7$, simplifies to $SP - 3Q = 7$.  
     - Substituting $SP = 25$ into $SP - 3Q = 7$ yields $25 - 3Q = 7 \Rightarrow Q = 6$.  

4. **Consistency Check**:  
   - Both direct expansion and symmetric identity approaches independently confirm $xyz = 6$, ensuring no algebraic errors or logical inconsistencies.  

**Conclusion**: All steps are logically consistent, and cross-verification via symmetric identities confirms the result.
