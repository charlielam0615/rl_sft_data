**Problem Statement**: A bag contains 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles, making a total of 8 marbles. Two marbles are drawn from the bag without replacement. We need to calculate the probability that the first marble drawn is red and the second marble drawn is white.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the probability problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first.
2. Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red.
3. Multiply these probabilities to find the joint probability.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first. There are 3 red marbles out of 8 total marbles. Use the formula for probability: number of favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability of drawing a red marble first is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles:
\[
P(\text{Red first}) = \frac{\text{Number of red marbles}}{\text{Total marbles}} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first marble was red. After drawing a red marble, 2 red and 5 white marbles remain, making 7 total marbles. Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble from these.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the first marble drawn is red and not replaced, the bag now has 2 red marbles and 5 white marbles, totaling 7 marbles. The probability of drawing a white marble second is:
\[
P(\text{White second} \mid \text{Red first}) = \frac{\text{Number of white marbles}}{\text{Total remaining marbles}} = \frac{5}{7}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the joint probability that the first marble is red and the second is white. Multiply the probability of the first event (red marble) by the conditional probability of the second event (white marble given red first).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability of drawing a red marble first and a white marble second is the product of the two probabilities:
\[
P(\text{Red first and White second}) = P(\text{Red first}) \times P(\text{White second} \mid \text{Red first}) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{3 \times 5}{8 \times 7} = \frac{15}{56}
\]
The fraction \(\frac{15}{56}\) is in its simplest form since 15 and 56 have no common factors other than 1.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the calculated probability. Check the calculations for correctness and ensure the logic accounts for the without-replacement condition.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the calculations:
- First probability: \(\frac{3}{8}\) (3 red out of 8 total marbles).
- Second probability: \(\frac{5}{7}\) (5 white out of 7 remaining marbles after 1 red is removed).
- Joint probability: \(\frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{56}\).
The logic correctly accounts for the without-replacement condition, as the total marbles decrease from 8 to 7 after the first draw. The arithmetic is correct, and the fraction is simplified.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that the first marble is red and the second is white.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first (completed: \(\frac{3}{8}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red (completed: \(\frac{5}{7}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Multiply these probabilities to find the joint probability (completed: \(\frac{15}{56}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations verified).

Current goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.
The final answer is \(\frac{15}{56}\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white is \(\frac{15}{56}\).
