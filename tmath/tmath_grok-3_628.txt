**Problem Statement**: A bag contains 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles, making a total of 8 marbles. Two marbles are drawn from the bag without replacement. We need to find the probability that the first marble drawn is red and the second marble drawn is white.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the probability:  
1. Determine the probability of drawing a red marble first.  
2. Determine the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red.  
3. Multiply these probabilities to find the joint probability.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first.  
**How to Achieve**: The bag has 3 red marbles and 8 total marbles. The probability of drawing a red marble first is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability of drawing a red marble first is:  
\[ P(\text{Red first}) = \frac{\text{Number of red marbles}}{\text{Total marbles}} = \frac{3}{8} \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red.  
**How to Achieve**: After drawing a red marble, 7 marbles remain (2 red, 5 white). The probability of drawing a white marble second is the number of white marbles divided by the remaining total marbles.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red, is:  
\[ P(\text{White second} \mid \text{Red first}) = \frac{\text{Number of white marbles}}{\text{Remaining marbles}} = \frac{5}{7} \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the joint probability of the first marble being red and the second being white.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the probabilities from the previous steps, as the draws are dependent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The joint probability is:  
\[ P(\text{Red first and White second}) = P(\text{Red first}) \times P(\text{White second} \mid \text{Red first}) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{56} \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculations and ensure the logic accounts for the dependent events and the correct number of marbles at each step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- First draw: 3 red out of 8 total marbles, so \( \frac{3}{8} \).  
- Second draw: After removing 1 red marble, 7 marbles remain (2 red, 5 white), so \( \frac{5}{7} \).  
- Joint probability: \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{56} \).  
The calculations are consistent, and the logic accounts for the marbles not being replaced. The fraction \( \frac{15}{56} \) is in simplest form (15 and 56 have no common factors).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that the first marble is red and the second is white.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first (completed: \( \frac{3}{8} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given the first was red (completed: \( \frac{5}{7} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the joint probability (completed: \( \frac{15}{56} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”probability calculated and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the first marble drawn is red and the second marble drawn is white is \( \frac{15}{56} \).
