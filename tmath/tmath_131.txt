Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Rearrange the equation $3x + 5y = 20$ into slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, we solve for $y$.

Start with the given equation:
$$
3x + 5y = 20
$$

Subtract $3x$ from both sides:
$$
5y = -3x + 20
$$

Now divide both sides by 5:
$$
y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4
$$

The equation in slope-intercept form is $y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4$, where $b = 4$ is the y-intercept.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the algebraic manipulation to slope-intercept form and the identification of the y-intercept.

[VERIFY]
1. Start with the original equation: $3x + 5y = 20$.  
2. To isolate $y$, subtract $3x$ from both sides:  
   $5y = -3x + 20$.  
   This step is valid because subtracting $3x$ maintains equality.  
3. Divide both sides by 5:  
   $y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4$.  
   This step is correct because dividing by 5 distributes to both terms on the right-hand side.  
4. The slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $b$ is the y-intercept. Here, $b = 4$.  
5. The y-intercept occurs at $x = 0$, so substituting $x = 0$ into the original equation:  
   $3(0) + 5y = 20$ → $5y = 20$ → $y = 4$.  
   This confirms the y-intercept is indeed $4$.  
6. The ordered pair is $(0, 4)$, which aligns with the calculation.  
All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
