Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Complete the square for the $x$-terms in the equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The $x$-terms are $x^2 - 6x$. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is -6), square it, and add it to the expression. Half of -6 is -3, and $(-3)^2 = 9$. So, add and subtract 9 to complete the square:
$$
x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Complete the square for the $y$-terms in the equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The $y$-terms are $y^2 + 2y$. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of $y$ (which is 2), square it, and add it to the expression. Half of 2 is 1, and $1^2 = 1$. So, add and subtract 1 to complete the square:  
$$
y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y + 1)^2.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Adjust the equation to maintain equality after completing the square for both $x$-terms and $y$-terms.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The original equation is $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$. After completing the square, we have:  
$$
(x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 = 9.
$$  
Simplify the left-hand side:  
$$
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 10 = 9.
$$  
Add 10 to both sides to maintain equality:  
$$
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the center $(h, k)$ of the circle from the standard form of the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The equation is now in the standard form of a circle:  
$$
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19.
$$  
In this form, the center of the circle is at $(h, k) = (3, -1)$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify all steps in the solution process for correctness, including completing the square, algebraic manipulations, and identification of the center.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Completing the square for x-terms**:  
   Original x-terms: x² - 6x.  
   Half of -6 is -3, (-3)² = 9.  
   Result: (x-3)² - 9.  
   ✅ Correct. The identity x² + bx = (x + b/2)² - (b/2)² is applied properly.

2. **Completing the square for y-terms**:  
   Original y-terms: y² + 2y.  
   Half of 2 is 1, 1² = 1.  
   Result: (y+1)² - 1.  
   ✅ Correct. Same identity applied with positive coefficient.

3. **Rewriting the full equation**:  
   Combining terms:  
   (x-3)² - 9 + (y+1)² - 1 = 9  
   Simplify constants: -9 -1 = -10  
   Final equation: (x-3)² + (y+1)² = 19  
   ✅ Correct. Both sides adjusted by +10 to maintain equality.

4. **Identifying the center**:  
   Standard form: (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r²  
   From the equation: h = 3, k = -1  
   ✅ Correct. The center is (3, -1). The sign of k is negative because the term is (y+1) = (y - (-1)).

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.

\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.
