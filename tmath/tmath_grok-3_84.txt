### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression \( x^2 + 8x \).  
- Subgoal 1: Recognize the expression as a quadratic function and identify its key properties (e.g., vertex, which gives the minimum for a parabola opening upward).  
- Subgoal 2: Use a mathematical method (e.g., completing the square or calculus) to find the vertex or critical point.  
- Subgoal 3: Evaluate the expression at the critical point to determine the minimum value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the critical point of the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \) to find its minimum value.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the function is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, the minimum occurs at the vertex. Use the vertex formula for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where the x-coordinate of the vertex is \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)),  
- \( b = 8 \) (coefficient of \( x \)),  
- \( c = 0 \) (constant term).  

The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{8}{2 \cdot 1} = -4. \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \) at the critical point \( x = -4 \) to find the minimum value.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = -4 \) into the expression and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -4 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \):  
\[ f(-4) = (-4)^2 + 8(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16. \]  
The value of the expression at \( x = -4 \) is \(-16\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(-16\) is the minimum value of \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the parabola opens upward (since \( a = 1 > 0 \)) and check the value at other points to ensure \(-16\) is the smallest. Alternatively, use an alternative method (e.g., completing the square) to confirm the vertex.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Check parabola direction**: The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, which is positive, so the parabola opens upward, and the vertex is the minimum.  
- **Alternative method (completing the square)**: Rewrite \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \):  
  \[ f(x) = x^2 + 8x = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16. \]  
  The expression \( (x + 4)^2 \geq 0 \), with equality at \( x = -4 \). Thus, the minimum value is:  
  \[ f(-4) = (0)^2 - 16 = -16. \]  
- **Test other points**:  
  - At \( x = -3 \): \( f(-3) = (-3)^2 + 8(-3) = 9 - 24 = -15 \).  
  - At \( x = -5 \): \( f(-5) = (-5)^2 + 8(-5) = 25 - 40 = -15 \).  
  Both values are greater than \(-16\), confirming the minimum.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize the expression as a quadratic and identify its properties (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the vertex using the vertex formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Evaluate the function at the vertex (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the minimum value (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the minimum value has been found and verified.

### Final Answer
The smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \) is \(-16\), achieved when \( x = -4 \).  
\[ \boxed{-16} \]
