**Problem Statement**: Find the smallest possible real value of the expression \( x^2 + 8x \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Recognize that \( x^2 + 8x \) is a quadratic expression.  
2. Determine the minimum value of a quadratic function, which occurs at its vertex.  
3. Compute the vertex and evaluate the expression at that point.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the vertex of the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \).  
How to Achieve: For a quadratic function \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), the vertex occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 8 \), so calculate \( x = -\frac{8}{2 \cdot 1} \). Then, evaluate \( f(x) \) at this x-value to find the minimum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = x^2 + 8x \), identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 8 \), \( c = 0 \).  
Vertex x-coordinate:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{8}{2 \cdot 1} = -4 \]  
Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -4 \):  
\[ f(-4) = (-4)^2 + 8(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16 \]  
The value of the expression at the vertex is \(-16\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \(-16\) is the smallest possible value of \( x^2 + 8x \).  
How to Achieve: Confirm the vertex calculation and check the behavior of the quadratic function. Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (\( a = 1 \)), the parabola opens upward, so the vertex is the minimum. Alternatively, complete the square to confirm the minimum value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the vertex to ensure correctness:  
\[ x = -\frac{8}{2 \cdot 1} = -4 \]  
\[ f(-4) = (-4)^2 + 8(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16 \]  
Complete the square for \( x^2 + 8x \):  
\[ x^2 + 8x = x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16 \]  
The expression \( (x + 4)^2 - 16 \) is minimized when \( (x + 4)^2 = 0 \), i.e., \( x = -4 \), giving:  
\[ (x + 4)^2 - 16 = 0 - 16 = -16 \]  
Since \( (x + 4)^2 \geq 0 \), the smallest value of \( (x + 4)^2 - 16 \) is \(-16\). This confirms the minimum.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize \( x^2 + 8x \) as a quadratic and find its minimum at the vertex.  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the vertex and evaluate the function.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the minimum value.  
Current Goal: Conclude that the smallest value has been found and summarize the result.  
The calculations in Steps 2 and 3 consistently yield \(-16\) as the minimum value, achieved at \( x = -4 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Summarize and state the final answer.  
How to Achieve: Based on the vertex calculation and validation, conclude that the smallest value of \( x^2 + 8x \) is \(-16\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \) is \(-16\), achieved when \( x = -4 \).

**Final Answer**: The smallest possible real value of \( x^2 + 8x \) is \(-16\).
