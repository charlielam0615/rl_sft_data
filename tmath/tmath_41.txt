Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the x-intercepts by solving $ (x-5)(x^2+5x+6) = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the x-intercepts, we set $ y = 0 $ and solve the equation:  

$$
(x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0
$$  

We will solve this by setting each factor equal to zero.  

1. $ x - 5 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 5 $  
2. $ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $  

Now, let's solve the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $ by factoring.  

$$
x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
$$  

So, $ x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2 $ and $ x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -3 $.  

Thus, the x-intercepts are $ x = 5 $, $ x = -2 $, and $ x = -3 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of solving the equation $ (x-5)(x^2+5x+6) = 0 $ and counting distinct x-intercepts.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of equation solving**:
   - The equation $ (x-5)(x^2+5x+6) = 0 $ was split into two factors: $ x-5=0 $ and $ x^2+5x+6=0 $. This is valid since a product equals zero if and only if at least one factor equals zero.
   - Solving $ x-5=0 $ gives $ x=5 $. This is correct.
   - Factoring $ x^2+5x+6 $ as $ (x+2)(x+3) $ is valid because $ (x+2)(x+3) = x^2 + 5x + 6 $. Solving $ x+2=0 $ and $ x+3=0 $ gives $ x=-2 $ and $ x=-3 $, respectively. This is correct.

2. **Verification of distinctness**:
   - The roots $ x=5 $, $ x=-2 $, and $ x=-3 $ are all distinct. There are no repeated roots in this case.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution process is logically sound, and all mathematical operations are valid. The count of distinct x-intercepts is 3.
