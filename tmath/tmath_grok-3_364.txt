**Problem Statement**: We need to evaluate \( f(5) - f(-5) \) where the function is \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(5) - f(-5) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(5) \) by substituting \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \).  
2. Compute \( f(-5) \) by substituting \( x = -5 \) into \( f(x) \).  
3. Subtract \( f(-5) \) from \( f(5) \) to find the final result.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(5) \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \) and calculate the value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 5 \):  
\[ f(5) = 5^4 + 5^2 + 5 \cdot 5 \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( 5^4 = 625 \)  
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)  
- \( 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \)  
Sum:  
\[ f(5) = 625 + 25 + 25 = 675 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(-5) \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \) and calculate the value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -5 \):  
\[ f(-5) = (-5)^4 + (-5)^2 + 5 \cdot (-5) \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( (-5)^4 = 625 \) (since the exponent is even)  
- \( (-5)^2 = 25 \) (since the exponent is even)  
- \( 5 \cdot (-5) = -25 \)  
Sum:  
\[ f(-5) = 625 + 25 - 25 = 625 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(5) - f(-5) \).  
How to Achieve: Use the values of \( f(5) \) and \( f(-5) \) computed in previous steps and subtract.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From previous steps:  
- \( f(5) = 675 \)  
- \( f(-5) = 625 \)  
Calculate:  
\[ f(5) - f(-5) = 675 - 625 = 50 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of \( f(5) - f(-5) = 50 \).  
How to Achieve: Recalculate \( f(5) \) and \( f(-5) \) to ensure no errors in computation, and confirm the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate \( f(5) \):  
\[ f(5) = 5^4 + 5^2 + 5 \cdot 5 = 625 + 25 + 25 = 675 \]  
Recalculate \( f(-5) \):  
\[ f(-5) = (-5)^4 + (-5)^2 + 5 \cdot (-5) = 625 + 25 - 25 = 625 \]  
Recalculate subtraction:  
\[ f(5) - f(-5) = 675 - 625 = 50 \]  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the result is correct.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( f(5) - f(-5) \) for \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(5) \) [Completed: \( f(5) = 675 \)].  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(-5) \) [Completed: \( f(-5) = 625 \)].  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(5) - f(-5) \) [Completed: \( 675 - 625 = 50 \)].  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result [Completed: Calculations confirmed].  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, solution achieved).
