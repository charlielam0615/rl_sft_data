**Problem Statement**: We need to evaluate \( f(5) - f(-5) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \( f(5) - f(-5) \), break the problem into subgoals:
1. Compute \( f(5) \) by substituting \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) \).
2. Compute \( f(-5) \) by substituting \( x = -5 \) into \( f(x) \).
3. Subtract \( f(-5) \) from \( f(5) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(5) \).
Description: Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \), calculate each term, and sum them.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 5 \):
- \( x^4 = 5^4 = 625 \)
- \( x^2 = 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 5x = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \)
Thus, \( f(5) = 625 + 25 + 25 = 675 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(-5) \).
Description: Substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 5x \), calculate each term, and sum them.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -5 \):
- \( x^4 = (-5)^4 = 625 \) (since the exponent is even)
- \( x^2 = (-5)^2 = 25 \) (since the exponent is even)
- \( 5x = 5 \cdot (-5) = -25 \)
Thus, \( f(-5) = 625 + 25 + (-25) = 625 + 25 - 25 = 625 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(5) - f(-5) \).
Description: Use the values \( f(5) = 675 \) and \( f(-5) = 625 \) to find the difference.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
\( f(5) - f(-5) = 675 - 625 = 50 \).
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( f(5) - f(-5) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(5) \) (completed: \( f(5) = 675 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(-5) \) (completed: \( f(-5) = 625 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract \( f(-5) \) from \( f(5) \) (completed: \( 675 - 625 = 50 \)).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
The final result is \( f(5) - f(-5) = 50 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(5) - f(-5) = 50 \)
