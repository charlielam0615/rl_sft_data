**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( y = p(x) \) defined by \( p(x) = \text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/3} + 2\text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/5} + |2x-2|^{1/7} \), and knowing that \( p(1.5) \) is an integer, we need to compute the value of \( p(1.5) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( p(1.5) \), we need to break down the problem into manageable subgoals. The main goal is to compute \( p(1.5) \) using the given function. Subgoals include:  
1. Understand the function \( p(x) \) and its components.  
2. Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the function.  
3. Simplify the expression to find the integer value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate \( p(x) = \text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/3} + 2\text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/5} + |2x-2|^{1/7} \) at \( x = 1.5 \). To achieve this, we will substitute \( x = 1.5 \), compute each term, and sum them to find the integer result.

[IMP]  
Let’s compute \( p(1.5) \). The function is:  
\[ p(x) = \text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/3} + 2\text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/5} + |2x-2|^{1/7} \]

**Step 1: Compute the argument \( 2x - 2 \)**  
For \( x = 1.5 \):  
\[ 2x - 2 = 2(1.5) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

**Step 2: Evaluate the sign function**  
\[ \text{sgn}(2x-2) = \text{sgn}(1) = 1 \] (since 1 is positive).

**Step 3: Compute each term**  
- First term: \( \text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/3} = 1 \cdot |1|^{1/3} = 1^{1/3} = 1 \)  
- Second term: \( 2\text{sgn}(2x-2)|2x-2|^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot |1|^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \)  
- Third term: \( |2x-2|^{1/7} = |1|^{1/7} = 1^{1/7} = 1 \)

**Step 4: Sum the terms**  
\[ p(1.5) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \]

The value of \( p(1.5) = 4 \), which is an integer.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( p(1.5) = 4 \) is correct by checking the calculations and ensuring the function was interpreted correctly. We will re-evaluate each term and confirm the result aligns with the problem’s condition that \( p(1.5) \) is an integer.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s validate the computation:  
- Recompute \( 2x - 2 \): \( 2(1.5) - 2 = 1 \).  
- Sign function: \( \text{sgn}(1) = 1 \).  
- First term: \( 1 \cdot |1|^{1/3} = 1 \).  
- Second term: \( 2 \cdot 1 \cdot |1|^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \).  
- Third term: \( |1|^{1/7} = 1 \).  
- Sum: \( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \).  

The calculations are consistent. Additionally, the Asymptote code shows the graph of \( p(x) \), and the label \( y = p(x) \) suggests the function is correctly defined. Since \( 4 \) is an integer, this satisfies the problem’s condition.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( p(1.5) \), which is an integer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the function \( p(x) \) (completed in Step 1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) and compute \( p(1.5) \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed in Step 3).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer and ensure all steps align with the problem requirements.  
The computation in Step 2 yielded \( p(1.5) = 4 \), validated in Step 3. All subgoals have been addressed, and the result is consistent with the problem’s requirement that \( p(1.5) \) is an integer.
