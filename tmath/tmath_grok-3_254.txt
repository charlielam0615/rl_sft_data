### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( p(1.5) \), where \( p(x) \) is the function graphed in the provided Asymptote code. The function is defined as:

\[ p(x) = \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/3} + 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/5} + |2x - 2|^{1/7} \]

The value of \( p(1.5) \) is stated to be an integer, and we need to compute it.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( p(1.5) \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the function \( p(x) \).  
2. Simplify the expression by evaluating each term.  
3. Compute the final value and confirm it is an integer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current goal:** Compute \( p(1.5) \) by substituting \( x = 1.5 \) into the function.  
- **How to achieve it:** Evaluate each term of the function \( p(x) \) at \( x = 1.5 \), simplify, and sum the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the function:

\[ p(x) = \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/3} + 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/5} + |2x - 2|^{1/7} \]

First, compute the argument \( 2x - 2 \):

\[ 2 \cdot 1.5 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

Now evaluate each term:

1. **First term:** \( \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/3} \)

\[ \text{sgn}(1) = 1, \quad |1|^{1/3} = 1^{1/3} = 1 \]

\[ \text{sgn}(1) \cdot |1|^{1/3} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \]

2. **Second term:** \( 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(2x - 2) \cdot |2x - 2|^{1/5} \)

\[ \text{sgn}(1) = 1, \quad |1|^{1/5} = 1^{1/5} = 1 \]

\[ 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(1) \cdot |1|^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

3. **Third term:** \( |2x - 2|^{1/7} \)

\[ |1|^{1/7} = 1^{1/7} = 1 \]

Sum the terms:

\[ p(1.5) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \]

The value is \( 4 \), which is an integer.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current goal:** Verify that \( p(1.5) = 4 \) is correct.  
- **How to achieve it:** Recompute \( p(1.5) \) and check the function definition to ensure no errors in substitution or simplification.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( p(1.5) \):

\[ 2x - 2 = 2 \cdot 1.5 - 2 = 1 \]

- First term: \( \text{sgn}(1) \cdot |1|^{1/3} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- Second term: \( 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(1) \cdot |1|^{1/5} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2 \)
- Third term: \( |1|^{1/7} = 1 \)

\[ p(1.5) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \]

The function definition matches the Asymptote code, and the computation is consistent. Since \( 4 \) is an integer, the result satisfies the problemâ€™s condition.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
List all goals and highlight the current one.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main goal: Find the value of \( p(1.5) \), which is an integer.
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into \( p(x) \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression by evaluating each term. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final value and confirm it is an integer. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation. (Completed)

**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved with \( p(1.5) = 4 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( p(1.5) \) is \( 4 \).
