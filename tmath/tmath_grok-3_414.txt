**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \), break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Expand the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Set up the equation by moving all terms to one side.
3. Simplify the resulting equation.
4. Solve the simplified equation for \( x \).
5. Verify the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Expand the left-hand side of the equation \( (8 - x)^2 \).
How to Achieve: Use the binomial formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \) to expand \( (8 - x)^2 \), where \( a = 8 \) and \( b = x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the binomial formula:
\[
(8 - x)^2 = 8^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot x + x^2 = 64 - 16x + x^2
\]
The equation becomes:
\[
64 - 16x + x^2 = x^2
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up the equation by moving all terms to one side.
How to Achieve: Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides to simplify the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting from:
\[
64 - 16x + x^2 = x^2
\]
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
64 - 16x + x^2 - x^2 = x^2 - x^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
64 - 16x = 0
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the simplified equation \( 64 - 16x = 0 \).
How to Achieve: Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[
64 - 16x = 0
\]
Add \( 16x \) to both sides:
\[
64 = 16x
\]
Divide both sides by 16:
\[
x = \frac{64}{16} = 4
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 4 \) satisfies the original equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 4 \) into both sides of the original equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \) and check for equality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 4 \):
- Left-hand side: \( (8 - 4)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
- Right-hand side: \( x^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
Since \( 16 = 16 \), the solution \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Solve \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \) for \( x \).
  - Subgoal 1: Expand the left-hand side (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equation by moving terms (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for \( x \) (completed, \( x = 4 \)).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solution (completed, \( x = 4 \) is valid).
Current Goal: Conclude the solution process, as all subgoals are completed.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve any additional information to ensure no other solutions exist for the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Reviewing previous steps, the equation was simplified to \( 64 - 16x = 0 \), a linear equation, suggesting a single solution (\( x = 4 \)). To confirm, reconsider the original equation:
\[
(8 - x)^2 = x^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides (noting the absolute value):
\[
|8 - x| = |x|
\]
This leads to two cases:
- Case 1: \( 8 - x = x \)
  \[
  8 = 2x \implies x = 4
  \]
- Case 2: \( 8 - x = -x \)
  \[
  8 = 0 \quad (impossible)
  \]
The second case yields no solution. Thus, only \( x = 4 \) was derived and verified.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) for which \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \) is \( x = 4 \).
