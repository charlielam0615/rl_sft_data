### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation:  
1. Expand the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Expand the equation \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the binomial expansion formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \) to expand the left-hand side, where \( a = 8 \) and \( b = x \), and set it equal to the right-hand side.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( (8 - x)^2 \):  
\( (8 - x)^2 = 8^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot x + x^2 = 64 - 16x + x^2 \).  
The equation becomes:  
\( 64 - 16x + x^2 = x^2 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation \( 64 - 16x + x^2 = x^2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides to eliminate the \( x^2 \) terms, then solve the resulting linear equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:  
\( 64 - 16x + x^2 = x^2 \).  
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:  
\( 64 - 16x = 0 \).  
Add 16x to both sides:  
\( 64 = 16x \).  
Divide by 16:  
\( x = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( x = 4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \):  
Left-hand side: \( (8 - 4)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).  
Right-hand side: \( x^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).  
Since \( 16 = 16 \), the solution \( x = 4 \) is valid.  
To ensure completeness, consider if other solutions exist. The equation was reduced to a linear equation (\( 64 - 16x = 0 \)), which suggests a single solution. However, since the original equation involves squares, test for other possible solutions by solving the equation differently:  
Take the square root of both sides of \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \):  
\( |8 - x| = |x| \).  
This gives two cases:  
1. \( 8 - x = x \):  
   \( 8 = 2x \), so \( x = 4 \).  
2. \( 8 - x = -x \):  
   \( 8 = 0 \), which is impossible.  
Thus, \( x = 4 \) is the only real solution.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) for which \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Expand the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( x \) (completed, \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed, \( x = 4 \) is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Completed, as all subgoals have been addressed, and the solution has been verified.  
**Summary**: The value of \( x \) is 4.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) for which \( (8 - x)^2 = x^2 \) is \( x = 4 \).
