**Problem Statement**: Given \( r = 3^s - s \) and \( s = 2^n + 1 \), find the value of \( r \) when \( n = 2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( r \):  
1. Substitute \( n = 2 \) into \( s = 2^n + 1 \) to find \( s \).  
2. Substitute the value of \( s \) into \( r = 3^s - s \) to compute \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( s \) by substituting \( n = 2 \) into \( s = 2^n + 1 \). This involves calculating \( 2^2 + 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( s \):  
\[ s = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( r \) by substituting \( s = 5 \) into \( r = 3^s - s \). This involves calculating \( 3^5 - 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( r \):  
\[ 3^5 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 243 \]  
\[ r = 3^5 - s = 243 - 5 = 238 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( r \) when \( n = 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( s = 2^n + 1 \) for \( n = 2 \). (Completed: \( s = 5 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( r = 3^s - s \) using \( s = 5 \). (Completed: \( r = 238 \))  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution, but since the main goal is achieved, no further subgoals are needed.  
**Final Answer**: The value of \( r \) when \( n = 2 \) is \( 238 \).

**Final Answer**: \( r = 238 \)
