**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( r \) given the expressions \( r = 3^s - s \) and \( s = 2^n + 1 \), when \( n = 2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to compute \( r \).  
1. Compute the value of \( s \) using the expression \( s = 2^n + 1 \) with \( n = 2 \).  
2. Substitute the value of \( s \) into the expression \( r = 3^s - s \).  
3. Calculate the final value of \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( s \) using \( s = 2^n + 1 \) for \( n = 2 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression and performing the calculation.

[IMP]  
Substitute \( n = 2 \) into \( s = 2^n + 1 \):  
\( s = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).  
So, \( s = 5 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( r \) using \( r = 3^s - s \) with \( s = 5 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( s = 5 \) into the expression and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( s = 5 \) into \( r = 3^s - s \):  
\( r = 3^5 - 5 \).  
Calculate \( 3^5 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 243 \).  
Then, \( r = 243 - 5 = 238 \).  
So, \( r = 238 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of \( r = 238 \). This can be achieved by recomputing the steps to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
1. For \( n = 2 \), calculate \( s = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).  
2. Then, \( r = 3^5 - 5 = 243 - 5 = 238 \).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming \( r = 238 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute the value of \( r \) when \( n = 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( s = 2^n + 1 \) for \( n = 2 \). (Completed: \( s = 5 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( r = 3^s - s \) using the value of \( s \). (Completed: \( r = 238 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result. (Completed: \( r = 238 \))  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, and the result is \( r = 238 \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The value of \( r \) when \( n = 2 \) is \( 238 \).
