Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the slope of the line through the points $(0,3)$ and $(-8,0)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The slope $m$ of a line through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is calculated as:
$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
Substituting the given points $(0,3)$ and $(-8,0)$:
$$
m = \frac{0 - 3}{-8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-8} = \frac{3}{8}
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Write the equation of the line using the point-slope form with the calculated slope and a known point.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The point-slope form of a line is:  
$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$  
Using the slope $m = \frac{3}{8}$ and the point $(0,3)$:  
$$
y - 3 = \frac{3}{8}(x - 0)
$$  
Simplify the equation:  
$$
y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the point $(t,5)$ into the line equation $y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3$ to find $t$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $x = t$ and $y = 5$ into the line equation:
$$
5 = \frac{3}{8}t + 3
$$
Solve for $t$:
$$
5 - 3 = \frac{3}{8}t
$$
$$
2 = \frac{3}{8}t
$$
$$
t = \frac{2 \cdot 8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Line equation verification**:
   - Slope calculation: $ m = \frac{0 - 3}{-8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-8} = \frac{3}{8} $ is correct.
   - Using point-slope form with $ (0,3) $: $ y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 $ is valid since it satisfies $ (0,3) $.

2. **Substitution verification**:
   - Plugging $ (t,5) $ into $ y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 $:  
     $ 5 = \frac{3}{8}t + 3 $  
     Subtracting 3: $ 2 = \frac{3}{8}t $  
     Multiplying by $ \frac{8}{3} $: $ t = \frac{16}{3} $.  
     The algebraic steps are logically sound.

3. **Consistency check**:
   - The final value $ t = \frac{16}{3} $ must satisfy the line equation.  
     Substitute back: $ y = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{16}{3} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 $, which matches the given $ y $-coordinate.  
     This confirms the solution is consistent.

4. **Edge case validation**:
   - The line passes through $ (0,3) $ and $ (-8,0) $. The point $ (\frac{16}{3},5) $ lies between $ x = 0 $ and $ x = -8 $? No, $ \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 $, which is to the right of $ x = 0 $. However, lines extend infinitely, so this is acceptable.  
     The calculation does not assume any restriction on $ x $, so the result remains valid.

All steps are mathematically rigorous and logically consistent. No errors detected.
