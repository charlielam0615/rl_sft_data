Let’s restate the problem clearly: We need to rationalize the denominator of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}\) and express the result in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\), where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are integers, \(D\) is positive, and \(B\) is not divisible by the square of any prime (i.e., \(B\) is square-free). Our goal is to find the minimum possible value of \(A + B + C + D\).

I’ll solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and formatting the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the numerator \(\sqrt{32}\).  
2. Rationalize the denominator \(\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}\) by multiplying by its conjugate.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\).  
4. Ensure \(B\) is square-free and \(D\) is positive.  
5. Compute \(A + B + C + D\) and verify it’s minimized.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the numerator \(\sqrt{32}\). This can be achieved by expressing \(\sqrt{32}\) in its simplest radical form using prime factorization.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\):  
\[
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}.
\]  
So, the expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rationalize the denominator \(\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}\). This can be achieved by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \(\sqrt{16} + \sqrt{2}\), to eliminate the square roots in the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \(\sqrt{16} = 4\), the expression is \(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}\). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate \(4 + \sqrt{2}\):  
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{4 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \cdot (4 + \sqrt{2})}{(4 - \sqrt{2})(4 + \sqrt{2})}.
\]  
Denominator:  
\[
(4 - \sqrt{2})(4 + \sqrt{2}) = 4^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 - 2 = 14.
\]  
Numerator:  
\[
4\sqrt{2} \cdot (4 + \sqrt{2}) = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{2} + 4 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 16\sqrt{2} + 4 \cdot 2 = 16\sqrt{2} + 8.
\]  
So, the expression is:  
\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}\) to the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\) and ensure it’s in simplest form. This can be achieved by factoring out common factors and checking if the expression can be simplified further.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}\):  
Factor the numerator:  
\[
16\sqrt{2} + 8 = 8(2\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]  
The denominator is 14. Check for common factors:  
\[
\frac{8(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{14} = \frac{8}{14} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 1) = \frac{4}{7} \cdot (2\sqrt{2} + 1) = \frac{4(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} = \frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}.
\]  
The expression is now:  
\[
\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}.
\]  
Compare to \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\):  
- \(A = 8\),  
- \(\sqrt{B} = \sqrt{2} \implies B = 2\),  
- \(C = 4\),  
- \(D = 7\).  
Check if \(B = 2\) is square-free: 2 is not divisible by the square of any prime (since \(2 = 2^1\)).  
Check if \(D = 7\) is positive: Yes.  
Check if the fraction is in simplest form: The numerator \(8\sqrt{2} + 4\) and denominator 7 have no common factors (7 is prime and does not divide 8 or 4).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) is the correct rationalized form and that no further simplification is possible. This can be achieved by recomputing the rationalization and checking the form’s compliance with the problem’s requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
Start with \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}\).  
Rationalize:  
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{4 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}(4 + \sqrt{2})}{16 - 2} = \frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14} = \frac{8(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{14} = \frac{4(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} = \frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}.
\]  
This matches the previous result.  
Check form:  
- Coefficients: \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\).  
- \(B = 2\) is square-free.  
- \(D = 7 > 0\).  
- GCD of numerator and denominator is 1 (no common factors).  
The expression satisfies all requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}\) and find the minimum \(A + B + C + D\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the numerator (completed: \(\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Rationalize the denominator (completed: multiplied by conjugate).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify to form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\) (completed: \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Ensure \(B\) is square-free and \(D\) is positive (completed: \(B = 2\), \(D = 7\)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \(A + B + C + D\) (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(A + B + C + D\) and ensure it’s minimized.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(A + B + C + D\) for the expression \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) and verify it’s the minimum possible value. This can be achieved by summing the coefficients and checking if an alternative form yields a smaller sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\):  
- \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\).  
Compute:  
\[
A + B + C + D = 8 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 21.
\]  
Check for minimization: Could another form, e.g., multiplying numerator and denominator by a constant, reduce the sum? Suppose we use \(\frac{k(8\sqrt{2} + 4)}{k \cdot 7} = \frac{8k\sqrt{2} + 4k}{7k}\). Then:  
- \(A' = 8k\), \(B' = 2\), \(C' = 4k\), \(D' = 7k\).  
- Sum: \(8k + 2 + 4k + 7k = 19k + 2\).  
Since \(k \geq 1\) (to keep integers), the smallest sum occurs at \(k = 1\), giving \(19 \cdot 1 + 2 = 21\), which matches our result. Larger \(k\) increases the sum.  
Thus, \(A + B + C + D = 21\) appears minimal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the minimum \(A + B + C + D\). Retrieve information from previous steps related to alternative simplifications or forms of the expression that might affect the sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Reviewing previous steps:  
- Step 2 simplified \(\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).  
- Step 3 rationalized to \(\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}\).  
- Step 4 simplified to \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\), noting the GCD of 8 and 14 allowed division by 2.  
- Step 5 validated the form.  
- Step 7 computed the sum as 21 and considered scaling by \(k\), finding \(k = 1\) optimal.  
No alternative forms were derived that maintained integer coefficients with a smaller sum. The simplification in Step 4 was maximal (dividing by 2), and no other common factors exist.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 9: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(A + B + C + D = 21\) is the minimum possible value. This can be achieved by rechecking the expression’s equivalence to the original and testing if alternative rationalizations yield a smaller sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify equivalence: Compute numerically to ensure \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) equals the original:  
Original: \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}\).  
Approximate: \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), so \(4 - \sqrt{2} \approx 4 - 1.414 = 2.586\), \(\sqrt{32} \approx 5.657\), giving \(\frac{5.657}{2.586} \approx 2.188\).  
Result: \(\frac{8 \cdot 1.414 + 4}{7} = \frac{11.312 + 4}{7} = \frac{15.312}{7} \approx 2.188\). Matches.  
Alternative form: Could we express differently, e.g., adjust coefficients? The form \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) is derived from maximal simplification. Test another conjugate, but since \(\sqrt{16} = 4\), the conjugate \(4 + \sqrt{2}\) is standard. Non-integer scaling (e.g., divide by 2) violates integer requirements.  
Sum check: No form with integer \(A, C, D\), square-free \(B\), and smaller sum was found.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The rationalized expression is \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\), with \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\). The minimum possible value of \(A + B + C + D\) is:  
\[
8 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 21.
\]  
**Final Answer**: \(21\)
