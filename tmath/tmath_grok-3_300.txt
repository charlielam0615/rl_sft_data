**Problem Restatement**: We need to rationalize the denominator of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}\) and express the result in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\), where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are integers, \(D\) is positive, and \(B\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Then, we find the minimum possible value of \(A + B + C + D\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the numerator \(\sqrt{32}\).  
2. Rationalize the denominator \(\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}\) by using the conjugate.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to match the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\).  
4. Ensure \(B\) is square-free and find the values of \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).  
5. Compute \(A + B + C + D\) and verify it is minimized.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the numerator \(\sqrt{32}\) and begin rationalizing the denominator \(\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}\). Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\) by expressing it in terms of its prime factors, and compute \(\sqrt{16}\) to prepare for denominator rationalization.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the numerator:  
\[
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}.
\]  
Simplify the denominator term:  
\[
\sqrt{16} = 4.
\]  
The expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}.
\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rationalize the denominator \(4 - \sqrt{2}\). Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \(4 + \sqrt{2}\), to eliminate the square root in the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression is \(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}\). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate \(4 + \sqrt{2}\):  
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{4 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \cdot (4 + \sqrt{2})}{(4 - \sqrt{2})(4 + \sqrt{2})}.
\]  
Denominator:  
\[
(4 - \sqrt{2})(4 + \sqrt{2}) = 4^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 - 2 = 14.
\]  
Numerator:  
\[
4\sqrt{2} \cdot (4 + \sqrt{2}) = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{2} + 4 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 16\sqrt{2} + 4 \cdot 2 = 16\sqrt{2} + 8.
\]  
The expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}\) to the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\), ensuring \(B\) is square-free, and compute \(A + B + C + D\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the fraction:  
\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14} = \frac{16\sqrt{2}}{14} + \frac{8}{14}.
\]  
Simplify each term:  
\[
\frac{16}{14} = \frac{8}{7}, \quad \frac{8}{14} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14} = \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{7} + \frac{4}{7} = \frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}.
\]  
This matches the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\), with:  
- \(A = 8\),  
- \(B = 2\) (square-free, as \(2\) is a prime),  
- \(C = 4\),  
- \(D = 7\).  
Compute:  
\[
A + B + C + D = 8 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 21.
\]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}}\) and find the minimum \(A + B + C + D\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the numerator \(\sqrt{32}\). (Completed: \(\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Rationalize the denominator \(\sqrt{16} - \sqrt{2}\). (Completed: Used conjugate \(4 + \sqrt{2}\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the expression to \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\). (Completed: \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\))  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(A + B + C + D\). (Completed: \(8 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 21\))  
**Current Goal**: Verify if \(A + B + C + D = 21\) is the minimum possible value.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if the expression \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) is in the simplest form and if \(A + B + C + D = 21\) is minimized. Check if further simplification is possible and confirm \(B\) is square-free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression is \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\). Check for further simplification:  
- Numerator: \(8\sqrt{2} + 4\). Factor out common terms:  
\[
8\sqrt{2} + 4 = 4(2\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]  
- Expression becomes:  
\[
\frac{4(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} = \frac{4}{7}(2\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]  
However, this does not match the required form \(\frac{A\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\), as \(\frac{4}{7}\) is not an integer. The form \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\) has integer coefficients: \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\).  
Verify \(B = 2\): It is prime, hence square-free.  
Check alternative forms:  
- If we scale by a constant \(k\), e.g., multiply numerator and denominator by 7 to get \(\frac{56\sqrt{2} + 28}{49}\), then \(A = 56\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 28\), \(D = 49\), and:  
\[
56 + 2 + 28 + 49 = 135,
\]  
which is larger than 21.  
- The fraction is in lowest terms, as \(\gcd(8, 4, 7) = 1\).  
Thus, \(A + B + C + D = 21\) appears minimal.

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the minimality of \(A + B + C + D = 21\). Retrieve information from previous steps to ensure all simplifications were considered and no alternative forms yield a smaller sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From previous steps:  
- Step 2 simplified \(\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\), and the expression became \(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{4 - \sqrt{2}}\).  
- Step 3 rationalized the denominator, yielding \(\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14}\).  
- Step 4 simplified to \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\), with \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\), and sum \(21\).  
- Step 6 verified that \(\gcd(8, 4, 7) = 1\), and scaling (e.g., to \(D = 49\)) increased the sum to 135.  
No alternative simplifications were missed, and \(B = 2\) is square-free. The sum \(21\) is consistent with the simplest integer coefficients.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**

The rationalized expression is \(\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}\), with \(A = 8\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 4\), \(D = 7\). The minimum value of \(A + B + C + D\) is:  
\[
8 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 21.
\]  
Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{21}\).
