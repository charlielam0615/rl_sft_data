**Problem Restatement**: We need to find two numbers whose difference is 3 and whose sum is 31, and then identify the larger of the two numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the two numbers using variables.  
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions (difference and sum).  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the numbers.  
4. Identify the larger number.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the two numbers and set up equations based on the given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Let the larger number be \( x \) and the smaller number be \( y \). Use the conditions "difference of 3" and "sum of 31" to create equations: \( x - y = 3 \) and \( x + y = 31 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define the two numbers:  
- Let \( x \) be the larger number.  
- Let \( y \) be the smaller number.  

Based on the problem:  
- Difference: \( x - y = 3 \)  
- Sum: \( x + y = 31 \)  

These equations represent the conditions provided.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).  
How to Achieve: Add the two equations \( x - y = 3 \) and \( x + y = 31 \) to eliminate \( y \), then solve for \( x \). Substitute \( x \) back into one equation to find \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the system of equations:  
1. \( x - y = 3 \)  
2. \( x + y = 31 \)  

Add the equations to eliminate \( y \):  
\[ (x - y) + (x + y) = 3 + 31 \]  
\[ 2x = 34 \]  
\[ x = 17 \]  

Substitute \( x = 17 \) into the second equation:  
\[ 17 + y = 31 \]  
\[ y = 31 - 17 \]  
\[ y = 14 \]  

So, the two numbers are 17 and 14.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the solution by verifying that the numbers satisfy both conditions.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 17 \) and \( y = 14 \) into the equations \( x - y = 3 \) and \( x + y = 31 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the solution:  
- Difference: \( x - y = 17 - 14 = 3 \), which satisfies \( x - y = 3 \).  
- Sum: \( x + y = 17 + 14 = 31 \), which satisfies \( x + y = 31 \).  

The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the larger of the two numbers.  
How to Achieve: Compare the two numbers (17 and 14) and select the larger one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The two numbers are 17 and 14. Comparing them, 17 is greater than 14.  
Therefore, the larger number is 17.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)
