### Problem Statement
We need to find two numbers whose difference is 3 and whose sum is 31, and then identify the larger of the two numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the two numbers:  
1. Set up equations based on the given conditions (difference and sum).  
2. Solve the equations to find the two numbers.  
3. Identify the larger number.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations based on the given conditions. Define the two numbers as variables, create equations for their sum and difference, and prepare to solve them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the two numbers be \( x \) (larger) and \( y \) (smaller).  
From the problem:  
- Sum: \( x + y = 31 \)  
- Difference: \( x - y = 3 \)  
These equations represent the conditions provided.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the values of the two numbers. Use the equations \( x + y = 31 \) and \( x - y = 3 \) to solve for \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the system of equations:  
1. \( x + y = 31 \)  
2. \( x - y = 3 \)  

Add the equations to eliminate \( y \):  
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 31 + 3 \]  
\[ 2x = 34 \]  
\[ x = 17 \]  

Substitute \( x = 17 \) into the first equation:  
\[ 17 + y = 31 \]  
\[ y = 31 - 17 = 14 \]  

The two numbers are 17 and 14.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the numbers 17 and 14 satisfy both conditions (sum of 31 and difference of 3).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the sum:  
\[ 17 + 14 = 31 \] (satisfies the sum condition).  

Check the difference:  
\[ 17 - 14 = 3 \] (satisfies the difference condition).  

Both conditions are met, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the larger of two numbers with a difference of 3 and a sum of 31.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations based on the given conditions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find the two numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the larger number (current).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the larger number from the solution (17 and 14).  
The larger number is 17.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The larger of the two numbers is 17.
