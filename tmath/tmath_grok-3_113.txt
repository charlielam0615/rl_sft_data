### Problem Restatement
We need to find the only integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 < 2n \). This means the square of the integer must be less than twice the integer itself, and there should be exactly one such integer.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:
1. Formulate the inequality \( n^2 < 2n \).
2. Solve the inequality to find all integers \( n \) that satisfy it.
3. Verify which integers meet the condition.
4. Confirm that only one integer satisfies the inequality.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Formulate and solve the inequality \( n^2 < 2n \).
How to Achieve: Rewrite the inequality as \( n^2 - 2n < 0 \), factorize it, and determine the integer solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the inequality:
\[ n^2 < 2n \]
\[ n^2 - 2n < 0 \]
Factorize:
\[ n(n - 2) < 0 \]
The product \( n(n - 2) < 0 \) is negative when \( n \) and \( n - 2 \) have opposite signs. Solve the inequality by finding the roots and testing intervals:
- Roots: \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 2 \).
- Test intervals: \( n < 0 \), \( 0 < n < 2 \), \( n > 2 \).
- For \( n < 0 \), e.g., \( n = -1 \): \( (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0 \).
- For \( 0 < n < 2 \), e.g., \( n = 1 \): \( 1(1 - 2) = 1(-1) = -1 < 0 \).
- For \( n > 2 \), e.g., \( n = 3 \): \( 3(3 - 2) = 3(1) = 3 > 0 \).
Thus, the solution is \( 0 < n < 2 \). Since \( n \) is an integer, the only candidate is \( n = 1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( n = 1 \) satisfies \( n^2 < 2n \) and check other integers to ensure itâ€™s the only solution.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 1 \) into the inequality and test other integers (e.g., \( n = 0, 2, -1 \)) to confirm no others satisfy it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 1^2 = 1 \), \( 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \), \( 1 < 2 \). Satisfied.
- For \( n = 0 \): \( 0^2 = 0 \), \( 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \), \( 0 \not< 0 \). Not satisfied.
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \), \( 4 \not< 4 \). Not satisfied.
- For \( n = -1 \): \( (-1)^2 = 1 \), \( 2 \cdot (-1) = -2 \), \( 1 \not< -2 \). Not satisfied.
Testing additional integers (e.g., \( n = 3 \): \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), \( 9 \not< 6 \)) confirms no other solutions.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the only integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 < 2n \).
  - Subgoal 1: Formulate the inequality (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the inequality (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify integer solutions (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm only one solution (in progress).
Current Goal: Confirm that \( n = 1 \) is the only solution, as verified in the previous step.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Summarize findings related to the inequality \( n^2 < 2n \) and the integer solutions tested.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- The inequality \( n^2 < 2n \) was rewritten as \( n(n - 2) < 0 \), yielding \( 0 < n < 2 \).
- Integer solutions: Only \( n = 1 \) lies in \( 0 < n < 2 \).
- Verification: \( n = 1 \) satisfies \( 1 < 2 \); other integers (\( n = 0, 2, -1, 3 \)) do not satisfy the inequality.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The only integer whose square is less than its double is \( 1 \).
