**Problem Statement**: Find the only integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 < 2n \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Translate the condition \( n^2 < 2n \) into a mathematical form that can be solved.  
2. Solve the resulting inequality to identify possible integers.  
3. Verify which integer satisfies the condition and confirm it is the only one.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Translate the condition \( n^2 < 2n \) into a solvable form.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the inequality \( n^2 < 2n \) by moving all terms to one side to form a quadratic inequality, then solve for \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the inequality:  
\[ n^2 < 2n \]  
Rewrite it:  
\[ n^2 - 2n < 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ n(n - 2) < 0 \]  
To find the solution, determine where the product \( n(n - 2) \) is negative. The roots of \( n(n - 2) = 0 \) are \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 2 \). These roots divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \). Test each interval:  
- For \( n < 0 \), e.g., \( n = -1 \): \( (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0 \).  
- For \( 0 < n < 2 \), e.g., \( n = 1 \): \( 1(1 - 2) = 1(-1) = -1 < 0 \).  
- For \( n > 2 \), e.g., \( n = 3 \): \( 3(3 - 2) = 3(1) = 3 > 0 \).  
The inequality holds in \( (0, 2) \). Since \( n \) is an integer, test integers in this interval: \( n = 1 \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify if \( n = 1 \) satisfies \( n^2 < 2n \) and check if other integers also satisfy it.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 1 \) into the inequality, then test integers outside and on the boundaries of \( (0, 2) \) to confirm \( n = 1 \) is the only solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test \( n = 1 \):  
\[ 1^2 = 1 \], \( 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \], and \( 1 < 2 \). The condition holds.  
Test boundary points and other integers:  
- \( n = 0 \): \( 0^2 = 0 \), \( 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \), \( 0 \not< 0 \). Fails.  
- \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \), \( 4 \not< 4 \). Fails.  
- \( n = -1 \): \( (-1)^2 = 1 \), \( 2 \cdot (-1) = -2 \), \( 1 \not< -2 \). Fails.  
- \( n = 3 \): \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), \( 9 \not< 6 \). Fails.  
Since \( (0, 2) \) includes only the integer \( n = 1 \), and tests outside this interval fail, \( n = 1 \) is the only integer solution.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the only integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 < 2n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the condition into a solvable inequality (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the inequality to identify possible integers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution and confirm uniqueness (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the problem has been solved.

**Final Answer**: The only integer whose square is less than its double is \( 1 \).
