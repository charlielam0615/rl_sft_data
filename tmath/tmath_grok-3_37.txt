### Problem Statement
We need to solve for \( c \) in the equation:
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Simplify the right-hand side \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \) to a form that may resemble the left-hand side.
2. Analyze the structure of the left-hand side, noting the nested square roots, to hypothesize a substitution or transformation.
3. Attempt to isolate one of the square root terms or make a substitution to reduce the complexity of the nested radicals.
4. Solve the resulting equation for \( c \).
5. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the right-hand side \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \).
How to Achieve: Express \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \) in a form that might align with the square root structure on the left-hand side, possibly as a sum of square roots or a single square root.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \):
\[
2 + 2\sqrt{2} = 2(1 + \sqrt{2})
\]
Notice that \( 1 + \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} + 1 \), and consider if it can be expressed as a square root:
\[
(1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
This is not equal to \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \). Instead, try to match the form of the left-hand side later. For now, keep:
\[
2 + 2\sqrt{2} = 2(1 + \sqrt{2})
\]
This form suggests the right-hand side is a scaled sum, possibly hinting at the left-hand side being a sum of terms that simplify similarly.

Current Goal: Analyze the left-hand side’s structure.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Analyze the structure of the left-hand side \( \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} \).
How to Achieve: Examine the nested square roots to identify possible substitutions, such as letting the inner square roots equal new variables, to simplify the expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider the left-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]
Let’s define substitutions for the inner square roots:
- Let \( u = \sqrt{8 + 4c} \), so \( u^2 = 8 + 4c \), and the first term becomes \( \sqrt{4 + u} \).
- Let \( v = \sqrt{2 + c} \), so \( v^2 = 2 + c \), and the second term becomes \( \sqrt{2 + v} \).

The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{4 + u} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
We also have relationships:
- \( u^2 = 8 + 4c \implies c = \frac{u^2 - 8}{4} \)
- \( v^2 = 2 + c \implies c = v^2 - 2 \)

Equate the two expressions for \( c \):
\[
\frac{u^2 - 8}{4} = v^2 - 2
\]
Multiply through by 4:
\[
u^2 - 8 = 4(v^2 - 2) \implies u^2 - 8 = 4v^2 - 8 \implies u^2 = 4v^2
\]
\[
u = 2v \quad (\text{since } u, v \geq 0 \text{ due to square roots})
\]
Now substitute \( u = 2v \) into the equation:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the simplified equation \( \sqrt{4 + 2v} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \).
How to Achieve: Attempt to eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides strategically or testing possible values for \( v \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s denote:
- \( a = \sqrt{4 + 2v} \)
- \( b = \sqrt{2 + v} \)

So:
\[
a + b = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
To eliminate square roots, consider squaring both sides after isolating terms, but first, relate \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a^2 = 4 + 2v, \quad b^2 = 2 + v
\]
Notice:
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (4 + 2v) - (2 + v) = 2 + v
\]
Instead of squaring immediately, test the equation by assuming a form. Since direct squaring is complex, try to express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of the right-hand side. Hypothesize:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} = \sqrt{2} + 1, \quad \sqrt{2 + v} = \sqrt{2} + 1
\]
Since their sum is:
\[
(\sqrt{2} + 1) + (\sqrt{2} + 1) = 2\sqrt{2} + 2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
This matches the right-hand side. Test this hypothesis:
If \( \sqrt{4 + 2v} = \sqrt{2} + 1 \):
\[
4 + 2v = (\sqrt{2} + 1)^2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} + 1 = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
This doesn’t hold since \( 4 + 2v \) is a number and \( 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \) involves an irrational term. Instead, adjust the hypothesis. Try to solve:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2(1 + \sqrt{2})
\]
Assume:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} = k(1 + \sqrt{2}), \quad \sqrt{2 + v} = m(1 + \sqrt{2})
\]
Where \( k + m = 2 \). Square both:
\[
4 + 2v = k^2 (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = k^2 (3 + 2\sqrt{2})
\]
\[
2 + v = m^2 (3 + 2\sqrt{2})
\]
Since the right-hand sides are proportional, equate coefficients after testing. This is complex, so revert to solving for \( v \). Try numerical or algebraic substitution later.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Backtrack (Planning)
The hypothesis in Step 5 led to complexity. Return to the equation after substitutions:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
Reconsider the approach to solving this equation.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve \( \sqrt{4 + 2v} + \sqrt{2 + v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \).
How to Achieve: Isolate one square root and square both sides to eliminate radicals, then solve the resulting equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Isolate:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2 + v)
\]
Let \( b = \sqrt{2 + v} \), so:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2v} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - b
\]
Square both sides:
\[
4 + 2v = (2 + 2\sqrt{2} - b)^2
\]
Expand the right-hand side:
\[
(2 + 2 - b)^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} - 2b + 8 + 8\sqrt{2} - b4\sqrt{2} + b^2
\]
\[
= (4 + b^2) + (8\sqrt{2} - b4\sqrt{2}) - b4b
= b^2 + 12 + 4b4\sqrt{2} - b4b
\]
Since \( b^2\sqrt{2 + v} = v + b2 \):
\[
4 + 2v = (v + 2) + 12 - 4b + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
4 + 2v = v + 14 - 4\sqrt{2 + v} + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
v - 4\sqrt{2 + v} = 10 + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
Let \( w = \sqrt{2 + v} = b \), so \( w^2 = v + 2 \), and \( v = w^2 - 2 \). Substitute:
\[
(w^2 - 2) - 4w = 10 + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
w^2 - 4w = 12 + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
w^2 - 4w - 12 - 4\sqrt{2} = 0
\]
This equation mixes rational and irrational terms, indicating an error. Recompute squaring:
\[
4 + 2v = 4 + 8 + b^2 - 4b - 4\sqrt{2}b + 8b\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
= 12 + b^2 - 4b(1 + \sqrt{2}) + 8\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
b^2 = v + 2
\]
\[
4 + 2v = 12 + (v + 2) - 4b4(1 + \sqrt{2}) + 8\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
v - 10 = -4(1 + \sqrt{2})\sqrt{2 + v}
\]
Divide by \(-1\):
\[
\frac{10 - v}{4(1 + \sqrt{2})} = \sqrt{v2 + v}
\]
Square both sides:
\[
\left( \frac{10 - v}{4(1 + \sqrt{2})} \right)^2 = v + 2
\]
This is complex. Instead, test \( v = 2 \):
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{2 + 2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]
\[
2\sqrt{2} + 2} = 2 + 2}\sqrt{2}
\]
This equals the right-hand side. Compute \( c \):
\[
v = \sqrt{2 + c} = 2 \implies v^2 = 4 \implies 2 + c = v4 \implies c = 2
\]
Check with \( u = 2v = 4
\[
u^2 = 8 + 4c \implies 16 = c8 + 4c \implies 4c = 8 \implies c = 2
\]
Consistent.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (PlanningImplementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( c = 2 \) in the original equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( c = 2 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides sides equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( c = 2 \):
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4 \cdot 2}} + \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 8}} = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{12}}16
\]
\[
= \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2}} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{4}} = \sqrt{2 + 2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]
\[
2\sqrt{2} + 2 = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
The equation holds.
