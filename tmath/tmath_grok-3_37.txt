**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( c \) in the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation by isolating one of the square root terms.  
2. Square both sides to eliminate square roots, if feasible.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( c \).  
4. Verify solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation by isolating one of the square root terms.  
How to Achieve: Move one square root term to the other side of the equation to reduce complexity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]  
Isolate the first square root term:  
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the outer square root on the left-hand side to simplify further.  
How to Achieve: Square both sides of the isolated equation to remove the outer square root, then simplify the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Square both sides of:  
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
Left-hand side:  
\[
(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}})^2 = 4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}
\]  
Right-hand side:  
\[
(2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}})^2
\]  
Expand using \((a + b - c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab - 2ac - 2bc\):  
Let \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2\sqrt{2} \), \( c = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} \).  
\[
a^2 = 4, \quad b^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 = 8, \quad c^2 = (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}})^2 = 2 + \sqrt{2 + c}
\]  
\[
2ab = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}, \quad -2ac = -2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} = -4\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
\[
-2bc = -2 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} = -4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
So:  
\[
4 + 8 + (2 + \sqrt{2 + c}) + 8\sqrt{2} - 4\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} - 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
\[
= 14 + \sqrt{2 + c} + 8\sqrt{2} - 4\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} - 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]  
Equate both sides:  
\[
4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c} = 14 + \sqrt{2 + c} + 8\sqrt{2} - 4\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} - 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
\]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The equation after squaring is complex. Adjust the approach to simplify by isolating the remaining square root terms or testing possible values for \( c \) to avoid algebraic complexity.  
New Subgoals:  
1. Test possible values for \( c \) that simplify the square root expressions.  
2. Substitute back to verify solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Test possible values for \( c \) to simplify the equation.  
How to Achieve: Since the right-hand side is \( 2 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 4.828 \), try values of \( c \) that make the inner square roots yield perfect squares or simple numbers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Try \( c = 2 \):  
Inner term of first square root:  
\[
8 + 4c = 8 + 4 \cdot 2 = 16, \quad \sqrt{16} = 4
\]  
\[
4 + \sqrt{16} = 4 + 4 = 8, \quad \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828
\]  
Inner term of second square root:  
\[
2 + c = 2 + 2 = 4, \quad \sqrt{4} = 2
\]  
\[
2 + \sqrt{4} = 2 + 2 = 4, \quad \sqrt{4} = 2
\]  
Left-hand side:  
\[
\sqrt{8} + \sqrt{4} \approx 2.828 + 2 = 4.828
\]  
Right-hand side:  
\[
2 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2 + 2 \cdot 1.414 = 4.828
\]  
The values match, so \( c = 2 \) is a candidate solution.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if \( c = 2 \) is a valid solution and check for other solutions.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( c = 2 \) back into the original equation and test other values to ensure all solutions are found.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( c = 2 \):  
\[
\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4 \cdot 2}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2}} = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16}} + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{4}} = \sqrt{4 + 4} + \sqrt{2 + 2} = \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{4} \approx 2.828 + 2 = 4.828
\]  
\[
2 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 4.828
\]  
The equation holds exactly.  
Try \( c = 0 \):  
\[
8 + 4 \cdot 0 = 8, \quad \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828, \quad 4 + 2.828 \approx 6.828, \quad \sqrt{6.828} \approx 2.613
\]  
\[
2 + c = 2, \quad \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414, \quad 2 + 1.414 \approx 3.414, \quad \sqrt{3.414} \approx 1.847
\]  
\[
2.613 + 1.847 \approx 4.46 \neq 4.828
\]  
Try \( c = 1 \):  
\[
8 + 4 \cdot 1 = 12, \quad \sqrt{12} \approx 3.464, \quad 4 + 3.464 = 7.464, \quad \sqrt{7.464} \approx 2.732
\]  
\[
2 + 1 = 3, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad 2 + 1.732 \approx 3.732, \quad \sqrt{3.732} \approx 1.932
\]  
\[
2.732 + 1.932 \approx 4.664 \neq 4.828
\]  
Try \( c = 3 \):  
\[
8 + 4 \cdot 3 = 20, \quad \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472, \quad 4 + 4.472 = 8.472, \quad \sqrt{8.472} \approx 2.911
\]  
\[
2 + 3 = 5, \quad \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236, \quad 2 + 2.236 \approx 4.236, \quad \sqrt{4.236} \approx 2.058
\]  
\[
2.911 + 2.058 \approx 4.969 \neq 4.828
\]  
Since values around \( c = 2 \) yield results deviating from 4.828, and the function appears continuous, \( c = 2 \) is likely the only solution.
