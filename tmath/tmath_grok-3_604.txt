**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a string of 2002 digits where the first digit is 1, and every two-digit number formed by consecutive digits (i.e., digits at positions \(i\) and \(i+1\) for \(i = 1, 2, ..., 2001\)) is divisible by either 19 or 31. The goal is to determine the largest possible value of the last digit (the 2002nd digit) of such a string.

To solve this, we will use the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Understand the constraints: The string has 2002 digits, starts with 1, and every two-digit number formed by consecutive digits (positions \(i, i+1\)) must be divisible by 19 or 31.  
2. Model the problem: Represent the string as a sequence of digits \(d_1, d_2, ..., d_{2002}\) where \(d_1 = 1\), and each two-digit number \(10d_i + d_{i+1}\) is divisible by 19 or 31 for \(i = 1, 2, ..., 2001\).  
3. Explore possible constructions: Determine how to construct the sequence by analyzing transitions between digits based on the divisibility condition.  
4. Maximize the last digit: Find the largest possible value of \(d_{2002}\) that can be achieved while satisfying all constraints.  
5. Verify feasibility: Ensure the sequence can be constructed for 2002 digits and check if the solution is optimal.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Model the problem as a sequence of digits where each pair satisfies the divisibility condition.  
- **How to Achieve**: Represent the string as \(d_1, d_2, ..., d_{2002}\) with \(d_1 = 1\). For each \(i\), the number \(10d_i + d_{i+1}\) must be divisible by 19 or 31. This suggests a transition rule where for a given digit \(d_i\), the next digit \(d_{i+1}\) must satisfy \(10d_i + d_{i+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{19}\) or \(10d_i + d_{i+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{31}\). We can model this as a directed graph where nodes are digits (0-9), and edges represent valid transitions based on the divisibility condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To model the problem, consider the string as a sequence \(d_1, d_2, ..., d_{2002}\) where \(d_1 = 1\). For each position \(i\), the two-digit number formed by digits \(d_i\) and \(d_{i+1}\) is \(10d_i + d_{i+1}\), which must be divisible by 19 or 31. Since 19 and 31 are primes and their least common multiple is \(19 \times 31 = 589\), the number \(10d_i + d_{i+1}\) must satisfy:

\[ 10d_i + d_{i+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{19} \quad \text{or} \quad 10d_i + d_{i+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{31} \]

For a digit \(d_i \in \{0, 1, ..., 9\}\), we need to find all possible \(d_{i+1} \in \{0, 1, ..., 9\}\) such that the above condition holds. This can be represented as a directed graph where:
- Nodes are the digits \(\{0, 1, ..., 9\}\).
- There is an edge from digit \(a\) to digit \(b\) if \(10a + b\) is divisible by 19 or 31.

Let’s compute the possible two-digit numbers divisible by 19 or 31:
- **Divisible by 19**: The smallest two-digit number divisible by 19 is 19, and the largest is 95 (since \(19 \times 5 = 95\)). The numbers are:
  - \(19 \times 1 = 19\) (digits 1, 9)
  - \(19 \times 2 = 38\) (digits 3, 8)
  - \(19 \times 3 = 57\) (digits 5, 7)
  - \(19 \times 4 = 76\) (digits 7, 6)
  - \(19 \times 5 = 95\) (digits 9, 5)
- **Divisible by 31**: The smallest two-digit number divisible by 31 is 31, and the largest is 93 (since \(31 \times 3 = 93\)). The numbers are:
  - \(31 \times 1 = 31\) (digits 3, 1)
  - \(31 \times 2 = 62\) (digits 6, 2)
  - \(31 \times 3 = 93\) (digits 9, 3)

Thus, the valid two-digit numbers are \(\{19, 31, 38, 57, 62, 76, 93, 95\}\), corresponding to the digit pairs:
- \((1, 9)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 8)\), \((5, 7)\), \((6, 2)\), \((7, 6)\), \((9, 3)\), \((9, 5)\).

The graph has edges:
- From 1 to 9
- From 3 to 1, 8
- From 5 to 7
- From 6 to 2
- From 7 to 6
- From 9 to 3, 5

Since \(d_1 = 1\), we start at node 1 in the graph. The goal is to find a path of length 2002 (from \(d_1\) to \(d_{2002}\)) and maximize \(d_{2002}\).

**Current Goal**: Explore possible constructions using the graph to find a sequence of 2002 digits.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Construct the sequence using the transition graph and analyze possible paths to reach the 2002nd digit.  
- **How to Achieve**: Starting from \(d_1 = 1\), traverse the graph to determine reachable digits after 2001 transitions (to get \(d_{2002}\)). Analyze the graph’s structure to identify cycles or patterns that allow a sequence of 2002 digits, and focus on paths that could lead to the highest possible digit at position 2002.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the graph defined in Step 2:
- **Nodes**: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\) (note: 0, 2, 4, 8 have no outgoing edges based on the valid pairs, as they do not appear as first digits in \(\{19, 31, 38, 57, 62, 76, 93, 95\}\)).
- **Edges**:
  - \(1 \to 9\)
  - \(3 \to 1, 8\)
  - \(5 \to 7\)
  - \(6 \to 2\)
  - \(7 \to 6\)
  - \(9 \to 3, 5\)

Starting at \(d_1 = 1\), let’s explore possible paths:
- From 1, go to 9 (\(d_2 = 9\)).
- From 9, go to 3 or 5 (\(d_3 = 3\) or \(d_3 = 5\)).
- If \(d_3 = 3\), go to 1 or 8 (\(d_4 = 1\) or \(d_4 = 8\)).
- If \(d_3 = 5\), go to 7 (\(d_4 = 7\)).
- Continue tracing paths.

Notice the graph’s structure:
- **Cycle analysis**:
  - Path \(5 \to 7 \to 6 \to 2\): From 5, go to 7, then 6, then 2 (2 has no outgoing edges, so this path ends).
  - Path \(9 \to 3 \to 1 \to 9\): Forms a cycle \(9 \to 3 \to 1 \to 9\) (length 3).
  - From 3, can also go to 8, which has no outgoing edges.
- **Reachable digits**: Starting from 1, we can reach:
  - \(1 \to 9 \to 3 \to 1\) (cycle), or \(3 \to 8\) (ends), or \(9 \to 5 \to 7 \to 6 \to 2\) (ends).

To find \(d_{2002}\), we need the digit reachable after 2001 transitions. The cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3 \to 1\) has length 3. Starting from \(d_1 = 1\):
- After 1 transition: \(d_2 = 9\).
- After 2 transitions: \(d_3 = 3\).
- After 3 transitions: \(d_4 = 1\).
- The sequence repeats every 3 digits: \(1, 9, 3\).

For position 2002:
- Number of transitions = \(2002 - 1 = 2001\).
- \(2001 \div 3 = 667\) (exact division), so after 2001 transitions, we are at the end of the 667th cycle.
- The cycle is \(1 \to 9 \to 3\), so:
  - Position 1: 1
  - Position 2: 9
  - Position 3: 3
  - Position 4: 1, and so on.
- After 2000 digits (666 cycles), \(d_{2001} = 3\) (since \(666 \times 3 = 1998\), and positions 1999, 2000, 2001 are 1, 9, 3).
- From \(d_{2001} = 3\), the next digit \(d_{2002}\) can be 1 or 8 (since \(3 \to 1, 8\)).

Thus, possible values for \(d_{2002}\) in this path are 1 or 8.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the current path (following the cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3\)) yields \(d_{2002} = 1\) or \(8\), we need to explore other paths to maximize \(d_{2002}\). Adjust the subgoal to:
- Explore alternative paths from node 9 (e.g., \(9 \to 5\)) to check if they lead to a higher digit at position 2002.
- Re-evaluate the graph to ensure all possible last digits are considered.
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Explore the path starting with \(1 \to 9 \to 5\) to determine if it leads to a higher last digit.  
- **How to Achieve**: Trace the path from \(d_3 = 5\) in the graph and check the reachable digits after 2001 transitions. Compare the resulting \(d_{2002}\) with previous results (1 or 8).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting again from \(d_1 = 1\):
- \(d_2 = 9\) (1 \(\to\) 9).
- \(d_3 = 5\) (9 \(\to\) 5, choosing the alternative to 3).
- \(d_4 = 7\) (5 \(\to\) 7).
- \(d_5 = 6\) (7 \(\to\) 6).
- \(d_6 = 2\) (6 \(\to\) 2).
- \(d_6 = 2\) has no outgoing edges, so the sequence cannot continue beyond 6 digits.

This path terminates early, so it cannot produce a 2002-digit sequence. Thus, the path \(1 \to 9 \to 5 \to 7 \to 6 \to 2\) is not viable for the full sequence. We revert to the viable path involving the cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3 \to 1\), which allows the sequence to continue for 2002 digits and gives \(d_{2002} = 1\) or \(8\).

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- **Main Goal**: Find the largest possible last digit (\(d_{2002}\)) of a 2002-digit string starting with \(d_1 = 1\), where every two-digit number formed by consecutive digits is divisible by 19 or 31.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Understand the constraints (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Model the problem as a transition graph (completed).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Explore possible constructions using the graph (partially completed; cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3\) yields \(d_{2002} = 1\) or \(8\), alternative path \(9 \to 5\) fails).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Maximize the last digit (\(d_{2002}\)) (in progress; current maximum is 8).  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Verify the sequence’s feasibility and optimality (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Maximize the last digit by confirming if 8 is the largest possible \(d_{2002}\) or if other paths yield a higher digit.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate whether 8 is the largest possible last digit by checking if other paths or digits are reachable at position 2002.  
- **How to Achieve**: Re-examine the graph to confirm all possible paths from \(d_1 = 1\) that maintain a 2002-digit sequence. Check if any path leads to a digit higher than 8 at position 2002.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconsider the graph’s structure:
- From \(d_{2001} = 3\), the possible digits for \(d_{2002}\) are 1 or 8.
- Other paths (e.g., \(9 \to 5\)) lead to dead ends (like 2, 6, or 8, which have no outgoing edges).
- Nodes with outgoing edges are \(\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}\), and the only sustainable path for 2002 digits is through the cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3 \to 1\), as other paths terminate early (e.g., reaching 2, 6, or 8).
- Possible last digits from the cycle:
  - If \(d_{2001} = 3\), then \(d_{2002} = 1\) or \(8\).
  - Other digits (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9) cannot be reached as \(d_{2002}\) because:
    - 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 have no incoming edges from nodes that sustain a 2002-digit path.
    - 5 is reachable only via \(9 \to 5\), but leads to 7 \(\to\) 6 \(\to\) 2 (dead end).
    - 7 is reachable only via \(5 \to 7\), which leads to a dead end.
    - 9 is reachable via \(1 \to 9\), but the next digit after 2001 transitions (if \(d_{2001} = 1\)) is 9, and \(d_{2002} = 3\) or \(5\), not 9.

Thus, the only sustainable path uses the cycle, and the maximum \(d_{2002}\) is 8 (since \(8 > 1\)).  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the largest possible last digit is 8.  
- **Core Content for Retrieval**: Information about the graph’s structure, the cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3\), and the possible last digits from \(d_{2001} = 3\).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:
- From Step 2: The graph has edges \(1 \to 9\), \(3 \to 1, 8\), \(5 \to 7\), \(6 \to 2\), \(7 \to 6\), \(9 \to 3, 5\). Valid two-digit numbers are \(\{19, 31, 38, 57, 62, 76, 93, 95\}\).
- From Step 4: The cycle \(1 \to 9 \to 3 \to 1\) allows a 2002-digit sequence, and after 2001 transitions, \(d_{2001} = 3\), so \(d_{2002} = 1\) or \(8\).
- From Step 6: The alternative path \(1 \to 9 \to 5 \to 7 \to 6 \to 2\) terminates early, so it’s not viable.
- From Step 8: Other digits (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9) cannot be reached as \(d_{2002}\) in a 2002-digit sequence due to dead ends or cycle constraints.

This confirms that \(d_{2002} = 8\) is the largest possible last digit, as no other paths yield a higher digit while maintaining the sequence length.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**

The largest possible last digit of the 2002-digit string is 8.
