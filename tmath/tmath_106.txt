Goal of this step: Simplify the quadratic equation to standard form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the given equation $x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41$, we'll move all terms to one side to get the equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Subtract $x$ and $41$ from both sides:
$$x^2 - 3x + 9 - x - 41 = 0$$
Simplify the left side by combining like terms:
$$x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0$$

The simplified quadratic equation is $x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0$, which is now in the standard form.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0$ using the quadratic formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The quadratic formula is given by:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
For the equation $x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0$, the coefficients are $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -32$.  

Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-32)}}{2(1)}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 128}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{4 \pm 12}{2}
$$  

This gives two solutions:  
$$
x = \frac{4 + 12}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
$$  
$$
x = \frac{4 - 12}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
$$  
The two solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -4$.

[REVIEW]
The simplified quadratic equation is $x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0$, and the two solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -4$. The next step is to calculate the positive difference between these solutions.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the positive difference between the solutions $x = 8$ and $x = -4$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The positive difference between two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.  

So, the positive difference between $8$ and $-4$ is:  
$$
|8 - (-4)| = |8 + 4| = 12
$$
