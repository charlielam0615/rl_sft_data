**Problem Statement**: Richard has 360 feet of fencing to enclose three sides of a rectangular backyard, with the fourth side bordered by his house. We need to determine the maximum possible area of the backyard.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the maximum area into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the variables for the rectangle’s dimensions.  
2. Set up the constraint based on the fencing length.  
3. Express the area as a function of the variables.  
4. Optimize the area function to find the maximum.  
5. Verify the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the variables for the rectangle’s dimensions and set up the fencing constraint. We will assign variables to the sides of the rectangle and use the fencing length to establish a relationship between them.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the width of the backyard (perpendicular to the house) be \( w \) feet, and the length (parallel to the house) be \( l \) feet. Since the house forms one side of the rectangle, the fencing covers two widths and one length:  
\[ 2w + l = 360 \]  
Solve for \( l \):  
\[ l = 360 - 2w \]  
The area of the rectangle is:  
\[ A = l \cdot w = (360 - 2w) \cdot w = 360w - 2w^2 \]  

[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to optimize the area function \( A = 360w - 2w^2 \) to find the maximum area. We will use calculus to find the critical points by taking the derivative, setting it to zero, and determining the nature of the critical point.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A = 360w - 2w^2 \) with respect to \( w \):  
\[ \frac{dA}{dw} = 360 - 4w \]  
Set the derivative to zero to find the critical point:  
\[ 360 - 4w = 0 \]  
\[ w = 90 \]  
To confirm this is a maximum, check the second derivative:  
\[ \frac{d^2A}{dw^2} = -4 \]  
Since the second derivative is negative, \( w = 90 \) corresponds to a maximum.  
Substitute \( w = 90 \) into the fencing constraint to find \( l \):  
\[ l = 360 - 2 \cdot 90 = 180 \]  
Calculate the area:  
\[ A = l \cdot w = 180 \cdot 90 = 16,200 \text{ square feet} \]  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the dimensions satisfy the fencing constraint and exploring alternative methods to confirm the maximum area. We will verify the perimeter and test the area function at boundary points.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the fencing constraint:  
\[ 2w + l = 2 \cdot 90 + 180 = 360 \text{ feet} \]  
This satisfies the given fencing length.  
To further validate, test the area at boundary points. If \( w = 0 \):  
\[ l = 360 - 2 \cdot 0 = 360, \quad A = 360 \cdot 0 = 0 \]  
If \( w = 180 \):  
\[ l = 360 - 2 \cdot 180 = 0, \quad A = 0 \cdot 180 = 0 \]  
Both boundary points yield zero area, supporting that \( w = 90 \), \( l = 180 \) is the maximum.  
Alternatively, recognize that the area function \( A = 360w - 2w^2 \) is a quadratic in \( w \), with a maximum at the vertex. The vertex of \( A = -2w^2 + 360w \) occurs at:  
\[ w = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{360}{2 \cdot (-2)} = 90 \]  
This confirms the calculus result.
