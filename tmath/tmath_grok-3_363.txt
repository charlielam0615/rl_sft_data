### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies both quadratic equations simultaneously: \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) and \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \). The solution must be expressed as a simplified common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( x \) that satisfies both quadratic equations, we break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Solve the first quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \).
2. Solve the second quadratic equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \).
3. Identify common solutions that satisfy both equations.
4. Verify the solutions and express the final answer as a simplified common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the first quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \).
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 8 \), \( b = 7 \), and \( c = -1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \):
- Coefficients: \( a = 8 \), \( b = 7 \), \( c = -1 \).
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-1) = 49 + 32 = 81 \).
- Quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{-7 \pm 9}{16} \).
- Solutions:
  - \( x_1 = \frac{-7 + 9}{16} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \).
  - \( x_2 = \frac{-7 - 9}{16} = \frac{-16}{16} = -1 \).

Thus, the solutions to the first equation are \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( x = -1 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the second quadratic equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \).
How to Achieve: Apply the quadratic formula with coefficients \( a = 24 \), \( b = 53 \), and \( c = -7 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \):
- Coefficients: \( a = 24 \), \( b = 53 \), \( c = -7 \).
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = 53^2 - 4 \cdot 24 \cdot (-7) = 2809 + 672 = 3481 \).
- Check if the discriminant is a perfect square: \( \sqrt{3481} \approx 59 \), since \( 59^2 = 3481 \).
- Quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-53 \pm \sqrt{3481}}{2 \cdot 24} = \frac{-53 \pm 59}{48} \).
- Solutions:
  - \( x_1 = \frac{-53 + 59}{48} = \frac{6}{48} = \frac{1}{8} \).
  - \( x_2 = \frac{-53 - 59}{48} = \frac{-112}{48} = \frac{-28}{12} = \frac{-7}{3} \).

Thus, the solutions to the second equation are \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( x = -\frac{7}{3} \).

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \( x \) that satisfies both \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) and \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) (completed: solutions \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -1 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \) (completed: solutions \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -\frac{7}{3} \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Identify common solutions (pending).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solutions and express as a simplified fraction (pending).
Current Goal: Identify common solutions that satisfy both equations.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify common solutions that satisfy both equations.
How to Achieve: Compare the solutions from both equations to find values of \( x \) that appear in both sets.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Solutions from the first equation: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -1 \).
- Solutions from the second equation: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -\frac{7}{3} \).
- Common solution: \( x = \frac{1}{8} \).

Since \( -1 \) and \( -\frac{7}{3} \) are not common to both, the only candidate is \( x = \frac{1}{8} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) satisfies both equations and confirm it is the only solution.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) into both equations and check if any other solutions were missed by ensuring no other common roots exist.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- First equation: \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \).
  - Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \):
  - \( 8 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + 7 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) - 1 = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{64} + \frac{7}{8} - 1 = \frac{8}{64} + \frac{56}{64} - \frac{64}{64} = \frac{8 + 56 - 64}{64} = \frac{0}{64} = 0 \).
  - Satisfies the equation.

- Second equation: \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \).
  - Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \):
  - \( 24 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + 53 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) - 7 = 24 \cdot \frac{1}{64} + \frac{53}{8} - 7 = \frac{24}{64} + \frac{424}{64} - \frac{448}{64} = \frac{24 + 424 - 448}{64} = \frac{0}{64} = 0 \).
  - Satisfies the equation.

To ensure no other solutions:
- The other solutions (\( x = -1 \) from the first, \( x = -\frac{7}{3} \) from the second) do not overlap.
- Alternatively, consider the system by subtracting equations to find common roots:
  - Subtract: \( (24x^2 + 53x - 7) - 3(8x^2 + 7x - 1) = 0 \).
  - \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 - (24x^2 + 21x - 3) = 32x - 4 = 0 \).
  - \( 32x = 4 \implies x = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \).
- This linear equation confirms \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) as the only common root.

The solution \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) is already a simplified common fraction.
