**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) that satisfies both quadratic equations \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) and \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \). Express the answer as a simplified common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( x \) that satisfies both quadratic equations, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the first quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \).  
2. Solve the second quadratic equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \).  
3. Identify the common value(s) of \( x \) that satisfy both equations.  
4. Verify the solution and express it as a simplified common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the first quadratic equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \). Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 8 \), \( b = 7 \), and \( c = -1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 8 \), \( b = 7 \), \( c = -1 \).  
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-1) = 49 + 32 = 81 \).  
- Quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{-7 \pm 9}{16} \).  
- Solutions:  
  - \( x_1 = \frac{-7 + 9}{16} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \).  
  - \( x_2 = \frac{-7 - 9}{16} = \frac{-16}{16} = -1 \).  
Thus, the possible values of \( x \) are \( \frac{1}{8} \) and \( -1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the second quadratic equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \) to find possible values of \( x \). Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 24 \), \( b = 53 \), and \( c = -7 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 24 \), \( b = 53 \), \( c = -7 \).  
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 53^2 - 4 \cdot 24 \cdot (-7) = 2809 + 672 = 3481 \).  
- Check if \( \Delta \) is a perfect square: \( \sqrt{3481} \approx 59 \), since \( 59^2 = 3481 \).  
- Quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-53 \pm \sqrt{3481}}{2 \cdot 24} = \frac{-53 \pm 59}{48} \).  
- Solutions:  
  - \( x_1 = \frac{-53 + 59}{48} = \frac{6}{48} = \frac{1}{8} \).  
  - \( x_2 = \frac{-53 - 59}{48} = \frac{-112}{48} = \frac{-7}{3} \).  
Thus, the possible values of \( x \) are \( \frac{1}{8} \) and \( \frac{-7}{3} \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( x \) that satisfies both \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) and \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \) (completed: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \) (completed: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, \frac{-7}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify common \( x \) values (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify and simplify the solution (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the common value(s) of \( x \) that satisfy both equations.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the common value(s) of \( x \) that satisfy both equations by comparing the solutions from the two quadratics. The solutions are \( \frac{1}{8}, -1 \) from the first equation and \( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{-7}{3} \) from the second equation. Find the intersection of these solution sets.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Solutions from the first equation: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, -1 \).  
- Solutions from the second equation: \( x = \frac{1}{8}, \frac{-7}{3} \).  
- Common solution: \( x = \frac{1}{8} \).  
Thus, the value of \( x \) that satisfies both equations is \( \frac{1}{8} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) satisfies both equations and ensure the solution is a simplified common fraction. Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) into both equations to confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For the first equation \( 8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0 \):  
  Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \):  
  \( 8 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + 7 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) - 1 = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{64} + \frac{7}{8} - 1 = \frac{8}{64} + \frac{7}{8} - 1 = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \).  
  The equation holds.  
- For the second equation \( 24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0 \):  
  Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{8} \):  
  \( 24 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + 53 \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) - 7 = 24 \cdot \frac{1}{64} + \frac{53}{8} - 7 = \frac{24}{64} + \frac{53}{8} - 7 = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{53}{8} - \frac{56}{8} = \frac{3 + 53 - 56}{8} = \frac{0}{8} = 0 \).  
  The equation holds.  
- The fraction \( \frac{1}{8} \) is already in its simplest form (numerator and denominator are coprime, as 1 and 8 have no common factors other than 1).
