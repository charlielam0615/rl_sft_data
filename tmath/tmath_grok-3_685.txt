**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine the greatest number of four-topping pizzas that can be made from six available toppings, ensuring that no two pizzas have the same combination of toppings. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 4 toppings out of 6, as each unique combination represents a distinct pizza.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the mathematical approach to calculate the number of unique four-topping combinations from six toppings.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that choosing 4 toppings from 6 is a combination problem, as the order of toppings does not matter. Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The problem involves selecting 4 toppings from 6 without regard to order, which is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). Here, \( n = 6 \) (total toppings) and \( k = 4 \) (toppings to choose). Thus, we need to compute \( C(6, 4) \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the combination formula to compute \( C(6, 4) \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \) into the formula \( C(6, 4) = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} \), calculate the factorials, and simplify the expression to find the number of combinations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( C(6, 4) \):  
\[ C(6, 4) = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} \]  
Calculate factorials:  
- \( 6! = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720 \)  
- \( 4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24 \)  
- \( 2! = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \)  
Substitute:  
\[ C(6, 4) = \frac{720}{24 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{48} = 15 \]  
Alternatively, simplify directly:  
\[ C(6, 4) = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{360}{24} = 15 \]  
Thus, there are 15 possible four-topping combinations.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation \( C(6, 4) = 15 \).  
How to Achieve: Use an alternative method, such as the relationship \( C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) \), to compute \( C(6, 2) \) and check if it equals \( C(6, 4) \). Additionally, consider listing a few combinations to confirm the total count is reasonable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify using \( C(6, 4) = C(6, 6-4) = C(6, 2) \):  
\[ C(6, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 4!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 24} = \frac{720}{48} = 15 \]  
Since \( C(6, 2) = 15 \), this matches \( C(6, 4) = 15 \), confirming the calculation.  
To further validate, note that listing all combinations (e.g., choosing 4 toppings from {A, B, C, D, E, F}) would be tedious, but the total of 15 is plausible since \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) and \( C(6, 5) = 6 \), and 15 fits the pattern of binomial coefficients.
