**Problem Statement**: Sam is hired for 20 days. He earns $60 per day worked, and $30 is subtracted per day not worked. At the end of 20 days, he receives $660. We need to determine how many days he did not work.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Define variables for days worked and days not worked.
2. Set up an equation based on the total earnings, using the given rates.
3. Solve the equation to find the number of days not worked.
4. Validate the solution.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and set up the equation for total earnings.
How to Achieve: Let \( x \) be the number of days Sam did not work. Then, the number of days worked is \( 20 - x \). Each day worked earns $60, and each day not worked subtracts $30. Total earnings are $660. Formulate the equation: \( 60(20 - x) - 30x = 660 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Define \( x \) as the number of days Sam did not work. Days worked = \( 20 - x \).
Earnings equation: \( 60(20 - x) - 30x = 660 \).
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( 60(20 - x) - 30x = 660 \) for \( x \).
How to Achieve: Simplify and solve the equation step-by-step using algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[
60(20 - x) - 30x = 660
\]
Distribute:
\[
60 \cdot 20 - 60x - 30x = 660
\]
\[
1200 - 60x - 30x = 660
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
1200 - 90x = 660
\]
Subtract 1200 from both sides:
\[
-90x = 660 - 1200
\]
\[
-90x = -540
\]
Divide by -90:
\[
x = \frac{-540}{-90} = 6
\]
So, Sam did not work for 6 days.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 6 \) days not worked.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the earnings equation and check if the total equals $660. Also, ensure the solution makes sense in the context (e.g., days worked and not worked sum to 20).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify \( x = 6 \):
Days worked = \( 20 - 6 = 14 \).
Earnings = \( 60 \cdot 14 - 30 \cdot 6 = 840 - 180 = 660 \).
The equation holds true.
Check total days: \( 14 + 6 = 20 \), which is correct.
The solution is valid: Sam did not work for 6 days.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine how many days Sam did not work.
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for days worked and not worked (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the earnings equation (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation for days not worked (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).
Current Goal: None (problem solved).
The solution is 6 days not worked.

**Final Answer**: Sam did not work for **6 days**.
