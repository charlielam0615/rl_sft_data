**Problem Statement**: Sam is hired for 20 days. He earns $60 for each day he works, and $30 is subtracted for each day he does not work. At the end of the 20 days, he receives $660. We need to determine how many days he did not work.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the number of days Sam worked and did not work.  
2. Set up an equation based on the total earnings, using the given rates for working and non-working days.  
3. Solve the equation to find the number of days Sam did not work.  
4. Validate the solution to ensure it aligns with the problem's conditions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an equation to represent Sam's total earnings. Define \( w \) as the number of days worked and \( n \) as the number of days not worked. Use the facts that the total period is 20 days, Sam earns $60 per working day, loses $30 per non-working day, and his total earnings are $660. Formulate the equation and solve for \( n \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( w \) be the number of days Sam worked, and \( n \) be the number of days he did not work. Since the total period is 20 days, we have:  
\[ w + n = 20 \]  

Sam earns $60 per working day, so his earnings from working are \( 60w \). For each non-working day, $30 is subtracted, so the deduction is \( 30n \). His total earnings are given as $660, leading to the equation:  
\[ 60w - 30n = 660 \]  

From the first equation, express \( w \) in terms of \( n \):  
\[ w = 20 - n \]  

Substitute \( w = 20 - n \) into the earnings equation:  
\[ 60(20 - n) - 30n = 660 \]  
\[ 1200 - 60n - 30n = 660 \]  
\[ 1200 - 90n = 660 \]  
\[ -90n = 660 - 1200 \]  
\[ -90n = -540 \]  
\[ n = \frac{540}{90} = 6 \]  

So, Sam did not work for 6 days.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if \( n = 6 \) satisfies the problem's conditions. Calculate the number of working days, total earnings, and deductions, and confirm the total matches $660.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
If Sam did not work for \( n = 6 \) days, then he worked for:  
\[ w = 20 - 6 = 14 \] days.  

Earnings from working:  
\[ 60 \times 14 = 840 \] dollars.  

Deductions for non-working days:  
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \] dollars.  

Total earnings:  
\[ 840 - 180 = 660 \] dollars.  

This matches the given total of $660, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of days Sam did not work.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for days worked and not worked (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve an equation for total earnings (completed, \( n = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, confirmed correct).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the number of days Sam did not work is 6, and the solution has been validated.

**Final Answer**: Sam did not work for 6 days.
