Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the fourth root of 81.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The fourth root of 81 is equivalent to $ 81^{1/4} $.  
To compute $ 81^{1/4} $, we can express 81 as a power of a smaller number.  
Note that $ 81 = 3^4 $.  
Thus, $ 81^{1/4} = (3^4)^{1/4} = 3^{4 \cdot 1/4} = 3^1 = 3 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Raise the result to the third power.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, the fourth root of 81 is 3.  
Now, raising this result to the third power:  
$$ 3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27 $$.

[VERIFY]
1. First, we decomposed $81^{3/4}$ into $\sqrt[4]{81}^3$. This follows the exponent rule $a^{m/n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$, which is correctly applied here.

2. We expressed 81 as $3^4$. Verifying: $3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$. This is correct.

3. Calculated $\sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3$. This follows from the property $\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a$ for non-negative real numbers, which holds true here since 3 is positive. Correct.

4. Calculated $3^3 = 27$. Verifying: $3 \times 3 = 9$, $9 \times 3 = 27$. Correct.

Each step logically follows from the previous one with no gaps in reasoning. The application of exponent rules is valid, and all arithmetic operations are correct. No alternative interpretations of the problem were overlooked. The final result of 27 is consistent with all steps of the calculation.
