Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the number of integers in the range from 80 to 90, inclusive.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To determine the number of integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive).
$$ 90 - 80 + 1 = 11 $$
There are 11 integers in the range from 80 to 90, inclusive.

Goal of this step: Calculate the average of the smallest and largest integers in the range.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The smallest integer in the range is 80, and the largest is 90.  
To calculate the average, we use the formula:  
$$ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Smallest} + \text{Largest}}{2} $$  
$$ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 90}{2} = \frac{170}{2} = 85 $$  
The average is 85.

Goal of this step: Multiply the average by the number of integers to find the sum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We previously determined that the average is 85 and the number of integers is 11.  
To find the sum, we use the formula:  
$$ \text{Sum} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of Integers} $$  
$$ \text{Sum} = 85 \times 11 $$  
$$ \text{Sum} = 935 $$  
The sum of all integers from 80 through 90, inclusive, is 935.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution for calculating the sum of integers from 80 to 90 inclusive.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Number of terms calculation**:  
   The formula used was $ 90 - 80 + 1 = 11 $.  
   Manual enumeration confirms there are 11 integers (80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90).  
   ✅ Correct.

2. **Average calculation**:  
   The average of the smallest (80) and largest (90) terms was calculated as $ \frac{80 + 90}{2} = 85 $.  
   This is mathematically valid for an arithmetic sequence.  
   ✅ Correct.

3. **Sum calculation**:  
   The formula $ \text{Sum} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of Terms} $ gives $ 85 \times 11 = 935 $.  
   Cross-verified via sequential addition of all 11 terms (80+81+82+...+90) which also totals 935.  
   ✅ Correct.

All steps are logically consistent and produce the same result through multiple methods. No errors detected.  
$\boxed{correct}$
