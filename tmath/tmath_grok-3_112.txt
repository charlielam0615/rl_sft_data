**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a negative integer \( N \) such that the sum of \( N \) and its square equals 6, i.e., \( N^2 + N = 6 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Formulate the equation based on the problem statement.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( N \).  
3. Identify solutions that are negative integers.  
4. Verify the solutions by substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to formulate the equation based on the problem statement. This will be achieved by translating the given condition "the sum of a negative integer \( N \) and its square is 6" into a mathematical equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The problem states that the sum of a negative integer \( N \) and its square is 6. This translates to the equation:  
\[ N^2 + N = 6 \]  
To prepare for solving, rewrite it in standard quadratic form:  
\[ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( N^2 + N - 6 = 0 \) for \( N \). This will be achieved by factoring the quadratic equation or using the quadratic formula, then identifying possible solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation:  
\[ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 \]  
Factorize the equation by finding two numbers that multiply to \(-6\) and add to \(1\). These numbers are \(3\) and \(-2\):  
\[ (N + 3)(N - 2) = 0 \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ N + 3 = 0 \implies N = -3 \]  
\[ N - 2 = 0 \implies N = 2 \]  
The solutions are \( N = -3 \) and \( N = 2 \). Since \( N \) must be a negative integer, retain \( N = -3 \) and discard \( N = 2 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( N = -3 \) satisfies the original condition \( N^2 + N = 6 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( N = -3 \) into the equation and checking if the result equals 6.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( N = -3 \) into the original equation:  
\[ (-3)^2 + (-3) = 9 - 3 = 6 \]  
The result is 6, which matches the given condition. Thus, \( N = -3 \) is a valid solution.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find a negative integer \( N \) such that \( N^2 + N = 6 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Formulate the equation (completed: \( N^2 + N - 6 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation (completed: \( N = -3, 2 \); retained \( N = -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify negative integer solutions (completed: \( N = -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solutions (completed: \( N = -3 \) satisfies the equation).  
**Current Goal**: Since all subgoals are completed and the solution is verified, the main goal is achieved.  
The value of \( N \) is \(-3\).

**Final Answer**: The value of \( N \) is \(-3\).
