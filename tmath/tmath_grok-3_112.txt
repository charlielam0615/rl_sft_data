**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a negative integer \( N \) such that the sum of \( N \) and its square (\( N^2 \)) equals 6. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( N^2 + N = 6 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Formulate the equation based on the problem statement.  
2. Solve the equation to find possible values of \( N \).  
3. Verify that the solution(s) are negative integers.  
4. Confirm the solution satisfies the original condition.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Formulate and solve the equation \( N^2 + N = 6 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form, solve for \( N \) using algebraic methods (e.g., factoring or the quadratic formula), and identify integer solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation: \( N^2 + N = 6 \).  
Rewrite it in standard quadratic form:  
\[ N^2 + N - 6 = 0 \]  

Solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need two numbers that multiply to \(-6\) and add to \(1\). Testing pairs:  
- \( 3 \) and \(-2\): \( 3 \cdot (-2) = -6 \), and \( 3 + (-2) = 1 \).  

Thus, the equation factors as:  
\[ (N + 3)(N - 2) = 0 \]  

Set each factor to zero:  
- \( N + 3 = 0 \implies N = -3 \)  
- \( N - 2 = 0 \implies N = 2 \)  

The possible solutions are \( N = -3 \) and \( N = 2 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the solutions \( N = -3 \) and \( N = 2 \) satisfy the original condition and the requirement that \( N \) is a negative integer.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution back into the equation \( N^2 + N = 6 \) and check if the result equals 6. Then, confirm which solution is a negative integer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \( N = -3 \):  
\[ (-3)^2 + (-3) = 9 - 3 = 6 \]  
This satisfies the equation. Since \(-3\) is a negative integer, it is a valid solution.  

Check \( N = 2 \):  
\[ 2^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]  
This also satisfies the equation. However, \( 2 \) is not a negative integer, so it does not meet the problem's requirement.  

Thus, only \( N = -3 \) is a valid solution based on the constraint.

### Step 4: Track Goals

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find a negative integer \( N \) such that \( N^2 + N = 6 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Formulate the equation (completed: \( N^2 + N = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation (completed: \( N = -3, 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions are negative integers (completed: \( N = -3 \) is valid, \( N = 2 \) is not).  
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the solution satisfies the condition (completed for \( N = -3 \)).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final solution. Since all subgoals have been addressed, the current goal is to state the final answer.  

The solution \( N = -3 \) has been validated as a negative integer satisfying \( N^2 + N = 6 \).

**Final Answer**: The value of \( N \) is \(-3\).
