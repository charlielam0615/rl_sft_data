### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the combined weight of Abby and Damon, given the following pair weights:
- Abby and Bart: 260 pounds
- Bart and Cindy: 245 pounds
- Cindy and Damon: 270 pounds

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding Abby and Damon's combined weight into intermediate subgoals. Subgoals:  
1. Assign variables to each person's weight.  
2. Set up equations based on the given pair weights.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find Abby and Damon's weights.  
4. Compute the sum of Abby and Damon's weights.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to assign variables to each person's weight and set up equations. Achieve this by defining variables for Abby (A), Bart (B), Cindy (C), and Damon (D), and writing equations based on the given pair weights.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let:  
- A = Abby's weight  
- B = Bart's weight  
- C = Cindy's weight  
- D = Damon's weight  

From the problem:  
1. A + B = 260  
2. B + C = 245  
3. C + D = 270  

These equations represent the pair weights provided.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the combined weight of Abby and Damon.  
  - Subgoal 1: Assign variables to each person's weight (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on pair weights (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations to find Abby and Damon's weights.  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of Abby and Damon's weights.  

**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find Abby and Damon's weights.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve the system of equations to find Abby and Damon's weights. Achieve this by manipulating the equations to isolate A and D, then summing them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We have:  
1. A + B = 260  
2. B + C = 245  
3. C + D = 270  

To find A + D, add all equations:  
(A + B) + (B + C) + (C + D) = 260 + 245 + 270  
A + B + B + C + C + D = 775  
A + 2B + 2C + D = 775  

This equation is not directly A + D. Instead, try to express A + D using the equations.  
Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:  
(A + B) - (B + C) = 260 - 245  
A + B - B - C = 15  
A - C = 15  

Now, use equation 3: C + D = 270. We need A + D:  
From A - C = 15, we get A = C + 15.  
Then:  
A + D = (C + 15) + D = (C + D) + 15 = 270 + 15 = 285  

Thus, A + D = 285 pounds.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution. Achieve this by substituting A + D back into the system or deriving A + D via an alternative method to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, solve for individual weights and check:  
From A - C = 15, we have A = C + 15.  
Use equation 3: C + D = 270, so D = 270 - C.  
Use equation 2: B + C = 245, so B = 245 - C.  
Substitute into equation 1:  
A + B = (C + 15) + (245 - C) = 15 + 245 = 260, which holds.  

Now compute A + D:  
From A = C + 15 and D = 270 - C:  
A + D = (C + 15) + (270 - C) = 15 + 270 = 285  

Alternatively, add equations 1 and 3, subtract equation 2:  
(A + B) + (C + D) - (B + C) = 260 + 270 - 245  
A + B + C + D - B - C = 285  
A + D = 285  

Both methods confirm A + D = 285 pounds.
