### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the combined weight of Abby and Damon, given the following pair weights:
- Abby and Bart: 260 pounds
- Bart and Cindy: 245 pounds
- Cindy and Damon: 270 pounds

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for Abby and Damon's combined weight, break the problem into subgoals:
1. Define variables for each person's weight.
2. Set up equations based on the given pair weights.
3. Solve the system of equations to find Abby and Damon's weights.
4. Calculate their combined weight.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations.
How to Achieve: Assign variables to each person's weight (e.g., A for Abby, B for Bart, C for Cindy, D for Damon) and write equations based on the given pair weights.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let:
- A = Abby's weight
- B = Bart's weight
- C = Cindy's weight
- D = Damon's weight

From the problem:
1. A + B = 260 (Abby and Bart)
2. B + C = 245 (Bart and Cindy)
3. C + D = 270 (Cindy and Damon)

The goal is to find A + D.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equations to find A + D.
How to Achieve: Manipulate the equations algebraically to express A + D in terms of known quantities, possibly by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate variables.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find A + D, add the three equations:
(A + B) + (B + C) + (C + D) = 260 + 245 + 270

Simplify:
A + B + B + C + C + D = 775
A + 2B + 2C + D = 775

This equation has multiple variables, so consider an alternative: eliminate variables to isolate A + D. Subtract the second equation from the first:
(A + B) - (B + C) = 260 - 245
A + B - B - C = 15
A - C = 15
A = C + 15

Now, use the third equation, C + D = 270. Substitute A = C + 15 into the expression for A + D:
A + D = (C + 15) + D = C + D + 15 = 270 + 15 = 285
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution for A + D.
How to Achieve: Substitute derived values back into the equations or use an alternative method to confirm A + D = 285.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative method: Add the first and third equations, then subtract the second:
(A + B) + (C + D) - (B + C) = 260 + 270 - 245
A + B + C + D - B - C = 285
A + D = 285

This confirms the earlier result. To further validate, assume A + D = 285 and check consistency. From A = C + 15 and C + D = 270:
- C + D = 270
- A + D = 285
- A = C + 15

The equations are consistent, as (C + 15) + D = (C + D) + 15 = 270 + 15 = 285.
[/IMP]
