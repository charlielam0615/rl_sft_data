**Step 8: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the fraction \( \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} \) and simplify to the form \( \frac{a}{b} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the results \( f(g(f(2))) = 41 \) and \( g(f(g(2))) = 31 \), form the fraction \( \frac{41}{31} \), and check if it can be simplified by finding common factors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the fraction:  
\[ \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} = \frac{41}{31} \]  
Check for simplification:  
- The numbers 41 and 31 are both prime (41 is only divisible by 1 and 41; 31 is only divisible by 1 and 31).  
- Since they share no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{41}{31} \) is already in its simplest form.

**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for \( f(g(f(2))) \) and \( g(f(g(2))) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute each step to ensure accuracy and confirm the fraction is simplified.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute each step:  
1. \( f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 7 \)  
2. \( g(f(2)) = g(7) = 3 \cdot 7 - 2 = 19 \)  
3. \( f(g(f(2))) = f(19) = 2 \cdot 19 + 3 = 41 \)  
4. \( g(2) = 3 \cdot 2 - 2 = 4 \)  
5. \( f(g(2)) = f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \)  
6. \( g(f(g(2))) = g(11) = 3 \cdot 11 - 2 = 31 \)  
7. Fraction: \( \frac{41}{31} \), which is simplified since 41 and 31 are coprime.  
All calculations are consistent with previous results.
