**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \), compute the value of \( \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} \) and express the answer as a fraction in the form \( \frac{a}{b} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(2) \).  
2. Use the result to find \( g(f(2)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(g(f(2))) \) for the numerator.  
4. Compute \( g(2) \).  
5. Use the result to find \( f(g(2)) \).  
6. Compute \( g(f(g(2))) \) for the denominator.  
7. Form the fraction \( \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} \) and simplify to the form \( \frac{a}{b} \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \). To achieve this, substitute \( x = 2 \) into the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \):  
\[ f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \]  
So, \( f(2) = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(2)) \). Using the result \( f(2) = 7 \), substitute \( x = 7 \) into \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \):  
\[ g(f(2)) = g(7) = 3 \cdot 7 - 2 = 21 - 2 = 19 \]  
So, \( g(f(2)) = 19 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(f(2))) \), the numerator. Using the result \( g(f(2)) = 19 \), substitute \( x = 19 \) into \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \):  
\[ f(g(f(2))) = f(19) = 2 \cdot 19 + 3 = 38 + 3 = 41 \]  
So, \( f(g(f(2))) = 41 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(2) \). Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \):  
\[ g(2) = 3 \cdot 2 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 \]  
So, \( g(2) = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(2)) \). Using the result \( g(2) = 4 \), substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \):  
\[ f(g(2)) = f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \]  
So, \( f(g(2)) = 11 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(g(2))) \), the denominator. Using the result \( f(g(2)) = 11 \), substitute \( x = 11 \) into \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \) and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( g(x) = 3x - 2 \):  
\[ g(f(g(2))) = g(11) = 3 \cdot 11 - 2 = 33 - 2 = 31 \]  
So, \( g(f(g(2))) = 31 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the fraction \( \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} \) and simplify it to the form \( \frac{a}{b} \). Using the results \( f(g(f(2))) = 41 \) and \( g(f(g(2))) = 31 \), form the fraction and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} = \frac{41}{31} \]  
Check if the fraction can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 41 and 31. Since 41 and 31 are prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Thus, the fraction is already in its simplest form.  
So, the answer is \( \frac{41}{31} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation by recomputing each step to ensure accuracy. Recompute \( f(g(f(2))) \) and \( g(f(g(2))) \), then verify the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the numerator:  
- \( f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 7 \).  
- \( g(f(2)) = g(7) = 3 \cdot 7 - 2 = 19 \).  
- \( f(g(f(2))) = f(19) = 2 \cdot 19 + 3 = 41 \).  

Recompute the denominator:  
- \( g(2) = 3 \cdot 2 - 2 = 4 \).  
- \( f(g(2)) = f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \).  
- \( g(f(g(2))) = g(11) = 3 \cdot 11 - 2 = 31 \).  

Form the fraction:  
\[ \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} = \frac{41}{31} \]  
The recomputed values match the previous results, and the fraction is in simplest form (GCD of 41 and 31 is 1). The computation is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( \frac{f(g(f(2)))}{g(f(g(2)))} \) and express as \( \frac{a}{b} \).
