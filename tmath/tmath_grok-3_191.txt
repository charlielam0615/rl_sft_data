**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \(\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2}\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{16}{5 + 3x}\). This requires finding the inverse function \(f^{-1}(x)\), evaluating it at \(x = 2\), and then computing the negative second power of that result.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve for \(\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2}\).  

1. Find the inverse function \(f^{-1}(x)\) by solving \(y = f(x)\) for \(x\) in terms of \(y\).  
2. Evaluate \(f^{-1}(x)\) at \(x = 2\) to find \(f^{-1}(2)\).  
3. Compute the negative second power of the result, i.e., \(\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2}\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the inverse function \(f^{-1}(x)\). This will be achieved by setting \(y = f(x) = \frac{16}{5 + 3x}\) and solving for \(x\) in terms of \(y\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the inverse, start with \(y = \frac{16}{5 + 3x}\). Solve for \(x\):  
1. Multiply both sides by \(5 + 3x\):  
   \(y (5 + 3x) = 16\)  
2. Divide by \(y\):  
   \(5 + 3x = \frac{16}{y}\)  
3. Subtract 5:  
   \(3x = \frac{16}{y} - 5\)  
4. Multiply by \(\frac{1}{3}\):  
   \(x = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{16}{y} - 5 \right)\)  
Simplify:  
   \(x = \frac{16 - 5y}{3y}\)  
Thus, the inverse function is:  
   \(f^{-1}(y) = \frac{16 - 5y}{3y}\)  
Since the variable is conventionally \(x\), we write:  
   \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac{16 - 5x}{3x}\)

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the inverse function \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac{16 - 5x}{3x}\). This will be done by checking if \(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\) and ensuring the function is well-defined for \(x = 2\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, compute \(f(f^{-1}(x))\):  
Substitute \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac{16 - 5x}{3x}\) into \(f(x) = \frac{16}{5 + 3x}\):  
\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left( \frac{16 - 5x}{3x} \right) = \frac{16}{5 + 3 \cdot \frac{16 - 5x}{3x}}\)  
Simplify the denominator:  
\(3 \cdot \frac{16 - 5x}{3x} = \frac{16 - 5x}{x}\)  
So,  
\(5 + \frac{16 - 5x}{x} = \frac{5x + 16 - 5x}{x} = \frac{16}{x}\)  
Thus:  
\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = \frac{16}{\frac{16}{x}} = x\)  
This confirms \(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\), so the inverse is correct.  
Next, check if \(f^{-1}(x)\) is defined at \(x = 2\):  
The denominator of \(f^{-1}(x)\) is \(3x\), which is non-zero at \(x = 2\). Thus, \(f^{-1}(2)\) is well-defined.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to evaluate \(f^{-1}(x)\) at \(x = 2\) to find \(f^{-1}(2)\). This will be achieved by substituting \(x = 2\) into \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac{16 - 5x}{3x}\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 2\) into \(f^{-1}(x)\):  
\(f^{-1}(2) = \frac{16 - 5 \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{16 - 10}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1\)  
So, \(f^{-1}(2) = 1\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2}\). This will be achieved by taking the result \(f^{-1}(2) = 1\) and calculating its negative second power.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(f^{-1}(2) = 1\), compute:  
\(\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2} = 1^{-2} = \frac{1}{1^2} = 1\)
