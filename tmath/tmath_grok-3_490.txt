### Problem Restatement
Ramanujan and Hardy each pick a complex number. The product of their numbers is \(32 - 8i\), and Hardy picks \(5 + 3i\). We need to find the complex number that Ramanujan picked.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding Ramanujan's complex number into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Represent Ramanujan's complex number as \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.  
2. Set up the equation based on the product of Hardy's number \((5 + 3i)\) and Ramanujan's number equaling \(32 - 8i\).  
3. Solve the resulting system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation for Ramanujan's complex number. Achieve this by multiplying Hardy's number \((5 + 3i)\) by Ramanujan's number \((a + bi)\) and equating the result to \(32 - 8i\). This will yield a system of equations for the real and imaginary parts, which can then be solved for \(a\) and \(b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let Ramanujan's complex number be \(a + bi\). The product of Hardy's number and Ramanujan's number is:

\[
(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 32 - 8i
\]

Expand the left-hand side:

\[
(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 5a + 5bi + 3ai + 3bi^2
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have:

\[
3bi^2 = 3b(-1) = -3b
\]

Combine terms:

\[
5a + 5bi + 3ai - 3b = (5a - 3b) + (5b + 3a)i
\]

Equate this to the given product \(32 - 8i\):

\[
(5a - 3b) + (5b + 3a)i = 32 - 8i
\]

For two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal. This gives the system of equations:

1. **Real part**: \(5a - 3b = 32\)  
2. **Imaginary part**: \(5b + 3a = -8\)

Solve the system. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 5 to eliminate \(a\):

\[
3(5a - 3b) = 3 \cdot 32 \implies 15a - 9b = 96
\]

\[
5(5b + 3a) = 5 \cdot (-8) \implies 25b + 15a = -40
\]

Now subtract the second equation from the first:

\[
(15a - 9b) - (15a + 25b) = 96 - (-40)
\]

\[
15a - 9b - 15a - 25b = 96 + 40
\]

\[
-34b = 136
\]

\[
b = \frac{136}{-34} = -4
\]

Substitute \(b = -4\) into the first equation:

\[
5a - 3(-4 = 32
\]

\[
5a - 12 = 32
\]

\[
5a = 32 + 12 = 44
\]

\[
a = \frac{44}{5} = 8
\]

Thus, Ramanujan's complex number is \(8 - 4i\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solution \(8 - 4i\) is correct. Achieve this by multiplying Hardy's number \((5 + 3i)\) by Ramanujan's number \((8 - 4i)\) and checking if the product equals \(32 - 8i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the solution by computing the product:

\[
(5 + 3i)(8 - 4i) = 5 \cdot 8 + 5 \cdot (-4i) + 3i \cdot 8) + 3i \cdot (-4i)
\]

\[
= 40 - 20i + 24i - 12i^2
\]

\[
= 40 - 20i + 24i - 12(-1)
\]

\[
= 40 + 12 + (-20i + 24i) = 52 + 4i
\]

The product is \(52 + 4i\), which does not equal \(32 - 8i\). This indicates an error in the solution.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
The validation step revealed an error, as the product does not match \(32 - 8i\). Return to the step where the solution was computed (Step 2) and re-evaluate the system of equations to identify and correct the mistake.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to re-solve the system of equations for Ramanujan's complex number \(a + bi\). Set up the equation \((5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 32 - 8i\), solve the system carefully, and ensure arithmetic accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the equation:

\[
(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = (5a - 3b) + (5b + 3a)i = 32 - 8i
\]

System of equations:

1. \(5a - 3b = 32\)
2. \(5b + 3a = -8\)

Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second by 3 to eliminate \(b\):

\[
5(5a - 3b) = 5 \cdot 32 \implies 25a - 15b = 160
\]

\[
3(5b + 3a) = 3 \cdot (-8) \implies 15b + 9a = -24
\]

Add the equations:

\[
(25a - 15b) + (15b + 9a) = 160 + (-24)
\]

\[
34a = 136
\]

\[
a = \frac{34}{4} = 4
\]

Substitute \(a = 4\) into the first equation:

\[
5 \cdot 4 - 3b = 32
\]

\[
20 - 3b = 32
\]

\[
-3b = 12
\]

\[
b = \frac{12}{12} = -4
\]

Thus, Ramanujan's complex number is \(4 - 4i\).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The goal is to verify the corrected solution \(4 - 4i\). Multiply \((5 + 3i)(4 - 4i)\) and check if the product equals \(32 - 8i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute the product:

\[
(5 + 3i)(4 - i4i) = 5 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot (-4i) + 3i \cdot (4) + 3i \cdot (-4i)
\]

\[
= 20 - 20i + 12i - 12i^2
\]

\[
= - 20 - 20i + 12i + 12(-1)
\]

\[
= 20 + 12 + (-20i + 12i) = 32 - 8i
\]

The product is \(32 - 8i\), which matches the given product. The solution \(4 - 4i\) is correct.
