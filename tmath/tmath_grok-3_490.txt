**Problem Statement**: Ramanujan and Hardy each pick a complex number, and the product of their numbers is \(32 - 8i\). Hardy’s number is \(5 + 3i\). We need to find Ramanujan’s number.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find Ramanujan’s complex number.  
- Subgoal 1: Represent Ramanujan’s number as a complex number \(a + bi\).  
- Subgoal 2: Set up the equation for the product of Hardy’s number (\(5 + 3i\)) and Ramanujan’s number (\(a + bi\)) equal to \(32 - 8i\).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the resulting system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up the equation for the product of the complex numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply Hardy’s number (\(5 + 3i\)) by Ramanujan’s number (\(a + bi\)) and set it equal to \(32 - 8i\). This will give a system of equations by equating the real and imaginary parts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let Ramanujan’s number be \(a + bi\). The product is:  
\[(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 32 - 8i\]  
Expanding the left-hand side:  
\[(5 + 3i)(a + bi) = 5a + 5bi + 3ai + 3bi^2\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:  
\[5a + 5bi + 3ai - 3b = (5a - 3b) + (5b + 3a)i\]  
Set this equal to \(32 - 8i\):  
\[(5a - 3b) + (5b + 3a)i = 32 - 8i\]  
Equate real and imaginary parts:  
- Real part: \(5a - 3b = 32\)  
- Imaginary part: \(5b + 3a = -8\)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) to solve the system:  
- \(5a - 3b = 32\)  
- \(5b + 3a = -8\)  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
1. \(5a - 3b = 32\)  
2. \(3a + 5b = -8\)  
Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 5 to align coefficients of \(a\):  
- \(15a - 9b = 96\)  
- \(15a + 25b = -40\)  
Subtract the second from the first:  
\[(15a - 9b) - (15a + 25b) = 96 - (-40)\]  
\[-9b - 25b = 136\]  
\[-34b = 136\]  
\[b = -\frac{136}{34} = -4\]  
Substitute \(b = -4\) into the first equation:  
\[5a - 3(-4) = 32\]  
\[5a + 12 = 32\]  
\[5a = 20\]  
\[a = 4\]  
Thus, Ramanujan’s number is \(4 - 4i\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the product of Hardy’s number (\(5 + 3i\)) and Ramanujan’s number (\(4 - 4i\)) equals \(32 - 8i\).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the product \((5 + 3i)(4 - 4i)\) and check if it matches \(32 - 8i\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute:  
\[(5 + 3i)(4 - 4i) = 5 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot (-4i) + 3i \cdot 4 + 3i \cdot (-4i)\]  
\[= 20 - 20i + 12i - 12i^2\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), \(-12i^2 = 12\), so:  
\[20 + 12 - 20i + 12i = 32 - 8i\]  
The product matches \(32 - 8i\), confirming the solution is correct.
