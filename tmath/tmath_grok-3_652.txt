### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, where arrangements are considered the same if one can be obtained from another by rotation or reflection.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Understand the bracelet as a circular arrangement where rotations are equivalent.  
2. Account for reflections, as the bracelet can be flipped.  
3. Use a mathematical approach (e.g., Burnside’s lemma) to count distinct arrangements under these symmetries.  
4. Compute the number of distinct arrangements for 6 distinct beads.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the bracelet as a circular arrangement and account for rotations. We will calculate the number of arrangements without considering symmetries first, then adjust for rotations using group theory or combinatorial methods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A bracelet with 6 beads can be modeled as a circular arrangement of 6 distinct beads. Without symmetries, the number of ways to arrange 6 distinct beads in a circle, accounting for rotations, is given by \((n-1)!\) for \(n\) distinct objects in a circular permutation. For 6 beads:  
\[
(6-1)! = 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]  
This accounts for rotations by fixing one bead and arranging the remaining 5, as rotations of a circular arrangement are considered the same.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The previous step accounted for rotations but not reflections. Adjust the subgoal to incorporate reflections, as the bracelet can be flipped, which may further reduce the number of distinct arrangements. Use Burnside’s lemma to handle both rotations and reflections systematically.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use Burnside’s lemma to count distinct arrangements under the symmetries of rotations and reflections for a bracelet with 6 distinct beads. We will identify the symmetry group (dihedral group \(D_6\)) and compute the number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To count distinct arrangements, we apply Burnside’s lemma, which states that the number of distinct arrangements under a group of symmetries is the average number of arrangements fixed by each group element. The symmetry group for a bracelet with 6 beads is the dihedral group \(D_6\), which has \(2 \times 6 = 12\) elements: 6 rotations and 6 reflections.

#### Step 1: Total arrangements without symmetries
For 6 distinct beads, the number of linear arrangements is \(6! = 720\). We need to compute the number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry in \(D_6\).

#### Step 2: Rotations
The rotations correspond to the cyclic group \(C_6\), with 6 elements (rotations by \(0^\circ, 60^\circ, 120^\circ, 180^\circ, 240^\circ, 300^\circ\)). For a rotation by \(k\) positions, the cycle structure of the permutation determines the number of fixed arrangements. The number of fixed arrangements for a permutation is \(n_c!\), where \(n_c\) is the number of cycles in the permutation.

- **Identity (0° rotation)**: 6 cycles of length 1 (each bead maps to itself). Fixed arrangements: \(6! = 720\).
- **60° rotation (1 position)**: One cycle of length 6. An arrangement is fixed if all beads are the same, but since beads are distinct, no arrangements are fixed: \(0! = 0\).
- **120° rotation (2 positions)**: Three cycles of length 2 (pairing beads opposite each other). No arrangements are fixed since beads are distinct: \(0! = 0\).
- **180° rotation (3 positions)**: Two cycles of length 3. No arrangements are fixed: \(0! = 0\).
- **240° rotation (4 positions)**: Same cycle structure as 120° (three cycles of length 2): \(0! = 0\).
- **300° rotation (5 positions)**: Same as 60° (one cycle of length 6): \(0! = 0\).

Total fixed arrangements for rotations: \(720 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 720\).

#### Step 3: Reflections
There are 6 reflections in \(D_6\). For a regular hexagon, reflections are of two types:
- **Reflections through opposite vertices (3 reflections)**: Each passes through two vertices and swaps the other four beads in two pairs. Cycle structure: 2 cycles of length 1 (fixed vertices) and 2 cycles of length 2 (swapped pairs). Fixed arrangements require the two fixed beads to be the same (not possible since beads are distinct) and the two pairs to be identical: \(0! = 0\).
- **Reflections through midpoints of opposite edges (3 reflections)**: Each passes through the midpoints of two opposite edges, swapping three pairs of beads. Cycle structure: 3 cycles of length 2. No arrangements are fixed since beads are distinct: \(0! = 0\).

Total fixed arrangements for reflections: \(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\).

#### Step 4: Apply Burnside’s lemma
The number of distinct arrangements is the average of fixed arrangements over all 12 symmetries:
\[
\frac{720 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{12} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Thus, there are 60 distinct arrangements when considering both rotations and reflections.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the application of Burnside’s lemma and ensuring all symmetries were considered correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, we confirm the symmetry group \(D_6\) has 12 elements (6 rotations, 6 reflections). We recheck the cycle structures:
- Rotations: Only the identity fixes any arrangements (720), as expected, since distinct beads prevent fixed arrangements under non-trivial rotations.
- Reflections: All reflections involve cycles of length 2 or fixed points, and since beads are distinct, no arrangements are fixed.
The calculation \(720 / 12 = 60\) is consistent. As a cross-check, for circular arrangements without reflections, we had \(5! = 120\). Dividing by 2 for reflections (since reflections halve the number of distinct arrangements in a dihedral group for even \(n\)) gives \(120 / 2 = 60\), confirming the result.
