**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250 (exclusive).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the range of numbers (50 to 250, exclusive).  
2. Define what a perfect square is.  
3. Find the smallest perfect square greater than 50.  
4. Find the largest perfect square less than 250.  
5. Calculate the number of perfect squares within this range.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define a perfect square and identify the range. A perfect square is an integer \( n \) such that \( n = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). The range is numbers greater than 50 and less than 250.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A perfect square is the square of an integer (e.g., \( 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9 \), etc.). The problem specifies "between 50 and 250," which means \( 50 < n < 250 \), excluding 50 and 250 themselves.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the smallest perfect square greater than 50. This requires finding the smallest integer \( k \) such that \( k^2 > 50 \), then computing \( k^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the smallest perfect square greater than 50:  
- Compute \( \sqrt{50} \approx 7.071 \).  
- The smallest integer \( k \) greater than \( \sqrt{50} \) is \( k = 8 \), since \( 7^2 = 49 \leq 50 \).  
- Thus, \( 8^2 = 64 \), which is the smallest perfect square greater than 50.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the largest perfect square less than 250. This requires finding the largest integer \( k \) such that \( k^2 < 250 \), then computing \( k^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the largest perfect square less than 250:  
- Compute \( \sqrt{250} \approx 15.811 \).  
- The largest integer \( k \) less than or equal to \( \sqrt{250} \) is \( k = 15 \), since \( 16^2 = 256 > 250 \).  
- Thus, \( 15^2 = 225 \), which is the largest perfect square less than 250.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Count perfect squares between 50 and 250.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the range (50 < n < 250) — completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Define perfect square (\( n = k^2 \)) — completed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Find smallest perfect square (\( 8^2 = 64 \)) — completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Find largest perfect square (\( 15^2 = 225 \)) — completed.  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate number of perfect squares — current goal.  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250. This involves counting integers \( k \) from 8 to 15 (since \( 8^2 = 64 \) and \( 15^2 = 225 \)) and determining the count of perfect squares in this range.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The perfect squares are \( k^2 \) for integers \( k \) from 8 to 15:  
- \( k = 8 \): \( 8^2 = 64 \)  
- \( k = 9 \): \( 9^2 = 81 \)  
- \( k = 10 \): \( 10^2 = 100 \)  
- \( k = 11 \): \( 11^2 = 121 \)  
- \( k = 12 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)  
- \( k = 13 \): \( 13^2 = 169 \)  
- \( k = 14 \): \( 14^2 = 196 \)  
- \( k = 15 \): \( 15^2 = 225 \)  
Count the integers from 8 to 15 inclusive: \( 15 - 8 + 1 = 8 \).  
Thus, there are 8 perfect squares.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the count of perfect squares. Verify that all perfect squares from \( k = 8 \) to \( k = 15 \) are within the range \( 50 < k^2 < 250 \), and confirm no other \( k \) values produce valid perfect squares.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Check range:  
  - \( 8^2 = 64 > 50 \), \( 64 < 250 \).  
  - \( 15^2 = 225 < 250 \), \( 225 > 50 \).  
  - All squares from \( k = 8 \) to \( k = 15 \) (i.e., 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225) satisfy \( 50 < k^2 < 250 \).  
- Check boundaries:  
  - \( 7^2 = 49 \leq 50 \), not valid.  
  - \( 16^2 = 256 \geq 250 \), not valid.  
- Count confirmation: The sequence \( k = 8, 9, \ldots, 15 \) has \( 15 - 8 + 1 = 8 \) terms.  
The count of 8 perfect squares is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
There are 8 perfect squares between 50 and 250.
