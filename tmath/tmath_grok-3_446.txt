**Problem Restatement**: Find the distance between the points $(-5, -2)$ and $(7, 3)$ in the Cartesian plane.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the distance between two points, break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.
2. Recall the distance formula for two points in the Cartesian plane.
3. Apply the distance formula using the coordinates.
4. Simplify the expression to find the final distance.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the coordinates of the two points.
How to Achieve: Extract the coordinates directly from the problem statement.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The coordinates of the points are $(-5, -2)$ and $(7, 3)$.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve the distance formula for two points in the Cartesian plane, which is foundational for computing the distance between $(-5, -2)$ and $(7, 3)$.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The distance formula for two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by the differences in x- and y-coordinates.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the distance formula using the coordinates $(-5, -2)$ and $(7, 3)$.
How to Achieve: Substitute the coordinates into the distance formula and compute the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let $(x_1, y_1) = (-5, -2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (7, 3)$. Using the distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(7 - (-5))^2 + (3 - (-2))^2}
\]
Calculate the differences:
\[
x_2 - x_1 = 7 - (-5) = 12, \quad y_2 - y_1 = 3 - (-2) = 5
\]
Square the differences:
\[
12^2 = 144, \quad 5^2 = 25
\]
Sum the squares:
\[
144 + 25 = 169
\]
Take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{169} = 13
\]
The distance is 13 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed distance.
How to Achieve: Recalculate the differences and check the arithmetic steps to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck the differences:
\[
x_2 - x_1 = 7 - (-5) = 12, \quad y_2 - y_1 = 3 - (-2) = 5
\]
Recalculate:
\[
12^2 = 144, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad 144 + 25 = 169, \quad \sqrt{169} = 13
\]
The calculations are consistent, confirming the distance is 13 units.
[/IMP]
