**Problem Statement**: Find the distance between the points \((-5, -2)\) and \((7, 3)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the distance between two points, break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points.
2. Apply the distance formula: For points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), the distance is \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).
3. Compute the differences in x and y coordinates.
4. Square the differences, sum them, and take the square root.
5. Simplify the result to obtain the final distance.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the coordinates of the two points.
How to Achieve: Extract the given points from the problem statement.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The given points are \((-5, -2)\) and \((7, 3)\). Thus, the coordinates are:
- Point 1: \((x_1, y_1) = (-5, -2)\)
- Point 2: \((x_2, y_2) = (7, 3)\)
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the differences in x and y coordinates.
How to Achieve: Subtract the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the differences:
- \(x_2 - x_1 = 7 - (-5) = 7 + 5 = 12\)
- \(y_2 - y_1 = 3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5\)
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Square the differences, sum them, and apply the distance formula.
How to Achieve: Square the x and y differences, add them, and take the square root.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Square the differences:
  - \((x_2 - x_1)^2 = 12^2 = 144\)
  - \((y_2 - y_1)^2 = 5^2 = 25\)
- Sum the squares:
  - \(144 + 25 = 169\)
- Apply the distance formula:
  - Distance = \(\sqrt{169} = 13\)
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the distance calculation.
How to Achieve: Recalculate the differences and apply the distance formula to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
- Differences: \(x_2 - x_1 = 7 - (-5) = 12\), \(y_2 - y_1 = 3 - (-2) = 5\)
- Squares: \(12^2 = 144\), \(5^2 = 25\)
- Sum: \(144 + 25 = 169\)
- Square root: \(\sqrt{169} = 13\)
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming the distance is 13.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the distance between points \((-5, -2)\) and \((7, 3)\).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the coordinates (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the differences in x and y coordinates (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the distance formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (completed).
Current Goal: Completed, as all subgoals are achieved.
The final distance is 13.
