**Problem Restatement**: Given the operation defined by \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \), compute \( 3 * 2 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( 3 * 2 \) using the given operation \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \). To achieve this, substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \) into the formula and perform the arithmetic operations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \) into the operation:  
\[ 3 * 2 = 3^2 + (3 \cdot 2) - 2^2 \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \)  
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)  
Combine:  
\[ 9 + 6 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \]  
Thus, \( 3 * 2 = 11 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( 3 * 2 = 11 \). To achieve this, recheck the substitution and arithmetic steps to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
\[ 3 * 2 = 3^2 + (3 \cdot 2) - 2^2 \]  
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \)  
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)  
\[ 9 + 6 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \]  
The result matches the previous computation, confirming \( 3 * 2 = 11 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-management system:  
- Main goal: Compute \( 3 * 2 \) using the operation \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \).  
  - Subgoal: Substitute \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \) into the formula and calculate (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Validate the computation to ensure correctness (completed).  
Current goal: No further computation is needed as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The result is \( 3 * 2 = 11 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( 3 * 2 = 11 \)
