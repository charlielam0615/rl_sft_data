**Problem Statement**: Given the operation defined by \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \), find the value of \( 3 * 2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Understand the given operation \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \).  
2. Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \) into the operation.  
3. Compute the result using the formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 3 * 2 \) using the operation \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \) into the formula and performing the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 2 \) into the operation:  
\[ 3 * 2 = 3^2 + (3)(2) - 2^2 \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( (3)(2) = 6 \)  
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)  
Combine:  
\[ 9 + 6 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \]  
So, \( 3 * 2 = 11 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \( 3 * 2 = 11 \) by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the formula \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \) with \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \):  
- \( a^2 = 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( ab = 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \)  
- \( b^2 = 2^2 = 4 \)  
- Combine: \( 9 + 6 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \).  
The calculation is consistent with the previous result, confirming \( 3 * 2 = 11 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( 3 * 2 \) using the operation \( a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the operation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \) and compute (completed, result: 11).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed, confirmed result: 11).  
**Current Goal**: The computation is complete, and the result \( 3 * 2 = 11 \) has been validated. No further subgoals are needed.

**Final Answer**: \( 3 * 2 = 11 \)
