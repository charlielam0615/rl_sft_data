Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert the fraction $-\frac{15}{4}$ to a decimal.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert $-\frac{15}{4}$ to a decimal, we perform the division $-15 \div 4$.

$-15 \div 4 = -3.75$

Thus, $-\frac{15}{4} = -3.75$.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The decimal value of $-\frac{15}{4}$ and its position on the number line.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the decimal value of $-\frac{15}{4}$: $-\frac{15}{4} = -3.75$. On the number line, this lies between the integers $-4$ and $-3$, closer to $-4$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the greatest integer less than $-3.75$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The greatest integer less than $-3.75$ is the largest integer to the left of $-3.75$ on the number line.  

The integers immediately around $-3.75$ are $-4$ and $-3$. Since $-3.75$ is closer to $-4$ than to $-3$, the greatest integer less than $-3.75$ is $-4$.

Scope of this verification: The entire solution process, including conversion to decimal, number line positioning, and integer comparison.

[VERIFY]
The solution involves three critical steps: (1) converting -15/4 to -3.75, (2) identifying the number line position between -4 and -3, and (3) selecting the greatest integer strictly less than -3.75. 

For step 1, the division calculation is straightforward: 15 รท 4 = 3.75, and the negative sign is preserved, so -15/4 = -3.75. This is mathematically sound.

For step 2, -3.75 lies between -4 and -3 on the number line. Since -3.75 is closer to -4 (difference of 0.25) than to -3 (difference of 0.75), the positioning is accurate.

For step 3, the key insight is understanding "greatest integer less than" in the context of negative numbers. While -3 is greater than -3.75, it is not less than -3.75. The next integer below -3.75 is -4, which satisfies the condition of being both an integer and strictly less than -3.75. This aligns with the mathematical definition of the floor function for negative non-integers.

No logical inconsistencies or calculation errors are detected in any step. The final conclusion directly follows from the premises.
