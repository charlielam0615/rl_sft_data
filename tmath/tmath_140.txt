Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Calculate the total value of the dimes.
2. Calculate the total value of the quarters.
3. Calculate the total value of all the money.
4. Determine what percent of the total value is in quarters.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total value of the dimes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each dime is worth $0.10, and there are 50 dimes.  
Total value of dimes = $ 50 \times 0.10 = 5.00 $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total value of the quarters.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each quarter is worth $0.25, and there are 20 quarters.  
Total value of quarters = $ 20 \times 0.25 = 5.00 $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total value of all the money.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total value of all the money is the sum of the value of the dimes and the value of the quarters.  
Total value = $ 5.00 + 5.00 = 10.00 $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine what percent of the total value is in quarters.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the percentage of the total value in quarters, divide the value of the quarters by the total value and multiply by 100:  
Percentage in quarters = $ \frac{5.00}{10.00} \times 100 = 50\% $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution (dime value calculation, quarter value calculation, total value calculation, percentage calculation).
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Dime value calculation: 50 dimes × $0.10/dime = $5.00 ✓  
2. Quarter value calculation: 20 quarters × $0.25/quarter = $5.00 ✓  
3. Total value calculation: $5.00 (dimes) + $5.00 (quarters) = $10.00 ✓  
4. Percentage calculation: ($5.00 ÷ $10.00) × 100 = 50% ✓  
All calculations are mathematically consistent and correctly applied. No logical errors detected in the reasoning chain.
