### Problem Statement

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the polynomial by distributing the constants and combining like terms.  
2. Identify the coefficients of the resulting polynomial.  
3. Sum the coefficients, including the constant term.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the polynomial by distributing the constants \(-2\), \(4\), and \(-3\) to their respective terms and combining like terms. This will be achieved by performing algebraic operations step-by-step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distribute the constants:  
- For \(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5)\):  
  \(-2 \cdot x^7 = -2x^7\), \(-2 \cdot (-x^4) = 2x^4\), \(-2 \cdot 3x^2 = -6x^2\), \(-2 \cdot (-5) = 10\).  
  Result: \(-2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10\).  

- For \(4(x^3 + 2x)\):  
  \(4 \cdot x^3 = 4x^3\), \(4 \cdot 2x = 8x\).  
  Result: \(4x^3 + 8x\).  

- For \(-3(x^5 - 4)\):  
  \(-3 \cdot x^5 = -3x^5\), \(-3 \cdot (-4) = 12\).  
  Result: \(-3x^5 + 12\).  

Combine all terms:  
\(-2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10 + 4x^3 + 8x - 3x^5 + 12\).  

Group like terms by degree:  
- \(x^7\): \(-2x^7\).  
- \(x^5\): \(-3x^5\).  
- \(x^4\): \(2x^4\).  
- \(x^3\): \(4x^3\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-6x^2\).  
- \(x^1\): \(8x\).  
- Constant: \(10 + 12 = 22\).  

Resulting polynomial: \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the simplified polynomial by checking the distribution and combination of terms for accuracy. This will be achieved by re-computing key steps or testing with a value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, substitute \(x = 1\) into the original expression and the simplified polynomial:  
- Original: \(-2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3 \cdot 1^2 - 5) + 4(1^3 + 2 \cdot 1) - 3(1^5 - 4)\).  
  \(-2(1 - 1 + 3 - 5) = -2(-2) = 4\).  
  \(4(1 + 2) = 4 \cdot 3 = 12\).  
  \(-3(1 - 4) = -3(-3) = 9\).  
  Total: \(4 + 12 + 9 = 25\).  

- Simplified: \(-2(1)^7 - 3(1)^5 + 2(1)^4 + 4(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 8(1) + 22\).  
  \(-2 - 3 + 2 + 4 - 6 + 8 + 22 = 25\).  

Both match, confirming the polynomial is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the polynomial (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the coefficients (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the coefficients (pending).  
**Current goal**: Identify the coefficients of the simplified polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The simplified polynomial is \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\). The next step is to extract the coefficients for all terms, including the constant.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coefficients of the simplified polynomial \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\). This will be achieved by listing the coefficient of each term, including the constant.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Coefficients:  
- \(x^7\): \(-2\).  
- \(x^5\): \(-3\).  
- \(x^4\): \(2\).  
- \(x^3\): \(4\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-6\).  
- \(x^1\): \(8\).  
- Constant: \(22\).  

List of coefficients: \(-2, -3, 2, 4, -6, 8, 22\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the coefficients \(-2, -3, 2, 4, -6, 8, 22\). This will be achieved by adding them together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sum: \(-2 + (-3) + 2 + 4 + (-6) + 8 + 22\).  
Step-by-step:  
\(-2 - 3 = -5\).  
\(-5 + 2 = -3\).  
\(-3 + 4 = 1\).  
\(1 - 6 = -5\).  
\(-5 + 8 = 3\).  
\(3 + 22 = 25\).  

Sum of coefficients: \(25\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the sum of the coefficients. This will be achieved by using the polynomial evaluation at \(x = 1\), as the sum of coefficients equals \(p(1)\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For polynomial \(p(x) = -2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\), evaluate at \(x = 1\):  
\(p(1) = -2(1)^7 - 3(1)^5 + 2(1)^4 + 4(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 8(1) + 22 = 25\).  
This matches the sum \(25\), validating the result.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of the coefficients of the polynomial is \(25\).
