**Problem Statement**: Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial \(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)\).

To solve this, I will follow the meta-cognitive action set framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the polynomial by distributing and combining like terms to obtain the standard form.  
2. Identify the coefficients of the resulting polynomial.  
3. Sum the coefficients, including the constant term.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the polynomial \(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)\). This will be achieved by distributing each term, collecting like terms, and writing the polynomial in standard form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute each term:  
- First term: \(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) = -2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10\).  
- Second term: \(4(x^3 + 2x) = 4x^3 + 8x\).  
- Third term: \(-3(x^5 - 4) = -3x^5 + 12\).  

Combine all terms:  
\(-2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10 + 4x^3 + 8x - 3x^5 + 12\).  

Group like terms by degree:  
- \(x^7\): \(-2x^7\).  
- \(x^5\): \(-3x^5\).  
- \(x^4\): \(2x^4\).  
- \(x^3\): \(4x^3\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-6x^2\).  
- \(x\): \(8x\).  
- Constant: \(10 + 12 = 22\).  

The simplified polynomial is:  
\(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the simplified polynomial \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\). This will be achieved by checking the distribution and combination of terms against the original expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the distribution:  
- \(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) = -2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10\).  
- \(4(x^3 + 2x) = 4x^3 + 8x\).  
- \(-3(x^5 - 4) = -3x^5 + 12\).  

Combine again:  
Terms: \(-2x^7\), \(2x^4\), \(-6x^2\), \(10\), \(4x^3\), \(8x\), \(-3x^5\), \(12\).  
By degree:  
- \(x^7\): \(-2x^7\).  
- \(x^5\): \(-3x^5\).  
- \(x^4\): \(2x^4\).  
- \(x^3\): \(4x^3\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-6x^2\).  
- \(x\): \(8x\).  
- Constant: \(10 + 12 = 22\).  

The polynomial matches: \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\). The simplification is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the polynomial (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the coefficients (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the coefficients (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficients of the simplified polynomial.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coefficients of the simplified polynomial \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\). This will be achieved by listing the coefficient of each term, including the constant term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The simplified polynomial is: \(-2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\).  
Coefficients (including the coefficient of \(x^0\)):  
- \(x^7\): \(-2\).  
- \(x^5\): \(-3\).  
- \(x^4\): \(2\).  
- \(x^3\): \(4\).  
- \(x^2\): \(-6\).  
- \(x\): \(8\).  
- Constant (\(x^0\)): \(22\).  

List of coefficients: \(-2, -3, 2, 4, -6, 8, 22\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the coefficients \(-2, -3, 2, 4, -6, 8, 22\). This will be achieved by adding them together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the coefficients:  
\(-2 + (-3) + 2 + 4 + (-6) + 8 + 22\).  
Step-by-step:  
- \(-2 - 3 = -5\).  
- \(-5 + 2 = -3\).  
- \(-3 + 4 = 1\).  
- \(1 - 6 = -5\).  
- \(-5 + 8 = 3\).  
- \(3 + 22 = 25\).  

The sum of the coefficients is \(25\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the sum of the coefficients (\(25\)) by evaluating the polynomial at \(x = 1\), as the sum of coefficients of a polynomial \(p(x)\) equals \(p(1)\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Evaluate the polynomial \(p(x) = -2x^7 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x + 22\) at \(x = 1\):  
\(p(1) = -2(1)^7 - 3(1)^5 + 2(1)^4 + 4(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 8(1) + 22\).  
Compute:  
- \(-2(1) = -2\).  
- \(-3(1) = -3\).  
- \(2(1) = 2\).  
- \(4(1) = 4\).  
- \(-6(1) = -6\).  
- \(8(1) = 8\).  
- Constant: \(22\).  

Sum: \(-2 - 3 + 2 + 4 - 6 + 8 + 22 = 25\).  
This matches the sum of coefficients (\(25\)), confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the polynomial (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the coefficients (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the coefficients (completed).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all goals are completed. The sum of the coefficients is \(25\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The sum of the coefficients in the polynomial is \(25\).  
\[ \boxed{25} \]
