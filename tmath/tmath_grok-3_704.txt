### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of distinct four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits of the number 1150 (i.e., using the digits 1, 1, 5, 0) such that each resulting number is a multiple of 5.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Identify the constraints for a four-digit number to be a multiple of 5.  
2. Determine the available digits and their frequencies.  
3. Calculate the number of distinct arrangements of these digits.  
4. Account for constraints such as leading zeros and the multiple-of-5 condition.  
5. Compute the final count of valid arrangements.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the constraints for a four-digit number to be a multiple of 5.  
- **How to Achieve**: A number is a multiple of 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we are forming four-digit numbers using the digits 1, 1, 5, 0, we need to consider cases where the last digit is either 0 or 5.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To be a multiple of 5, a four-digit number must end in 0 or 5. Given the digits 1, 1, 5, 0, we can form numbers ending in 0 or 5, as both are available. We will handle these cases separately in subsequent steps.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the available digits and their frequencies.  
- **How to Achieve**: List the digits provided by the number 1150 and count how many times each digit appears.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number 1150 provides the digits: 1, 1, 5, 0.  
- Digit 1 appears 2 times.  
- Digit 5 appears 1 time.  
- Digit 0 appears 1 time.  
Each four-digit number will use all four digits: two 1's, one 5, and one 0.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to focus on calculating the number of valid arrangements:  
1. Compute arrangements where the last digit is 0, ensuring the number is four-digit (i.e., no leading zero).  
2. Compute arrangements where the last digit is 5, ensuring the number is four-digit.  
3. Sum the valid arrangements from both cases to get the total number of ways.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the number of four-digit arrangements where the last digit is 0, ensuring no leading zero.  
- **How to Achieve**: Fix the last digit as 0, arrange the remaining digits (1, 1, 5) in the first three positions, and exclude cases where the first digit is 0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Fix the last digit as 0**: The number is of the form _ _ _ 0, using digits 1, 1, 5 for the first three positions.  
- **Arrange the digits 1, 1, 5**: The number of distinct permutations of three digits {1, 1, 5} is calculated as:  
  \[
  \frac{3!}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
  \]
  (Divide by 2! for the two identical 1's.)  
- **Check for leading zeros**: Since the digits for the first three positions are 1, 1, 5, the first digit cannot be 0. Thus, all arrangements are valid four-digit numbers.  
- **Result**: There are 3 valid arrangements when the last digit is 0.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the number of four-digit arrangements where the last digit is 5, ensuring no leading zero.  
- **How to Achieve**: Fix the last digit as 5, arrange the remaining digits (1, 1, 0) in the first three positions, and exclude cases where the first digit is 0.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Fix the last digit as 5**: The number is of the form _ _ _ 5, using digits 1, 1, 0 for the first three positions.  
- **Arrange the digits 1, 1, 0**: The number of distinct permutations of three digits {1, 1, 0} is:  
  \[
  \frac{3!}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
  \]
  (Divide by 2! for the two identical 1's.)  
- **Check for leading zeros**: The first digit must not be 0. List the arrangements of {1, 1, 0}:  
  - 1 1 0 (first digit is 1, valid)  
  - 1 0 1 (first digit is 1, valid)  
  - 0 1 1 (first digit is 0, invalid)  
  Out of 3 arrangements, 2 are valid (first digit is 1).  
- **Result**: There are 2 valid arrangements when the last digit is 5.
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of distinct four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits of 1150 (1, 1, 5, 0) such that the number is a multiple of 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify constraints for a multiple of 5 (completed: last digit must be 0 or 5).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine available digits and their frequencies (completed: 1 appears twice, 5 once, 0 once).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute arrangements where the last digit is 0, ensuring no leading zero (completed: 3 ways).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute arrangements where the last digit is 5, ensuring no leading zero (completed: 2 ways).  
  - Subgoal 5: Sum the valid arrangements to get the total number of ways (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Sum the valid arrangements from both cases to get the total number of ways.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Sum the valid arrangements from both cases to get the total number of ways.  
- **How to Achieve**: Add the number of valid arrangements where the last digit is 0 and where the last digit is 5.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Arrangements with last digit 0: 3 ways.  
- Arrangements with last digit 5: 2 ways.  
- Total number of valid four-digit numbers:  
  \[
  3 + 2 = 5
  \]

**Final Answer**: There are 5 ways to arrange the digits of 1150 to form a four-digit multiple of 5.
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: List all possible four-digit numbers formed by arranging 1, 1, 5, 0, check which are multiples of 5, and confirm the count matches the computed result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **List all possible arrangements**: Consider all distinct permutations of {1, 1, 5, 0}, accounting for the two identical 1's. Total permutations:  
  \[
  \frac{4!}{2!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
  \]
  However, we only need those ending in 0 or 5 and without leading zeros.  
- **Case 1: Last digit is 0** (from Step 5): Arrangements of {1, 1, 5} in the first three positions:  
  - 1 1 5 0 → 1150  
  - 1 5 1 0 → 1510  
  - 5 1 1 0 → 5110  
  All are four-digit, end in 0 (multiple of 5), count = 3.  
- **Case 2: Last digit is 5** (from Step 6): Arrangements of {1, 1, 0} in the first three positions:  
  - 1 1 0 5 → 1105  
  - 1 0 1 5 → 1015  
  - 0 1 1 5 → 0115 (invalid, not four-digit)  
  Valid numbers: 1105, 1015, count = 2.  
- **Total**: 3 + 2 = 5 numbers.  
- **Verify**: All listed numbers (1150, 1510, 5110, 1105, 1015) are divisible by 5 and distinct. The count matches the result from Step 8.  
The solution is correct.
