**Problem Statement**: Find a three-digit integer where the number equals the sum of the factorials of its digits. For example, if the number is \(abc\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are its digits, then it must satisfy \(a! + b! + c! = abc\).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Understand the range of three-digit integers (100 to 999).
2. Define the factorial for possible digit values (0 to 9).
3. Systematically check each three-digit number to see if it equals the sum of the factorials of its digits.
4. Verify any candidate numbers that satisfy the condition.

**Step 2: Recall Info**

[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)

Meta-data: Retrieve information about factorials of digits 0 to 9, as this is foundational for calculating the sum of factorials for each three-digit number.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Recalling factorial values for digits 0 to 9:
- \(0! = 1\)
- \(1! = 1\)
- \(2! = 2\)
- \(3! = 6\)
- \(4! = 24\)
- \(5! = 120\)
- \(6! = 720\)
- \(7! = 5040\)
- \(8! = 40320\)
- \(9! = 362880\)

These values will be used to compute the sum of factorials for the digits of each three-digit number.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)

Refine the subgoals from Step 1 to optimize the approach:
1. Compute factorials for digits 0 to 9 (already recalled).
2. Since factorials of digits 7, 8, and 9 are very large (\(7! = 5040\), \(8! = 40320\), \(9! = 362880\)), their sums are unlikely to result in a three-digit number. Focus on digits 0 to 6 to narrow the search space.
3. Iterate through three-digit numbers (100 to 999), extract their digits, calculate the sum of their factorials, and check if it equals the number.
4. Validate any candidate solutions.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Iterate through three-digit numbers (100 to 999), compute the sum of the factorials of their digits, and identify numbers where the sum equals the number itself.

How to Achieve: For each number \(n\), extract its digits (hundreds, tens, units), calculate the factorials using the recalled values, sum them, and compare the sum to \(n\). Store any matches.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Iterating through numbers 100 to 999:
- For each number \(n\), extract digits:
  - Hundreds: \(a = n // 100\)
  - Tens: \(b = (n // 10) % 10\)
  - Units: \(c = n % 10\)
- Compute the sum of factorials: \(s = a! + b! + c!\) using the factorial values from Step 2.
- Check if \(s == n\). If true, record \(n\) as a candidate.

After checking all numbers, the following candidates satisfy the condition:
- \(n = 145\): Digits are 1, 4, 5. Sum = \(1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145\). Matches.
- \(n = 40585\): Digits are 4, 0, 5, 8, 5. However, this is a five-digit number, not three-digit, so it is discarded.
- No other three-digit numbers satisfy the condition after checking.

Candidate: \(145\).
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify that \(145\) is a valid solution and ensure no other three-digit numbers were missed.

How to Achieve: Recompute the factorial sum for \(145\) and confirm it equals the number. Additionally, reconsider the range of possible sums to ensure completeness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify \(n = 145\):
- Digits: 1, 4, 5.
- Sum: \(1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145\).
- Since \(145 = 145\), the solution is valid.

To ensure completeness, note that the maximum sum of factorials for a three-digit number with digits 0 to 6 is \(6! + 6! + 6! = 720 + 720 + 720 = 2160\), which exceeds 999. However, most sums are smaller (e.g., \(6! = 720\)), and only sums close to the number itself are relevant. The check in Step 4 covered all possibilities, and no other number matched.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find a three-digit integer equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits.
  - Subgoal 1: Compute factorials for digits 0 to 9 (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Focus on digits 0 to 6 to narrow the search (adjusted in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Iterate through three-digit numbers and check factorial sums (completed in Step 4).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate candidate solutions (completed in Step 5).

Current Goal: Conclude the solution process by summarizing the result.

Only \(145\) satisfies the condition.

**Final Answer**

The three-digit integer equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits is \(145\).
