### Problem Statement
We need to find the coordinates of the other endpoint of a diameter of circle \( O \), given that the center of the circle is at \( (2, 3) \) and one endpoint of the diameter is at \( (-1, -1) \). The answer should be expressed as an ordered pair.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the geometric relationship: The center of the circle lies at the midpoint of the diameter.  
2. Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the other endpoint, given the center and one endpoint.  
3. Compute the coordinates of the other endpoint.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the other endpoint.  
- **How to Achieve:** The center \( (2, 3) \) is the midpoint of the diameter with endpoints \( (-1, -1) \) and the unknown endpoint \( (x, y) \). Apply the midpoint formula:  
  \[
  \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) = (2, 3)
  \]
  where \( (x_1, y_1) = (-1, -1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (x, y) \). Solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

[IMP]  
Let the coordinates of the other endpoint be \( (x, y) \). Since the center \( (2, 3) \) is the midpoint of \( (-1, -1) \) and \( (x, y) \), use the midpoint formula:

\[
\frac{-1 + x}{2} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{-1 + y}{2} = 3
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
-1 + x = 4 \implies x = 5
\]

Solve for \( y \):

\[
-1 + y = 6 \implies y = 7
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the other endpoint are \( (5, 7) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that \( (5, 7) \) is the correct endpoint by checking if the center \( (2, 3) \) is the midpoint of \( (-1, -1) \) and \( (5, 7) \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute the midpoint of \( (-1, -1) \) and \( (5, 7) \) using the midpoint formula and confirm it equals \( (2, 3) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the midpoint of \( (-1, -1) \) and \( (5, 7) \):

\[
x_{\text{mid}} = \frac{-1 + 5}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

\[
y_{\text{mid}} = \frac{-1 + 7}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

The midpoint is \( (2, 3) \), which matches the center of the circle. This confirms that \( (5, 7) \) is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals:  
- Main Goal: Find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the geometric relationship (center as midpoint).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the midpoint formula to compute the endpoint.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution.  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the solution and finalize the answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy shows that all subgoals have been addressed:  
- Subgoal 1 was addressed in Step 1 by recognizing the center as the midpoint.  
- Subgoal 2 was completed in Step 2, yielding \( (5, 7) \).  
- Subgoal 3 was completed in Step 3, confirming the midpoint.  
The main goal is achieved, and the coordinates of the other endpoint are \( (5, 7) \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter are \( (5, 7) \).
