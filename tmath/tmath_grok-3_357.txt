**Problem Statement**: Given a circle with center at (2, 3) and one endpoint of a diameter at (-1, -1), find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter. Express the answer as an ordered pair.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other endpoint of the diameter, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the geometric property of a diameter and its relationship to the center.  
2. Use the coordinates of the center and one endpoint to find the other endpoint.  
3. Derive the coordinates mathematically.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter. Since the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter, use the midpoint formula with the given center (2, 3) and one endpoint (-1, -1) to calculate the coordinates of the other endpoint.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The center of the circle, (2, 3), is the midpoint of the diameter with endpoints (-1, -1) and the unknown endpoint (x, y). The midpoint formula for points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:  

\[
\left( \frac{x₁ + x₂}{2}, \frac{y₁ + y₂}{2} \right) = (2, 3)
\]

Given one endpoint (x₁, y₁) = (-1, -1) and the midpoint (2, 3), set up equations:  

For the x-coordinate:  
\[
\frac{-1 + x}{2} = 2
\]  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
\[
-1 + x = 4
\]  
Solve for x:  
\[
x = 5
\]

For the y-coordinate:  
\[
\frac{-1 + y}{2} = 3
\]  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
\[
-1 + y = 6
\]  
Solve for y:  
\[
y = 7
\]

Thus, the other endpoint is (5, 7).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that (5, 7) is the correct endpoint by checking if the midpoint of the diameter with endpoints (-1, -1) and (5, 7) is indeed (2, 3).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, compute the midpoint of the segment with endpoints (-1, -1) and (5, 7):  

\[
x_{\text{mid}} = \frac{-1 + 5}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]  
\[
y_{\text{mid}} = \frac{-1 + 7}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

The midpoint is (2, 3), which matches the given center. This confirms the coordinates (5, 7) are correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the geometric property of a diameter (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the midpoint formula to find the other endpoint (completed, result: (5, 7)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, midpoint matches center).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and the solution is validated.  
The coordinates of the other endpoint are (5, 7).

**Final Answer**: (5, 7)
