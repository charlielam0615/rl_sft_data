### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that at least one of two fair 6-sided dice shows a 1 when rolled.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.  
2. Calculate the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 1.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.  
- **How to Achieve**: Each die has 6 faces, and the rolls are independent. Multiply the number of outcomes for each die (6 × 6).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes is:  
6 × 6 = 36.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 1.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the complement rule: Compute the probability that neither die shows a 1, then subtract from 1. Alternatively, directly count outcomes where at least one die is a 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
It’s easier to calculate the complement (neither die shows a 1):  
- Each die has 5 outcomes that are not 1 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
- Outcomes where neither die is a 1: 5 × 5 = 25.  
- Outcomes where at least one die is a 1: Total outcomes minus outcomes with no 1s = 36 − 25 = 11.  
Alternatively, count directly:  
- First die is 1, second die is any of 6: 1 × 6 = 6 outcomes.  
- First die is not 1, second die is 1: 5 × 1 = 5 outcomes.  
- Total favorable outcomes: 6 + 5 = 11.  
Both methods confirm 11 favorable outcomes.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
- **How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (11) by the total outcomes (36).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 11 / 36.  
The probability that at least one die shows a 1 is 11/36.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the calculated probability.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the complement rule to confirm the result. Calculate the probability that neither die shows a 1 and subtract from 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Probability neither die is a 1:  
- Each die has 5 non-1 outcomes, so probability per die = 5/6.  
- For both dice: (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36.  
- Probability of at least one 1: 1 − 25/36 = 11/36.  
This matches the previous result, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that at least one die shows a 1.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total outcomes (completed: 36 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate favorable outcomes (completed: 11 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute probability (completed: 11/36).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate result (completed: confirmed via complement rule).  
**Current Goal**: None (problem solved).  
The solution process is complete, with all subgoals addressed and validated.

### Final Answer
The probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 1 is **11/36**.
