### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that at least one of two fair 6-sided dice shows a 1 when rolled.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where at least one die shows a 1.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice.  
How to Achieve: Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent. Multiply the number of outcomes for each die (6 × 6).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Each die has 6 possible outcomes. For two dice, the total number of outcomes is:  
6 × 6 = 36.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where at least one die shows a 1.  
How to Achieve: It’s easier to calculate the complementary event (neither die shows a 1) and subtract from the total outcomes. For each die, the outcomes that are not 1 are {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For each die, there are 5 outcomes that are not a 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
For two dice, the number of outcomes where neither die is a 1 is:  
5 × 5 = 25.  
Thus, the number of outcomes where at least one die is a 1 is:  
36 − 25 = 11.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (11) by the total number of outcomes (36).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability is:  
11 / 36.  
This fraction is in its simplest form, as 11 is prime and shares no common factors with 36.  
[/IMP]

Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that at least one die shows a 1.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes (completed: 36 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (completed: 11 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability (completed: 11/36).  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 1 is **11/36**.
