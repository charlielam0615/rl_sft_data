Goal of this step: Identify $ b $ by halving the coefficient of $ x $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The coefficient of $ x $ in the quadratic $ x^2 + 1300x + 1300 $ is 1300. To find $ b $, we halve this coefficient:
$$
b = \frac{1300}{2} = 650
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $ b^2 $ and adjust the constant to find $ c $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have determined that $ b = 650 $. To complete the square, we calculate $ b^2 $:  
$$
b^2 = 650^2 = 422500
$$  
The original quadratic is $ x^2 + 1300x + 1300 $. In the completed square form $ (x + b)^2 + c $, the constant $ c $ is calculated as:  
$$
c = 1300 - b^2 = 1300 - 422500 = -421200
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Compute the value of $ \frac{c}{b} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have the values $ b = 650 $ and $ c = -421200 $. To find $ \frac{c}{b} $, we perform the division:  
$$
\frac{c}{b} = \frac{-421200}{650}
$$  
Simplify the fraction:  
$$
\frac{-421200}{650} = -648
$$  
Thus, $ \frac{c}{b} = -648 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of $b$ calculation**:  
   The coefficient of $x$ is 1300. Halving this gives $b = \frac{1300}{2} = 650$. This is correct as the formula for completing the square requires $b = \frac{\text{coefficient of }x}{2}$.

2. **Verification of $b^2$**:  
   $b = 650$, so $b^2 = 650^2$. Calculating:  
   $$
   650 \times 650 = (600 + 50)^2 = 600^2 + 2 \cdot 600 \cdot 50 + 50^2 = 360{,}000 + 60{,}000 + 2{,}500 = 422{,}500
   $$  
   This matches the computed value of $b^2 = 422{,}500$.

3. **Verification of $c$**:  
   The original constant term is 1300. After completing the square, $c = 1300 - b^2 = 1300 - 422{,}500 = -421{,}200$. This is correct because the completed square form subtracts $b^2$ to maintain equality.

4. **Verification of $\frac{c}{b}$**:  
   Substituting $c = -421{,}200$ and $b = 650$:  
   $$
   \frac{c}{b} = \frac{-421{,}200}{650} = -648
   $$  
   Simplifying via division:  
   $$
   421{,}200 \div 650 = 648 \quad \text{(since } 650 \times 648 = 421{,}200\text{)}
   $$  
   The negative sign is preserved, confirming $\frac{c}{b} = -648$.

All calculations are consistent and correct. No errors detected.
