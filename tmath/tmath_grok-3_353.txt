### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
2. Express the sum of four consecutive even integers in terms of a variable.  
3. Set up an equation equating the two sums.  
4. Solve for the variable to find the four consecutive even integers.  
5. Identify the largest of these four integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers. This can be achieved by listing the first 20 positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ..., 40) and summing them, or by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first 20 positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 40. This is an arithmetic sequence with:  
- First term \( a_1 = 2 \),  
- Common difference \( d = 2 \),  
- Number of terms \( n = 20 \).  

The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \). For the 20th term:  
\( a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40 \).  

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by:  
\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \).  
So, the sum is:  
\( S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420 \).  

Thus, the sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the sum of four consecutive even integers in terms of a variable and set up an equation equating it to 420. This can be achieved by defining the first of the four consecutive even integers as a variable, expressing the others in terms of it, and summing them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the first of the four consecutive even integers be \( n \), where \( n \) is even. The four consecutive even integers are:  
\( n, n+2, n+4, n+6 \).  

Their sum is:  
\( n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) = 4n + 12 \).  

Since this sum equals the sum of the first 20 positive even integers:  
\( 4n + 12 = 420 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 4n + 12 = 420 \) to find the four consecutive even integers. This can be achieved by isolating \( n \) and solving the linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\( 4n + 12 = 420 \).  
Subtract 12 from both sides:  
\( 4n = 408 \).  
Divide by 4:  
\( n = 102 \).  

The four consecutive even integers are:  
\( n = 102 \),  
\( n+2 = 104 \),  
\( n+4 = 106 \),  
\( n+6 = 108 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the sum of the four consecutive even integers (102, 104, 106, 108) equals 420. This can be achieved by calculating their sum and checking if it matches the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the sum of the four integers:  
\( 102 + 104 + 106 + 108 \).  
\( 102 + 104 = 206 \),  
\( 206 + 106 = 312 \),  
\( 312 + 108 = 420 \).  

The sum is 420, which matches the sum of the first 20 positive even integers. Thus, the solution is valid.
