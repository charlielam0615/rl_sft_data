**Problem Statement**: The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is equal to the sum of four consecutive even integers. We need to find the largest of these four consecutive even integers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
2. Express the sum of four consecutive even integers in terms of a variable.  
3. Set the two sums equal to form an equation.  
4. Solve the equation to find the four consecutive even integers.  
5. Identify the largest of the four integers.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
**How to Achieve**: The first 20 positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 40. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a_1 = 2\), common difference \(d = 2\), and number of terms \(n = 20\). Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The first 20 positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 40. The first term \(a_1 = 2\), the last term \(a_{20} = 40\), and the number of terms \(n = 20\).  
Using the sum formula:  
\[ S_{20} = \frac{20}{2}(2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420. \]  
The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the sum of four consecutive even integers in terms of a variable.  
**How to Achieve**: Represent the four consecutive even integers as \(n\), \(n+2\), \(n+4\), \(n+6\), where \(n\) is an even integer. Compute their sum as an expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the four consecutive even integers be \(n\), \(n+2\), \(n+4\), and \(n+6\). Their sum is:  
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) = 4n + 12. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set the two sums equal to form an equation and solve for \(n\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the sum from Step 2 (420) and the expression from Step 3 (\(4n + 12\)). Set them equal to form the equation \(4n + 12 = 420\) and solve for \(n\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the sum of the four consecutive even integers equal to the sum of the first 20 positive even integers:  
\[ 4n + 12 = 420. \]  
Solve for \(n\):  
\[ 4n = 420 - 12 = 408, \]  
\[ n = \frac{408}{4} = 102. \]  
The four consecutive even integers are:  
\[ 102, 104, 106, 108. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the sum of the four consecutive even integers equals 420.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the sum of 102, 104, 106, and 108, and check if it equals 420.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate the sum:  
\[ 102 + 104 + 106 + 108 = (102 + 108) + (104 + 106) = 210 + 210 = 420. \]  
The sum matches 420, confirming the solution is valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the largest of four consecutive even integers whose sum equals the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers (completed: sum = 420).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the sum of four consecutive even integers (completed: \(4n + 12\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set the sums equal and solve for \(n\) (completed: \(n = 102\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: sum of 102, 104, 106, 108 = 420).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify the largest integer (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest of the four consecutive even integers.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the largest of the four consecutive even integers.  
**How to Achieve**: From the solution in Step 4, the integers are 102, 104, 106, 108. Identify the largest among them.

[IMP]  
The four consecutive even integers are 102, 104, 106, and 108. The largest is 108.
