**Problem Statement**: Given the complex numbers \( A = 2 + i \), \( O = -4 \), \( P = -i \), and \( S = 2 + 4i \), compute the expression \( A - O + P + S \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( A - O + P + S \).  
- Subgoal 1: Express all terms in a consistent form (complex number form).  
- Subgoal 2: Perform the arithmetic operations step-by-step (subtraction and addition).  
- Subgoal 3: Simplify the result to the standard form \( a + bi \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express all terms in complex number form and perform the arithmetic operations.  
How to Achieve: Convert each term to the form \( a + bi \), then compute \( A - O + P + S \) by adding and subtracting the real and imaginary parts separately.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
- \( A = 2 + i = 2 + 1i \)  
- \( O = -4 = -4 + 0i \)  
- \( P = -i = 0 - 1i \)  
- \( S = 2 + 4i = 2 + 4i \)  

Compute \( A - O + P + S \):  
\[ A - O + P + S = (2 + 1i) - (-4 + 0i) + (0 - 1i) + (2 + 4i) \]  

Step-by-step:  
1. Compute \( A - O \):  
\[ (2 + 1i) - (-4 + 0i) = (2 - (-4)) + (1i - 0i) = 6 + 1i \]  

2. Add \( P \):  
\[ (6 + 1i) + (0 - 1i) = (6 + 0) + (1i - 1i) = 6 + 0i = 6 \]  

3. Add \( S \):  
\[ 6 + (2 + 4i) = (6 + 2) + (0i + 4i) = 8 + 4i \]  

Result: \( 8 + 4i \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computation.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the expression using an alternative approach (e.g., combine all terms directly) to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute \( A - O + P + S \):  
Combine real and imaginary parts directly:  
- Real parts: \( 2 - (-4) + 0 + 2 = 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8 \)  
- Imaginary parts: \( 1i - 0i - 1i + 4i = (1 - 0 - 1 + 4)i = 4i \)  

Result: \( 8 + 4i \).  
This matches the previous result, confirming correctness.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( A - O + P + S \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express all terms in complex number form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform arithmetic operations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the result to standard form (completed).  
  - Validation: Verify the computation (completed).  

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, final result obtained).  
Final result: \( 8 + 4i \).

**Final Answer**: \( 8 + 4i \)
