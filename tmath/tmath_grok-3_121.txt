**Problem Statement**: Given the complex numbers \( A = 2 + i \), \( O = -4 \), \( P = -i \), and \( S = 2 + 4i \), compute the expression \( A - O + P + S \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( A - O + P + S \):  
1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each term.  
2. Perform the arithmetic operations (subtraction and addition) on the real and imaginary parts separately.  
3. Combine the results to obtain the final complex number.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the real and imaginary parts of each term.  
How to Achieve: Express each term in the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- \( A = 2 + i \): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = 1.  
- \( O = -4 \): Real part = -4, Imaginary part = 0 (since \( -4 = -4 + 0i \)).  
- \( P = -i \): Real part = 0, Imaginary part = -1 (since \( -i = 0 - 1i \)).  
- \( S = 2 + 4i \): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = 4.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Perform the arithmetic operations on the real and imaginary parts.  
How to Achieve: Compute \( A - O + P + S \) by adding the real parts together and the imaginary parts together.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Express the operation:  
\( A - O + P + S = (2 + i) - (-4) + (0 - i) + (2 + 4i) \).  
Combine real and imaginary parts:  
- Real parts: \( 2 - (-4) + 0 + 2 = 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8 \).  
- Imaginary parts: \( 1 - 0 + (-1) + 4 = 1 - 1 + 4 = 4 \).  
Result: \( 8 + 4i \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the arithmetic operations.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the sum by grouping terms differently to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Alternative approach: Compute pairwise:  
- First, \( A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 2 + i + 4 = 6 + i \).  
- Then, \( (6 + i) + P = (6 + i) + (0 - i) = 6 + i - i = 6 \).  
- Finally, \( 6 + S = 6 + (2 + 4i) = 6 + 2 + 4i = 8 + 4i \).  
The result \( 8 + 4i \) matches the previous computation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( A - O + P + S \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify real and imaginary parts of each term (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform arithmetic operations on real and imaginary parts (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed).  
Current Goal: The computation is complete, with the result \( 8 + 4i \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( 8 + 4i \)
