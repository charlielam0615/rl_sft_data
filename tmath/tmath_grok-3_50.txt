### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( p^2 + q^2 \) given that \( pq = 9 \) and \( p + q = 6 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( p^2 + q^2 \) into intermediate subgoals. To compute \( p^2 + q^2 \), we can use the identity \( p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq \). Since we are given \( p + q = 6 \) and \( pq = 9 \), we can directly apply this identity to find the solution. The subgoals are:  
1. Recall the identity for \( p^2 + q^2 \).  
2. Substitute the given values into the identity.  
3. Compute the result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( p^2 + q^2 \) using the identity \( p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq \). We will achieve this by substituting \( p + q = 6 \) and \( pq = 9 \) into the identity and performing the calculation.

[IMP]  
Using the identity \( p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq \):  
- Given \( p + q = 6 \), compute \( (p + q)^2 = 6^2 = 36 \).  
- Given \( pq = 9 \), compute \( 2pq = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \).  
- Therefore, \( p^2 + q^2 = 36 - 18 = 18 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed value of \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \). We will achieve this by finding the values of \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfy \( pq = 9 \) and \( p + q = 6 \), computing \( p^2 + q^2 \) directly, and checking if the result matches our previous answer.

[IMP]  
To validate, solve for \( p \) and \( q \):  
- From \( p + q = 6 \), express \( q = 6 - p \).  
- Substitute into \( pq = 9 \): \( p(6 - p) = 9 \).  
- This gives \( 6p - p^2 = 9 \), or \( p^2 - 6p + 9 = 0 \).  
- Solve the quadratic equation: \( (p - 3)^2 = 0 \), so \( p = 3 \).  
- Then, \( q = 6 - p = 6 - 3 = 3 \).  
- Compute \( p^2 + q^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 = 18 \).  
The result matches our previous computation, confirming that \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( p^2 + q^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the identity \( p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( p + q = 6 \) and \( pq = 9 \) into the identity.  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the result.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result by solving for \( p \) and \( q \).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, as \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \) has been computed and validated.

### Final Answer
The value of \( p^2 + q^2 \) is \( 18 \).
