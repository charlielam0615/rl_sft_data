[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( p^2 + q^2 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given equations \( pq = 9 \) and \( p + q = 6 \) to find the values of \( p \) and \( q \).  
2. Compute \( p^2 + q^2 \) using the values of \( p \) and \( q \), or find an algebraic method to compute it directly.  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the values of \( p \) and \( q \) using the given equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Form a quadratic equation using \( p + q = 6 \) and \( pq = 9 \), solve for \( p \) and \( q \), and then compute \( p^2 + q^2 \). Alternatively, explore an algebraic identity to compute \( p^2 + q^2 \) directly.

[IMP]
Since \( p \) and \( q \) are roots of a quadratic equation, we can write the quadratic whose roots are \( p \) and \( q \). For a quadratic equation of the form \( x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = 0 \), substitute the known values:  
- \( p + q = 6 \)
- \( pq = 9 \)

Thus, the quadratic equation is:  
\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x - 3)^2 = 0 \]  
\[ x = 3 \]

This suggests \( p = 3 \) and \( q = 3 \). Let’s verify:  
- \( p + q = 3 + 3 = 6 \), which satisfies the given equation.  
- \( pq = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \), which also satisfies the given equation.

Now, compute \( p^2 + q^2 \):  
\[ p^2 + q^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 = 18 \]

Alternatively, use the algebraic identity for \( p^2 + q^2 \):  
\[ p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq \]  
Substitute \( p + q = 6 \) and \( pq = 9 \):  
\[ p^2 + q^2 = 6^2 - 2 \cdot 9 = 36 - 18 = 18 \]

Both methods yield \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the solution \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the computed values of \( p \) and \( q \) satisfy both given equations and confirm the calculation of \( p^2 + q^2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We found \( p = 3 \), \( q = 3 \):  
- Check \( p + q = 3 + 3 = 6 \), which matches.  
- Check \( pq = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \), which matches.  
- Compute \( p^2 + q^2 = 9 + 9 = 18 \), consistent with the algebraic method.

To ensure robustness, consider if other values of \( p \) and \( q \) are possible. The quadratic \( x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0 \) has a double root at \( x = 3 \), indicating \( p = q = 3 \) is the only solution. Alternatively, test the quadratic’s discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = (p + q)^2 - 4pq = 6^2 - 4 \cdot 9 = 36 - 36 = 0 \]  
A discriminant of 0 confirms a single real root, supporting \( p = q = 3 \).

The solution \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \) is consistent across methods.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Compute \( p^2 + q^2 \) given \( pq = 9 \) and \( p + q = 6 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find \( p \) and \( q \) using the given equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( p^2 + q^2 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Completed, as all subgoals have been addressed, and the solution \( p^2 + q^2 = 18 \) has been computed and verified.

### Final Answer
The value of \( p^2 + q^2 \) is \( 18 \).
