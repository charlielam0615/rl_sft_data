I am focusing on the initial step, which is to define the mathematical condition given in the problem.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Define the mathematical condition given in the problem.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The problem asks for an integer whose square is less than its double. This can be represented mathematically as:
$$ x^2 < 2x $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the inequality $ x^2 < 2x $ to find the integer(s) that satisfy it.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve the inequality $ x^2 < 2x $, rearrange it to bring all terms to one side:  
$$ x^2 - 2x < 0 $$  

Factor the expression:  
$$ x(x - 2) < 0 $$  

Now, analyze the sign of the product $ x(x - 2) $:  

1. The critical points are at $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 2 $.  
2. These divide the number line into three intervals:  
   - $ x < 0 $: Both $ x $ and $ x - 2 $ are negative, so their product is positive.  
   - $ 0 < x < 2 $: $ x $ is positive and $ x - 2 $ is negative, so their product is negative.  
   - $ x > 2 $: Both $ x $ and $ x - 2 $ are positive, so their product is positive.  

The inequality $ x(x - 2) < 0 $ is satisfied when the product is negative, which occurs in the interval $ 0 < x < 2 $.  

The only integer in this interval is $ x = 1 $.

Goal of this step: Verify if the solution is unique and an integer.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The solution found is $ x = 1 $.  

To verify uniqueness and integrality:  
- $ x = 1 $ is an integer.  
- The inequality $ x^2 < 2x $ is satisfied for $ x = 1 $, as $ 1^2 = 1 $ and $ 2x = 2 $, and $ 1 < 2 $.  
- No other integers in the interval $ 0 < x < 2 $ exist, so the solution is unique.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The solution process and the final result.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the solution process and the final result here:  
- The problem was to find the integer whose square is less than its double.  
- Mathematically, this was represented as $ x^2 < 2x $.  
- Solving the inequality led to $ x(x - 2) < 0 $, which is satisfied in the interval $ 0 < x < 2 $.  
- The only integer in this interval is $ x = 1 $.  
- Verification confirmed that $ x = 1 $ satisfies the condition and is the unique solution.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution process and conclusion.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Mathematical formulation: The original problem "square less than double" correctly translates to x² < 2x. This is mathematically valid as squaring and doubling are standard operations.

2. Inequality manipulation: 
   - Rearranged to x² - 2x < 0 is correct (subtracting 2x from both sides)
   - Factored to x(x-2) < 0 is valid algebraic manipulation
   - Critical points at x=0 and x=2 are correctly identified as boundaries between sign changes

3. Interval analysis:
   - For x < 0: Both x and x-2 negative → product positive (correct)
   - For 0 < x < 2: x positive and x-2 negative → product negative (correct)
   - For x > 2: Both x and x-2 positive → product positive (correct)
   - The solution set 0 < x < 2 correctly identifies where the product is negative

4. Integer identification:
   - Only integer in 0 < x < 2 is x=1 (correct)
   - Verification of x=1: 1²=1 < 2(1)=2 (correct)
   - Excluded endpoints x=0 and x=2:
     - At x=0: 0²=0 not < 0 (equality fails)
     - At x=2: 2²=4 not < 4 (equality fails)
   - Checked negative integers (x=-1): 1 not < -2 (correctly ruled out)

5. Uniqueness confirmation:
   - No other integers in the solution interval
   - All boundary cases properly evaluated
   - Negative integers explicitly tested and rejected

All logical steps are valid, calculations are correct, and edge cases are properly considered. The solution is both mathematically sound and complete.
