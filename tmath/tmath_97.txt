Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $81^{-1/2} = 2r - 1$ for $ r $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation:  
$$
81^{-1/2} = 2r - 1
$$  
Recall that $81 = 3^4$, so:  
$$
81^{-1/2} = (3^4)^{-1/2} = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{9}
$$  
Substitute into the equation:  
$$
\frac{1}{9} = 2r - 1
$$  
Now solve for $ r $:  
$$
2r = \frac{1}{9} + 1 = \frac{1 + 9}{9} = \frac{10}{9}
$$  
$$
r = \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9}
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution $ r = \frac{5}{9} $ in the original equation and validate all algebraic steps.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Domain Check**: The argument of the logarithm must satisfy $ 2r - 1 > 0 $. Substituting $ r = \frac{5}{9} $:
   $$
   2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 1 = \frac{10}{9} - \frac{9}{9} = \frac{1}{9} > 0
   $$
   Valid.

2. **Exponential Form Check**: Verify $ \log_{81}(2r - 1) = -1/2 $:
   - Left-hand side (LHS): $ \log_{81}\left(\frac{1}{9}\right) $
   - Right-hand side (RHS): $ -1/2 $
   - Convert LHS to exponential form: $ 81^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{9} $. This matches the argument, confirming equality.

3. **Algebraic Steps**:
   - $ 81^{-1/2} = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{9} $: Correct, as $ 81 = 3^4 $.
   - Solving $ \frac{1}{9} = 2r - 1 $:
     $$
     2r = \frac{1}{9} + 1 = \frac{10}{9} \implies r = \frac{5}{9}
     $$
     Calculations are valid.

4. **Final Substitution**: Replacing $ r = \frac{5}{9} $ in $ 2r - 1 $ yields $ \frac{1}{9} $, which aligns with $ 81^{-1/2} $. No inconsistencies.

All steps are logically sound and consistent. The solution satisfies the original equation and domain constraints.
