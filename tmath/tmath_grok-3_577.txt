**Problem Restatement**: Tom has 1 red marble, 1 green marble, 1 blue marble, and 3 identical yellow marbles. We need to determine the number of different groups of two marbles that can be chosen, where order does not matter (combinations) and the yellow marbles are indistinguishable from each other.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling** (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into the following subgoals:  
1. Identify the distinct marbles and handle the identical yellow marbles.  
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 marbles, considering cases based on the types of marbles selected.  
3. Sum the number of distinct groups from each case to get the total.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal** (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the distinct marbles and handle the identical yellow marbles.  
- **How to Achieve**: List the distinct marble types (red, green, blue, and yellow, noting that the three yellow marbles are identical). Treat the yellow marbles as one type since they are indistinguishable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Tom has:  
- 1 red marble (distinct)  
- 1 green marble (distinct)  
- 1 blue marble (distinct)  
- 3 yellow marbles (identical, treated as one type)  

Thus, there are 4 types of marbles: red, green, blue, and yellow (with yellow marbles being indistinguishable).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal** (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 marbles, considering cases based on the types of marbles selected.  
- **How to Achieve**: Define cases for choosing 2 marbles: (1) both marbles are of different types (excluding yellow-yellow), (2) both marbles are yellow (since yellow marbles are identical). Use combinations for distinct types and account for identical yellow marbles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To choose 2 marbles, consider the following cases:  

**Case 1: Choose 2 marbles of different types (excluding yellow-yellow)**  
- Possible pairs among distinct types (red, green, blue):  
  - Red-Green  
  - Red-Blue  
  - Green-Blue  
- For each pair, since marbles are distinct, there is 1 way to choose them.  
- Number of ways to choose 2 distinct types from {red, green, blue}:  
  \[
  \binom{3}{2} = 3
  \]  
- Include pairs involving yellow with other distinct marbles:  
  - Red-Yellow  
  - Green-Yellow  
  - Blue-Yellow  
- Since there are 3 yellow marbles, each pair (e.g., Red-Yellow) can be formed in 1 way (1 red Ã— 1 yellow).  
- Number of pairs involving yellow: 3 (one for each of red, green, blue).  
- Total for Case 1:  
  \[
  3 \text{ (from red, green, blue)} + 3 \text{ (involving yellow)} = 6
  \]

**Case 2: Choose 2 yellow marbles**  
- Since the yellow marbles are identical, choosing 2 yellow marbles results in only 1 unique group (yellow-yellow).  
- Number of ways: 1  

Total number of distinct groups:  
\[
6 \text{ (Case 1)} + 1 \text{ (Case 2)} = 7
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation** (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check the validity of the current path by verifying the calculations and ensuring all cases are covered.  
- **How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the cases to confirm no groups are missed or double-counted, and check the logic for handling identical yellow marbles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate the cases:  
- **Case 1**:  
  - Red-Green, Red-Blue, Green-Blue: 3 pairs, each with 1 way.  
  - Red-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Blue-Yellow: 3 pairs, each with 1 way (since yellow marbles are available).  
  - Total: 6 pairs.  
- **Case 2**:  
  - Yellow-Yellow: Since yellow marbles are identical, this is 1 group.  
- Total groups: \(6 + 1 = 7\).  

Check for missed cases:  
- All combinations of distinct types (red, green, blue) are covered.  
- All pairs involving yellow with other types are included.  
- Yellow-Yellow is accounted for as a single group due to indistinguishability.  
- No other cases are possible (e.g., choosing 2 reds is impossible since there is only 1 red).  

The calculations are consistent, and the logic accounts for identical yellow marbles correctly.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals** (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of different groups of two marbles Tom can choose.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the distinct marbles and handle identical yellow marbles. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 marbles, considering cases based on types. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the number of distinct groups to get the total. (Completed via Case 1 and Case 2 calculations)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations to ensure correctness. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution since all subgoals are completed and validated.  

The total number of distinct groups of two marbles is 7.  
- Case 1: 6 groups (Red-Green, Red-Blue, Green-Blue, Red-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Blue-Yellow).  
- Case 2: 1 group (Yellow-Yellow).

**Final Answer**: Tom can choose 7 different groups of two marbles.  

**Final Answer**: 7
