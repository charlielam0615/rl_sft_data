**Problem Statement**: Tom has six marbles: one red, one green, one blue, and three identical yellow marbles. We need to determine the number of different groups of two marbles Tom can choose, where the order of selection does not matter (i.e., choosing red and green is the same as choosing green and red), and the yellow marbles are indistinguishable from each other.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the distinct types of marbles and their quantities.  
2. Determine the possible types of groups of two marbles (e.g., both yellow, one yellow and one non-yellow, or both non-yellow).  
3. Calculate the number of combinations for each type of group.  
4. Sum the results to get the total number of different groups.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the distinct types of marbles and their quantities. This can be achieved by listing the marbles based on their colors and noting how many are identical.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Tom has:  
- 1 red marble  
- 1 green marble  
- 1 blue marble  
- 3 identical yellow marbles  
This gives a total of 6 marbles, with the yellow marbles being indistinguishable from each other.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To determine the possible types of groups of two marbles, consider the distinct cases based on the marbles’ colors:  
1. Both marbles are yellow (possible since there are 3 yellow marbles).  
2. One marble is yellow, and one is non-yellow (red, green, or blue).  
3. Both marbles are non-yellow (chosen from red, green, and blue).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of combinations for the case where both marbles are yellow. Since the yellow marbles are identical, choose 2 out of 3 identical yellow marbles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For two yellow marbles:  
Since the yellow marbles are identical, there is only 1 way to choose 2 yellow marbles (as the choices are indistinguishable).  
Number of groups: 1  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of combinations for the case where one marble is yellow and one is non-yellow (red, green, or blue). Choose 1 yellow marble and 1 non-yellow marble from the 3 distinct non-yellow marbles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Choose 1 yellow marble: There are 3 identical yellow marbles, so this is 1 choice (since they are indistinguishable).  
- Choose 1 non-yellow marble: There are 3 choices (red, green, or blue).  
Total combinations = 1 × 3 = 3  
The groups are: {Yellow, Red}, {Yellow, Green}, {Yellow, Blue}.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of combinations for the case where both marbles are non-yellow (chosen from red, green, and blue). Use the combination formula to choose 2 out of 3 distinct marbles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For two non-yellow marbles:  
There are 3 distinct non-yellow marbles (red, green, blue). The number of ways to choose 2 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the number of items, and k is the number to choose.  
C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!1!) = (3 × 2) / (2 × 1) = 3  
The groups are: {Red, Green}, {Red, Blue}, {Green, Blue}.  
Number of groups: 3  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of different groups of two marbles.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the distinct types of marbles and their quantities (completed: 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, 3 yellow).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the possible types of groups (completed: both yellow, one yellow and one non-yellow, both non-yellow).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate combinations for each type of group.  
    - Case 1: Both yellow (completed: 1 group).  
    - Case 2: One yellow, one non-yellow (completed: 3 groups).  
    - Case 3: Both non-yellow (completed: 3 groups).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the results (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the number of groups from all cases to find the total number of different groups.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the number of groups from all cases to find the total number of different groups of two marbles. Add the results from the three cases calculated previously.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Case 1 (both yellow): 1 group  
- Case 2 (one yellow, one non-yellow): 3 groups  
- Case 3 (both non-yellow): 3 groups  
Total number of different groups = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if all possible groups have been accounted for and the calculations are correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
List all groups to verify:  
1. {Yellow, Yellow}  
2. {Yellow, Red}  
3. {Yellow, Green}  
4. {Yellow, Blue}  
5. {Red, Green}  
6. {Red, Blue}  
7. {Green, Blue}  
Total: 7 groups.  
The calculations match the listed groups, and all cases (both yellow, one yellow and one non-yellow, both non-yellow) have been covered. The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: Tom can choose **7 different groups** of two marbles.
