To solve the quadratic equation $ -16t^2 + 80t = 36 $, first rearrange it into standard quadratic form:  
$$
-16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0.
$$  
This is a quadratic equation in the form $ at^2 + bt + c = 0 $, where $ a = -16 $, $ b = 80 $, and $ c = -36 $. The quadratic formula is:  
$$
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
$$  
Substitute the values into the formula:  
$$
t = \frac{-80 \pm \sqrt{80^2 - 4(-16)(-36)}}{2(-16)}.
$$  
Simplify the expression step by step:  
1. Calculate $ b^2 = 80^2 = 6400 $.  
2. Calculate $ 4ac = 4(-16)(-36) = 4(576) = 2304 $.  
3. Compute the discriminant $ b^2 - 4ac = 6400 - 2304 = 4096 $.  
4. Take the square root of the discriminant $ \sqrt{4096} = 64 $.  
5. Plug the values into the quadratic formula:  
$$
t = \frac{-80 \pm 64}{2(-16)}.
$$  
This yields two solutions:  
- For the $ + $ sign:  
$$
t = \frac{-80 + 64}{-32} = \frac{-16}{-32} = 0.5.
$$  
- For the $ - $ sign:  
$$
t = \frac{-80 - 64}{-32} = \frac{-144}{-32} = 4.5.
$$  
The two times at which the projectile reaches a height of 36 feet are $ t = 0.5 $ and $ t = 4.5 $. Since the question asks for the first time, the answer is $ t = 0.5 $.

1. **Equation Setup Verification**:  
   The original equation $ y = -16t^2 + 80t $ is set to $ y = 36 $, resulting in $ -16t^2 + 80t = 36 $. Rearranged to standard form: $ -16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0 $. This is correct.

2. **Quadratic Formula Application**:  
   - Coefficients: $ a = -16 $, $ b = 80 $, $ c = -36 $. Correctly identified.  
   - Discriminant calculation:  
     $ b^2 = 80^2 = 6400 $.  
     $ 4ac = 4(-16)(-36) = 2304 $.  
     $ \text{Discriminant} = 6400 - 2304 = 4096 $.  
     $ \sqrt{4096} = 64 $. All steps are mathematically valid.  

3. **Root Calculation**:  
   Substituting into the quadratic formula:  
   $ t = \frac{-80 \pm 64}{2(-16)} $.  
   - For $ + $: $ \frac{-80 + 64}{-32} = \frac{-16}{-32} = 0.5 $.  
   - For $ - $: $ \frac{-80 - 64}{-32} = \frac{-144}{-32} = 4.5 $.  
   Both roots are correctly computed.  

4. **Interpretation of Roots**:  
   The projectile reaches 36 feet at $ t = 0.5 $ seconds (first ascent) and $ t = 4.5 $ seconds (descent). The problem asks for the first time, so selecting $ t = 0.5 $ is correct.  

5. **Rounding**:  
   $ 0.5 $ is already to the nearest tenth. No further rounding needed.  

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically accurate. No errors detected.
