Goal of this step: Substitute 25 for $ h $ in the equation and simplify to form a quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substituting $ h = 25 $ into the equation $ h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 $, we get:  

$$
25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2
$$  

Now simplify the equation:  

$$
25 - 45 = -7t - 6t^2
$$  

$$
-20 = -7t - 6t^2
$$  

Rearranging terms to write in standard quadratic form $ at^2 + bt + c = 0 $:  

$$
6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0
$$  

This is the quadratic equation to solve.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $ 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 $ for $ t $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We solve the quadratic equation $ 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 $ using the quadratic formula:  

$$
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  

Here, $ a = 6 $, $ b = 7 $, and $ c = -20 $. Substituting these values:  

$$
t = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 - 4(6)(-20)}}{2(6)}
$$  

$$
t = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 480}}{12}
$$  

$$
t = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{529}}{12}
$$  

$$
t = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{12}
$$  

Now calculate the two possible values of $ t $:  

1. $ t = \frac{-7 + 23}{12} = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} $  
2. $ t = \frac{-7 - 23}{12} = \frac{-30}{12} = -\frac{5}{2} $  

The two solutions are $ t = \frac{4}{3} $ and $ t = -\frac{5}{2} $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the quadratic equation solution and the validity of the time solution.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
First, verify the quadratic equation formation. Starting from h = 25, the equation becomes 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t². Subtracting 25 from both sides gives 0 = 20 - 7t - 6t², which rearranges to 6t² + 7t - 20 = 0. This matches the derived equation, so the formation is correct.

Next, verify the quadratic formula application. With a = 6, b = 7, c = -20:
- Discriminant calculation: 7² - 4*6*(-20) = 49 + 480 = 529. √529 = 23. Correct.
- Solutions: (-7 + 23)/12 = 16/12 = 4/3 and (-7 - 23)/12 = -30/12 = -5/2. Correct.

Finally, validate the time solution. Time cannot be negative, so t = -5/2 is discarded. The positive solution t = 4/3 (≈1.333 seconds) is valid. The calculation is consistent with the problem's physical constraints.

No errors detected in the logic or calculations. The solution is mathematically and contextually sound.
