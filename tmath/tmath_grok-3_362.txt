### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the pattern of the geometric sequence by determining the common ratio.  
2. Use the common ratio to find the next term after \(54x^3\).  
3. Express the next term in terms of \(x\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the pattern of the geometric sequence by determining the common ratio.  
- **How to Achieve**: Divide consecutive terms to find the common ratio \(r\), i.e., compute \(\frac{6x}{2}\), \(\frac{18x^2}{6x}\), and \(\frac{54x^3}{18x^2}\) to confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the common ratio \(r\):  
- First pair: \(\frac{6x}{2} = 3x\).  
- Second pair: \(\frac{18x^2}{6x} = \frac{18x^2}{6x} = 3x\).  
- Third pair: \(\frac{54x^3}{18x^2} = \frac{54x^3}{18x^2} = 3x\).  

Since all pairs yield \(3x\), the common ratio is \(r = 3x\).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check the validity of the common ratio \(r = 3x\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Verify that multiplying each term by \(3x\) produces the next term in the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the common ratio:  
- \(2 \cdot 3x = 6x\) (matches second term).  
- \(6x \cdot 3x = 18x^2\) (matches third term).  
- \(18x^2 \cdot 3x = 54x^3\) (matches fourth term).  

The common ratio \(r = 3x\) is valid as it correctly generates each subsequent term.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find the next term after \(54x^3\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Multiply the fourth term \(54x^3\) by the common ratio \(3x\) to compute the fifth term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The fourth term is \(54x^3\).  
Next term: \(54x^3 \cdot 3x = 54 \cdot 3 \cdot x^3 \cdot x = 162x^4\).  
The next term is \(162x^4\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the next term in the geometric sequence \(2, 6x, 18x^2, 54x^3, \ldots\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the pattern by determining the common ratio (completed: \(r = 3x\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the common ratio to find the next term (completed: \(162x^4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the next term in terms of \(x\) (completed: \(162x^4\)).  

**Current Goal**: Completed (next term found).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The next term in the geometric sequence is \(162x^4\).
