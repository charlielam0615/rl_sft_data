**Problem Statement**: Find the next term in the geometric sequence \(2, 6x, 18x^2, 54x^3, \ldots\), expressed in terms of \(x\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the next term in the geometric sequence, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the common ratio of the sequence.  
2. Determine the position of the next term.  
3. Calculate the next term using the general formula for a geometric sequence.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the common ratio of the sequence. This can be achieved by dividing consecutive terms to find the constant ratio.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the sequence \(2, 6x, 18x^2, 54x^3, \ldots\), calculate the common ratio \(r\) by dividing the second term by the first term:  
\[
r = \frac{6x}{2} = 3x
\]  
Verify with the next pair of terms:  
\[
\frac{18x^2}{6x} = \frac{18x^2}{6x} = 3x
\]  
And the next pair:  
\[
\frac{54x^3}{18x^2} = \frac{54x^3}{18x^2} = 3x
\]  
The common ratio is consistently \(3x\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the next term in the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the common ratio (completed: common ratio is \(3x\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the position of the next term (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the next term using the general formula (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Determine the position of the next term.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the position of the next term. This can be achieved by identifying the term numbers in the sequence and finding the position of the term after \(54x^3\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The given sequence is \(2, 6x, 18x^2, 54x^3\). These correspond to:  
- 1st term: \(2\)  
- 2nd term: \(6x\)  
- 3rd term: \(18x^2\)  
- 4th term: \(54x^3\)  
The next term is the 5th term.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the 5th term using the general formula for a geometric sequence. The general formula is \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\), where \(a_1\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the term number.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the general formula \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\):  
- First term \(a_1 = 2\)  
- Common ratio \(r = 3x\)  
- For the 5th term, \(n = 5\):  
\[
a_5 = 2 \cdot (3x)^{5-1} = 2 \cdot (3x)^4 = 2 \cdot 81x^4 = 162x^4
\]  
The 5th term is \(162x^4\).  

[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated 5th term by checking if it fits the sequence pattern. This can be achieved by multiplying the 4th term by the common ratio and comparing it to the calculated term.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The 4th term is \(54x^3\). Multiply by the common ratio \(3x\):  
\[
54x^3 \cdot 3x = 54 \cdot 3 \cdot x^3 \cdot x = 162x^4
\]  
This matches the calculated 5th term \(162x^4\), confirming the result is correct.
