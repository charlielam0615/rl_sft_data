**Problem Restatement**: A dog is tied to a post at point (4, 3) on a Cartesian plane, where each unit is one foot. The dog is on a 10-foot rope. We need to find the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin (0, 0).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the region the dog can reach, constrained by the 10-foot rope.  
2. Identify the point(s) within this region that maximize the distance from the origin.  
3. Calculate the distance from the origin to the identified point(s).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the region the dog can reach. The dog is tied to (4, 3) with a 10-foot rope, so it can reach any point within a distance of 10 feet from (4, 3). This forms a circle centered at (4, 3) with radius 10. Describe this region mathematically.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The dog can reach any point (x, y) satisfying the equation of a circle centered at (4, 3) with radius 10:  
\[
(x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 \leq 100
\]  
This represents all points within or on the circle of radius 10 feet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the point(s) on the circle that maximize the distance from the origin (0, 0). Since the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), we need to find the point on the circle \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\) that maximizes this distance. This is likely the point on the circle farthest from the origin, which can be found by considering the geometry or optimization.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To maximize the distance from the origin, consider the geometry: the farthest point from (0, 0) on the circle centered at (4, 3) is likely along the line from (0, 0) through (4, 3), extended outward. The vector from (0, 0) to (4, 3) is (4, 3). Normalize this vector to find the direction:  
\[
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5
\]  
Unit vector: \(\left(\frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5}\right)\).  
A point on the circle along this direction from (4, 3) is:  
\[
(x, y) = (4, 3) + 10 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5}\right) = (4, 3) + (8, 6) = (12, 9)
\]  
Verify this point lies on the circle:  
\[
(12 - 4)^2 + (9 - 3)^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100
\]  
The point (12, 9) satisfies the circle equation, so it is reachable by the dog.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that (12, 9) is indeed the point on the circle that maximizes the distance from the origin. Check if other points on the circle yield a greater distance and confirm the geometric reasoning.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the distance from (12, 9) to (0, 0):  
\[
\sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{144 + 81} = \sqrt{225} = 15 \text{ feet}
\]  
To validate, consider the distance from the center (4, 3) to the origin:  
\[
\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5 \text{ feet}
\]  
The maximum distance occurs when the dog is 10 feet farther along this line, so:  
\[
5 + 10 = 15 \text{ feet}
\]  
Alternatively, test a point on the opposite side, e.g., along the direction from (4, 3) toward the origin. Unit vector toward origin: \(\left(-\frac{4}{5}, -\frac{3}{5}\right)\). Point:  
\[
(4, 3) + 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{4}{5}, -\frac{3}{5}\right) = (4, 3) + (-8, -6) = (-4, -3)
\]  
Verify:  
\[
(-4 - 4)^2 + (-3 - 3)^2 = (-8)^2 + (-6)^2 = 64 + 36 = 100
\]  
Distance to origin:  
\[
\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5 \text{ feet}
\]  
Since 15 > 5, the point (12, 9) gives a greater distance. The geometric insight that the maximum distance occurs along the line through the origin and center is confirmed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the greatest distance from the origin, using the validated point (12, 9). Compute the distance \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) for (12, 9).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Distance from (12, 9) to (0, 0):  
\[
\sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{144 + 81} = \sqrt{225} = 15 \text{ feet}
\]  
This confirms the greatest distance is 15 feet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the region the dog can reach (completed: circle centered at (4, 3), radius 10).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the point(s) maximizing distance from the origin (completed: point (12, 9)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the distance from the origin to the identified point (completed: 15 feet).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the greatest distance has been calculated.

**Final Answer**: The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is 15 feet.
