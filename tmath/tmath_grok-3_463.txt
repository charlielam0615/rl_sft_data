**Problem Statement**: A dog is tied to a post at the point (4, 3) on a Cartesian plane, where each unit is one foot. The dog is on a 10-foot rope. We need to find the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin (0, 0).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the region the dog can reach, given it is tied to (4, 3) with a 10-foot rope.  
2. Identify the point within this region that maximizes the distance from the origin (0, 0).  
3. Calculate the distance from the origin to that point using the distance formula.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the region the dog can reach.  
**How to Achieve**: The dog is tied to the point (4, 3) with a 10-foot rope, so it can reach any point within a circle centered at (4, 3) with a radius of 10 feet. The equation of this circle is \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 \leq 100\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The dog’s possible positions form a circle with center (4, 3) and radius 10. Any point (x, y) the dog can reach satisfies the equation \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 \leq 100\). This defines the boundary and interior of the circle where the dog can move.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the point on the circle that maximizes the distance from the origin (0, 0).  
**How to Achieve**: The farthest point from the origin will lie on the circle’s boundary, \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\), and will be the point where the vector from (0, 0) to (x, y) is maximized. Since the origin is outside the circle, the maximum distance occurs at the point on the circle farthest from (0, 0), which is along the line from (0, 0) to (4, 3), extended to the circle’s boundary.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The center of the circle is at (4, 3), and the radius is 10 feet. The distance from the origin (0, 0) to the center (4, 3) is:  
\[
\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ feet.}
\]  
Since the radius (10 feet) is greater than this distance, the origin lies inside the circle. To maximize the distance from the origin, we need the point on the circle’s boundary, \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\), farthest from (0, 0). This point lies along the line from the origin through the center (4, 3), extended to the circle’s boundary.  

The line from (0, 0) to (4, 3) has a slope of \(3/4\). Parameterize the line as \((x, y) = t(4, 3) = (4t, 3t)\), where \(t\) is a scalar. Substitute into the circle’s equation:  
\[
(4t - 4)^2 + (3t - 3)^2 = 100.
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
16(t - 1)^2 + 9(t - 1)^2 = 100 \implies 25(t - 1)^2 = 100 \implies (t - 1)^2 = 4 \implies t - 1 = \pm 2 \implies t = 3 \text{ or } t = -1.
\]  
- For \(t = 3\): Point is \((4 \cdot 3, 3 \cdot 3) = (12, 9)\).  
- For \(t = -1\): Point is \((4 \cdot -1, 3 \cdot -1) = (-4, -3)\).  

Now, calculate the distances from the origin:  
- For (12, 9):  
\[
\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (9 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{144 + 81} = \sqrt{225} = 15 \text{ feet.}
\]  
- For (-4, -3):  
\[
\sqrt{(-4 - 0)^2 + (-3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ feet.}
\]  
The point (12, 9) gives the greater distance.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that (12, 9) lies on the circle and is the farthest point from the origin.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if (12, 9) satisfies the circle’s equation and confirm that no other point on the circle yields a greater distance.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify (12, 9) lies on the circle:  
\[
(12 - 4)^2 + (9 - 3)^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100.
\]  
This satisfies \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\), confirming (12, 9) is on the circle’s boundary.  

To ensure this is the maximum distance, note that the distance from the origin to the center (4, 3) is 5 feet, and the radius is 10 feet. The farthest point from the origin is at the circle’s boundary along the line through (0, 0) and (4, 3), extended outward. Since (12, 9) lies on this line (as computed) and gives 15 feet, while the opposite point (-4, -3) gives 5 feet, (12, 9) is likely the maximum.  

Alternatively, consider the general distance from (0, 0) to a point (x, y) on the circle:  
\[
d^2 = x^2 + y^2.
\]  
Subject to \((x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\), maximize \(x^2 + y^2\). Using Lagrange multipliers or geometric reasoning, the maximum occurs when the point is aligned with the center and origin, consistent with our calculation.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified (12, 9) lies on the circle and maximizes distance).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the maximum distance.

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is 15 feet.
