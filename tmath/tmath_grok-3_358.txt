**Problem Restatement**: Find the fifth term of a geometric sequence where the first term is $2$ and the second term is $\frac{1}{4}$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the fifth term of the geometric sequence, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the common ratio of the sequence using the first and second terms.  
2. Derive the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.  
3. Calculate the fifth term using the formula, first term, and common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the common ratio of the sequence.  
How to Achieve: Divide the second term by the first term, i.e., compute $\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2}$.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the common ratio:  
\[
r = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]  
The common ratio is $\frac{1}{8}$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Derive the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.  
How to Achieve: Recall that the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:  
\[
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}.
\]  
Given: $a_1 = 2$, $r = \frac{1}{8}$.  
For the fifth term ($n = 5$), the formula becomes:  
\[
a_5 = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{5-1} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the fifth term using the formula.  
How to Achieve: Substitute $a_1 = 2$, $r = \frac{1}{8}$, and $n = 5$ into $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$, and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[
a_5 = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4.
\]  
First, compute $\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4$:  
\[
\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4 = \frac{1^4}{8^4} = \frac{1}{8^4} = \frac{1}{4096}.
\]  
Now multiply by 2:  
\[
a_5 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4096} = \frac{2}{4096} = \frac{1}{2048}.
\]  
The fifth term is $\frac{1}{2048}$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of the fifth term.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the sequence terms up to the fifth term using the first term and common ratio, and check consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Sequence: $a_1 = 2$, $r = \frac{1}{8}$.  
- $a_2 = a_1 \cdot r = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$ (matches given second term).  
- $a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{32}$.  
- $a_4 = a_3 \cdot r = \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{256}$.  
- $a_5 = a_4 \cdot r = \frac{1}{256} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2048}$.  
Alternatively, using the formula:  
\[
a_5 = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^4 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4096} = \frac{1}{2048}.
\]  
Both methods agree, confirming the fifth term is $\frac{1}{2048}$.
