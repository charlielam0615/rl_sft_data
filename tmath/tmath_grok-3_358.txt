**Problem Restatement**: Find the fifth term of a geometric sequence where the first term is 2 and the second term is 1/4.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the fifth term:  
1. Determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
2. Derive the general formula for the nth term.  
3. Calculate the fifth term using the formula.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence. This can be achieved by dividing the second term by the first term.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the second term \( a_2 = \frac{1}{4} \), the common ratio \( r \) is calculated as:  
\[ r = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \]  
The common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{8} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the general formula for the nth term of the geometric sequence. This can be achieved using the first term and the common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:  
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \]  
Given \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{8} \), the formula is:  
\[ a_n = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^{n-1} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the fifth term using the general formula. This can be achieved by substituting \( n = 5 \) into the formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the formula \( a_n = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^{n-1} \), for \( n = 5 \):  
\[ a_5 = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^{5-1} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^4 \]  
Calculate \( \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^4 \):  
\[ \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^4 = \frac{1}{8^4} = \frac{1}{4096} \]  
Then:  
\[ a_5 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4096} = \frac{2}{4096} = \frac{1}{2048} \]  
The fifth term is \( \frac{1}{2048} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the calculated fifth term by verifying the sequenceâ€™s pattern. This can be achieved by computing the first few terms and confirming the fifth term.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the sequence:  
- First term: \( a_1 = 2 \).  
- Second term: \( a_2 = a_1 \cdot r = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) (given, correct).  
- Third term: \( a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{32} \).  
- Fourth term: \( a_4 = a_3 \cdot r = \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{256} \).  
- Fifth term: \( a_5 = a_4 \cdot r = \frac{1}{256} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2048} \).  
The calculated fifth term \( \frac{1}{2048} \) matches the result from Step 4, confirming its correctness.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the fifth term of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the common ratio (completed: \( r = \frac{1}{8} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the general formula (completed: \( a_n = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^{n-1} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the fifth term (completed: \( a_5 = \frac{1}{2048} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: fifth term verified).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and no further subgoals are needed.  
The fifth term of the geometric sequence is \( \frac{1}{2048} \).

**Final Answer**: The fifth term of the geometric sequence is \( \frac{1}{2048} \).
