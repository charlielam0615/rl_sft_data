**Problem Restatement**: Given two polynomials, \( f(x) \) of degree 4 and \( g(x) \) of degree 5, determine the degree of the polynomial \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \):  
1. Determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \).  
2. Determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \).  
3. Compute the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \). To achieve this, analyze how the substitution \( x^3 \) affects the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) \), which has degree 4.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4, its highest degree term can be written as \( a x^4 \), where \( a \) is a constant. Substituting \( x^3 \) for \( x \), we get \( f(x^3) = a (x^3)^4 + \text{lower degree terms} = a x^{12} + \text{lower degree terms} \). Thus, the degree of \( f(x^3) \) is \( 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \). To achieve this, analyze how the substitution \( x^2 \) affects the degree of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which has degree 5.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( g(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5, its highest degree term can be written as \( b x^5 \), where \( b \) is a constant. Substituting \( x^2 \) for \( x \), we get \( g(x^2) = b (x^2)^5 + \text{lower degree terms} = b x^{10} + \text{lower degree terms} \). Thus, the degree of \( g(x^2) \) is \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \) (completed: degree is 12).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \) (completed: degree is 10).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \). To achieve this, use the rule that the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The degree of \( f(x^3) \) is 12, and the degree of \( g(x^2) \) is 10. For two polynomials, the degree of their product is the sum of their degrees, provided the leading coefficients do not cancel out. Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are general polynomials with non-zero leading coefficients, the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) has degree \( 12 + 10 = 22 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computed degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \). To achieve this, check the calculations and consider edge cases to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute: Degree of \( f(x^3) = 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \), degree of \( g(x^2) = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \), so degree of product is \( 12 + 10 = 22 \).  
Edge case: If the leading coefficients of \( f(x^3) \) and \( g(x^2) \) were to cancel out in the product, the degree could be lower. However, since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are arbitrary polynomials, cancellation is not assumed without specific conditions. Thus, the degree is 22 in the general case.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) is \( 22 \).
