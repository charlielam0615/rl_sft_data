### Problem Statement
We need to determine the degree of the polynomial resulting from the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \), where \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4 and \( g(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the degree of the product polynomial:
1. Determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \).
2. Determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \).
3. Calculate the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4, analyze how the substitution \( x^3 \) affects the degree of the resulting polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the degree of \( f(x^3) \), consider the effect of the substitution \( x^3 \). Let \( f(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), where \( a_4 \neq 0 \) since \( f(x) \) has degree 4. Replacing \( x \) with \( x^3 \), we get:
\[ f(x^3) = a_4 (x^3)^4 + a_3 (x^3)^3 + a_2 (x^3)^2 + a_1 (x^3) + a_0 = a_4 x^{12} + a_3 x^9 + a_2 x^6 + a_1 x^3 + a_0. \]
The highest degree term is \( a_4 x^{12} \), so the degree of \( f(x^3) \) is \( 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since \( g(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5, analyze how the substitution \( x^2 \) affects the degree of the resulting polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( g(x^2) \), let \( g(x) = b_5 x^5 + b_4 x^4 + b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0 \), where \( b_5 \neq 0 \) since \( g(x) \) has degree 5. Replacing \( x \) with \( x^2 \), we get:
\[ g(x^2) = b_5 (x^2)^5 + b_4 (x^2)^4 + b_3 (x^2)^3 + b_2 (x^2)^2 + b_1 (x^2) + b_0 = b_5 x^{10} + b_4 x^8 + b_3 x^6 + b_2 x^4 + b_1 x^2 + b_0. \]
The highest degree term is \( b_5 x^{10} \), so the degree of \( g(x^2) \) is \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the degree of \( f(x^3) \) (completed: degree is 12).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the degree of \( g(x^2) \) (completed: degree is 10).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) (current goal).
**Current Goal**: Calculate the degree of the product \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the property that the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees, assuming the leading coefficients are non-zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees, provided the leading coefficients do not cancel out. From Step 2, the degree of \( f(x^3) \) is 12, and from Step 3, the degree of \( g(x^2) \) is 10. Thus, the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22. \]
Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are general polynomials with non-zero leading coefficients, the leading terms \( a_4 x^{12} \) (from \( f(x^3) \)) and \( b_5 x^{10} \) (from \( g(x^2) \)) produce a term \( a_4 b_5 x^{12+10} = a_4 b_5 x^{22} \), which is non-zero as \( a_4 \neq 0 \) and \( b_5 \neq 0 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the calculation of the degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Confirm the degree calculation by checking the general rule for polynomial composition and multiplication, and consider edge cases where the degree might differ (e.g., leading coefficient cancellation).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, note that for polynomials \( p(x) \) of degree \( m \) and \( q(x) \) of degree \( n \), the degree of \( p(x^k) \) is \( m \cdot k \), and the degree of \( p(x^k) \cdot q(x^l) \) is \( m \cdot k + n \cdot l \), assuming no cancellation of the leading term. Here, \( f(x^3) \) has degree \( 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \), and \( g(x^2) \) has degree \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \), so the product degree is \( 12 + 10 = 22 \). Cancellation of the leading term would require \( a_4 b_5 = 0 \), but since \( a_4 \neq 0 \) and \( b_5 \neq 0 \), this does not occur. Thus, the degree is consistently 22.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The degree of \( f(x^3) \cdot g(x^2) \) is 22.
