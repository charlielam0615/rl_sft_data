**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 \) and \( g(x) = x + 3 \), compute the value of \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) \):  
1. Compute \( g(5) \).  
2. Use the result to compute \( f(g(5)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(5) \).  
4. Use the result to compute \( g(f(5)) \).  
5. Subtract \( g(f(5)) \) from \( f(g(5)) \) to find the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(5) \), which involves substituting \( x = 5 \) into \( g(x) = x + 3 \). This is a straightforward evaluation using the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( g(x) = x + 3 \):  
\( g(5) = 5 + 3 = 8 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(5)) \), which is \( f(8) \) since \( g(5) = 8 \). Substitute \( x = 8 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 8 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 \):  
\( f(8) = 8^2 - 2 \cdot 8 + 5 = 64 - 16 + 5 = 53 \).  
So, \( f(g(5)) = 53 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(5) \), by substituting \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 \):  
\( f(5) = 5^2 - 2 \cdot 5 + 5 = 25 - 10 + 5 = 20 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(5)) \), which is \( g(20) \) since \( f(5) = 20 \). Substitute \( x = 20 \) into \( g(x) = x + 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 20 \) into \( g(x) = x + 3 \):  
\( g(20) = 20 + 3 = 23 \).  
So, \( g(f(5)) = 23 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) \), using the previously computed values \( f(g(5)) = 53 \) and \( g(f(5)) = 23 \). Perform the subtraction to find the final result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the results:  
\( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) = 53 - 23 = 30 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) = 30 \) by rechecking each step to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck calculations:  
- \( g(5) = 5 + 3 = 8 \).  
- \( f(8) = 8^2 - 2 \cdot 8 + 5 = 64 - 16 + 5 = 53 \).  
- \( f(5) = 5^2 - 2 \cdot 5 + 5 = 25 - 10 + 5 = 20 \).  
- \( g(20) = 20 + 3 = 23 \).  
- \( 53 - 23 = 30 \).  
All steps are consistent with the previous calculations, confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(5) = 8 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(5)) = f(8) = 53 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(5) = 20 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( g(f(5)) = g(20) = 23 \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( 53 - 23 = 30 \).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the result (confirmed as 30).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to present the final validated result.  
The computations are complete, and the final result is \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) = 30 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(5)) - g(f(5)) = 30 \).
