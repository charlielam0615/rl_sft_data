**Problem Restatement**: Find the coefficient of the \( x^2 y^4 \) term in the expansion of \( (x + y)^6 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^2 y^4 \) in \( (x + y)^6 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the appropriate method for finding a specific term in a binomial expansion.  
2. Apply the method to determine the coefficient for the term \( x^2 y^4 \).  
3. Verify the result for correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the method for finding a specific term in a binomial expansion.  
How to Achieve: Use the binomial theorem, which states that for \( (x + y)^n \), the general term is given by \( \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k \). The coefficient of a specific term can be found by determining the appropriate \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The binomial theorem provides the expansion of \( (x + y)^n \):  
\[ (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k \]  
For \( (x + y)^6 \), the general term is:  
\[ \binom{6}{k} x^{6-k} y^k \]  
To find the term \( x^2 y^4 \), set the exponents to match:  
- For \( x \): \( 6 - k = 2 \implies k = 4 \)  
- For \( y \): \( k = 4 \)  
Thus, the term occurs when \( k = 4 \), and the coefficient is \( \binom{6}{4} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the coefficient for the term \( x^2 y^4 \).  
How to Achieve: Compute \( \binom{6}{4} \) using the formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \( \binom{6}{4} \):  
\[ \binom{6}{4} = \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{4! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]  
The coefficient of \( x^2 y^4 \) is 15.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the coefficient.  
How to Achieve: Check the calculation by recomputing \( \binom{6}{4} \) and confirm the term’s exponents align with the binomial theorem.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute \( \binom{6}{4} \):  
\[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{24 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{48} = 15 \]  
Confirm exponents: For \( k = 4 \), the term is \( \binom{6}{4} x^{6-4} y^4 = \binom{6}{4} x^2 y^4 \), which matches \( x^2 y^4 \).  
The coefficient 15 is consistent.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 y^4 \) in \( (x + y)^6 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the method (binomial theorem).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the method to compute the coefficient (\( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (confirmed correct).  
Current Goal: Completed—coefficient found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The coefficient of the \( x^2 y^4 \) term in the expansion of \( (x + y)^6 \) is 15.
