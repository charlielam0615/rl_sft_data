### Problem Statement
The pages of a book are numbered from 1 to \( n \). The sum of the page numbers from 1 to \( n \) is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). However, when the page numbers were added, one page number, say \( x \), was added twice, leading to an incorrect sum of 1986. We need to find the value of \( x \), the page number that was added twice.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express the correct sum of page numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Model the incorrect sum by accounting for the page number added twice.
3. Set up an equation based on the incorrect sum being 1986.
4. Solve for \( n \) and \( x \).
5. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express the correct sum of page numbers and model the incorrect sum.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), for the correct sum. For the incorrect sum, add the page number \( x \) twice, which means adding \( x \) once extra to the correct sum. Set this equal to 1986.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The correct sum of page numbers from 1 to \( n \) is:
\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
Since page \( x \) is added twice, it is counted once in the correct sum and once extra, so the incorrect sum is:
\[
S + x = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + x
\]
Given that the incorrect sum is 1986, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + x = 1986
\]
Rearrange to express \( x \):
\[
x = 1986 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
Since \( x \) is a page number, \( 1 \leq x \leq n \), and \( x \) must be an integer.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve for \( n \) and \( x \) using the equation.
How to Achieve: Since \( x = 1986 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) must be an integer and \( 1 \leq x \leq n \), estimate \( n \) by approximating the correct sum close to 1986. Then, test values of \( n \) to find integer solutions for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To estimate \( n \), assume the extra \( x \) is small and the correct sum \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \approx 1986 \). Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
n(n+1) \approx 3972
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
n^2 + n - 3972 \approx 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = -3972 \):
\[
n \approx \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 3972}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 15888}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{15889}}{2}
\]
Since \( \sqrt{15889} \approx 126.15 \), we have:
\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 126.15}{2} \approx 62.575
\]
Thus, \( n \) is likely around 62 or 63. Test \( n = 63 \):
\[
\frac{63 \cdot 64}{2} = \frac{4032}{2} = 2016
\]
\[
x = 1986 - 2016 = -30
\]
This is negative, so not possible. Try \( n = 62 \):
\[
\frac{62 \cdot 63}{2} = \frac{3906}{2} = 1953
\]
\[
x = 1986 - 1953 = 33
\]
Since \( x = 33 \leq 62 \), this is valid. Verify with \( n = 61 \):
\[
\frac{61 \cdot 62}{2} = \frac{3782}{2} = 1891
\]
\[
x = 1986 - 1891 = 95
\]
Since \( 95 \leq n=61 \), this is not possible. Thus, \( n = 33 \), \( x = 62 \) seems promising.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution for \( n = 62 \), \( x = 33 \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 62 \) and \( x = 33 \) into the equation and check if the incorrect sum holds. Also, ensure \( x \leq n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = 62 \):
\[
\text{Correct sum} = \frac{62 \cdot 63}{2} = 1953
\]
\[
\text{Incorrect sum} = 1953 + x = 1953 + 33 = 1986
\]
This matches the given incorrect sum of 1986. Check constraint:
\[
x = 33 \leq n = 62
\]
The solution satisfies all conditions. Test \( n \) (e.g., \( n = 61 \)):
\[
x = 95 > 61
\]
This violates \( x \leq n \). Higher \( n > 62 \):
\[
n = 63: \frac{63 \cdot 64}{2} = 2016, \quad x = 1986 - 2016 = -30
\]
Negative, not possible. Thus, \( n = 33 \), \( x = 62 \) is the only valid solution.
