### Problem Restatement
The pages of a book are numbered from 1 to \( n \). The sum of the page numbers from 1 to \( n \) is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). However, when the page numbers were summed, one page number, say \( k \), was added twice, resulting in an incorrect sum of 1986. We need to find the value of \( k \), the page number that was added twice.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( k \).  
1. Derive the equation for the sum of page numbers with one page added twice.  
2. Use the given incorrect sum (1986) to set up an equation involving \( n \) and \( k \).  
3. Solve for \( k \) by finding possible values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it is a valid page number.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the equation for the sum of page numbers with one page added twice. This can be achieved by expressing the correct sum of pages from 1 to \( n \) as \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), then adding the extra page number \( k \) to account for it being added twice.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The sum of page numbers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Since page \( k \) was added twice, it contributes \( k \) once as part of the sum and an additional \( k \) due to the mistake. Thus, the incorrect sum is:  
\[ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + k = 1986 \]  
This equation relates \( n \) (the total number of pages) and \( k \) (the page added twice).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + k = 1986 \) for \( k \). This can be achieved by expressing \( k \) in terms of \( n \), i.e., \( k = 1986 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and finding integer solutions for \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rearrange the equation:  
\[ k = 1986 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]  
Since \( k \) is a page number, \( k \) must be an integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \). Additionally, \( k \) must be positive, so:  
\[ 1986 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \geq 1 \]  
\[ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \leq 1985 \]  
\[ n(n+1) \leq 3970 \]  
We need to find \( n \) such that \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) is close to 1986, and \( k \) is an integer. Let’s estimate \( n \):  
\[ n(n+1) \approx 3970 \]  
Taking the square root:  
\[ \sqrt{3970} \approx 63 \]  
Test values of \( n \) around 63:  
- For \( n = 63 \):  
  \[ \frac{63 \cdot 64}{2} = \frac{4032}{2} = 2016 \]  
  \[ k = 1986 - 2016 = -30 \] (not possible, as \( k \geq 1 \)).  
- For \( n = 62 \):  
  \[ \frac{62 \cdot 63}{2} = \frac{3906}{2} = 1953 \]  
  \[ k = 1986 - 1953 = 33 \]  
Since \( k = 33 \leq n = 62 \), this is a valid solution. Let’s try one more to ensure uniqueness:  
- For \( n = 61 \):  
  \[ \frac{61 \cdot 62}{2} = \frac{3782}{2} = 1891 \]  
  \[ k = 1986 - 1891 = 95 \]  
Since \( k = 95 > n = 61 \), this is not valid.  
Thus, \( n = 62 \), \( k = 33 \) is a promising solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( n = 62 \) and \( k = 33 \) satisfy the problem conditions. This can be achieved by checking if the sum of pages from 1 to 62, plus an extra 33, equals 1986, and confirming \( k \leq n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the sum for \( n = 62 \):  
\[ \frac{62 \cdot 63}{2} = 1953 \]  
Add the extra page \( k = 33 \):  
\[ 1953 + 33 = 1986 \]  
This matches the given incorrect sum. Check if \( k \leq n \):  
\[ 33 \leq 62 \] (true).  
The solution satisfies all conditions.
