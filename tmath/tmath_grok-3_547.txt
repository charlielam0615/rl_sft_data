**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of values of \( a \) for which the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).  
2. Determine the condition for the line \( y = x + a \) to pass through the vertex.  
3. Solve for the values of \( a \) that satisfy this condition.  
4. Count the number of valid \( a \) values.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \). Achieve this by analyzing the parabola’s equation to identify its vertex.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \) is in the form \( y = x^2 + c \), where \( c = a^2 \). For a parabola \( y = x^2 + c \), the vertex is at \( (0, c) \). Thus, the vertex is \( (0, a^2) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for the line \( y = x + a \) to pass through the vertex \( (0, a^2) \). Achieve this by substituting the vertex coordinates into the line’s equation and solving for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the line \( y = x + a \) to pass through the vertex \( (0, a^2) \), substitute \( x = 0 \), \( y = a^2 \) into the line’s equation:  
\[ a^2 = 0 + a \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ a^2 = a \]  
\[ a^2 - a = 0 \]  
\[ a(a - 1) = 0 \]  
The solutions are \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 1 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) are valid by checking if the line passes through the vertex for each value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For \( a = 0 \):  
  - Parabola: \( y = x^2 + 0^2 = x^2 \), vertex at \( (0, 0) \).  
  - Line: \( y = x + 0 = x \). At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), which matches the vertex \( (0, 0) \).  
  - The line passes through the vertex.  
- For \( a = 1 \):  
  - Parabola: \( y = x^2 + 1^2 = x^2 + 1 \), vertex at \( (0, 1) \).  
  - Line: \( y = x + 1 \). At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \), which matches the vertex \( (0, 1) \).  
  - The line passes through the vertex.  
Both solutions are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of values of \( a \) for which the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the vertex of the parabola (completed: vertex is \( (0, a^2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for the line to pass through the vertex (completed: \( a^2 = a \), solutions \( a = 0, 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solutions (completed: both \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) are valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the number of valid \( a \) values (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of valid \( a \) values.  
The solutions \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) were found and validated, so there are 2 valid values of \( a \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the number of valid \( a \) values. Achieve this by summarizing the validated solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The valid values of \( a \) are \( 0 \) and \( 1 \), so there are 2 values of \( a \) for which the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: 2
