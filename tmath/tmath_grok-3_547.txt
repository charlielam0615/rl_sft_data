### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many values of \( a \) satisfy the condition that the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Find the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).  
2. Express the condition that the line \( y = x + a \) passes through this vertex.  
3. Solve for the values of \( a \) that satisfy this condition.  
4. Determine how many distinct values of \( a \) exist.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \). This can be achieved by analyzing the parabola’s equation to identify its vertex.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \) is a quadratic function in \( x \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, it opens upward, and the vertex occurs at the minimum point. The general form of a parabola is \( y = Ax^2 + Bx + C \). Here, \( A = 1 \), \( B = 0 \), and \( C = a^2 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{B}{2A} = -\frac{0}{2 \cdot 1} = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the equation gives the y-coordinate: \( y = 0^2 + a^2 = a^2 \). Thus, the vertex is \( (0, a^2) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the condition that the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex \( (0, a^2) \). This can be achieved by substituting the vertex coordinates into the line’s equation and checking if it holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the line \( y = x + a \) to pass through the vertex \( (0, a^2) \), substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = a^2 \) into the line’s equation:  
\[ a^2 = 0 + a \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ a^2 = a \]  
or equivalently:  
\[ a^2 - a = 0 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( a^2 - a = 0 \) to find the values of \( a \). This can be achieved by factoring and solving the resulting quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:  
\[ a^2 - a = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ a(a - 1) = 0 \]  
The solutions are:  
\[ a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 1 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) satisfy the condition that the line passes through the parabola’s vertex. This can be achieved by substituting these values back into the equations of the line and parabola.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Check \( a = 0 \)**:  
- Parabola: \( y = x^2 + 0^2 = x^2 \). Vertex at \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0^2 = 0 \), so \( (0, 0) \).  
- Line: \( y = x + 0 = x \). At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \). The point \( (0, 0) \) lies on the line.  
This satisfies the condition.  

**Check \( a = 1 \)**:  
- Parabola: \( y = x^2 + 1^2 = x^2 + 1 \). Vertex at \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0^2 + 1 = 1 \), so \( (0, 1) \).  
- Line: \( y = x + 1 \). At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 + 1 = 1 \). The point \( (0, 1) \) lies on the line.  
This satisfies the condition.  

Both solutions are valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many values of \( a \) make the line \( y = x + a \) pass through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the vertex of the parabola. (Completed: Vertex is \( (0, a^2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the condition for the line to pass through the vertex. (Completed: \( a^2 = a \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( a \). (Completed: \( a = 0, 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solutions. (Completed: Both \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) are valid).  
  - Subgoal 5: Count distinct values of \( a \). (Pending).  

**Current Goal**: Count the distinct values of \( a \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the distinct values of \( a \) that satisfy the condition. This can be achieved by listing the solutions and determining their count.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solutions are \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \). There are two distinct values of \( a \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
There are **2** values of \( a \) for which the line \( y = x + a \) passes through the vertex of the parabola \( y = x^2 + a^2 \).
