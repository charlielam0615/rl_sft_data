**Problem Restatement**: Noelle earns homework points based on the number of assignments completed. For the first 5 points, each point requires 1 assignment. For the next 5 points (6th to 10th), each point requires 2 assignments. For the next 5 points (11th to 15th), each point requires 3 assignments, and so on. The number of assignments needed for the \( n \)-th point is \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \). We need to determine the smallest number of homework assignments required to earn a total of 25 points.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the smallest number of assignments needed for 25 points, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of assignments required for each point from 1 to 25 based on the rule \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \).  
2. Sum these assignments to find the total for 25 points.  
3. Verify the calculation to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of assignments required for each point from 1 to 25 using the formula \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \). This involves dividing each point number \( n \) by 5, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then summing these values.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For each point \( n \) from 1 to 25, compute \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \):  
- Points 1 to 5: \( \lceil n/5 \rceil = \lceil 1/5 \rceil = \lceil 2/5 \rceil = \lceil 3/5 \rceil = \lceil 4/5 \rceil = \lceil 5/5 \rceil = 1 \). So, 5 points × 1 assignment = 5 assignments.  
- Points 6 to 10: \( \lceil n/5 \rceil = \lceil 6/5 \rceil = \lceil 7/5 \rceil = \lceil 8/5 \rceil = \lceil 9/5 \rceil = \lceil 10/5 \rceil = 2 \). So, 5 points × 2 assignments = 10 assignments.  
- Points 11 to 15: \( \lceil n/5 \rceil = \lceil 11/5 \rceil = \lceil 12/5 \rceil = \lceil 13/5 \rceil = \lceil 14/5 \rceil = \lceil 15/5 \rceil = 3 \). So, 5 points × 3 assignments = 15 assignments.  
- Points 16 to 20: \( \lceil n/5 \rceil = \lceil 16/5 \rceil = \lceil 17/5 \rceil = \lceil 18/5 \rceil = \lceil 19/5 \rceil = \lceil 20/5 \rceil = 4 \). So, 5 points × 4 assignments = 20 assignments.  
- Points 21 to 25: \( \lceil n/5 \rceil = \lceil 21/5 \rceil = \lceil 22/5 \rceil = \lceil 23/5 \rceil = \lceil 24/5 \rceil = \lceil 25/5 \rceil = 5 \). So, 5 points × 5 assignments = 25 assignments.  

Total assignments = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking the formula application and summation for correctness. This involves confirming the \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \) values for each point and ensuring the total is accurate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute for a sample point to confirm: For the 12th point, \( \lceil 12/5 \rceil = \lceil 2.4 \rceil = 3 \), which matches the problem’s example.  
Recalculate the sum:  
- Points 1–5: 5 × 1 = 5  
- Points 6–10: 5 × 2 = 10  
- Points 11–15: 5 × 3 = 15  
- Points 16–20: 5 × 4 = 20  
- Points 21–25: 5 × 5 = 25  
Sum: \( 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75 \).  
The summation is consistent. Alternatively, use the formula for the sum of assignments: For each group of 5 points, the number of assignments per point is constant. The total is \( 5 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 5 \times 15 = 75 \). This confirms the result.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the smallest number of assignments for 25 points.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine assignments per point using \( \lceil n/5 \rceil \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum assignments for points 1 to 25.  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution aligns with all subgoals.  
The calculation of 75 assignments satisfies Subgoals 1 and 2, and Subgoal 3 (verification) confirms correctness.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn 25 homework points is 75.
