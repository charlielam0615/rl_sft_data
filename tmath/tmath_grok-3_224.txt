**Problem Statement**: Noelle earns homework points based on the number of assignments completed. For the first 5 points, she needs 1 assignment per point; for points 6 to 10, she needs 2 assignments per point; for points 11 to 15, she needs 3 assignments per point, and so on. To earn the nth point, she needs ⌈n/5⌉ assignments. We need to find the smallest number of assignments required to earn a total of 25 points.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the smallest number of assignments needed for 25 points, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the number of assignments required for each point from 1 to 25.  
2. Sum these assignments to get the total for 25 points.  
3. Verify the calculation to ensure correctness.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of assignments required for each point from 1 to 25.  
How to Achieve: For the nth point, the number of assignments is ⌈n/5⌉. Calculate this for n = 1 to 25.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each point n, the number of assignments is ⌈n/5⌉:  
- Points 1–5 (n=1 to 5): ⌈n/5⌉ = ⌈1/5 to 5/5⌉ = ⌈0.2 to 1⌉ = 1 assignment each.  
- Points 6–10 (n=6 to 10): ⌈6/5 to 10/5⌉ = ⌈1.2 to 2⌉ = 2 assignments each.  
- Points 11–15 (n=11 to 15): ⌈11/5 to 15/5⌉ = ⌈2.2 to 3⌉ = 3 assignments each.  
- Points 16–20 (n=16 to 20): ⌈16/5 to 20/5⌉ = ⌈3.2 to 4⌉ = 4 assignments each.  
- Points 21–25 (n=21 to 25): ⌈21/5 to 25/5⌉ = ⌈4.2 to 5⌉ = 5 assignments each.  
List of assignments per point:  
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the assignments to get the total for 25 points.  
How to Achieve: Add the number of assignments for points 1 to 25, grouped by ranges: 5 points at 1 assignment, 5 at 2, 5 at 3, 5 at 4, and 5 at 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the total assignments:  
- Points 1–5: 5 points × 1 assignment = 5 assignments.  
- Points 6–10: 5 points × 2 assignments = 10 assignments.  
- Points 11–15: 5 points × 3 assignments = 15 assignments.  
- Points 16–20: 5 points × 4 assignments = 20 assignments.  
- Points 21–25: 5 points × 5 assignments = 25 assignments.  
Total = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75 assignments.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation to ensure correctness.  
How to Achieve: Derive the total using an alternative method, such as a mathematical formula for the sum of assignments, and compare results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of assignments for the nth point is ⌈n/5⌉. The total is the sum of ⌈n/5⌉ from n=1 to 25. Alternatively, use the grouped sum formula:  
For k groups of 5 points, where group i (points 5(i-1)+1 to 5i) requires i assignments:  
Total assignments = Σ (i × 5) for i=1 to k. For 25 points, k=5:  
1×5 + 2×5 + 3×5 + 4×5 + 5×5 = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75.  
This matches the previous result.  
To further confirm, consider the arithmetic sequence of assignments per group: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 terms). Sum = 5/2 × (1+5) × 5 = 2.5 × 6 × 5 = 75.  
Both methods confirm 75 assignments.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the smallest number of homework assignments for 25 points.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine assignments per point (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum assignments for 25 points (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify calculation (completed).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
The total is 75 assignments, verified by multiple methods.

**Final Answer**: The smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn 25 homework points is **75**.
