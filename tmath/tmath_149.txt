What to recall: The definition and properties of the floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For any real number $x$, it can be expressed as $x = \lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\}$, where $\{x\}$ is the fractional part of $x$ satisfying $0 \leq \{x\} < 1$.

Goal of this step: Express $x$ in terms of its integer and fractional parts and set up an equation.
[/PLANNING]

Let $x = n + f$, where $n = \lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer and $f$ is the fractional part of $x$ such that $0 \leq f < 1$.

From the problem, we have:
$$
\lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3}
$$
Substitute $x = n + f$ into the equation:
$$
n + (n + f) = \frac{13}{3}
$$
Simplify the left-hand side:
$$
2n + f = \frac{13}{3}
$$
This equation relates the integer part $n$ and the fractional part $f$ of $x$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $2n + f = \frac{13}{3}$ for $x = n + f$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given:
$$
2n + f = \frac{13}{3}
$$
Since $n$ is an integer and $0 \leq f < 1$, we can analyze the equation to find possible values for $n$ and $f$.

Start by isolating $f$:
$$
f = \frac{13}{3} - 2n
$$
Now, since $0 \leq f < 1$, substitute the expression for $f$ into the inequality:
$$
0 \leq \frac{13}{3} - 2n < 1
$$
Solving the inequality:
1. For the left side: 
$$
\frac{13}{3} - 2n \geq 0 \Rightarrow 2n \leq \frac{13}{3}
$$
$$
n \leq \frac{13}{6}
$$
2. For the right side:
$$
\frac{13}{3} - 2n < 1 \Rightarrow 2n > \frac{13}{3} - 1
$$
$$
2n > \frac{10}{3} \Rightarrow n > \frac{5}{3}
$$

So $n$ must satisfy:
$$
\frac{5}{3} < n \leq \frac{13}{6}
$$
Since $n$ is an integer, the only possible value is $n = 2$.

Now substitute $n = 2$ back into the equation for $f$:
$$
f = \frac{13}{3} - 2(2) = \frac{13}{3} - 4 = \frac{13 - 12}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Thus, $x = n + f = 2 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check if x = 7/3 satisfies the original equation $\lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3}$ and verify the correctness of all algebraic steps.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Check the original equation:**
   - Compute $\lfloor x \rfloor$ for $x = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333...$. The floor function gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x, so $\lfloor \frac{7}{3} \rfloor = 2$.
   - Add $\lfloor x \rfloor + x = 2 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{13}{3}$, which matches the given condition. ✅

2. **Verify the inequality constraints for $n$:**
   - The derived range $\frac{5}{3} < n \leq \frac{13}{6}$ translates to $1.\overline{6} < n \leq 2.1\overline{6}$. The only integer in this interval is $n = 2$. ✅

3. **Check consistency of fractional part $f$:**
   - Substituting $n = 2$ into $f = \frac{13}{3} - 2n$ gives $f = \frac{1}{3}$, which satisfies $0 \leq f < 1$. ✅

4. **Re-examine algebraic manipulations:**
   - The substitution $x = n + f$ and simplification to $2n + f = \frac{13}{3}$ is valid. ✅
   - Solving for $f$ and applying inequalities is logically sound. ✅

All steps align with mathematical principles, and the final value $x = \frac{7}{3}$ satisfies the original equation. No discrepancies detected.
