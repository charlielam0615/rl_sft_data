### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the expression:  
1. Combine the square root terms using properties of radicals.  
2. Simplify the resulting expression under a single square root.  
3. Ensure the final answer is in simplest radical form, with \(p\) appropriately handled.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Combine the square root terms into a single expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the property of radicals that \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\) to multiply the terms \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply the radical property:  
\[
\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p} = \sqrt{(30p) \cdot (5p) \cdot (6p)}.  
\]  
Multiply the arguments:  
\[
30p \cdot 5p \cdot 6p = 30 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot p \cdot p \cdot p = 900 \cdot p^3.  
\]  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{900p^3}.  
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the expression \(\sqrt{900p^3}\) into simplest radical form.  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize 900 and \(p^3\) to identify perfect squares, then use the property \(\sqrt{a \cdot b} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}\) to simplify.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Factorize 900:  
\[
900 = 30^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2.  
\]  
Factorize \(p^3\):  
\[
p^3 = p^2 \cdot p, \text{ where } p^2 \text{ is a perfect square (assuming } p \text{ is positive).}  
\]  
So:  
\[
900p^3 = 900 \cdot p^3 = (2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2) \cdot (p^2 \cdot p).  
\]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\[
\sqrt{900p^3} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^2) \cdot p} = \sqrt{(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot p)^2 \cdot p} = \sqrt{(30p)^2 \cdot p}.  
\]  
Simplify using \(\sqrt{a^2 \cdot b} = |a| \cdot \sqrt{b}\):  
\[
\sqrt{(30p)^2 \cdot p} = |30p| \cdot \sqrt{p} = 30|p| \cdot \sqrt{p}.  
\]  
Since the problem involves radicals and \(p\) is typically assumed positive in such contexts unless specified, we take \(|p| = p\). Thus:  
\[
30p \cdot \sqrt{p}.  
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(30p \sqrt{p}\) is in simplest radical form and correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the radicand \(\sqrt{p}\) has no perfect square factors (other than 1) and confirm the calculation by reversing the process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check Simplest Form**: The radicand \(p\) is a variable and has no perfect square factors unless additional information about \(p\) is provided (e.g., \(p\) being a perfect square). Thus, \(\sqrt{p}\) is simplified.  
- **Reverse Calculation**: Start with \(30p \sqrt{p}\):  
  \[
  (30p \sqrt{p})^2 = (30p)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{p})^2 = 900p^2 \cdot p = 900p^3.  
  \]  
  Taking the square root:  
  \[
  \sqrt{900p^3} = \sqrt{30p \cdot 5p \cdot 6p} = \sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p},  
  \]  
  which matches the original expression, confirming correctness.  
The expression \(30p \sqrt{p}\) is in simplest radical form, assuming \(p\) is positive.
