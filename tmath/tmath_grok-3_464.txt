### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the product \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\) and express the answer in simplest radical form in terms of \(p\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of calculating \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Combine the square roots into a single expression.  
2. Simplify the expression under the square root.  
3. Express the result in simplest radical form, ensuring the role of \(p\) is clear.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the square roots into a single expression. This can be achieved by using the property of square roots: \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\). Apply this property to multiply \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the property \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\), combine the square roots:  
\[
\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p} = \sqrt{(30p) \cdot (5p) \cdot (6p)}
\]  
Multiply the terms inside the square root:  
\[
(30p) \cdot (5p) \cdot (6p) = 30 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot p \cdot p \cdot p = 900 \cdot p^3
\]  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{900 p^3}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{900 p^3}\). This can be achieved by factoring the number and the variable inside the square root, extracting perfect squares, and simplifying to the simplest radical form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{900 p^3}\):  
- Factor 900 into its prime factors: \(900 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2\).  
- For \(p^3\), rewrite it as \(p^2 \cdot p\), where \(p^2\) is a perfect square.  
Thus:  
\[
900 p^3 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^2 \cdot p
\]  
Take the square root:  
\[
\sqrt{900 p^3} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^2) \cdot p} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot p^2} \cdot \sqrt{p} = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot p) \cdot \sqrt{p} = 30p \sqrt{p}
\]  
The expression is now \(30p \sqrt{p}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(30p \sqrt{p}\) is in simplest radical form and correctly represents the product. Check if the radical \(\sqrt{p}\) can be simplified further and verify the computation by retracing the steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Check if \(\sqrt{p}\) is in simplest form: Since \(p\) is a variable, we assume it is positive (as square roots typically imply the principal root), and \(\sqrt{p}\) cannot be simplified further unless additional information about \(p\) is provided.  
- Verify the computation:  
  Original product: \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\).  
  Recompute:  
  \[
  \sqrt{(30p) \cdot (5p) \cdot (6p)} = \sqrt{900 p^3} = \sqrt{900 \cdot p^2 \cdot p} = \sqrt{900} \cdot \sqrt{p^2} \cdot \sqrt{p} = 30 \cdot p \cdot \sqrt{p} = 30p \sqrt{p}
  \]  
  The result matches. The expression \(30p \sqrt{p}\) is in simplest radical form.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\) and express in simplest radical form.  
  - Subgoal 1: Combine the square roots into a single expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression under the square root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the result in simplest radical form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and the solution \(30p \sqrt{p}\) has been validated. No further steps are needed.

### Final Answer
The product \(\sqrt{30p} \cdot \sqrt{5p} \cdot \sqrt{6p}\) in simplest radical form is \(30p \sqrt{p}\).  
\[
\boxed{30p \sqrt{p}}
