**Problem Restatement**: Calculate the probability that Steve, who guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple-choice test with two choices per question (one correct, one incorrect), gets at least half of the questions correct (i.e., at least 8 correct answers). Express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:  
1. Determine the probability of getting a single question correct.  
2. Model the number of correct answers as a binomial distribution.  
3. Calculate the probability of getting at least 8 correct answers (8, 9, ..., 15).  
4. Sum the probabilities for each case and express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the probability of getting a single question correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Since each question has two choices (one correct, one incorrect) and Steve guesses randomly, compute the probability of selecting the correct answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each question has two choices, with one being correct. Since Steve guesses randomly, the probability of choosing the correct answer for any single question is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Model the number of correct answers as a binomial distribution.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the binomial distribution formula to model the number of correct answers, defining the parameters \( n \) (number of trials) and \( p \) (probability of success).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem involves 15 questions, so the number of trials is \( n = 15 \). The probability of success (correct answer) is \( p = \frac{1}{2} \), and the probability of failure (incorrect answer) is \( 1 - p = \frac{1}{2} \). The number of correct answers \( k \) follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of getting exactly \( k \) correct answers is given by:
\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \binom{15}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15-k} = \binom{15}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability of getting at least 8 correct answers.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the sum of probabilities for \( k = 8, 9, \ldots, 15 \) using the binomial formula, leveraging the fact that \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} \) is a common factor.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We need the probability of getting at least 8 correct answers, i.e., \( P(k \geq 8) = P(8) + P(9) + \cdots + P(15) \). Using the binomial formula:
\[
P(k) = \binom{15}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15}
\]
The total probability is:
\[
P(k \geq 8) = \sum_{k=8}^{15} \binom{15}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} \sum_{k=8}^{15} \binom{15}{k}
\]
We need to compute the sum of binomial coefficients \( \sum_{k=8}^{15} \binom{15}{k} \). Alternatively, since \( \binom{15}{k} = \binom{15}{15-k} \), we can use symmetry:
\[
\sum_{k=8}^{15} \binom{15}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{15}{k}
\]
The total sum of binomial coefficients for \( n = 15 \) is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{15} \binom{15}{k} = 2^{15} = 32768
\]
By symmetry, \( \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{15}{k} = \sum_{k=8}^{15} \binom{15}{k} \), so:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{15}{k} = \frac{2^{15}}{2} = \frac{32768}{2} = 16384
\]
Thus:
\[
P(k \geq 8) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} \cdot 16384 = \frac{16384}{2^{15}} = \frac{16384}{32768} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the binomial sum using an alternative method, such as computing the complementary probability \( P(k \leq 7) \), and ensure the result matches.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, compute the complementary probability \( P(k \leq 7) = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{15}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} \). From the previous step, we know:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{15}{k} = 16384
\]
So:
\[
P(k \leq 7) = 16384 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{15} = \frac{16384}{32768} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since \( P(k \geq 8) + P(k \leq 7) = 1 \), and we have \( P(k \geq 8) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( P(k \leq 7) = \frac{1}{2} \), the calculations are consistent. Alternatively, since \( p = \frac{1}{2} \), the binomial distribution is symmetric, and exactly half the probability mass lies at or above the median (7.5), confirming \( P(k \geq 8) = \frac{1}{2} \).
