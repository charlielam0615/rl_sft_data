**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). This requires applying the function \( f \) six times, starting with the input \( x = -1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break down the task into intermediate subgoals. The goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \), which means applying \( f \) six times starting from \( x = -1 \). A logical approach is to compute each application of \( f \) step-by-step, where each subgoal is to evaluate \( f \) at the result of the previous application. The subgoals are:  
1. Compute \( f(-1) \).  
2. Compute \( f(f(-1)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(f(f(-1))) \).  
4. Compute \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) \).  
5. Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) \).  
6. Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-1) \), the first application of the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = -1 \) into the function and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \):  
\[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \]  
So, \( f(-1) = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) \), the second application of the function. Substitute the result from Step 2, \( x = 3 \), into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \) and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \):  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 - 6 = 3 \]  
So, \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-1) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 6: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) \).  
Interestingly, \( f(3) = 3 \) from Step 3, suggesting a possible pattern where \( f(3) = 3 \). This indicates \( x = 3 \) may be a fixed point of the function, which could simplify further iterations.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether \( x = 3 \) is a fixed point of \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \), as the results \( f(-1) = 3 \) and \( f(3) = 3 \) suggest a potential pattern. Check if \( f(3) = 3 \) holds consistently and assess its impact on subsequent iterations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, confirm \( f(3) \):  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 - 6 = 3 \]  
This confirms \( f(3) = 3 \), so \( x = 3 \) is a fixed point. Since \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \), applying \( f \) again gives \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3 \). This implies all further applications of \( f \) (i.e., \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) \), etc.) will yield 3, as \( f(3) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final result \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \). Since \( x = 3 \) is a fixed point and \( f(f(-1)) = 3 \), apply \( f \) to confirm the result for the remaining iterations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( f(f(-1)) = 3 \) and \( f(3) = 3 \), we have:  
- \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
- \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
- \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
- \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
Thus, \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \) is \( \boxed{3} \).
