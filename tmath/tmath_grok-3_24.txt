### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \), where \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). This involves applying the function \( f \) six times, starting with the input \( x = -1 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, we need to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \). Since the function is applied six times, we can break this down into a sequence of subgoals: compute \( f(-1) \), then apply \( f \) to the result, and repeat until the sixth application. Each subgoal is to evaluate \( f \) at the output of the previous step.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(-1) \), the first application of the function. We will achieve this by substituting \( x = -1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \) and calculating the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \):  
\[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \]  
So, \( f(-1) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) \), the second application of the function. We will substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \):  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 - 6 = 3 \]  
So, \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) \), the third application of the function. Since \( f(3) = 3 \) from the previous step, we will compute \( f(3) \) again.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \):  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 - 6 = 3 \]  
So, \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to ensure we are on track.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-1) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) = f(f(3)) \).  
  - Subgoal 6: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = f(f(f(3))) \).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(3) \).  
**Observation**: We notice that \( f(3) = 3 \) in previous steps, suggesting a possible fixed point or pattern where \( f(3) = 3 \) holds for further applications.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether \( f(3) = 3 \) is a fixed point, which would imply that further applications of \( f \) yield the same result. We will test \( f(3) \) and check if the pattern holds for subsequent iterations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From previous steps, we have \( f(3) = 3 \). To confirm if 3 is a fixed point, compute \( f(3) \) again:  
\[ f(3) = 3^2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 - 6 = 3 \]  
Since \( f(3) = 3 \), applying \( f \) to 3 does not change the value. This suggests that \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(3) = 3 \), and further applications (e.g., \( f(f(3)) \), \( f(f(f(3))) \)) will also yield 3.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) = f(f(3)) \), the fifth application. Since \( f(3) = 3 \), we will compute \( f(3) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( f(3) = 3 \), we have:  
\[ f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3 \]  
So, \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = f(f(3)) \), the sixth and final application. Since \( f(3) = 3 \), we will compute \( f(3) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( f(3) = 3 \), we have:  
\[ f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3 \]  
So, \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = f(3) = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Review the goal hierarchy to confirm all subgoals are complete and the final answer is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(-1) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(-1)) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(-1))) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(-1)))) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(-1))))) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) = f(3) = 3 \) (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete.  
**Summary**: Starting from \( f(-1) = 3 \), each subsequent application of \( f \) yields \( f(3) = 3 \), as 3 is a fixed point of the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). Thus, the final value is 3.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) \) is \( \boxed{3} \).
