**Problem Restatement:** We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\) and express them in the form \(x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1. The goal is to determine the value of \(n\).

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve the quadratic equation and express the roots in the required form. The subgoals are: (1) Recall the quadratic formula to find the roots, (2) Apply the formula to the given equation, (3) Simplify the expression to match the form \(x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\), and (4) Identify the value of \(n\).

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\).  
Description: I will use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 2\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -4\), and compute the values step by step to find the roots.

Using the quadratic formula:  
- \(a = 2\), \(b = -5\), \(c = -4\)  
- Discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(2)(-4) = 25 + 32 = 57\)  
- Roots: \(x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{57}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\)  
The roots are expressed as \(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\), which matches the form \(x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\) with \(m = 5\), \(n = 57\), and \(p = 4\).

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify that the expression for the roots is correct and that \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1.  
Description: I will check the calculations for the discriminant and the simplification of the quadratic formula, and confirm that the values of \(m = 5\), \(n = 57\), and \(p = 4\) satisfy the condition of having a GCD of 1.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recalculating the discriminant: \((-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-4) = 25 + 32 = 57\), which is correct.  
The formula application: \(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\), which is consistent.  
Now, checking the GCD of \(m = 5\), \(n = 57\), and \(p = 4\):  
- Factors of 5: 1, 5  
- Factors of 57: 1, 3, 19, 57  
- Factors of 4: 1, 2, 4  
The common factor is only 1, so the GCD is 1, satisfying the condition.  
Thus, the expression is correct, and the value of \(n = 57\) is identified.
