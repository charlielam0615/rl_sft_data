**Problem Statement**: We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\) in the form \(x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers with a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1, and determine the value of \(n\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\).  
2. Express the roots in the form \(x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\).  
3. Ensure \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers with GCD of 1.  
4. Identify the value of \(n\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\). This involves identifying the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), computing the discriminant, and substituting into the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the equation \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\), the coefficients are:  
- \(a = 2\)  
- \(b = -5\)  
- \(c = -4\)  

The quadratic formula is:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Compute the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-4) = 25 + 32 = 57 \]

Thus, the roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{57}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4} \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the roots \(\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\) are correctly expressed in the form \(\frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers with GCD of 1. Check if the expression matches the required form and if the GCD condition is satisfied.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The roots are \(\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\). Comparing with \(\frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\):  
- \(m = 5\)  
- \(n = 57\)  
- \(p = 4\)  

All are positive integers. Now, check the GCD of \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\):  
- \(m = 5\), a prime number.  
- \(n = 57 = 3 \cdot 19\), not divisible by 5.  
- \(p = 4 = 2^2\), not divisible by 5 or 3.  

The GCD of 5, 57, and 4 is 1, as no common factor greater than 1 exists. The expression satisfies the problemâ€™s conditions.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \(n\) in the roots of \(2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\) expressed as \(\frac{m \pm \sqrt{n}}{p}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the quadratic formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express roots in the required form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) have GCD of 1 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the value of \(n\) (current).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the value of \(n\). From the roots \(\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{4}\), we have \(n = 57\).
