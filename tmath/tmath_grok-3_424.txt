**Problem Restatement**: Find the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the parabolas \( y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \) and \( y = -x^2 - 2x + 4 \), denoted as \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), where \( c \geq a \), and compute \( c - a \) as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( c - a \), we need to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the two parabolas. Break this down into subgoals:  
1. Set the equations equal to find the x-coordinates of intersection.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for x-values (these will be \( a \) and \( c \)).  
3. Identify \( a \) and \( c \) with \( c \geq a \).  
4. Compute \( c - a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points. Achieve this by setting the two parabola equations equal to each other and solving for x.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 = -x^2 - 2x + 4 \]  
Subtract \( -x^2 - 2x + 4 \) from both sides:  
\[ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 - (-x^2 - 2x + 4) = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ 3x^2 - 2x = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ x(3x - 2) = 0 \]  
Solutions:  
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 3x - 2 = 0 \implies x = \frac{2}{3} \]  
Thus, the x-coordinates are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{2}{3} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the x-coordinates by checking if both parabolas yield the same y-value at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{2}{3} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 0 \):  
- First parabola: \( y = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 4 = 4 \)  
- Second parabola: \( y = -(0)^2 - 2(0) + 4 = 4 \)  
Both yield \( y = 4 \), so \( (0, 4) \) is an intersection point.  

For \( x = \frac{2}{3} \):  
- First parabola: \( y = 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 4 = 2 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - \frac{8}{3} + 4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{24}{9} + \frac{36}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \)  
- Second parabola: \( y = -\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 4 = -\frac{4}{9} - \frac{4}{3} + 4 = -\frac{4}{9} - \frac{12}{9} + \frac{36}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \)  
Both yield \( y = \frac{20}{9} \), so \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{20}{9}\right) \) is an intersection point.  

The x-coordinates \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{2}{3} \) are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( c - a \), where \( c \geq a \) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find x-coordinates of intersection points (completed: \( x = 0, \frac{2}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify x-coordinates (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify \( a \) and \( c \) with \( c \geq a \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( c - a \).  
**Current Goal**: Identify \( a \) and \( c \) with \( c \geq a \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assign \( a \) and \( c \) from the x-coordinates \( 0 \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \), ensuring \( c \geq a \), and compute \( c - a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The x-coordinates are \( 0 \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \). Since \( c \geq a \):  
- Let \( a = 0 \), \( c = \frac{2}{3} \) (as \( \frac{2}{3} > 0 \)).  
Compute:  
\[ c - a = \frac{2}{3} - 0 = \frac{2}{3} \]  
The result \( \frac{2}{3} \) is already a common fraction.

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}} \]
