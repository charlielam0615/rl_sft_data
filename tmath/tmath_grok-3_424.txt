**Problem Statement**: We need to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the parabolas \( y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \) and \( y = -x^2 - 2x + 4 \), denoted as \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), where \( c \geq a \), and compute \( c - a \) as a common fraction.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for \( c - a \), we need to:
1. Find the x-coordinates of the intersection points by equating the two parabola equations.
2. Solve the resulting equation to obtain the x-values, \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \geq a \).
3. Compute the difference \( c - a \) and express it as a common fraction.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Find the x-coordinates of the intersection points.

**How to Achieve**: Equate the two parabola equations to find the x-values where they intersect, then solve the resulting quadratic equation.

[IMP]

Set the equations equal:
\[ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 = -x^2 - 2x + 4 \]

Simplify:
\[ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 \]
\[ 3x^2 - 2x = 0 \]
\[ x (3x - 2) = 0 \]

Solve for x:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 3x - 2 = 0 \implies x = \frac{2}{3} \]

The x-coordinates of the intersection points are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{2}{3} \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the x-coordinates of the intersection points.

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{2}{3} \) into both equations to confirm they yield the same y-value, ensuring the points lie on both parabolas.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

For \( x = 0 \):
- First parabola: \( y = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 4 = 4 \)
- Second parabola: \( y = -(0)^2 - 2(0) + 4 = 4 \)
- Same y-value: (0, 4) is an intersection point.

For \( x = \frac{2}{3} \):
- First parabola: \( y = 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 4 = 2 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - \frac{8}{3} + 4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{24}{9} + \frac{36}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \)
- Second parabola: \( y = -\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 4 = -\frac{4}{9} - \frac{4}{3} + 4 = -\frac{4}{9} - \frac{12}{9} + \frac{36}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \)
- Same y-value: \(\left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{20}{9}\right)\) is an intersection point.

Both points are valid.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Compute \( c - a \) for the intersection points of the parabolas.
  - Subgoal 1: Find x-coordinates of intersection points (completed: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \frac{2}{3} \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Verify intersection points (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( c - a \) as a common fraction (current).

**Current Goal**: Compute \( c - a \).

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute \( c - a \).

**How to Achieve**: Assign \( a \) and \( c \) based on \( c \geq a \), then calculate the difference and express as a common fraction.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]

The x-coordinates are \( 0 \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \). Since \( c \geq a \):
- Let \( a = 0 \), \( c = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Compute: \( c - a = \frac{2}{3} - 0 = \frac{2}{3} \).

The result is already a common fraction.

**Final Answer**

\[ \frac{2}{3} \]
