### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( |m - n| \) given the equations \( mn = 4 \) and \( m + n = 5 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( |m - n| \) into intermediate subgoals.  
1. Solve the system of equations \( mn = 4 \) and \( m + n = 5 \) to find the values of \( m \) and \( n \).  
2. Compute the difference \( m - n \).  
3. Calculate the absolute value \( |m - n| \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( mn = 4 \) and \( m + n = 5 \) to find \( m \) and \( n \). This can be achieved by forming a quadratic equation from the given equations and solving for the variables.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( m + n = 5 \), express \( n = 5 - m \). Substitute into \( mn = 4 \):  
\[ m(5 - m) = 4 \]  
\[ 5m - m^2 = 4 \]  
\[ m^2 - 5m + 4 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), \( c = 4 \):  
\[ m = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 3}{2} \]  
\[ m = \frac{5 + 3}{2} = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad m = \frac{5 - 3}{2} = 1 \]  
For \( m = 4 \), \( n = 5 - 4 = 1 \). For \( m = 1 \), \( n = 5 - 1 = 4 \).  
Thus, the solutions are \( (m, n) = (4, 1) \) or \( (1, 4) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( m - n \) using the solutions \( (m, n) = (4, 1) \) or \( (1, 4) \). This involves subtracting \( n \) from \( m \) for each pair.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( (m, n) = (4, 1) \):  
\[ m - n = 4 - 1 = 3 \]  
For \( (m, n) = (1, 4) \):  
\[ m - n = 1 - 4 = -3 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate \( |m - n| \) using the results from the previous step. This involves taking the absolute value of the differences computed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous step, \( m - n = 3 \) or \( m - n = -3 \).  
\[ |m - n| = |3| = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad |m - n| = |-3| = 3 \]  
In both cases, \( |m - n| = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the values of \( m \) and \( n \) satisfy both given equations and confirm the result for \( |m - n| \). This can be done by substituting \( (m, n) = (4, 1) \) and \( (1, 4) \) into the original equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( (m, n) = (4, 1) \):  
- Check \( mn = 4 \): \( 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \), satisfied.  
- Check \( m + n = 5 \): \( 4 + 1 = 5 \), satisfied.  
- Check \( |m - n| \): \( |4 - 1| = 3 \).  
For \( (m, n) = (1, 4) \):  
- Check \( mn = 4 \): \( 1 \cdot 4 = 4 \), satisfied.  
- Check \( m + n = 5 \): \( 1 + 4 = 5 \), satisfied.  
- Check \( |m - n| \): \( |1 - 4| = 3 \).  
Both pairs satisfy the equations, and \( |m - n| = 3 \) in both cases.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( |m - n| \) given \( mn = 4 \) and \( m + n = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations to find \( m \) and \( n \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( m - n \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \( |m - n| \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
**Result**: \( |m - n| = 3 \).
