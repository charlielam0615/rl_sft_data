**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \) and \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \), we need to find the inverse of the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the inverse of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
2. Find the inverse of \( h(x) \) by solving \( y = h(x) \) for \( x \) in terms of \( y \).  
3. Verify the inverse by checking that \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \), and simplify the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), start with \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \). Substitute into \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(2x - 3) = 3(2x - 3) + 4 = 6x - 9 + 4 = 6x - 5. \]  
Thus, \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find the inverse of \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Set \( y = h(x) \), solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \), and express the result as \( h^{-1}(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the inverse, set \( y = h(x) = 6x - 5 \). Solve for \( x \):  
\[ y = 6x - 5 \]  
\[ y + 5 = 6x \]  
\[ x = \frac{y + 5}{6}. \]  
Thus, the inverse function is \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \) is the inverse of \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check that \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
1. Compute \( h(h^{-1}(x)) \):  
\[ h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \]  
\[ h(h^{-1}(x)) = h\left(\frac{x + 5}{6}\right) = 6 \cdot \frac{x + 5}{6} - 5 = (x + 5) - 5 = x. \]  
This satisfies the first condition.  

2. Compute \( h^{-1}(h(x)) \):  
\[ h(x) = 6x - 5 \]  
\[ h^{-1}(h(x)) = h^{-1}(6x - 5) = \frac{(6x - 5) + 5}{6} = \frac{6x}{6} = x. \]  
This satisfies the second condition.  

Since both conditions hold, \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \) is correct.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the inverse of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \). (Completed: \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the inverse of \( h(x) \). (Completed: \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the inverse. (Completed: Verification successful)  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The inverse of \( h(x) \) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The inverse of \( h(x) \) is \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \).
