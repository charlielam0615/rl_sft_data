**Problem Restatement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \) and \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \), we need to find the inverse of the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the inverse of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
2. Verify that \( h(x) \) is one-to-one to ensure an inverse exists.  
3. Find the inverse function \( h^{-1}(x) \) by solving \( y = h(x) \) for \( x \).  
4. Validate the inverse by checking if \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \). This will be achieved by substituting \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \) and simplifying the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), substitute \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \):  
\[ f(g(x)) = f(2x - 3) = 3(2x - 3) + 4 = 6x - 9 + 4 = 6x - 5. \]  
Thus, \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \) is one-to-one to ensure an inverse exists. This will be achieved by checking if \( h(x) \) is strictly increasing or decreasing (i.e., its derivative is always positive or negative).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \), compute the derivative:  
\[ h'(x) = 6. \]  
Since \( h'(x) = 6 > 0 \) for all \( x \), \( h(x) \) is strictly increasing and thus one-to-one. Therefore, an inverse function exists.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the inverse function \( h^{-1}(x) \). This will be achieved by setting \( y = h(x) = 6x - 5 \), solving for \( x \) in terms of \( y \), and expressing the result as \( h^{-1}(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the inverse, set \( y = h(x) = 6x - 5 \). Solve for \( x \):  
\[ y = 6x - 5 \]  
\[ y + 5 = 6x \]  
\[ x = \frac{y + 5}{6}. \]  
Thus, the inverse function is:  
\[ h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6}. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the inverse function \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \). This will be achieved by checking if \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
1. Check \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \):  
\[ h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \]  
\[ h(h^{-1}(x)) = h\left( \frac{x + 5}{6} \right) = 6 \left( \frac{x + 5}{6} \right) - 5 = (x + 5) - 5 = x. \]  
This holds.  

2. Check \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \):  
\[ h(x) = 6x - 5 \]  
\[ h^{-1}(h(x)) = h^{-1}(6x - 5) = \frac{(6x - 5) + 5}{6} = \frac{6x}{6} = x. \]  
This also holds.  

The inverse function is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the inverse of \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \) [Completed: \( h(x) = 6x - 5 \)].  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify \( h(x) \) is one-to-one [Completed: \( h(x) \) is strictly increasing].  
  - Subgoal 3: Find \( h^{-1}(x) \) [Completed: \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \)].  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the inverse [Completed: Verified \( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \)].  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.

**Final Answer**: The inverse of \( h(x) \) is \( h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6} \).
