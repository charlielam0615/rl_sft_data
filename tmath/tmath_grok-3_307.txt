### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( a \) that makes the piecewise function \( f(x) \) continuous for all real numbers \( x \). The function is defined as:

\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x + 2 & \text{if } x > 3, \\
2x + a & \text{if } x \leq 3.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Continuity at a point requires that the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at that point are equal. Since the function changes definition at \( x = 3 \), we need to ensure continuity at this point.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( a \), break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the condition for continuity at \( x = 3 \).
2. Compute the right-hand limit as \( x \) approaches 3 from values greater than 3.
3. Compute the left-hand limit (or function value) as \( x \) approaches 3 from values less than or equal to 3.
4. Set the limits equal to ensure continuity and solve for \( a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the condition for continuity at \( x = 3 \).
How to Achieve: For \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = 3 \), the right-hand limit (\( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) \)), the left-hand limit (\( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) \)), and the function value at \( x = 3 \) (\( f(3) \)) must be equal. Since \( x = 3 \) falls in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), use \( f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + a \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The condition for continuity at \( x = 3 \) is:

\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = f(3)
\]

Since \( f(3) \) is defined by the piece \( x \leq 3 \), we have:

\[
f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + a = 6 + a
\]

We will compute the limits in the next steps to set up the equation.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the right-hand limit, \( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) \).
How to Achieve: For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = x + 2 \). Evaluate the limit as \( x \) approaches 3 from the right by substituting \( x = 3 \) into \( x + 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} (x + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the left-hand limit, \( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) \), and the function value at \( x = 3 \).
How to Achieve: For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 2x + a \). Since the function is a linear polynomial, it is continuous for \( x \leq 3 \). Thus, the left-hand limit is the function value at \( x = 3 \), i.e., \( f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + a \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} (2x + a) = 2 \cdot 3 + a = 6 + a
\]

Since \( x = 3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), the function value is:

\[
f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + a = 6 + a
\]

Thus, \( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = f(3) = 6 + a \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set the right-hand and left-hand limits equal to ensure continuity and solve for \( a \).
How to Achieve: Equate \( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) \), i.e., \( 5 = 6 + a \), and solve for \( a \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
5 = 6 + a
\]

\[
a = 5 - 6 = -1
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( a = -1 \) makes the function continuous at \( x = 3 \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( a = -1 \) into the function, recompute \( f(3) \), and check if \( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = f(3) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With \( a = -1 \), the function becomes:

\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x + 2 & \text{if } x > 3, \\
2x - 1 & \text{if } x \leq 3.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

- Right-hand limit:

\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = 3 + 2 = 5
\]

- Left-hand limit:

\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]

- Function value at \( x = 3 \):

\[
f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 5
\]

Since \( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = f(3) = 5 \), the function is continuous at \( x = 3 \).
[/IMP]
