**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( a \) that makes the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} x + 2 & \text{if } x > 3, \\ 2x + a & \text{if } x \leq 3 \end{cases} \) continuous. A function is continuous at a point if the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at that point are equal. Since this is a piecewise function with a transition at \( x = 3 \), we need to ensure continuity at \( x = 3 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( a \), we need to ensure the function is continuous at \( x = 3 \). This involves the following subgoals:  
1. Compute the right-hand limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 3^+ \).  
2. Compute the left-hand limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 3^- \).  
3. Compute the function value at \( x = 3 \).  
4. Set the left-hand limit equal to the right-hand limit and the function value to ensure continuity.  
5. Solve for \( a \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the right-hand limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 3^+ \).  
**How to Achieve**: For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = x + 2 \). Evaluate the limit as \( x \) approaches 3 from the right using this expression.  

[IMP]  
For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = x + 2 \). The right-hand limit is:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} (x + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the left-hand limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 3^- \).  
**How to Achieve**: For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 2x + a \). Evaluate the limit as \( x \) approaches 3 from the left using this expression.  

[IMP]  
For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 2x + a \). The left-hand limit is:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} (2x + a) = 2 \cdot 3 + a = 6 + a.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the function value at \( x = 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( x = 3 \) falls in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), use \( f(x) = 2x + a \) to evaluate \( f(3) \).  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 3 \), \( f(x) = 2x + a \). Thus:  
\[
f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + a = 6 + a.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure continuity at \( x = 3 \) by setting the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal.  
**How to Achieve**: For continuity at \( x = 3 \), we need \( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = f(3) \). Set the expressions from previous steps equal and solve for \( a \).  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the right-hand limit is:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = 5.
\]  
From Step 3, the left-hand limit is:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = 6 + a.
\]  
From Step 4, the function value is:  
\[
f(3) = 6 + a.
\]  
For continuity, set the limits and function value equal:  
\[
6 + a = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 6 + a = f(3) = 6 + a.
\]  
Solving \( 6 + a = 5 \):  
\[
a = 5 - 6 = -1.
\]  
Since \( f(3) = 6 + a = 6 + (-1) = 5 \), the function value matches the right-hand limit, confirming continuity at \( x = 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = -1 \) makes the function continuous at \( x = 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = -1 \) into the function, recompute the limits and function value at \( x = 3 \), and check if they are equal.  

[IMP]  
With \( a = -1 \), the function is:  
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x + 2 & \text{if } x > 3, \\ 
2x - 1 & \text{if } x \leq 3.
\end{cases}
\]  
- Right-hand limit:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} (x + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]  
- Left-hand limit:  
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} (2x - 1) = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
\]  
- Function value:  
\[
f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
\]  
Since \( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = f(3) = 5 \), the function is continuous at \( x = 3 \).
