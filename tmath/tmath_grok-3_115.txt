### Problem Restatement
We need to find the greatest value of \( b \) such that the quadratic inequality \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\) holds for all real numbers \( b \). Since this is an inequality involving a quadratic expression, we interpret "for all real numbers \( b \)" as finding the maximum \( b \) within the solution set where the inequality is satisfied.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the inequality \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Rewrite the inequality in a standard quadratic form.
2. Find the roots of the corresponding equation to determine the solution interval.
3. Analyze the quadratic to identify the solution set for \( b \).
4. Determine the greatest value of \( b \) within this set.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the inequality and set up the quadratic equation.
Description: Multiply both sides of \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\) by \(-1\) (reversing the inequality) to get a positive leading coefficient, then solve the equation \( b^2 - 7b + 10 = 0 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the inequality:
\[
-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0
\]
Multiply by \(-1\):
\[
b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b^2 - 7b + 10 = 0
\]
Factorize:
\[
(b - 2)(b - 5) = 0
\]
Roots are \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the solution set for the inequality \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \).
Description: Since the quadratic \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \) has a positive leading coefficient, it opens upward. Test intervals defined by the roots \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \) to find where the inequality holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The roots are \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \). The quadratic \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \) is a parabola opening upward, so it is non-positive (\(\leq 0\)) between the roots, including the endpoints.

Test intervals:
- For \( b < 2 \), e.g., \( b = 1 \):
  \[
  (1)^2 - 7(1) + 10 = 1 - 7 + 10 = 4 > 0
  \]
- For \( 2 < b < 5 \), e.g., \( b = 3 \):
  \[
  (3)^2 - 7(3) + 10 = 9 - 21 + 10 = -2 < 0
  \]
- For \( b > 5 \), e.g., \( b = 6 \):
  \[
  (6)^2 - 7(6) + 10 = 36 - 42 + 10 = 4 > 0
  \]
At the roots:
- For \( b = 2 \): \( (2)^2 - 7(2) + 10 = 4 - 14 + 10 = 0 \)
- For \( b = 5 \): \( (5)^2 - 7(5) + 10 = 25 - 35 + 10 = 0 \)

Thus, \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \) holds for \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure alignment and identify the current goal:
- Main goal: Find the greatest \( b \) such that \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\).
- Subgoal 1: Rewrite inequality (completed).
- Subgoal 2: Solve quadratic equation (completed).
- Subgoal 3: Find solution set (completed: \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \)).
- Current goal: Identify the greatest \( b \) in the solution set.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main goal: Find the greatest \( b \) such that \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\).
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite inequality as \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \) (Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( b^2 - 7b + 10 = 0 \), roots at \( b = 2, 5 \) (Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Determine solution set, found \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \) (Step 3).
Current Goal: Identify the greatest \( b \) within \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the greatest \( b \) in the solution set \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \).
Description: Since the solution set is the interval \( [2, 5] \), the greatest value of \( b \) is the upper bound.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solution set is \( 2 \leq b \leq 5 \). The greatest value of \( b \) is:
\[
b = 5
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( b = 5 \) is the greatest value satisfying the inequality.
Description: Substitute \( b = 5 \) into the original inequality to confirm it holds, and test a value slightly greater than 5 to ensure the inequality fails.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( b = 5 \):
\[
-(5)^2 + 7(5) - 10 = -25 + 35 - 10 = 0
\]
Since \( 0 \geq 0 \), the inequality holds at \( b = 5 \).

For \( b = 5.1 \):
\[
-(5.1)^2 + 7(5.1) - 10 = -(26.01) + 35.7 - 10 = -0.31 < 0
\]
Since \(-0.31 < 0\), the inequality does not hold for \( b > 5 \).

Thus, \( b = 5 \) is the greatest value.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The greatest value of \( b \) such that \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\) is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
