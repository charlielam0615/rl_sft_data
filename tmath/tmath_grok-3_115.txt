**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the inequality \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the inequality in a standard form.  
2. Solve the corresponding equation \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 = 0\) to find the boundary points.  
3. Determine the intervals where the inequality holds by analyzing the quadratic function.  
4. Identify the greatest value of \( b \) from the solution set.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the inequality and solve the equation \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 = 0\) to find the boundary points.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the inequality by \(-1\) (reversing the inequality sign) to simplify, then solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the inequality \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\). Multiply both sides by \(-1\), reversing the inequality:  
\[ b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0. \]  
Solve the equation \( b^2 - 7b + 10 = 0 \):  
Using the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 1 \), \( B = -7 \), \( C = 10 \):  
\[ b = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 40}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 3}{2}. \]  
Roots are:  
\[ b = \frac{7 + 3}{2} = 5, \quad b = \frac{7 - 3}{2} = 2. \]  
The boundary points are \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the intervals where \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the quadratic \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \) has a positive leading coefficient, the parabola opens upward. Test intervals defined by the roots \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \) to find where the expression is non-positive.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \) has roots at \( b = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \). Test intervals: \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( [2, 5] \), \( (5, \infty) \).  
- At \( b = 1 \) (in \( (-\infty, 2) \)): \( 1^2 - 7 \cdot 1 + 10 = 1 - 7 + 10 = 4 > 0 \).  
- At \( b = 3 \) (in \( [2, 5] \)): \( 3^2 - 7 \cdot 3 + 10 = 9 - 21 + 10 = -2 < 0 \).  
- At \( b = 6 \) (in \( (5, \infty) \)): \( 6^2 - 7 \cdot 6 + 10 = 36 - 42 + 10 = 4 > 0 \).  
Since the parabola opens upward, \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \) holds between the roots, including the endpoints: \( b \in [2, 5] \).

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest \( b \) such that \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite inequality (completed: \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve quadratic equation (completed: roots at \( b = 2, 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine intervals where inequality holds (completed: \( b \in [2, 5] \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the greatest \( b \) (current).  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest \( b \) from the solution set \( [2, 5] \).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest value of \( b \) from the solution set \( [2, 5] \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the solution set is the closed interval \( [2, 5] \), the greatest value is the upper bound.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The inequality \( b^2 - 7b + 10 \leq 0 \) holds for \( b \in [2, 5] \). The greatest value of \( b \) in this interval is \( b = 5 \).  
Verify: At \( b = 5 \), \(-5^2 + 7 \cdot 5 - 10 = -25 + 35 - 10 = 0 \), which satisfies \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greatest value of \( b \) such that \(-b^2 + 7b - 10 \geq 0\) is \( b = 5 \).
