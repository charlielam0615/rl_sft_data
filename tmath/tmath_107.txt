Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the missing endpoint.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The midpoint formula is given by:  
$$
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$  
Let $(x, y)$ be the coordinates of the missing endpoint. Since the midpoint is $(1, -2)$ and one endpoint is $(4, 5)$, we can set up the following equations:  
$$
\frac{4 + x}{2} = 1 \quad \text{(1)}
$$  
$$
\frac{5 + y}{2} = -2 \quad \text{(2)}
$$  
These equations can be solved to find $x$ and $y$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equations to find the missing coordinates $x$ and $y$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We will solve the equations step by step.  

From Equation (1):  
$$
\frac{4 + x}{2} = 1
$$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$
4 + x = 2
$$  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
$$
x = 2 - 4 = -2
$$  

From Equation (2):  
$$
\frac{5 + y}{2} = -2
$$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$
5 + y = -4
$$  
Subtract 5 from both sides:  
$$
y = -4 - 5 = -9
$$  

Thus, the missing endpoint is $(-2, -9)$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the solution for finding the missing endpoint using the midpoint formula.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Midpoint formula correctness**: The midpoint formula is correctly recalled as $\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)$.  
2. **Equation setup**:  
   - For $x$-coordinate: $\frac{4 + x}{2} = 1$ simplifies to $x = -2$.  
   - For $y$-coordinate: $\frac{5 + y}{2} = -2$ simplifies to $y = -9$.  
   Both equations are algebraically valid.  
3. **Final answer validation**: Plugging $(-2, -9)$ and $(4, 5)$ into the midpoint formula:  
   $$
   \left( \frac{4 + (-2)}{2}, \frac{5 + (-9)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2}, \frac{-4}{2} \right) = (1, -2)
   $$  
   This matches the given midpoint, confirming the solution is correct.  
4. **No logical gaps**: All steps logically follow without missing components.
