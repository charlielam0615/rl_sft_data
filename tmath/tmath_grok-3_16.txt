**Problem Statement**: The sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is 10, and the fifth term is 5. We need to find the sixth term.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the sixth term, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the arithmetic sequence using the general form.  
2. Use the given sum of the first four terms to set up an equation.  
3. Use the fifth term to set up another equation.  
4. Solve the system of equations to find the first term and common difference.  
5. Calculate the sixth term using the arithmetic sequence formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define the arithmetic sequence and set up equations for the given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Represent the sequence as \( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference. Use the sum of the first four terms (\( 10 \)) to write the equation \( a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 10 \). Use the fifth term (\( 5 \)) to write the equation \( a+4d = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The arithmetic sequence is \( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, \ldots \).  
- Sum of the first four terms:  
  \( a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 4a + 6d = 10 \)  
- Fifth term:  
  \( a + 4d = 5 \)  
We now have the system of equations:  
1. \( 4a + 6d = 10 \)  
2. \( a + 4d = 5 \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( d \).  
How to Achieve: Solve the second equation for \( a \) in terms of \( d \), substitute into the first equation, and solve for \( d \). Then, find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the second equation:  
\( a + 4d = 5 \implies a = 5 - 4d \)  
Substitute into the first equation:  
\( 4a + 6d = 10 \implies 4(5 - 4d) + 6d = 10 \)  
\( 20 - 16d + 6d = 10 \implies 20 - 10d = 10 \implies -10d = -10 \implies d = 1 \)  
Now, find \( a \):  
\( a = 5 - 4(1) = 5 - 4 = 1 \)  
Thus, \( a = 1 \), \( d = 1 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the values of \( a \) and \( d \) satisfy the given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Check if \( a = 1 \), \( d = 1 \) satisfy the sum of the first four terms (\( 10 \)) and the fifth term (\( 5 \)).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sequence: \( a = 1 \), \( d = 1 \implies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots \)  
- Sum of first four terms:  
  \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \), which matches.  
- Fifth term:  
  \( a + 4d = 1 + 4(1) = 5 \), which matches.  
The values \( a = 1 \), \( d = 1 \) are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sixth term of the sequence.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the \( n \)-th term, \( a_n = a + (n-1)d \), with \( n = 6 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( d = 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sixth term:  
\( a_6 = a + (6-1)d = 1 + 5(1) = 1 + 5 = 6 \)  
The sixth term is \( 6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the sixth term (completed).  
Current Goal: Completed â€” the sixth term is \( 6 \).

**Final Answer**: The sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \( 6 \).
