**Problem Restatement**: The sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is 10, and the fifth term is 5. We need to find the sixth term.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the sixth term, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the arithmetic sequence using the first term \(a\) and common difference \(d\).  
2. Use the given sum of the first four terms (10) to form an equation.  
3. Use the fifth term (5) to form another equation.  
4. Solve the system of equations to find \(a\) and \(d\).  
5. Calculate the sixth term using the sequence formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations using the given information about the sum of the first four terms and the fifth term. Achieve this by expressing the terms of the arithmetic sequence in terms of \(a\) and \(d\), then forming equations based on the problem's conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
An arithmetic sequence has the form \(a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots\).  
- The first four terms are \(a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d\). Their sum is 10:  
  \[
  a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 10
  \]
  Simplify:  
  \[
  4a + 6d = 10 \quad (1)
  \]
- The fifth term is \(a+4d = 5 \quad (2)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations from Step 2 to find \(a\) and \(d\). Achieve this by using substitution or elimination to determine the values of \(a\) and \(d\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From equation (2): \(a + 4d = 5 \implies a = 5 - 4d\).  
Substitute into equation (1):  
\[
4(5 - 4d) + 6d = 10
\]
Simplify:  
\[
20 - 16d + 6d = 10 \implies 20 - 10d = 10 \implies -10d = -10 \implies d = 1
\]
Substitute \(d = 1\) into \(a = 5 - 4d\):  
\[
a = 5 - 4(1) = 1
\]
Thus, \(a = 1\), \(d = 1\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the values of \(a\) and \(d\) by checking if they satisfy the given conditions (sum of first four terms = 10, fifth term = 5). Achieve this by computing the terms and sum using \(a = 1\), \(d = 1\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sequence: \(a = 1\), \(d = 1\), so terms are \(1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4, 4+1=5, \ldots\).  
- Sum of first four terms: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\), which matches.  
- Fifth term: \(a + 4d = 1 + 4(1) = 5\), which matches.  
The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The final goal is to find the sixth term. Achieve this by using the sequence formula \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\) with \(n = 6\), \(a = 1\), and \(d = 1\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sixth term: \(a_6 = a + (6-1)d = 1 + 5(1) = 1 + 5 = 6\).  
The sixth term is 6.
