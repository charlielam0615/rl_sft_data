Goal of this step: Consider the definition of absolute value and set up both positive and negative scenarios.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The absolute value equation $|x - 5| = 12$ implies two cases:
1. $x - 5 = 12$
2. $x - 5 = -12$

We will solve these equations to find the possible values of $x$.

Goal of this step: Solve each resulting linear equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
1. For $x - 5 = 12$, solving for $x$ gives:  
   $x = 12 + 5 = 17$.  

2. For $x - 5 = -12$, solving for $x$ gives:  
   $x = -12 + 5 = -7$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Breakdown**: The absolute value equation |x - 5| = 12 correctly splits into two cases:  
   - Case 1: $x - 5 = 12$ → $x = 17$  
   - Case 2: $x - 5 = -12$ → $x = -7$  
   This aligns with the definition of absolute value ($|A| = B$ implies $A = B$ or $A = -B$ for $B \geq 0$).  

2. **Solution Validity**:  
   - Substituting $x = 17$ into the original equation: $|17 - 5| = |12| = 12$ ✔️  
   - Substituting $x = -7$: $|-7 - 5| = |-12| = 12$ ✔️  

3. **Comparison of Solutions**: $17 > -7$, so the largest value is correctly identified as $17$.  

No errors detected in reasoning, calculations, or final selection.
