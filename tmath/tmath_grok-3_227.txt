**Problem Statement**: We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
ax + 3 & \text{if } x > 0, \\
ab & \text{if } x = 0, \\
bx + c & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]

We are also given the conditions \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \), with \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) being nonnegative integers. The goal is to find the value of \( a + b + c \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), break down the problem into subgoals based on the given conditions. Each condition provides an equation involving the unknowns. The subgoals are:
1. Use \( f(2) = 5 \) to form an equation for \( x > 0 \).
2. Use \( f(0) = 5 \) to form an equation for \( x = 0 \).
3. Use \( f(-2) = -10 \) to form an equation for \( x < 0 \).
4. Solve the resulting system of equations.
5. Ensure \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are nonnegative integers.
6. Compute \( a + b + c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to form equations using the given conditions for \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \). This will be achieved by applying the piecewise function definitions to each condition.

[IMP]  
Using the piecewise function:
- For \( x = 2 > 0 \), \( f(2) = a \cdot 2 + 3 = 2a + 3 \). Given \( f(2) = 5 \), we have:
  \[
  2a + 3 = 5 \implies 2a = 2 \implies a = 1.
  \]
- For \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = ab \). Given \( f(0) = 5 \), we have:
  \[
  ab = 5.
  \]
- For \( x = -2 < 0 \), \( f(-2) = b \cdot (-2) + c = -2b + c \). Given \( f(-2) = -10 \), we have:
  \[
  -2b + c = -10.
  \]
Thus, the system of equations is:
1. \( a = 1 \)
2. \( ab = 5 \)
3. \( -2b + c = -10 \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), ensuring they are nonnegative integers. This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 1 \) into the second equation and solving for \( b \), then using \( b \) in the third equation to find \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the equations:
- \( a = 1 \).
- Substitute \( a = 1 \) into \( ab = 5 \):
  \[
  1 \cdot b = 5 \implies b = 5.
  \]
- Substitute \( b = 5 \) into \( -2b + c = -10 \):
  \[
  -2 \cdot 5 + c = -10 \implies -10 + c = -10 \implies c = 0.
  \]
Thus, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 0 \), and all are nonnegative integers.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 0 \) satisfy all given conditions. This will be achieved by substituting these values into the piecewise function and checking \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 0 \):
- For \( x = 2 \):
  \[
  f(2) = 1 \cdot 2 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5. \quad \text{(Satisfies \( f(2) = 5 \))}
  \]
- For \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  f(0) = 1 \cdot 5 = 5. \quad \text{(Satisfies \( f(0) = 5 \))}
  \]
- For \( x = -2 \):
  \[
  f(-2) = 5 \cdot (-2) + 0 = -10 + 0 = -10. \quad \text{(Satisfies \( f(-2) = -10 \))}
  \]
All conditions are satisfied.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( a + b + c \). This will be achieved by adding the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 0 \):
\[
a + b + c = 1 + 5 + 0 = 6.
\]  
[/IMP]
