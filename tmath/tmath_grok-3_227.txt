**Problem Statement**: We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} ax + 3 & \text{if } x > 0, \\ ab & \text{if } x = 0, \\ bx + c & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases} \), with conditions \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are nonnegative integers. We need to find the value of \( a + b + c \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
- Subgoal 1: Use the given conditions to set up equations based on the piecewise function.  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
- Subgoal 3: Ensure \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are nonnegative integers.  
- Subgoal 4: Compute \( a + b + c \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up equations using the given conditions \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \).  
Description: Evaluate the piecewise function at each given point to create a system of equations based on the definition of \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- For \( x = 2 \): Since \( 2 > 0 \), use \( f(x) = ax + 3 \). Given \( f(2) = 5 \), we have:  
  \( a \cdot 2 + 3 = 5 \implies 2a + 3 = 5 \implies 2a = 2 \implies a = 1 \).  
- For \( x = 0 \): Since \( x = 0 \), use \( f(x) = ab \). Given \( f(0) = 5 \), we have:  
  \( ab = 5 \).  
- For \( x = -2 \): Since \( -2 < 0 \), use \( f(x) = bx + c \). Given \( f(-2) = -10 \), we have:  
  \( b \cdot (-2) + c = -10 \implies -2b + c = -10 \).  
The system of equations is:  
1. \( a = 1 \)  
2. \( ab = 5 \)  
3. \( -2b + c = -10 \)

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
Description: Substitute \( a = 1 \) into the second equation to find \( b \), then use \( b \) in the third equation to find \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- From equation 1: \( a = 1 \).  
- Substitute \( a = 1 \) into equation 2: \( ab = 5 \implies 1 \cdot b = 5 \implies b = 5 \).  
- Substitute \( b = 5 \) into equation 3: \( -2b + c = -10 \implies -2 \cdot 5 + c = -10 \implies -10 + c = -10 \implies c = 0 \).  
Thus, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 0 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 0 \) satisfy all given conditions and the nonnegative integer constraint.  
Description: Substitute \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) back into the piecewise function and check if \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(0) = 5 \), and \( f(-2) = -10 \), and confirm that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are nonnegative integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Check \( f(2) \): Since \( 2 > 0 \), \( f(2) = a \cdot 2 + 3 = 1 \cdot 2 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \). Satisfied.  
- Check \( f(0) \): Since \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = ab = 1 \cdot 5 = 5 \). Satisfied.  
- Check \( f(-2) \): Since \( -2 < 0 \), \( f(-2) = b \cdot (-2) + c = 5 \cdot (-2) + 0 = -10 \). Satisfied.  
- Check nonnegativity: \( a = 1 \geq 0 \), \( b = 5 \geq 0 \), \( c = 0 \geq 0 \). All are nonnegative integers.  
The solution \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 0 \) is valid.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( a + b + c \).  
Description: Add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to find the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 0 \).  
\( a + b + c = 1 + 5 + 0 = 6 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
