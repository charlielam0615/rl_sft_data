**Problem Statement**: We need to find the probability that when six 6-sided dice are rolled, the number of dice showing even numbers equals the number of dice showing odd numbers. Since each die has 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the even numbers are {2, 4, 6} and the odd numbers are {1, 3, 5}. For the counts to be equal, exactly 3 dice must show even numbers and 3 dice must show odd numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly 3 dice show even numbers and 3 dice show odd numbers.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent, so we compute the total outcomes by multiplying the number of faces for each die.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 6 possible outcomes (faces 1 through 6). Since there are 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
\[ 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 46656. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where exactly 3 dice show even numbers and 3 dice show odd numbers. This involves choosing 3 dice to show even numbers, with the remaining 3 showing odd numbers, and determining the probability of each outcome.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 3 even faces (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd faces (1, 3, 5), so the probability of rolling an even number or an odd number is:  
\[ P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P(\text{odd}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}. \]  
We need exactly 3 dice to show even numbers. The number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = \frac{720}{6 \times 6} = 20. \]  
For each of these 20 combinations, each of the 3 chosen dice must show an even number (probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) per die), and each of the remaining 3 dice must show an odd number (probability \(\frac{1}{2}\) per die). Since the dice rolls are independent, the probability for each combination is:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}. \]  
Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}. \]  
Alternatively, in terms of outcomes, each die has 3 even faces, so the 3 even dice contribute \(3^3 = 27\) outcomes, and the 3 odd dice contribute \(3^3 = 27\) outcomes. Thus, for each combination:  
\[ 3^3 \times 3^3 = 27 \times 27 = 729. \]  
Total favorable outcomes:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} \times 3^3 \times 3^3 = 20 \times 729 = 14580. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of favorable outcomes by ensuring the combinatorial and probability calculations are correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the binomial coefficient:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20. \]  
Confirm the probability per die: Each die has 3 even and 3 odd faces, so \(P(\text{even}) = P(\text{odd}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).  
Check the favorable outcomes:  
- Total outcomes for 3 even and 3 odd: \(3^3 \times 3^3 = 729\).  
- With \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\), total favorable outcomes = \(20 \times 729 = 14580\).  
Cross-check with the probability approach:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}. \]  
This matches the expected form of the probability, confirming correctness.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total outcomes: \(6^6 = 46656\).  
Favorable outcomes: \(14580\).  
Probability:  
\[ \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{14580}{46656}. \]  
Simplify the fraction:  
\[ \gcd(14580, 46656) = 2916, \]  
\[ \frac{14580 \div 2916}{46656 \div 2916} = \frac{5}{16}. \]  
Alternatively, from Step 3â€™s probability approach:  
\[ \binom{6}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{5}{16}. \]  
Both methods agree, so the probability is \(\frac{5}{16}\).
