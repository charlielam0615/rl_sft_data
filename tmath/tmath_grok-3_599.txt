**Problem Statement**: Calculate the probability that when six 6-sided dice are rolled, the number of dice showing even numbers equals the number of dice showing odd numbers. Since each die has 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and the odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. For the counts to be equal with six dice, exactly 3 dice must show even numbers, and 3 dice must show odd numbers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into subgoals to compute the probability:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice.  
2. Identify the favorable outcomes where exactly 3 dice show even numbers (and thus 3 show odd numbers).  
3. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice.  
**How to Achieve**: Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent. The total number of outcomes is 6 raised to the power of the number of dice (6^6).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Each of the six dice can land on any of its 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Since the dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
\[ 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 46656. \]  
So, there are 46,656 possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the number of favorable outcomes where exactly 3 dice show even numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the binomial coefficient to find the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to show even numbers, then multiply by the number of ways each selected die can be even and each unselected die can be odd.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- A 6-sided die has 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5).  
- The probability of a die showing an even number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of showing an odd number is also 1/2.  
- We need exactly 3 dice to show even numbers (and thus 3 to show odd numbers).  
- The number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:  
  \[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = \frac{720}{6 \times 6} = 20. \]  
- For each of the 3 chosen dice, there are 3 ways to get an even number (2, 4, or 6), so the number of ways for these 3 dice to be even is \( 3^3 = 27 \).  
- For the remaining 3 dice, there are 3 ways to get an odd number (1, 3, or 5), so the number of ways for these 3 dice to be odd is \( 3^3 = 27 \).  
- Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes is:  
  \[ \binom{6}{3} \times 3^3 \times 3^3 = 20 \times 27 \times 27 = 20 \times 729 = 14580. \]  
So, there are 14,580 favorable outcomes.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of favorable outcomes.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the binomial coefficient and probabilities, and consider an alternative approach (e.g., binomial probability) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Check binomial coefficient**:  
  \[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20 \] (correct).  
- **Check probabilities**: Each die has 3 even and 3 odd outcomes, so the probability of even or odd is 1/2, and the number of ways for 3 dice to be even is \( 3^3 = 27 \), and for 3 dice to be odd is \( 3^3 = 27 \).  
- **Alternative approach**: Use the binomial probability formula. The probability of exactly 3 even numbers in 6 dice rolls, where each die has a probability of 1/2 for even, is:  
  \[ P(X = 3) = \binom{6}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 20 \times \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{8} = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}. \]  
- The number of favorable outcomes is then:  
  \[ \frac{5}{16} \times 6^6 = \frac{5}{16} \times 46656 = 5 \times 2916 = 14580, \]  
  which matches the previous calculation (14,580).  
The calculations are consistent across methods, confirming correctness.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the final probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{14580}{46656}. \]  
Simplify the fraction:  
- Divide numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. First, try dividing by 4:  
  \[ 14580 \div 4 = 3645, \quad 46656 \div 4 = 11664. \]  
- Check if 3645 and 11664 can be simplified further. Factorize:  
  - \( 3645 = 5 \times 729 = 5 \times 3^6 \).  
  - \( 11664 = 16 \times 729 = 2^4 \times 3^6 \).  
- Divide both by 729:  
  \[ 3645 \div 729 = 5, \quad 11664 \div 729 = 16. \]  
- The fraction is now \( \frac{5}{16} \), which is in simplest form (5 is prime, 16 = 2^4, no common factors).  
Thus, the probability is:  
\[ \frac{5}{16} \approx 0.3125. \]
