Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor the quadratic expression $ x^2 - 7x + 6 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factor $ x^2 - 7x + 6 $, we look for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to -7 (the coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are -1 and -6. Thus, the quadratic expression can be factored as:  

$$
x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6)
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the intervals where the quadratic expression $ (x - 1)(x - 6) < 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The roots of the equation $ (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0 $ are $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 6 $. These divide the real number line into three intervals:  

1. $ (-\infty, 1) $  
2. $ (1, 6) $  
3. $ (6, \infty) $  

We now test each interval to determine where the expression is negative ($< 0$).  

- **Interval $ (-\infty, 1) $:** Choose $ x = 0 $:  
  $$
  (0 - 1)(0 - 6) = (-1)(-6) = 6 > 0
  $$  
  The expression is positive in this interval.  

- **Interval $ (1, 6) $:** Choose $ x = 3 $:  
  $$
  (3 - 1)(3 - 6) = (2)(-3) = -6 < 0
  $$  
  The expression is negative in this interval.  

- **Interval $ (6, \infty) $:** Choose $ x = 7 $:  
  $$
  (7 - 1)(7 - 6) = (6)(1) = 6 > 0
  $$  
  The expression is positive in this interval.  

Thus, the inequality $ x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 $ is satisfied in the interval $ (1, 6) $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Factoring Verification**:  
   The quadratic $ x^2 - 7x + 6 $ is factored as $ (x - 1)(x - 6) $.  
   - Multiply $ (x - 1)(x - 6) = x^2 - 6x - x + 6 = x^2 - 7x + 6 $, which matches the original expression.  
   - The coefficients and signs are correct.  

2. **Roots and Intervals Verification**:  
   - The roots $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 6 $ are correctly derived from $ (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0 $.  
   - The intervals $ (-\infty, 1) $, $ (1, 6) $, and $ (6, \infty) $ are logically determined based on these roots.  

3. **Sign Testing Verification**:  
   - For $ (-\infty, 1) $, choosing $ x = 0 $:  
     $ (0 - 1)(0 - 6) = (-1)(-6) = 6 > 0 $ → Correct.  
   - For $ (1, 6) $, choosing $ x = 3 $:  
     $ (3 - 1)(3 - 6) = (2)(-3) = -6 < 0 $ → Correct.  
   - For $ (6, \infty) $, choosing $ x = 7 $:  
     $ (7 - 1)(7 - 6) = (6)(1) = 6 > 0 $ → Correct.  

4. **Final Interval Notation Verification**:  
   - The inequality $ x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 $ holds where the expression is negative, which is $ (1, 6) $.  
   - The endpoints $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 6 $ are excluded because the inequality is strict ($<$).  

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically correct. No errors detected.
