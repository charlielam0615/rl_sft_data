**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute the given values \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression.  
2. Simplify the expression step-by-step to compute the final value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression \( y(y - 3x) \) and compute the result. This will be achieved by plugging in the values and simplifying the expression using basic arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression:  
\[ y(y - 3x) = 0 \cdot (0 - 3 \cdot 3) \]  
First, compute the inner expression:  
\[ 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]  
\[ 0 - 9 = -9 \]  
Now compute the outer expression:  
\[ 0 \cdot (-9) = 0 \]  
The result is \( 0 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computed result (\( 0 \)) by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps. This will be achieved by repeating the substitution and simplification process to ensure no errors were made.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the expression \( y(y - 3x) \) with \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \):  
\[ y(y - 3x) = 0 \cdot (0 - 3 \cdot 3) \]  
Inner expression:  
\[ 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]  
\[ 0 - 9 = -9 \]  
Outer expression:  
\[ 0 \cdot (-9) = 0 \]  
The recomputed result is \( 0 \), which matches the previous result, confirming the calculation is correct.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression to compute the final value (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computed result (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final result and conclude the evaluation. The result \( 0 \) has been computed and validated.

### Final Answer
The value of \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) is \( 0 \).
