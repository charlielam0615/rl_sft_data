**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Substitute the given values \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression \( y(y - 3x) \).
2. Simplify the expression step-by-step to compute the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into \( y(y - 3x) \) and compute the result.
How to Achieve: Replace \( x \) and \( y \) with their given values, then perform the arithmetic operations following the order of operations.

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression:
\[ y(y - 3x) = 0(0 - 3 \cdot 3) \]
Calculate inside the parentheses first:
\[ 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]
\[ 0 - 9 = -9 \]
Now compute:
\[ 0 \cdot (-9) = 0 \]
The result is \( 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed result.
How to Achieve: Recompute the expression with the given values and check if the result matches the previous computation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
\[ y(y - 3x) = 0(0 - 3 \cdot 3) \]
\[ 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]
\[ 0 - 9 = -9 \]
\[ 0 \cdot (-9) = 0 \]
The result is \( 0 \), which matches the previous computation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( y(y - 3x) \) for \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the expression (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression to compute the result (completed, result = 0).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed, verified result = 0).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
The final result is \( 0 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( 0 \)
