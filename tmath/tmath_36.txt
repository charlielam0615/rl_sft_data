Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the largest cube factor of 2700 using its prime factorization $2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the prime factorization $2700 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2$, we can extract cube factors by taking powers of 3 in the exponents.  

- $3^3$ is a cube factor.
- $2^2$ and $5^2$ are not cube factors because their exponents are less than 3.  

The largest cube factor is $3^3 = 27$.  

Now, we can simplify $\sqrt[3]{2700}$ as follows:  
$$
\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{27 \cdot 100} = \sqrt[3]{27} \cdot \sqrt[3]{100} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{100}
$$  
Thus, the simplified form is $3\sqrt[3]{100}$, where $a = 3$ and $b = 100$.  

Next, we compute $a + b = 3 + 100 = 103$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Prime Factorization Verification**:  
   The original number is 2700. The given prime factorization is $2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2$.  
   - $2^2 = 4$, $3^3 = 27$, $5^2 = 25$.  
   - Multiplying these: $4 \cdot 27 = 108$, $108 \cdot 25 = 2700$.  
   This confirms the prime factorization is correct.

2. **Largest Cube Factor Extraction**:  
   From $2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2$, the only exponent divisible by 3 is $3^3$.  
   - $3^3 = 27$ is the largest cube factor.  
   - $2700 / 27 = 100$, and $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$.  
   - No further cube factors exist in 100 (since exponents 2 and 2 are not divisible by 3).  
   This confirms $b = 100$ is the smallest possible.

3. **Simplification and Final Values**:  
   - $\sqrt[3]{2700} = \sqrt[3]{27 \cdot 100} = \sqrt[3]{27} \cdot \sqrt[3]{100} = 3\sqrt[3]{100}$.  
   - $a = 3$, $b = 100$, so $a + b = 103$.  
   All steps align with mathematical rules for simplifying cube roots.

No inconsistencies or errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The solution is consistent and adheres to the problem constraints.
