### Problem Restatement
We need to determine for how many values of \( x \) the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is undefined. An expression is undefined when its denominator is zero, so we must find all values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero and account for any simplifications that might affect the result.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Identify the denominator of the expression.  
2. Simplify the expression, if possible, to check for cancellations that might affect where the expression is undefined.  
3. Find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero after simplification.  
4. Verify that these values do not also make the numerator zero (to account for potential removable discontinuities).  
5. Count the distinct values of \( x \) that result in an undefined expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the denominator of the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\). To achieve this, extract the denominator directly from the given expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The denominator of the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is \((x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) to check for possible cancellations that could affect the denominator. Factorize the numerator and denominator, then simplify the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Numerator**: \( x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3) \), since it is a difference of squares.  
- **Denominator**:  
  - First term: \( x^2 + 2x - 3 \). Find factors of \(-3\) that add to \(2\): \(3\) and \(-1\). Thus, \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = (x + 3)(x - 1) \).  
  - Second term: \( x - 3 \).  
  - So, the denominator is \((x + 3)(x - 1)(x - 3)\).  
- **Expression**:  
  \[
  \frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{(x + 3)(x - 1)(x - 3)}
  \]  
- **Simplification**: Cancel the common factors \((x - 3)\) and \((x + 3)\), assuming \( x \neq 3 \) and \( x \neq -3 \), since these make the factors zero. The simplified expression is:  
  \[
  \frac{1}{x - 1}
  \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the values of \( x \) that make the simplified expression \(\frac{1}{x - 1}\) undefined. This occurs when the denominator of the simplified expression is zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The simplified expression is \(\frac{1}{x - 1}\). It is undefined when the denominator is zero:  
\[
x - 1 = 0 \implies x = 1
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the original expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is undefined at \( x = 1 \) and to check if the canceled values \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \) affect the result (e.g., removable discontinuities).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check \( x = 1 \)**:  
  - Numerator: \( x^2 - 9 = 1^2 - 9 = 1 - 9 = -8 \neq 0 \).  
  - Denominator: \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0 \); \( x - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 \neq 0 \).  
  - The denominator term \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \), so the original expression is undefined at \( x = 1 \).  
- **Check \( x = 3 \)**:  
  - Numerator: \( 3^2 - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0 \).  
  - Denominator: \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 - 3 = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \neq 0 \); \( x - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 \).  
  - Both numerator and denominator are zero, indicating a potential removable discontinuity. Evaluate the simplified expression \(\frac{1}{x - 1}\) at \( x = 3 \):  
    \[
    \frac{1}{3 - 1} = \frac{1}{2}
    \]  
    The simplified expression is defined at \( x = 3 \), so \( x = 3 \) is not a point where the original expression is undefined.  
- **Check \( x = -3 \)**:  
  - Numerator: \( (-3)^2 - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0 \).  
  - Denominator: \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = (-3)^2 + 2 \cdot (-3) - 3 = 9 - 6 - 3 = 0 \); \( x - 3 = -3 - 3 = -6 \neq 0 \).  
  - Both numerator and denominator are zero. Evaluate the simplified expression at \( x = -3 \):  
    \[
    \frac{1}{-3 - 1} = \frac{1}{-4} = -\frac{1}{4}
    \]  
    The simplified expression is defined at \( x = -3 \), so \( x = -3 \) is not a point where the original expression is undefined.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine for how many values of \( x \) the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is undefined.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the denominator (completed: \((x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression (completed: \(\frac{1}{x - 1}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find values where the simplified expression is undefined (completed: \( x = 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate if the original expression is undefined at \( x = 1 \) and check canceled values \( x = 3, -3 \) (completed: undefined at \( x = 1 \), defined at \( x = 3, -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Count distinct values (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Count the distinct values of \( x \) that make the original expression undefined.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the distinct values of \( x \) that make the original expression undefined, based on the validation that the expression is undefined at \( x = 1 \) and defined at \( x = 3, -3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the validation step, the original expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is undefined only at \( x = 1 \). Thus, there is exactly **1 value** of \( x \) for which the expression is undefined.  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The expression \(\frac{x^2 - 9}{(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3)}\) is undefined for **1 value** of \( x \).  
\[ \boxed{1} \]
