[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express both sides of the equation $4^6 = 8^n$ with the same base.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We can express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2.  
- $4 = 2^2$  
- $8 = 2^3$  

Substitute these into the equation:  
$$
(2^2)^6 = (2^3)^n
$$  

Simplify both sides using the power rule $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$:  
$$
2^{12} = 2^{3n}
$$  

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:  
$$
12 = 3n
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $n$ in the equation $12 = 3n$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve for $n$, divide both sides of the equation $12 = 3n$ by 3:  
$$
n = \frac{12}{3} = 4
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Base substitution verification**:  
   - $4 = 2^2$ and $8 = 2^3$ are correct representations.  
   - Substituting into the equation yields $(2^2)^6 = (2^3)^n$, which is mathematically valid.  

2. **Exponent simplification verification**:  
   - Applying $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$:  
     - Left side: $2^{2 \cdot 6} = 2^{12}$ ✔️  
     - Right side: $2^{3 \cdot n} = 2^{3n}$ ✔️  

3. **Equating exponents verification**:  
   - Since the bases are identical ($2$), equating exponents $12 = 3n$ is justified.  

4. **Solving for $n$**:  
   - Dividing both sides by 3: $n = \frac{12}{3} = 4$ ✔️  

All steps logically follow and are mathematically sound. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
