**Problem Statement**: Expand the product \( 3(x+4)(x+5) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of expanding \( 3(x+4)(x+5) \) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Expand the binomial product \( (x+4)(x+5) \).
2. Multiply the result by the constant 3.
3. Simplify the final expression if necessary.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Expand the binomial product \( (x+4)(x+5) \).
How to Achieve: Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to multiply the binomials.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the FOIL method to \( (x+4)(x+5) \):
- First: \( x \cdot x = x^2 \)
- Outer: \( x \cdot 5 = 5x \)
- Inner: \( 4 \cdot x = 4x \)
- Last: \( 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \)
Combine: \( x^2 + 5x + 4x + 20 \)
Simplify like terms: \( x^2 + 9x + 20 \)
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the result \( x^2 + 9x + 20 \) by the constant 3.
How to Achieve: Distribute the constant 3 to each term in the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute 3 to each term in \( x^2 + 9x + 20 \):
- \( 3 \cdot x^2 = 3x^2 \)
- \( 3 \cdot 9x = 27x \)
- \( 3 \cdot 20 = 60 \)
Result: \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \)
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the expanded expression \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \).
How to Achieve: Substitute a value for \( x \) into both the original expression \( 3(x+4)(x+5) \) and the expanded expression \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \), and compare the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose \( x = 1 \):
- Original: \( 3(x+4)(x+5) = 3(1+4)(1+5) = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 90 \)
- Expanded: \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 = 3(1^2) + 27(1) + 60 = 3 + 27 + 60 = 90 \)
Since both yield 90, the expansion is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Expand \( 3(x+4)(x+5) \)
  - Subgoal 1: Expand \( (x+4)(x+5) \) [Completed: Result \( x^2 + 9x + 20 \)]
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply by 3 [Completed: Result \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \)]
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify if necessary [Completed: Expression is simplified]
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result [Completed: Validated with \( x = 1 \)]
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The final expanded expression is \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The expanded product is \( 3x^2 + 27x + 60 \).
