### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to distribute six identical books such that some are in the library and some are checked out, with the condition that at least one book is in the library and at least one book is checked out. Since the books are indistinguishable, the only factor is the number of books in each location (library or checked out).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of ways to distribute the books.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the total number of books and the possible distributions between the library and checked out.  
- Subgoal 2: Apply the condition that at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out.  
- Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of valid distributions, considering the books are indistinguishable.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to distribute six identical books between the library and checked out, with at least one book in each location. Since the books are indistinguishable, we need to count the number of ways to choose how many books are in the library (the rest will be checked out), ensuring the constraints are met. This is a combinatorics problem solvable using combinations for indistinguishable items.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since the books are indistinguishable, the number of ways to distribute them depends on the number of books in the library (or equivalently, checked out). Let \( k \) be the number of books in the library. Then, \( 6 - k \) books are checked out. The condition requires at least one book in the library (\( k \geq 1 \)) and at least one checked out (\( 6 - k \geq 1 \), or \( k \leq 5 \)). Thus, \( k \) can range from 1 to 5.

For each value of \( k \), there is exactly one way to assign \( k \) indistinguishable books to the library and \( 6 - k \) to checked out, because the books are identical. Therefore, we count the possible values of \( k \):  
- \( k = 1 \): 1 book in library, 5 checked out.  
- \( k = 2 \): 2 books in library, 4 checked out.  
- \( k = 3 \): 3 books in library, 3 checked out.  
- \( k = 4 \): 4 books in library, 2 checked out.  
- \( k = 5 \): 5 books in library, 1 checked out.  

This gives 5 possible distributions (since \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 6 \) would violate the condition of having at least one book in each location).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the calculation of 5 possible distributions is correct by checking if all valid cases are covered and the constraints are satisfied.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, we reconsider the problem. We need to distribute 6 identical books into two groups (library and checked out), with at least one book in each. The number of books in the library (\( k \)) determines the distribution, and since the books are indistinguishable, each valid \( k \) (from 1 to 5) corresponds to exactly one unique way.  

Letâ€™s check the constraints:  
- For \( k = 0 \), all 6 books are checked out, leaving none in the library (invalid).  
- For \( k = 6 \), all 6 books are in the library, leaving none checked out (invalid).  
- For \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \), both conditions (at least one in library, at least one checked out) are satisfied.  

Thus, there are exactly 5 valid distributions. To ensure correctness, note that this is equivalent to finding the number of positive integer solutions to \( x + y = 6 \), where \( x \geq 1 \) (books in library) and \( y \geq 1 \) (books checked out). Substituting \( x' = x - 1 \), \( y' = y - 1 \), we solve \( x' + y' = 4 \), where \( x', y' \geq 0 \). The number of solutions is given by \( \binom{4 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \binom{5}{1} = 5 \), confirming our result.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the number of ways to distribute six identical books such that at least one is in the library and at least one is checked out.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the total number of books and possible distributions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the condition of at least one book in each location (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of valid distributions (completed, result: 5 ways).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculation (completed, confirmed 5 ways).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming all steps are complete and the answer is correct.

### Step 5: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the solution. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the calculation and validation of the number of distributions to ensure completeness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 1: Defined subgoals to break down the problem (identify distributions, apply constraints, calculate valid cases).  
- Step 2: Determined that for \( k = 1 \) to \( 5 \) books in the library, there is exactly one way per \( k \) due to indistinguishability, yielding 5 distributions.  
- Step 3: Validated the result using the constraints and an alternative combinatorial approach (\( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \)).  
- Step 4: Confirmed the goal hierarchy and that all subgoals were addressed.  

The recalled information supports the conclusion that there are 5 ways to distribute the books.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
There are 5 different ways to distribute six identical books such that at least one is in the library and at least one is checked out.
