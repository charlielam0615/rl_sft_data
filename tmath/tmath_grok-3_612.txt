### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to distribute six indistinguishable copies of a book between being in the library and being checked out, with the condition that at least one book is in the library and at least one book is checked out. Since the books are indistinguishable, the order of assignment does not matter, and we are counting the number of possible distributions based on the number of books in each state (in the library or checked out).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of ways to distribute six indistinguishable books such that at least one is in the library and at least one is checked out.

- **Subgoal 1**: Determine the total number of ways to distribute six indistinguishable books between two states (in the library or checked out) without any restrictions.
- **Subgoal 2**: Identify the cases that violate the conditions (i.e., all books in the library or all books checked out).
- **Subgoal 3**: Subtract the invalid cases from the total to get the number of valid distributions.
- **Subgoal 4**: Verify the solution to ensure all conditions are met.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total number of ways to distribute six indistinguishable books between being in the library and being checked out, without restrictions.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the books are indistinguishable, we need to find the number of ways to partition six books into two groups (in the library and checked out). This is equivalent to choosing the number of books in the library (the rest are checked out), which can be modeled as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \( x + y = 6 \), where \( x \) is the number of books in the library and \( y \) is the number of books checked out.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The number of non-negative integer solutions to \( x + y = 6 \) is given by the "stars and bars" theorem. We need to distribute 6 indistinguishable books (stars) into 2 distinct groups (library and checked out). The formula for the number of solutions to \( x + y = n \) is \( \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \), where \( n = 6 \) (books) and \( k = 2 \) (groups).  

\[
\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7
\]

So, there are 7 possible distributions, corresponding to the number of books in the library: \( x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) (and correspondingly, \( y = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 \)).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the cases that violate the conditions (i.e., all books in the library or all books checked out).  
**How to Achieve**: From the total distributions, determine which cases have either all books in the library (\( x = 6, y = 0 \)) or all books checked out (\( x = 0, y = 6 \)), as these do not satisfy the condition of having at least one book in each state.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous step, the possible distributions are when the number of books in the library (\( x \)) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The invalid cases are:  
- \( x = 6, y = 0 \): All books are in the library, none checked out.  
- \( x = 0, y = 6 \): All books are checked out, none in the library.  

There are exactly 2 invalid cases.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of valid distributions by subtracting the invalid cases from the total.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the number of invalid cases (from Step 3) from the total number of distributions (from Step 2).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total distributions (from Step 2): 7  
Invalid cases (from Step 3): 2  
Valid distributions: \( 7 - 2 = 5 \)  

The valid distributions correspond to \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \) books in the library (and \( y = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 \) books checked out, respectively).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the solution accounts for all valid distributions and satisfies the problem’s conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Check each valid distribution to ensure it meets the requirement of at least one book in the library and one checked out, and confirm the total count.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The valid distributions are when the number of books in the library is \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). Let’s verify:  
- \( x = 1, y = 5 \): 1 book in the library, 5 checked out. Satisfies both conditions.  
- \( x = 2, y = 4 \): 2 books in the library, 4 checked out. Satisfies both conditions.  
- \( x = 3, y = 3 \): 3 books in the library, 3 checked out. Satisfies both conditions.  
- \( x = 4, y = 2 \): 4 books in the library, 2 checked out. Satisfies both conditions.  
- \( x = 5, y = 1 \): 5 books in the library, 1 checked out. Satisfies both conditions.  

These are exactly 5 cases, and each has at least one book in the library and one checked out. The excluded cases (\( x = 0, y = 6 \) and \( x = 6, y = 0 \)) correctly violate the conditions. Thus, the calculation of 5 valid distributions is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Find the number of ways to distribute six indistinguishable books such that at least one is in the library and at least one is checked out.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Compute the total number of distributions (completed: 7 distributions).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Identify invalid cases (completed: 2 invalid cases).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate valid distributions (completed: 5 valid distributions).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Verify the solution (completed: all valid cases satisfy conditions).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as we have calculated and verified the solution.  
The number of valid distributions is 5.
