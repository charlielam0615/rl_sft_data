**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( c \) in the quadratic equation \(\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + c = 0\), given that its roots are \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( c \), we need to use the given roots to determine the quadratic equationâ€™s constant term. The roots suggest a relationship with the quadratic formula, so we can break this down into subgoals:  
1. Identify the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) from the quadratic equation.  
2. Use the quadratic formula to express the roots in terms of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
3. Compare the given roots to the quadratic formula to set up equations.  
4. Solve for \( c \) using the relationships derived.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \), and use the quadratic formula to relate the given roots to \( c \).  
**How to Achieve**: Extract \( a = \frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = 11 \) from the equation \(\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + c = 0\). The quadratic formula for roots is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \). Compare this to the given roots \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \) to find \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic equation is \(\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + c = 0\), so \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = 11 \), and \( c \) is unknown. The quadratic formula gives the roots as:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
Substituting \( a = \frac{3}{2} \) and \( b = 11 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{11^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot c}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{121 - 6c}}{3} \]  
The given roots are \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \). Comparing the two expressions, the denominators match (both are 3), and the numerators suggest:  
\[ \sqrt{121 - 6c} = \sqrt{7} \]  
This gives us an equation to solve for \( c \).

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \(\sqrt{121 - 6c} = \sqrt{7}\) to find \( c \).  
**How to Achieve**: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots, then solve the resulting linear equation for \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ \sqrt{121 - 6c} = \sqrt{7} \]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[ 121 - 6c = 7 \]  
\[ 121 - 7 = 6c \]  
\[ 114 = 6c \]  
\[ c = \frac{114}{6} = 19 \]  
So, \( c = 19 \).

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( c = 19 \) produces the given roots in the quadratic equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( c = 19 \) into the quadratic equation, compute the roots using the quadratic formula, and check if they match \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With \( c = 19 \), the quadratic equation is:  
\[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + 19 = 0 \]  
Using the quadratic formula, where \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = 11 \), and \( c = 19 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = 11^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot 19 = 121 - 4 \cdot \frac{57}{2} = 121 - 114 = 7 \]  
\[ \text{Roots} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \]  
These roots match the given roots \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \), confirming that \( c = 19 \) is correct.
