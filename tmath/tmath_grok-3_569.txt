### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Use the quadratic formula to establish the relationship between the roots and the coefficients of the quadratic equation.  
**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the roots are given by the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \). Compare this to the given roots to identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and the discriminant, which will help us find \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is \(\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + c = 0\). In standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), we identify:
- \( a = \frac{3}{2} \)
- \( b = 11 \)
- \( c = c \) (unknown)

The roots are given as \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \). For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the quadratic formula gives the roots as:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Compare this to the given roots \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \). Rewrite the given roots to match the quadratic formula's form:
\[ x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}} \]
Since \( 2a = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 3 \), the denominator matches, confirming \( a = \frac{3}{2} \).

Now, compare the numerator:
- The quadratic formula has \( -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \).
- The given roots have \( -11 \pm \sqrt{7} \).

Thus:
- \( -b = -11 \implies b = 11 \), which matches the coefficient of \( x \) in the equation.
- The discriminant is \( \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = \sqrt{7} \), so:
  \[ b^2 - 4ac = 7 \]

Substitute \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = 11 \):
\[ 11^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot c = 7 \]
\[ 121 - 6c = 7 \]
This equation can be solved for \( c \) in the next step.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation derived from the discriminant to find \( c \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equation \( 121 - 6c = 7 \) to isolate and solve for \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with the equation:
\[ 121 - 6c = 7 \]
Subtract 121 from both sides:
\[ -6c = 7 - 121 \]
\[ -6c = -114 \]
Divide by \(-6\):
\[ c = \frac{-114}{-6} = 19 \]
So, \( c = 19 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( c = 19 \) produces the given roots for the quadratic equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( c = 19 \) into the quadratic equation, compute the roots using the quadratic formula, and check if they match \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation with \( c = 19 \) is:
\[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 11x + 19 = 0 \]
Apply the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = \frac{3}{2} \), \( b = 11 \), \( c = 19 \):
- Discriminant:
  \[ b^2 - 4ac = 11^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot 19 = 121 - 4 \cdot \frac{57}{2} = 121 - 114 = 7 \]
- Roots:
  \[ x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3} \]
The calculated roots match the given roots, confirming \( c = 19 \) is correct.
