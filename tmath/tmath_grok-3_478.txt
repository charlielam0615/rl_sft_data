### Problem Statement
We need to determine the width of the domain of the function \( g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \), given that the domain of \( h(x) \) is the interval \([-8, 8]\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the domain of \( g(x) \) and compute its width.  
Subgoals:  
1. Determine the domain of \( g(x) \) based on the transformation \( \frac{x}{2} \) and the domain of \( h(x) \).  
2. Calculate the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the domain of \( g(x) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \), the input to \( h \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \). For \( g(x) \) to be defined, \( \frac{x}{2} \) must lie within the domain of \( h \), which is \([-8, 8]\). Solve the inequality \( -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \) to find the domain of \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the domain of \( g(x) \), solve the inequality:  
\[ -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \]  
Multiply through by 2:  
\[ -8 \cdot 2 \leq x \leq 8 \cdot 2 \]  
\[ -16 \leq x \leq 16 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).  
**How to Achieve**: The domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\). Compute the width by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound: \( 16 - (-16) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\).  
Width = \( 16 - (-16) = 16 + 16 = 32 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the domain of \( g(x) \) (completed: domain is \([-16, 16]\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the width of the domain (completed: width is 32).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution (implicit, as problem appears solved).  
The main goal has been achieved by determining the domain and computing its width.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the domain and width calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the domain transformation and width calculation for accuracy. Ensure the inequality \( -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \) correctly maps to \([-16, 16]\), and confirm the width computation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the domain:  
For \( g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \), \( \frac{x}{2} \) must be in \([-8, 8]\):  
\[ -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \]  
\[ -16 \leq x \leq 16 \]  
Domain is \([-16, 16]\), which matches.  
Width: \( 16 - (-16) = 32 \), which is consistent.  
The calculations are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\), and its width is \( 32 \).  
\[ \boxed{32} \]
