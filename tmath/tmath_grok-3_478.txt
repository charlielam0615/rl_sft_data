### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the width of the domain of the function \( g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \), given that the domain of \( h(x) \) is the interval \([-8, 8]\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the domain of \( g(x) \) based on the domain of \( h(x) \) and the transformation \( \frac{x}{2} \).  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the width of the domain of \( g(x) \) by finding the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the domain.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the domain of \( g(x) \) based on the domain of \( h(x) \) and the transformation \( \frac{x}{2} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( g(x) = h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \), the input to \( h \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \). The domain of \( h(x) \) is \([-8, 8]\), so we need \( \frac{x}{2} \) to lie within \([-8, 8]\). Solve the inequality \( -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \) to find the domain of \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the domain of \( g(x) \), solve the inequality \( -8 \leq \frac{x}{2} \leq 8 \).  
Multiply all parts by 2:  
\[ -8 \cdot 2 \leq \frac{x}{2} \cdot 2 \leq 8 \cdot 2 \]  
\[ -16 \leq x \leq 16 \]  
Thus, the domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).  
**How to Achieve**: The domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\). The width of an interval \([a, b]\) is given by \( b - a \). Compute \( 16 - (-16) \) to find the width.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The domain of \( g(x) \) is \([-16, 16]\).  
The width is:  
\[ 16 - (-16) = 16 + 16 = 32 \]  
Thus, the width of the domain of \( g(x) \) is 32.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the width of the domain of \( g(x) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the domain of \( g(x) \) based on the domain of \( h(x) \) and the transformation \( \frac{x}{2} \) (Completed: Domain is \([-16, 16]\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the width of the domain of \( g(x) \) (Completed: Width is 32).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that the width of the domain of \( g(x) \), which is 32, completes the problem. Since the width has been calculated, no further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The width of the domain of \( g(x) \) is 32.
