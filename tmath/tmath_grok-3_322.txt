**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 2x + 5 \), \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \), and \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), find the value of \( h(2) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( h(2) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(x) \) at the required input.  
2. Use the result to compute \( g(x) \).  
3. Use the result of \( g(x) \) to compute \( h(x) \).  
Since \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), evaluate \( g(2) \) first, then apply \( f \) to that result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(2) \) as the first step to find \( g(2) \), since \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) = 2x + 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate \( f(2) \):  
\[ f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \]  
So, \( f(2) = 9 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(2) \), since \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \) and we need \( g(2) \) for \( h(2) \).  
How to Achieve: Use \( f(2) = 9 \) from the previous step, substitute into \( g(x) \), and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate \( g(2) \):  
\[ g(2) = \sqrt{f(2)} - 2 = \sqrt{9} - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \]  
So, \( g(2) = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( h(2) \), since \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).  
How to Achieve: Use \( g(2) = 1 \) from the previous step, substitute into \( f(x) \), and evaluate.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate \( h(2) \):  
\[ h(2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) \]  
Now compute \( f(1) \):  
\[ f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \]  
So, \( h(2) = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( h(2) \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute each step to ensure correctness and check the domain of \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
1. \( f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 5 = 9 \).  
2. \( g(2) = \sqrt{f(2)} - 2 = \sqrt{9} - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \).  
3. \( h(2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 = 7 \).  

Check domain: For \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \), \( f(x) \geq 0 \). Since \( f(x) = 2x + 5 \),  
\[ 2x + 5 \geq 0 \implies x \geq -\frac{5}{2} \]  
Since \( x = 2 > -\frac{5}{2} \), the input is valid. The calculations are consistent.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( h(2) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) \). (Completed: \( f(2) = 9 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(2) \). (Completed: \( g(2) = 1 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( h(2) = f(g(2)) \). (Completed: \( h(2) = 7 \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation. (Completed)  

Current Goal: Completed main goal of computing \( h(2) \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( h(2) = 7 \)
