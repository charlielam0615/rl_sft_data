### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( h(2) \), where the functions are defined as:
- \( f(x) = 2x + 5 \)
- \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \)
- \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \)

To solve this, we will compute \( h(2) \) by evaluating the composition of the functions step-by-step, following the meta-cognitive action framework.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( h(2) \):
1. Compute \( f(2) \).
2. Use the result of \( f(2) \) to compute \( g(2) \).
3. Use the result of \( g(2) \) to compute \( h(2) \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function \( f(x) = 2x + 5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[
f(2) = 2(2) + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9
\]
So, \( f(2) = 9 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(2) \). This will be achieved by using the result \( f(2) = 9 \) in the function \( g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)} - 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( f(2) = 9 \) into \( g(x) \):
\[
g(2) = \sqrt{f(2)} - 2 = \sqrt{9} - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1
\]
So, \( g(2) = 1 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( h(2) \). This will be achieved by using the result \( g(2) = 1 \) in the function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), which means computing \( f(g(2)) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( g(2) = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[
h(2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) = 2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7
\]
So, \( h(2) = 7 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( h(2) \). This will be achieved by retracing the steps to ensure all calculations are correct and consistent with the function definitions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Letâ€™s verify each step:
1. **Compute \( f(2) \)**:
   \[
   f(2) = 2(2) + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9
   \]
   This matches the result from Step 2.
2. **Compute \( g(2) \)**:
   \[
   g(2) = \sqrt{f(2)} - 2 = \sqrt{9} - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1
   \]
   This matches the result from Step 3.
3. **Compute \( h(2) \)**:
   \[
   h(2) = f(g(2)) = f(1) = 2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   This matches the result from Step 4.

All calculations are consistent, and the domain is valid since \( f(2) = 9 \geq 0 \), ensuring the square root in \( g(x) \) is defined. Thus, \( h(2) = 7 \) is correct.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Compute \( h(2) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) \) (completed: \( f(2) = 9 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(2) \) (completed: \( g(2) = 1 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( h(2) \) (completed: \( h(2) = 7 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation (completed: calculations verified).

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy, which has been fully addressed.

The final answer is \( h(2) = 7 \).

h(2) = 7
