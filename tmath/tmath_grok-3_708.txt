**Problem Restatement**: A pet store has 15 puppies, 6 kittens, and 8 hamsters. Alice, Bob, and Charlie each want to buy a pet, and for variety, they each must choose a different kind of pet. We need to determine how many ways they can select their pets such that each person gets a unique type of pet.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve it systematically. First, I need to determine the number of ways to assign a unique type of pet to each of the three individuals (Alice, Bob, and Charlie). Then, for each assignment of pet types, I will calculate the number of ways to choose specific pets from the available counts of each type.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of ways to assign unique pet types to Alice, Bob, and Charlie.  
How to Achieve: Since there are three distinct types of pets (puppies, kittens, hamsters) and three people, I will calculate the number of permutations of pet types among the three individuals.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To assign unique pet types to Alice, Bob, and Charlie, I recognize that this is a permutation problem where order matters (since each person is distinct). There are 3 types of pets, and I need to assign one type to each of the 3 people without repetition. The number of ways to do this is calculated as 3! (3 factorial), which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. So, there are 6 possible ways to assign the pet types.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose specific pets for each person based on the assigned pet types.  
How to Achieve: For each assignment of pet types, multiply the number of available pets of each type assigned to each person. Since the choices are independent for each type, this will give the total combinations of specific pets for a given type assignment.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For each of the 6 assignments of pet types, I need to account for the number of specific pets available for each type. Suppose one assignment is Alice gets a puppy, Bob gets a kitten, and Charlie gets a hamster. Then, the number of choices is:  
- Alice: 15 puppies  
- Bob: 6 kittens  
- Charlie: 8 hamsters  
So, for this assignment, the number of ways is 15 × 6 × 8 = 720. Since the number of available pets for each type is fixed (15 puppies, 6 kittens, 8 hamsters), every assignment of pet types will result in the same product of choices (15 × 6 × 8). Therefore, for each of the 6 assignments, there are 720 ways to choose specific pets.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute the total number of ways Alice, Bob, and Charlie can choose their pets.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the number of ways to assign pet types by the number of ways to choose specific pets for each assignment.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From Step 2, there are 6 ways to assign the pet types. From Step 3, for each assignment, there are 720 ways to choose specific pets. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6 × 720 = 4320. This represents the total number of ways Alice, Bob, and Charlie can each buy a different type of pet and leave the store satisfied.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation and logic used.  
How to Achieve: Double-check the permutation calculation for assigning pet types and the multiplication of pet choices to ensure no errors in arithmetic or assumptions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let me validate the solution. First, confirming the number of ways to assign pet types: with 3 distinct pet types and 3 distinct individuals, the number of permutations is indeed 3! = 6. Second, for each assignment, the number of choices for puppies (15), kittens (6), and hamsters (8) are multiplied to get 15 × 6 × 8 = 720, which is correct. Finally, multiplying the number of assignments by the choices per assignment, 6 × 720 = 4320, is also correct. Additionally, the assumption that each person must get a different type of pet aligns with the problem statement. I believe the solution is accurate.
