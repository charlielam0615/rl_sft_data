**Problem Restatement**: Erika, aged 14, flips a fair coin with sides labeled 10 and 20, and rolls a standard six-sided die. She adds the number on the top face of the coin to the number on the die. We need to find the probability that this sum equals her age, 14, and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the possible outcomes of the coin flip and die roll.  
2. Determine all combinations that produce a sum of 14.  
3. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
5. Express the probability as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible outcomes of the coin flip and die roll. Achieve this by listing the coin’s outcomes (10 or 20) and the die’s outcomes (1 through 6), then forming all possible pairs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The coin has two outcomes: 10 or 20 (since it’s fair, each has a probability of 1/2). The die has six outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (each with a probability of 1/6). The total outcomes are all possible pairs of coin and die results. Since the coin and die are independent, the total number of outcomes is:  
2 (coin outcomes) × 6 (die outcomes) = 12.  
The possible pairs are:  
- Coin = 10: (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6)  
- Coin = 20: (20, 1), (20, 2), (20, 3), (20, 4), (20, 5), (20, 6)  
Each pair is equally likely with probability (1/2) × (1/6) = 1/12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine all combinations where the sum of the coin and die equals 14. Achieve this by calculating the sum for each pair from the previous step and identifying those that equal 14.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the sums for each pair:  
- Coin = 10:  
  - (10, 1): 10 + 1 = 11  
  - (10, 2): 10 + 2 = 12  
  - (10, 3): 10 + 3 = 13  
  - (10, 4): 10 + 4 = 14  
  - (10, 5): 10 + 5 = 15  
  - (10, 6): 10 + 6 = 16  
- Coin = 20:  
  - (20, 1): 20 + 1 = 21  
  - (20, 2): 20 + 2 = 22  
  - (20, 3): 20 + 3 = 23  
  - (20, 4): 20 + 4 = 24  
  - (20, 5): 20 + 5 = 25  
  - (20, 6): 20 + 6 = 26  

The only pair that sums to 14 is (10, 4). Thus, there is 1 favorable outcome.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the favorable outcomes. Achieve this by rechecking the sums and ensuring no combinations were missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the sums:  
- For coin = 10, the die must contribute 14 − 10 = 4. Since 4 is a valid die outcome (1 to 6), (10, 4) is valid.  
- For coin = 20, the die must contribute 14 − 20 = −6, which is not possible since die outcomes are positive (1 to 6).  
No other combinations yield 14. The favorable outcome (10, 4) is confirmed.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals:  
- Main goal: Find the probability that the sum equals 14, expressed as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible outcomes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine combinations summing to 14 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total outcomes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute probability (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express as a common fraction (pending).  
**Current goal**: Compute the probability.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals is:  
- Main goal: Probability of sum = 14 as a fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identified 12 total outcomes (coin: 10, 20; die: 1–6).  
  - Subgoal 2: Found 1 favorable outcome (10, 4).  
  - Subgoal 3: Total outcomes = 12 (verified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute probability (current).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express as fraction (next).  
Current goal: Compute the probability using the number of favorable outcomes (1) and total outcomes (12).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability. Achieve this by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of favorable outcomes is 1 (from Step 3). The total number of outcomes is 12 (from Step 2). The probability is:  
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{1}{12} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the probability calculation. Achieve this by confirming the counts and ensuring the fraction is in simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconfirm:  
- Total outcomes: 2 (coin) × 6 (die) = 12.  
- Favorable outcome: (10, 4), sum = 14, only one such pair.  
- Probability: 1/12.  
The fraction 1/12 is in simplest form (1 and 12 are coprime). The calculation is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the probability as a common fraction. Retrieve information related to the probability calculation and fraction format from previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From Step 6, the probability is 1/12. From Step 7, this fraction is confirmed to be in simplest form. The problem requires a common fraction, and 1/12 meets this requirement as it is a ratio of two integers with no common factors other than 1.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the sum equals Erika’s age (14) is \(\frac{1}{12}\).
