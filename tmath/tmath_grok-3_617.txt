**Problem Statement**: Erika, aged 14, flips a fair coin with sides labeled 10 and 20, then adds the number on the top face of the coin to the number rolled on a standard six-sided die (labeled 1 through 6). We need to find the probability that the sum equals her age, 14, and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify all possible outcomes of the coin flip and die roll.  
2. Calculate the sum for each outcome.  
3. Determine which outcomes result in a sum of 14.  
4. Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
5. Express the probability as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all possible outcomes of the coin flip and die roll. Achieve this by listing the coin’s outcomes (10 or 20) and the die’s outcomes (1 through 6), then forming all possible pairs.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The coin has 2 outcomes: 10 or 20 (since it’s fair, each has a probability of 1/2).  
The die has 6 outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (each with a probability of 1/6).  
Total outcomes = 2 × 6 = 12, all equally likely since the coin and die are independent.  
Possible pairs (coin, die):  
- Coin = 10: (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6)  
- Coin = 20: (20, 1), (20, 2), (20, 3), (20, 4), (20, 5), (20, 6)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum for each outcome and identify which pairs result in a sum of 14. Achieve this by adding the coin and die values for each pair and checking which sums equal 14.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate sums for each pair:  
- Coin = 10:  
  - (10, 1): 10 + 1 = 11  
  - (10, 2): 10 + 2 = 12  
  - (10, 3): 10 + 3 = 13  
  - (10, 4): 10 + 4 = 14  
  - (10, 5): 10 + 5 = 15  
  - (10, 6): 10 + 6 = 16  
- Coin = 20:  
  - (20, 1): 20 + 1 = 21  
  - (20, 2): 20 + 2 = 22  
  - (20, 3): 20 + 3 = 23  
  - (20, 4): 20 + 4 = 24  
  - (20, 5): 20 + 5 = 25  
  - (20, 6): 20 + 6 = 26  

Favorable outcome: (10, 4) → 10 + 4 = 14.  
Number of favorable outcomes = 1.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the favorable outcomes. Achieve this by rechecking the sums and ensuring no other pairs yield 14.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recheck sums:  
- For coin = 10: Only (10, 4) gives 14. Other sums (11, 12, 13, 15, 16) do not.  
- For coin = 20: Sums (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26) are all greater than 14.  
No additional pairs yield 14. The favorable outcome (10, 4) is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the probability that the sum equals 14, expressed as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all possible outcomes (completed: 12 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate sums and find those equaling 14 (completed: 1 favorable outcome).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express as a common fraction (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability. Achieve this by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total outcomes = 12 (from Step 2).  
Favorable outcomes = 1 (from Step 3).  
Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 1/12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the probability calculation. Achieve this by confirming the total and favorable outcomes and ensuring the fraction is in simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total outcomes: 2 coin outcomes × 6 die outcomes = 12.  
Favorable outcomes: Only (10, 4) sums to 14, confirmed in Step 4.  
Probability = 1/12.  
Check if 1/12 is in simplest form: 1 and 12 have no common factors other than 1, so it is simplified.  
[/IMP]
