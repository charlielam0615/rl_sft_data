**Problem Statement**: Find all values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \) holds true, and express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the inequality in standard form.  
2. Solve the corresponding quadratic equation to find critical points.  
3. Determine the intervals where the inequality holds by testing points.  
4. Express the solution in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the inequality in standard form.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side to set the inequality to zero, which simplifies solving the quadratic inequality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \). Subtract 35 from both sides:  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \]  
The inequality is now in standard form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 \) to find critical points.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots, which will divide the number line into intervals for testing.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve \( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), \( c = -35 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-35) = 4 + 140 = 144 \]  
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 12}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{2 + 12}{2} = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{2 - 12}{2} = -5 \]  
The roots are \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the intervals where \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) by testing points.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the roots \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 7 \) to divide the number line into intervals, then test a point in each interval to see where the quadratic is positive.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The roots \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 7 \) divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 7) \), and \( (7, \infty) \). Test a point in each:  
- For \( x = -6 \) in \( (-\infty, -5) \):  
  \[ (-6)^2 - 2(-6) - 35 = 36 + 12 - 35 = 13 > 0 \]  
- For \( x = 0 \) in \( (-5, 7) \):  
  \[ 0^2 - 2(0) - 35 = -35 < 0 \]  
- For \( x = 8 \) in \( (7, \infty) \):  
  \[ 8^2 - 2(8) - 35 = 64 - 16 - 35 = 13 > 0 \]  
The inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) holds in \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking boundary points and ensuring the inequality is strict.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the roots \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 7 \) to confirm they are not included, and recheck the sign of the quadratic near boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the roots:  
- At \( x = -5 \):  
  \[ (-5)^2 - 2(-5) - 35 = 25 + 10 - 35 = 0 \]  
- At \( x = 7 \):  
  \[ 7^2 - 2(7) - 35 = 49 - 14 - 35 = 0 \]  
Since \( 0 = 0 \), not \( > 0 \), the roots are excluded, confirming the strict inequality.  
Test points near boundaries:  
- At \( x = -4.9 \):  
  \[ (-4.9)^2 - 2(-4.9) - 35 = 24.01 + 9.8 - 35 = -1.19 < 0 \] (in \( (-5, 7) \), consistent)  
- At \( x = -5.1 \):  
  \[ (-5.1)^2 - 2(-5.1) - 35 = 26.01 + 10.2 - 35 = 1.21 > 0 \] (in \( (-\infty, -5) \), consistent)  
The intervals \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \) are valid.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \) and express in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite inequality as \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 \) (roots: \( x = -5, 7 \)) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Test intervals to find where \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) (intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (7, \infty) \)) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify boundary points and strict inequality (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express solution in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.  
**How to Achieve**: Combine the intervals where the inequality holds, using proper notation for open intervals since the inequality is strict.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) holds in \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \). Since the inequality is strict (\( > \)), use open intervals. The solution in interval notation is:  
\[ (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \]  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \]
