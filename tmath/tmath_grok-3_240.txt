**Problem Restatement**: Find all values of \( x \) such that \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \), and express the solution in interval notation.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \), break it down into intermediate subgoals by working backward from the goal. The final goal is to find the values of \( x \) satisfying the inequality in interval notation. Subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the inequality in standard form.  
2. Solve the corresponding quadratic equation to find critical points.  
3. Determine the intervals defined by these critical points.  
4. Test each interval to identify where the inequality holds.  
5. Express the solution in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the inequality \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \) in standard form by moving all terms to one side. This will simplify solving the quadratic equation in the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \):  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 \) to find the critical points that divide the number line into intervals. Use factoring or the quadratic formula to find the roots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 \):  
Try factoring: Find two numbers that multiply to \(-35\) and add to \(-2\). The numbers are \(-7\) and \(5\).  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 35 = (x - 7)(x + 5) = 0 \]  
Roots: \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -5 \).  
Critical points: \( x = -5, 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
The critical points \( x = -5 \) and \( x = 7 \) divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 7) \), and \( (7, \infty) \). The next subgoals are:  
1. Test a point in each interval to determine where \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \).  
2. Combine the intervals where the inequality holds.  
3. Account for the strict inequality (exclude critical points).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test the intervals \( (-\infty, -5) \), \( (-5, 7) \), and \( (7, \infty) \) by substituting a test point into \( x^2 - 2x - 35 \) to check where it is positive.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \):  
- Interval \( (-\infty, -5) \), test \( x = -6 \):  
  \[ (-6)^2 - 2(-6) - 35 = 36 + 12 - 35 = 13 > 0 \] (Holds)  
- Interval \( (-5, 7) \), test \( x = 0 \):  
  \[ 0^2 - 2(0) - 35 = -35 < 0 \] (Does not hold)  
- Interval \( (7, \infty) \), test \( x = 8 \):  
  \[ 8^2 - 2(8) - 35 = 64 - 16 - 35 = 13 > 0 \] (Holds)  
The inequality holds in \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \). Since the inequality is strict (\( > \)), exclude the critical points \( x = -5, 7 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \) and express in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal: Rewrite inequality in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Solve quadratic equation for critical points (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Determine intervals and test them (completed).  
  - Subgoal: Express solution in interval notation (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Combine the intervals where the inequality holds and write the solution in interval notation.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the intervals \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \) where the inequality holds and express the solution in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The inequality \( x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \) holds in \( (-\infty, -5) \) and \( (7, \infty) \). In interval notation, the solution is:  
\[ (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking boundary points and re-testing intervals to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Validate the solution \( (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \):  
- Check boundary points (not included due to strict inequality):  
  - At \( x = -5 \): \( (-5)^2 - 2(-5) - 35 = 25 + 10 - 35 = 0 \not> 0 \) (correctly excluded).  
  - At \( x = 7 \): \( 7^2 - 2(7) - 35 = 49 - 14 - 35 = 0 \not> 0 \) (correctly excluded).  
- Re-test points in solution intervals:  
  - \( x = -6 \in (-\infty, -5) \): \( 13 > 0 \) (confirmed).  
  - \( x = 8 \in (7, \infty) \): \( 13 > 0 \) (confirmed).  
- Test point in excluded interval \( (-5, 7) \), \( x = 0 \): \( -35 < 0 \) (confirmed).  
The solution \( (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ (-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty) \]
