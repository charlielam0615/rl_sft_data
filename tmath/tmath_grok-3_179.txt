**Problem Restatement**: The quadratic equation is \(5x^2 + kx = 4\), or in standard form, \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\). One root is \(x = 2\). We need to find the other root.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other root, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the given root \(x = 2\) to find the coefficient \(k\) by substituting into the equation.  
2. Form the quadratic equation with the determined \(k\).  
3. Find the other root using the quadratic formula or factoring.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the coefficient \(k\) using the given root \(x = 2\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\) and solve for \(k\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 2\):  
\(5(2)^2 + k(2) - 4 = 0\)  
\(5(4) + 2k - 4 = 0\)  
\(20 + 2k - 4 = 0\)  
\(16 + 2k = 0\)  
\(2k = -16\)  
\(k = -8\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Form the quadratic equation with \(k = -8\) and find the other root.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(k = -8\) into \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\), then solve for the roots using the quadratic formula, noting that one root is already \(x = 2\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The equation becomes:  
\(5x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0\)  
Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 5\), \(b = -8\), \(c = -4\).  
Discriminant:  
\(b^2 - 4ac = (-8)^2 - 4(5)(-4) = 64 + 80 = 144\)  
Roots:  
\(x = \frac{-(-8) \pm \sqrt{144}}{2(5)} = \frac{8 \pm 12}{10}\)  
\(x = \frac{8 + 12}{10} = \frac{20}{10} = 2\)  
\(x = \frac{8 - 12}{10} = \frac{-4}{10} = -\frac{2}{5}\)  
Since \(x = 2\) is given, the other root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated root \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) is correct.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) into \(5x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0\) to check if it satisfies the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\):  
\(5\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) - 4\)  
\(5\left(\frac{4}{25}\right) + \frac{16}{5} - 4\)  
\(\frac{20}{25} + \frac{80}{25} - \frac{100}{25} = \frac{20 + 80 - 100}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0\)  
The equation holds, confirming \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) is a root.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the other root of \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\) given one root is \(x = 2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine \(k\) using the given root. (Completed: \(k = -8\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Form the quadratic equation and find the other root. (Completed: Root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution. (Completed: \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) satisfies the equation)  
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The other root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The other root is \(-\frac{2}{5}\).
