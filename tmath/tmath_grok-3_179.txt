**Problem Restatement**: One root of the quadratic equation \(5x^2 + kx = 4\) is \(x = 2\). We need to find the other root.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the other root, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
2. Use the given root \(x = 2\) to determine the value of \(k\).
3. Find the other root using the quadratic formula or factoring.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation in standard form and use the given root \(x = 2\) to find \(k\).
Description: Move all terms to one side to get \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\). Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation to solve for \(k\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Rewrite the equation:
\[
5x^2 + kx = 4 \implies 5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0
\]
Since \(x = 2\) is a root, substitute \(x = 2\):
\[
5(2)^2 + k(2) - 4 = 0 \implies 5 \cdot 4 + 2k - 4 = 0 \implies 20 + 2k - 4 = 0 \implies 16 + 2k = 0 \implies 2k = -16 \implies k = -8
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the other root using the quadratic equation with \(k = -8\).
Description: Substitute \(k = -8\) into \(5x^2 + kx - 4 = 0\), then use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) to find the roots, noting one root is \(x = 2\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
With \(k = -8\), the equation is:
\[
5x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0
\]
Identify coefficients: \(a = 5\), \(b = -8\), \(c = -4\). Apply the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-(-8) \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-4)}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 80}}{10} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{144}}{10} = \frac{8 \pm 12}{10}
\]
Calculate the roots:
\[
x = \frac{8 + 12}{10} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{8 - 12}{10} = \frac{-4}{10} = -\frac{2}{5}
\]
Since \(x = 2\) is given, the other root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the other root \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) is correct.
Description: Substitute \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) into \(5x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0\) to confirm it satisfies the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\):
\[
5\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) - 4 = 5 \cdot \frac{4}{25} + 8 \cdot \frac{2}{5} - 4 = \frac{20}{25} + \frac{16}{5} - 4 = \frac{20}{25} + \frac{80}{25} - \frac{100}{25} = \frac{20 + 80 - 100}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0
\]
The equation holds, confirming \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) is a root.
[/IMP]

Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the other root of \(5x^2 + kx = 4\) given one root is \(x = 2\).
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine \(k\) using the given root \(x = 2\) (completed, \(k = -8\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Find the other root (completed, other root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the other root (completed).
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The other root is \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The other root is \(-\frac{2}{5}\).
