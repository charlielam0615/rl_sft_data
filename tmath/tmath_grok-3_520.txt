### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of terms \( n \) in the infinite geometric sequence \( \left\{1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots \right\} \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms equals \( \frac{121}{81} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
2. Write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence.  
- **How to Achieve:** Examine the sequence \( \left\{1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots \right\} \) to determine the first term and calculate the common ratio by dividing consecutive terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is \( 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots \).  
- The first term is \( a = 1 \).  
- The common ratio is found by dividing the second term by the first term:  
  \[
  r = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1} = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]
Alternatively, check the next pair:  
  \[
  \frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot 3 = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]
Thus, the common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence.  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the standard formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence, incorporating the first term and common ratio identified previously.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a geometric sequence with first term \( a \), common ratio \( r \), and \( |r| < 1 \), the sum of the first \( n \) terms is given by:  
\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.
\]
Substituting \( a = 1 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{3} \):  
\[
S_n = 1 \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{3^n}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{3^n}}{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right).
\]
Thus, the sum formula is:  
\[
S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right).
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Set up an equation using the given sum \( \frac{121}{81} \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Equate the sum formula \( S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) \) to \( \frac{121}{81} \) and simplify to form an equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \( S_n = \frac{121}{81} \), set up the equation:  
\[
\frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
To eliminate the fraction on the left, multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):  
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{121}{81} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{121 \cdot 2}{81 \cdot 3} = \frac{242}{243}.
\]
Thus, the equation is:  
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{242}{243}.
\]
Rewrite the left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{1}{3^n} = 1 - \frac{242}{243} = \frac{243 - 242}{243} = \frac{1}{243}.
\]
So:  
\[
\frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{1}{243}.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the equation \( \frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{1}{243} \) for \( n \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Express both sides with the same base and equate the exponents, or compute numerically to find \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the equation:  
\[
\frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{1}{243}.
\]
Rewrite the right-hand side:  
\[
243 = 3^5 \quad \text{(since } 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 243\text{)},
\]
so:  
\[
\frac{1}{243} = \frac{1}{3^5} = 3^{-5}.
\]
Thus:  
\[
\frac{1}{3^n} = 3^{-5}.
\]
This implies:  
\[
3^{-n} = 3^{-5}.
\]
Equating the exponents:  
\[
-n = -5 \implies n = 5.
\]
Alternatively, compute directly:  
\[
3^n = 243 \implies 3^5 = 243 \implies n = 5.
\]
So, \( n = 5 \).

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the solution \( n = 5 \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( n = 5 \) into the sum formula and check if the result equals \( \frac{121}{81} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the sum formula:  
\[
S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right),
\]
for \( n = 5 \):  
\[
\frac{1}{3^5} = \frac{1}{243},
\]
\[
1 - \frac{1}{243} = \frac{242}{243},
\]
\[
S_5 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{242}{243} = \frac{3 \cdot 242}{2 \cdot 243} = \frac{726}{486}.
\]
Simplify:  
\[
\frac{726 \div 6}{486 \div 6} = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
Since \( S_5 = \frac{121}{81} \), the solution \( n = 5 \) is correct.
