### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of terms \( n \) in the infinite geometric sequence \( \{1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots\} \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms equals \( \frac{121}{81} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
2. Write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence.  
3. Set up an equation using the given sum \( \frac{121}{81} \).  
4. Solve the equation for \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence. This can be achieved by examining the given sequence \( \{1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots\} \) and computing the ratio between consecutive terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is \( 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \dots \).  
- First term: \( a = 1 \).  
- Common ratio: Divide the second term by the first term:  
  \[
  r = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1} = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]
Verify with the next pair:  
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot 3 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus, the first term is \( a = 1 \), and the common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence. This can be achieved by recalling the standard formula for the sum of a geometric series and substituting the values of \( a \) and \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \neq 1 \) is:
\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.
\]
Given \( a = 1 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{3} \), substitute these values:
\[
S_n = 1 \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{3^n}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{3^n}}{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right).
\]
Thus, the sum formula is:
\[
S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right).
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an equation using the given sum \( \frac{121}{81} \). This can be achieved by equating the sum formula to \( \frac{121}{81} \) and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of the first \( n \) terms is given as \( \frac{121}{81} \). Using the sum formula:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{121}{81} = \frac{121}{81} \div \frac{9}{9} = \frac{11 \cdot 11}{9 \cdot 9} = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2.
\]
So, the equation is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2.
\]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms equals \( \frac{121}{81} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term and common ratio (completed: \( a = 1, r = \frac{1}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Write the sum formula (completed: \( S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up the equation (completed: \( \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve the equation for \( n \) (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2 \) for \( n \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2 \) for \( n \). This can be achieved by isolating \( \frac{1}{3^n} \), simplifying, and finding \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2.
\]
Compute the right-hand side:
\[
\left(\frac{11}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
So:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{121}{81} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{121 \cdot 2}{81 \cdot 3} = \frac{242}{243}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{242}{243} = \frac{243 - 1}{243} = 1 - \frac{1}{243}.
\]
Since \( 243 = 3^5 \), we have:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{243} = 1 - \frac{1}{3^5}.
\]
Thus:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3^n} = 1 - \frac{1}{3^5}.
\]
Equate the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{1}{3^5}.
\]
Therefore:
\[
3^n = 3^5 \implies n = 5.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( n = 5 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( n = 5 \) into the sum formula and checking if the sum equals \( \frac{121}{81} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( n = 5 \) into the sum formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^n}\right).
\]
For \( n = 5 \):
\[
S_5 = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^5}\right) = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{243}\right) = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{242}{243} = \frac{3 \cdot 242}{2 \cdot 243} = \frac{726}{486} = \frac{121}{81}.
\]
The calculated sum matches the given sum \( \frac{121}{81} \), confirming that \( n = 5 \) is correct.

The number of terms \( n \) is \( \boxed{5} \).
