### Problem Statement
We need to find the second term of an infinite geometric series given that its common ratio is \( r = \frac{-1}{3} \) and its sum is 25.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the second term of the infinite geometric series.  
- Subgoal 1: Recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.  
- Subgoal 2: Use the given sum and common ratio to find the first term.  
- Subgoal 3: Determine the second term using the first term and the common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
Meta-data: Retrieve the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, as it is essential for using the given sum and common ratio to find the first term.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \), where \( |r| < 1 \), is given by:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]  
This formula will be used to find the first term given the sum and common ratio.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
Current Goal: Use the sum and common ratio to find the first term \( a \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( S = 25 \) and \( r = \frac{-1}{3} \) into the formula \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \) and solve for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given:  
- Sum \( S = 25 \)  
- Common ratio \( r = \frac{-1}{3} \)  

The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]  

Substitute the known values:  
\[ 25 = \frac{a}{1 - \left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)} \]  
\[ 25 = \frac{a}{1 + \frac{1}{3}} \]  
\[ 25 = \frac{a}{\frac{4}{3}} \]  
\[ 25 = \frac{3a}{4} \]  

Solve for \( a \):  
\[ a = 25 \cdot \frac{4}{3} \]  
\[ a = \frac{100}{3} \]  

The first term is \( a = \frac{100}{3} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
Current Goal: Find the second term using the first term and the common ratio.  
How to Achieve: The second term of a geometric series is given by \( a_2 = a \cdot r \). Use the first term \( a = \frac{100}{3} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{-1}{3} \) to compute the second term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second term is:  
\[ a_2 = a \cdot r \]  
\[ a_2 = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \frac{-1}{3} \]  
\[ a_2 = \frac{100 \cdot (-1)}{3 \cdot 3} \]  
\[ a_2 = \frac{-100}{9} \]  

The second term is \( a_2 = -\frac{100}{9} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
Current Goal: Verify that the second term and the series parameters are consistent with the given sum.  
How to Achieve: Check if the first term and common ratio produce the given sum, confirming the calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the first term \( a = \frac{100}{3} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{-1}{3} \), recompute the sum:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]  
\[ S = \frac{\frac{100}{3}}{1 - \left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)} \]  
\[ S = \frac{\frac{100}{3}}{\frac{4}{3}} \]  
\[ S = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \]  
\[ S = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]  

The sum matches the given value of 25, confirming the first term is correct. The second term calculation is straightforward:  
\[ a_2 = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \frac{-1}{3} = -\frac{100}{9} \]  
The calculations are consistent.
