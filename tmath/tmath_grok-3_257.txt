### Problem Statement
We need to find the second term of an infinite geometric series with a common ratio of \( r = -\frac{1}{3} \) and a sum of 25.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the second term of the infinite geometric series.  
Subgoals:  
1. Recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.  
2. Use the given sum and common ratio to find the first term.  
3. Determine the second term using the first term and the common ratio.

### Step 2: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
Retrieve the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, as it is essential for finding the first term.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \), where \( |r| < 1 \), is given by:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]  
This formula applies since the given common ratio \( r = -\frac{1}{3} \) satisfies \( |r| = \frac{1}{3} < 1 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the first term \( a \) of the series.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the sum formula \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \) with the given sum \( S = 25 \) and common ratio \( r = -\frac{1}{3} \) to solve for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute the known values into the sum formula:  
\[ 25 = \frac{a}{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)} \]  
Simplify the denominator:  
\[ 1 - \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \]  
So, the equation becomes:  
\[ 25 = \frac{a}{\frac{4}{3}} \]  
Multiply both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \):  
\[ a = 25 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \]  
The first term is \( a = \frac{100}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the second term of the series.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the first term \( a = \frac{100}{3} \) and the common ratio \( r = -\frac{1}{3} \) to compute the second term, which is \( ar \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second term of a geometric series is given by:  
\[ a_2 = a \cdot r \]  
Substitute \( a = \frac{100}{3} \) and \( r = -\frac{1}{3} \):  
\[ a_2 = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{100 \cdot (-1)}{3 \cdot 3} = \frac{-100}{9} \]  
The second term is \( -\frac{100}{9} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the second term by checking the series sum and terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the first few terms to ensure they form a geometric series with the given ratio and sum to 25.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First term: \( a = \frac{100}{3} \).  
Second term: \( a_2 = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{100}{9} \).  
Third term: \( a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = -\frac{100}{9} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{100}{27} \).  
Check the common ratio:  
\[ \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-\frac{100}{9}}{\frac{100}{3}} = -\frac{100}{9} \cdot \frac{3}{100} = -\frac{1}{3} \]  
\[ \frac{a_3}{a_2} = \frac{\frac{100}{27}}{-\frac{100}{9}} = \frac{100}{27} \cdot \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{1}{3} \]  
The common ratio is consistent. Now, verify the sum using the formula:  
\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{\frac{100}{3}}{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)} = \frac{\frac{100}{3}}{\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{100}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 25 \]  
The sum matches the given value, confirming the first term and subsequent terms are correct.
