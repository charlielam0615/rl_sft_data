Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3$ for $a$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve the equation $6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3$, subtract 3 from both sides to set the equation to zero:  
$$
6a^2 + 5a + 4 - 3 = 0
$$  
$$
6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0
$$  
Now, solve the quadratic equation $6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:  
$$
a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
Here, $a = 6$, $b = 5$, and $c = 1$. Substituting these values:  
$$
a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(6)(1)}}{2(6)}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{12}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{12}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{12}
$$  
This gives two solutions:  
$$
a = \frac{-5 + 1}{12} = \frac{-4}{12} = \frac{-1}{3}
$$  
$$
a = \frac{-5 - 1}{12} = \frac{-6}{12} = \frac{-1}{2}
$$  
So, the two possible values of $a$ are $a = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $a = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the value of $2a + 1$ for each solution of $a$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For $a = -\frac{1}{3}$:  
$$
2a + 1 = 2(-\frac{1}{3}) + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{1}{3}
$$  

For $a = -\frac{1}{2}$:  
$$
2a + 1 = 2(-\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0
$$  

Thus, the calculated values of $2a + 1$ are $\frac{1}{3}$ and $0$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Quadratic Equation Solution**:  
   Original equation: $6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3$.  
   Subtracting 3: $6a^2 + 5a + 1 = 0$.  
   Quadratic formula: $a = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{12} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{12}$.  
   Solutions: $a = -\frac{1}{3}, -\frac{1}{2}$.  
   **Correct**: All steps align with standard quadratic solution methods.  

2. **Substitution into $2a + 1$**:  
   For $a = -\frac{1}{3}$:  
   $2(-\frac{1}{3}) + 1 = -\frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{1}{3}$.  
   For $a = -\frac{1}{2}$:  
   $2(-\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  
   **Correct**: Calculations are arithmetic and verified.  

3. **Smallest Value**:  
   $\frac{1}{3}$ vs. $0$.  
   $0 < \frac{1}{3}$, so the smallest value is $0$.  
   **Correct**: Logical comparison holds.  

No inconsistencies or errors detected.
