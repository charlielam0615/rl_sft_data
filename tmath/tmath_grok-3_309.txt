**Problem Restatement**: A shirt is priced at $30 and has a 20% discount, followed by an additional 25% discount on the sale price due to a coupon. We need to find a single percentage discount that results in the same final price as applying these two successive discounts.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount.  
2. Calculate the final price after applying the 25% coupon discount to the sale price.  
3. Determine the single percentage discount that, when applied to the original price, yields the same final price.  
4. Verify the solution by comparing the final prices.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount.  
**How to Achieve**: A 20% discount means paying 80% of the original price. Multiply the original price ($30) by 0.80 to find the sale price.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original price = $30  
20% discount = 100% - 20% = 80%  
Sale price = $30 × 0.80 = $24  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the final price after applying the 25% coupon discount to the sale price.  
**How to Achieve**: A 25% discount on the sale price means paying 75% of the sale price. Multiply the sale price ($24) by 0.75 to find the final price.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sale price = $24  
25% coupon discount = 100% - 25% = 75%  
Final price = $24 × 0.75 = $18  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the single percentage discount that yields the same final price.  
**How to Achieve**: The final price is $18, and the original price is $30. Calculate the total discount as a percentage of the original price, then express it as a single discount percentage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Final price = $18  
Original price = $30  
Total discount amount = $30 - $18 = $12  
Discount percentage = ($12 / $30) × 100 = 40%  
Thus, a single 40% discount reduces the price to $30 × (1 - 0.40) = $30 × 0.60 = $18.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that a single 40% discount gives the same final price as the two successive discounts.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply a 40% discount to the original price and check if the result matches the final price ($18) from the successive discounts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original price = $30  
Single 40% discount = 100% - 40% = 60%  
Price after single discount = $30 × 0.60 = $18  
This matches the final price from Step 3 ($18), confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find a single percentage discount equivalent to a 20% discount followed by a 25% discount.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount (Completed: $24).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the final price after the 25% coupon discount (Completed: $18).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the single percentage discount (Completed: 40%).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (Completed: Matches $18).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution is complete, with a single 40% discount confirmed as equivalent.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: A single 40% discount gives the same final price as the two successive discounts.
