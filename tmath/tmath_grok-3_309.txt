### Problem Statement
We need to determine a single percentage discount that results in the same final price as applying two successive discounts to a shirt originally priced at $30: a 20% off sale discount followed by an additional 25% off coupon discount on the sale price.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the equivalent single discount percentage:  
1. Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount.  
2. Calculate the final price after applying the 25% coupon discount to the sale price.  
3. Determine the total discount percentage from the original price to the final price.  
4. Find the single discount percentage that, when applied to the original price, yields the same final price.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the sale price after the 20% discount. This will be achieved by applying a 20% reduction to the original price of $30.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the sale price after a 20% discount:  
- A 20% discount means paying 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%).  
- Sale price = $30 × (1 - 0.20) = $30 × 0.80 = $24.  
The sale price is $24.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to calculate the final price after applying the 25% coupon discount to the sale price of $24. This will be achieved by applying a 25% reduction to $24.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the final price after a 25% coupon discount:  
- A 25% discount means paying 75% of the sale price (100% - 25% = 75%).  
- Final price = $24 × (1 - 0.25) = $24 × 0.75 = $18.  
The final price is $18.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to determine the total discount percentage from the original price to the final price and find the single discount percentage that yields the same final price. This will be achieved by calculating the overall discount from $30 to $18 and expressing it as a single percentage.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the single discount percentage:  
- The original price is $30, and the final price is $18.  
- Total discount = $30 - $18 = $12.  
- Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) × 100 = ($12 / $30) × 100 = 0.4 × 100 = 40%.  
- To verify, apply a 40% discount to the original price:  
  - A 40% discount means paying 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%).  
  - $30 × 0.60 = $18, which matches the final price.  
The single discount percentage is 40%.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate that a single 40% discount produces the same final price as the two successive discounts. This will be achieved by comparing the final price from the single discount with the final price from the successive discounts.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- From Step 3, the final price after successive discounts (20% then 25%) is $18.  
- From Step 4, applying a 40% discount gives $30 × (1 - 0.40) = $30 × 0.60 = $18.  
- Since both methods yield $18, the single discount of 40% is correct.  
The solution is validated.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Find the single discount percentage equivalent to a 20% sale discount followed by a 25% coupon discount.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount (completed: $24).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the final price after the 25% coupon discount (completed: $18).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the single discount percentage (completed: 40%).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: 40% confirmed correct).  
**Current Goal:** None, as the main goal is achieved, and validation is complete.  
The single discount percentage is 40%.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The single percent discount that gives the same final price as the two successive discounts is **40%**.
