Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor the numerator $x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factor $x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x$, first factor out the greatest common factor, which is $x$:  

$$
x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x = x(x^2 - 2x - 8)
$$

Now, factor the quadratic $x^2 - 2x - 8$:  
$$
x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x - 4)(x + 2)
$$

So, the numerator becomes:  
$$
x(x - 4)(x + 2)
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Cancel out any common factors in the numerator and denominator.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expression becomes:

$$
\frac{x(x - 4)(x + 2)}{x + 2}
$$

We can cancel out the common factor $(x + 2)$, as long as $x \neq -2$ (since the denominator would be zero, and the expression is undefined). Thus, the simplified expression is:

$$
x(x - 4)
$$

Now the equation is:

$$
5 = x(x - 4)
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $5 = x(x - 4)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation:

$$
5 = x(x - 4)
$$

Expand the right-hand side:

$$
5 = x^2 - 4x
$$

Bring all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation:

$$
x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0
$$

Now, solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0$ by factoring. We look for two numbers that multiply to $-5$ and add to $-4$. These numbers are $-5$ and $1$. Thus:

$$
x^2 - 4x - 5 = (x - 5)(x + 1)
$$

So, the solutions are:

$$
x = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the algebraic steps and the validity of the solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Numerator Factoring**: The original numerator is $x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x$. Factoring out $x$ gives $x(x^2 - 2x - 8)$. The quadratic $x^2 - 2x - 8$ factors into $(x - 4)(x + 2)$, which is correct because $-4 \cdot 2 = -8$ and $-4 + 2 = -2$. This step is valid.

2. **Simplification**: The expression becomes $\frac{x(x - 4)(x + 2)}{x + 2}$. Canceling $(x + 2)$ is valid for $x \neq -2$, as division by zero is undefined. This step is correct.

3. **Solving the Simplified Equation**: The equation $5 = x(x - 4)$ expands to $x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0$. Factoring this quadratic gives $(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0$, leading to solutions $x = 5$ and $x = -1$. These solutions are valid because neither equals $-2$, the excluded value.

4. **Sum of Solutions**: The sum of $5$ and $-1$ is $4$. This aligns with Vieta's formula for quadratic equations ($-b/a = 4$), confirming correctness.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
