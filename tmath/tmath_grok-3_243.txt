### Problem Statement
The bookstore wants to determine the price \( p \) (in dollars, where \( p \leq 26 \)) for a book such that the monthly revenue is maximized. The number of books sold per month is given by the function \( 130 - 5p \). Revenue is calculated as price times quantity sold, so we need to maximize the revenue function \( R(p) = p \cdot (130 - 5p) \), subject to the constraint \( p \leq 26 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of maximizing revenue into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the revenue function based on price and quantity sold.  
2. Determine the mathematical approach to maximize the revenue function.  
3. Account for the constraint \( p \leq 26 \).  
4. Solve for the optimal price and verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the revenue function and set up the optimization problem. This will be achieved by expressing revenue as a function of price \( p \) using the given quantity function \( 130 - 5p \), and identifying the method to find the maximum (e.g., calculus or completing the square, since the function is quadratic).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The revenue \( R \) is the product of price \( p \) and the number of books sold \( 130 - 5p \):  
\[ R(p) = p \cdot (130 - 5p) = 130p - 5p^2 \]  
This is a quadratic function in the form \( R(p) = -5p^2 + 130p \). Since the coefficient of \( p^2 \) is negative (\(-5\)), the parabola opens downward, indicating a maximum at the vertex. To find the vertex, we can use the formula for the vertex of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where the vertex occurs at \( p = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -5 \), \( b = 130 \), so:  
\[ p = -\frac{130}{2 \cdot (-5)} = \frac{130}{10} = 13 \]  
Thus, the potential optimal price is \( p = 13 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the price \( p = 13 \) by checking if it satisfies the constraint \( p \leq 26 \) and confirming it maximizes revenue by evaluating the revenue at this point and considering boundary conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, check the constraint: \( p = 13 \leq 26 \), which is satisfied.  
Next, compute the revenue at \( p = 13 \):  
\[ R(13) = 13 \cdot (130 - 5 \cdot 13) = 13 \cdot (130 - 65) = 13 \cdot 65 = 845 \]  
To ensure this is the maximum, evaluate the revenue at the boundary \( p = 26 \):  
\[ R(26) = 26 \cdot (130 - 5 \cdot 26) = 26 \cdot (130 - 130) = 26 \cdot 0 = 0 \]  
Since \( R(26) = 0 \) is much lower than \( R(13) = 845 \), and the function is a downward-opening parabola, the vertex at \( p = 13 \) is likely the maximum. For additional confirmation, test a nearby point, e.g., \( p = 12 \):  
\[ R(12) = 12 \cdot (130 - 5 \cdot 12) = 12 \cdot (130 - 60) = 12 \cdot 70 = 840 \]  
Since \( R(12) = 840 < 845 \), and the function is symmetric around the vertex, \( p = 13 \) appears to maximize revenue.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Maximize the bookstoreâ€™s revenue.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the revenue function (completed: \( R(p) = 130p - 5p^2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the mathematical approach to maximize the revenue function (completed: used vertex of quadratic).  
  - Subgoal 3: Account for the constraint \( p \leq 26 \) (completed: verified \( p = 13 \leq 26 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for the optimal price and verify the solution (completed: \( p = 13 \), revenue = 845, validated with boundary and nearby points).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final solution and summarize.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by stating the optimal price and maximum revenue, ensuring all constraints and calculations are addressed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The optimal price is \( p = 13 \) dollars, which yields a maximum revenue of:  
\[ R(13) = 13 \cdot (130 - 5 \cdot 13) = 13 \cdot 65 = 845 \text{ dollars per month.} \]  
This satisfies the constraint \( p \leq 26 \), and validation confirms it is the maximum by comparing with boundary and nearby points.

### Final Answer
The bookstore should charge **$13** per book to maximize its monthly revenue, resulting in a revenue of **$845**.
