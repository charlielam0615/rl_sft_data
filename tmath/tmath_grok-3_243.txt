**Problem Statement**: A bookstore wants to determine the price \( p \) (in dollars, where \( p \leq 26 \)) to charge for a book to maximize its monthly revenue. The number of books sold per month is given by the function \( 130 - 5p \). Revenue is calculated as price times quantity sold, and we need to find the price \( p \) that maximizes this revenue.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem of maximizing revenue, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Define the revenue function based on price \( p \) and the number of books sold.  
2. Determine the mathematical approach to maximize the revenue function.  
3. Account for the constraint \( p \leq 26 \).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it maximizes revenue within the given constraints.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the revenue function. This will be achieved by multiplying the price \( p \) by the number of books sold, \( 130 - 5p \), to express revenue as a function of \( p \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The revenue \( R \) is the product of the price \( p \) and the quantity sold \( 130 - 5p \):  
\[ R(p) = p \cdot (130 - 5p) = 130p - 5p^2 \]  
This gives the revenue function \( R(p) = -5p^2 + 130p \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the price \( p \) that maximizes the revenue function \( R(p) = -5p^2 + 130p \). Since this is a quadratic function, we can find the maximum by determining the vertex of the parabola, and then check the constraint \( p \leq 26 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The revenue function \( R(p) = -5p^2 + 130p \) is a quadratic function of the form \( ap^2 + bp + c \), where \( a = -5 \), \( b = 130 \), and \( c = 0 \). Since \( a < 0 \), the parabola opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic function \( ap^2 + bp + c \) is at \( p = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

Calculate the vertex:  
\[ p = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{130}{2 \cdot (-5)} = \frac{130}{10} = 13 \]

Thus, the price that maximizes revenue is \( p = 13 \). Since \( p = 13 \leq 26 \), it satisfies the constraint.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( p = 13 \) maximizes revenue within the constraint \( p \leq 26 \). This will be achieved by checking the revenue at \( p = 13 \), comparing it with boundary points (e.g., \( p = 26 \)), and confirming the behavior of the function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the revenue at \( p = 13 \):  
\[ R(13) = -5(13)^2 + 130 \cdot 13 = -5 \cdot 169 + 1690 = -845 + 1690 = 845 \]

Check the boundary at \( p = 26 \):  
\[ R(26) = -5(26)^2 + 130 \cdot 26 = -5 \cdot 676 + 3380 = -3380 + 3380 = 0 \]

Check another point, e.g., \( p = 10 \):  
\[ R(10) = -5(10)^2 + 130 \cdot 10 = -5 \cdot 100 + 1300 = -500 + 1300 = 800 \]

The revenue at \( p = 13 \) (\( 845 \)) is higher than at \( p = 10 \) (\( 800 \)) and \( p = 26 \) (\( 0 \)). To further confirm, note that the second derivative of \( R(p) = -5p^2 + 130p \) is \( R''(p) = -10 \), which is negative, confirming a maximum at \( p = 13 \).
