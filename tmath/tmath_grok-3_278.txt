**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( c \) such that the circle defined by the equation \( x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 4.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( c \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form by completing the square for \( x \) and \( y \).  
2. Identify the radius from the standard form and set it equal to 4.  
3. Solve for \( c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form by completing the square.  
How to Achieve: Group \( x \)-terms and \( y \)-terms, complete the square for each, and simplify to obtain the standard form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \]  

Group terms:  
\[ (x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 - 4y) + c = 0 \]  

Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9 \] (since \( 6/2 = 3 \), and \( 3^2 = 9 \))  

Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \] (since \( -4/2 = -2 \), and \( (-2)^2 = 4 \))  

Substitute back:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 + c = 0 \]  

Simplify:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 13 + c = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c \]  

The equation is now in standard form, where the right-hand side represents the radius squared.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set the radius equal to 4 and solve for \( c \).  
How to Achieve: From the standard form \( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c \), the radius is \( \sqrt{13 - c} \). Set \( \sqrt{13 - c} = 4 \), square both sides, and solve for \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the standard form:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c \]  

The radius is:  
\[ r = \sqrt{13 - c} \]  

Given \( r = 4 \):  
\[ \sqrt{13 - c} = 4 \]  

Square both sides:  
\[ 13 - c = 16 \]  

Solve for \( c \):  
\[ c = 13 - 16 = -3 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( c = -3 \) produces a circle with radius 4.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( c = -3 \) back into the standard form equation and check if the radius is 4.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( c = -3 \) into the standard form:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - (-3) = 13 + 3 = 16 \]  

The radius is:  
\[ r = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]  

This matches the given radius, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( c \) such that the circle \( x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 4.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set the radius equal to 4 and solve for \( c \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  

Current Goal: None (problem solved).  
The solution \( c = -3 \) has been validated.

**Final Answer**: The value of \( c \) is \(-3\).
