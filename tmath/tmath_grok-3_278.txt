### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( c \) such that the circle defined by the equation \( x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 4.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( c \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form by completing the square for \( x \) and \( y \).  
2. Identify the radius from the standard form and set it equal to 4.  
3. Solve for \( c \) using the resulting equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form.  
- **How to Achieve**: Complete the square for the \( x \)-terms (\( x^2 + 6x \)) and \( y \)-terms (\( y^2 - 4y \)), then simplify to express the equation in the form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \]

**Complete the square for \( x \)**:  
\[ x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9 \]  
(Since \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \), and \( 3^2 = 9 \).)

**Complete the square for \( y \)**:  
\[ y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \]  
(Since \( -4 \div 2 = -2 \), and \( (-2)^2 = 4 \).)

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 + c = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 9 - 4 + c = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + c - 13 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c \]

The equation is now in standard form: \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where the radius squared is \( r^2 = 13 - c \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set the radius equal to 4 and solve for \( c \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since the radius \( r = \sqrt{13 - c} \), set \( \sqrt{13 - c} = 4 \), square both sides to eliminate the square root, and solve the resulting equation for \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the standard form:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c \]  
The radius \( r = \sqrt{13 - c} \). Given \( r = 4 \):  
\[ \sqrt{13 - c} = 4 \]

Square both sides:  
\[ 13 - c = 16 \]

Solve for \( c \):  
\[ c = 13 - 16 \]  
\[ c = -3 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( c = -3 \) produces a circle with radius 4.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( c = -3 \) back into the standard form equation, compute the radius, and check if it equals 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( c = -3 \) into the standard form:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - (-3) = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

The radius is:  
\[ r = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]

This matches the given radius of 4, confirming the solution is correct.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( c \) such that the circle \( x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 4.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set the radius equal to 4 and solve for \( c \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution since all subgoals are achieved.  

**Conclusion**: The value of \( c \) is \(-3\), as it satisfies the condition that the circle has a radius of 4.
