### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up equations for the two fractions based on their sum and product.  
- **How to Achieve**: Let the two fractions be \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{c}{d}\). Use the given conditions to form equations: their sum is \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{11}{12}\), and their product is \(\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{1}{6}\). To simplify, assume common denominators or express as single variables for algebraic manipulation.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the two fractions be \(x\) and \(y\). We have:  
1. \(x + y = \frac{11}{12}\)  
2. \(x \cdot y = \frac{1}{6}\)  

To solve, represent \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\) from the first equation and substitute into the second equation to form a quadratic equation in \(x\).  

Substitute \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\) into \(x \cdot y = \frac{1}{6}\):  
\[ x \cdot \left( \frac{11}{12} - x \right) = \frac{1}{6} \]  

Multiply through by 12 to clear denominators:  
\[ 12x \cdot \left( \frac{11}{12} - x \right) = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \]  
\[ 12x \cdot \frac{11}{12} - 12x^2 = 2 \]  
\[ 11x - 12x^2 = 2 \]  

Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[ -12x^2 + 11x - 2 = 0 \]  
\[ 12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation to find the values of the fractions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula to solve \(12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0\) for \(x\), then find \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \(12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0\), apply the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 12\), \(b = -11\), and \(c = 2\).  

Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-11)^2 - 4 \cdot 12 \cdot 2 = 121 - 96 = 25 \]  

Solve for \(x\):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-11) \pm \sqrt{25}}{2 \cdot 12} = \frac{11 \pm 5}{24} \]  

Two solutions:  
\[ x_1 = \frac{11 + 5}{24} = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
\[ x_2 = \frac{11 - 5}{24} = \frac{6}{24} = \frac{1}{4} \]  

Find corresponding \(y\) values using \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\):  
- If \(x = \frac{2}{3}\):  
  \[ y = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
- If \(x = \frac{1}{4}\):  
  \[ y = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \]  

Thus, the two fractions are \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the fractions \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) satisfy the given conditions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check if their sum equals \(\frac{11}{12}\) and their product equals \(\frac{1}{6}\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the sum:  
\[ \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \]  
This satisfies the first condition.  

Verify the product:  
\[ \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \]  
This satisfies the second condition.  

Both conditions are met, confirming the fractions are correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the lesser of the two fractions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Compare \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) numerically or by converting to a common denominator.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compare \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\):  
Convert to a common denominator (12):  
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \]  
Since \(\frac{3}{12} < \frac{8}{12}\), we have \(\frac{1}{4} < \frac{2}{3}\).  

The lesser fraction is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the lesser fraction (completed, current goal).  
  - Subgoal 5: Ensure the answer is a common fraction (to be confirmed).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the lesser fraction and ensure it is a common fraction.  
The lesser fraction is \(\frac{1}{4}\), which is already in its simplest form as a common fraction (numerator and denominator are coprime).
