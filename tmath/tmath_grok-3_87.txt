### Problem Statement
We need to find two fractions whose sum is \(\frac{11}{12}\), whose product is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and identify the lesser of the two fractions, expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, we break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Represent the two fractions as variables, say \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{c}{d}\).
2. Set up equations based on the given conditions: their sum is \(\frac{11}{12}\) and their product is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
3. Simplify the equations, possibly by assuming a common denominator or expressing one fraction in terms of the other.
4. Solve the resulting system of equations to find the fractions.
5. Identify the lesser of the two fractions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up equations for the two fractions based on their sum and product.
How to Achieve: Let the two fractions be \(x\) and \(y\). We have:
- \(x + y = \frac{11}{12}\)
- \(x \cdot y = \frac{1}{6}\)
Since these are fractions, assume \(x = \frac{p}{q}\) and \(y = \frac{r}{s}\), but for simplicity, treat them as variables and solve the system of equations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the equations:
- \(x + y = \frac{11}{12}\)
- \(x \cdot y = \frac{1}{6}\)
Assume \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\) from the first equation. Substitute into the second:
\[ x \left( \frac{11}{12} - x \right) = \frac{1}{6} \]
Multiply through by 12 to clear the denominator:
\[ 12x \left( \frac{11}{12} - x \right) = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ 12x \cdot \frac{11}{12} - 12x^2 = 2 \]
\[ 11x - 12x^2 = 2 \]
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:
\[ 12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \(12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0\) to find the values of \(x\) (one fraction).
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 12\), \(b = -11\), \(c = 2\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For \(12x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0\):
- \(a = 12\), \(b = -11\), \(c = 2\)
- Discriminant: \(\Delta = (-11)^2 - 4 \cdot 12 \cdot 2 = 121 - 96 = 25\)
- Quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2 \cdot 12} = \frac{11 \pm 5}{24}\)
- Solutions:
  - \(x_1 = \frac{11 + 5}{24} = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3}\)
  - \(x_2 = \frac{11 - 5}{24} = \frac{6}{24} = \frac{1}{4}\)
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the second fraction \(y\) for each value of \(x\) using \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\).
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{4}\) into the equation \(y = \frac{11}{12} - x\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- If \(x = \frac{2}{3}\):
  \[ y = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \]
- If \(x = \frac{1}{4}\):
  \[ y = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{11}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \]
So, the two fractions are \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the fractions \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) satisfy both conditions (sum and product).
How to Achieve: Compute their sum and product and check against \(\frac{11}{12}\) and \(\frac{1}{6}\).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Sum: \(\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}\). This satisfies the first condition.
- Product: \(\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\). This satisfies the second condition.
Both conditions are met, confirming the fractions are correct.

Action: Track Goals (Review)

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the lesser of the two fractions, \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).
How to Achieve: Compare the numerical values of \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) by converting to a common denominator or decimal form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Common denominator (12): \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{12}\), \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}\).
- Since \(\frac{3}{12} < \frac{8}{12}\), the lesser fraction is \(\frac{1}{4}\).
Alternatively, in decimal form:
- \(\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667\), \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\). Since \(0.25 < 0.6667\), the lesser fraction is \(\frac{1}{4}\).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The lesser of the two fractions is \(\frac{1}{4}\).
