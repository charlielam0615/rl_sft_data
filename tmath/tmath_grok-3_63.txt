**Problem Statement**: The graph of the equation \( y = |x| - 3 \) is translated two units to the left and three units down. We need to determine the coordinates of the minimum point of the resulting graph.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the coordinates of the minimum point after the translation:  
1. Identify the minimum point of the original graph \( y = |x| - 3 \).  
2. Apply the translation (two units left, three units down) to the minimum point.  
3. Verify the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the minimum point of the original graph \( y = |x| - 3 \). This will be achieved by analyzing the equation, which is a transformation of the absolute value function \( y = |x| \), and determining the vertex, which is the minimum point for this function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation \( y = |x| - 3 \) represents the graph of \( y = |x| \) shifted downward by 3 units. The absolute value function \( y = |x| \) has a vertex (minimum point) at \( (0, 0) \). Shifting it down by 3 units changes the y-coordinate of the vertex. Thus, the minimum point of \( y = |x| - 3 \) is at \( (0, -3) \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the translation (two units left, three units down) to the minimum point of the original graph. This will be achieved by adjusting the coordinates of the minimum point based on the translation rules.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The original minimum point is \( (0, -3) \). A translation of two units to the left subtracts 2 from the x-coordinate, and a translation of three units down subtracts 3 from the y-coordinate.  
- New x-coordinate: \( 0 - 2 = -2 \)  
- New y-coordinate: \( -3 - 3 = -6 \)  
Thus, the minimum point of the new graph is \( (-2, -6) \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coordinates of the minimum point of the translated graph.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the minimum point of the original graph \( y = |x| - 3 \) (completed: minimum point is \( (0, -3) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the translation to the minimum point (completed: translated point is \( (-2, -6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( (-2, -6) \) is the minimum point of the new graph. This will be achieved by determining the equation of the translated graph and checking the vertex.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To verify, find the equation of the translated graph. The original equation is \( y = |x| - 3 \).  
- Translating two units left replaces \( x \) with \( x + 2 \), so \( y = |x + 2| - 3 \).  
- Translating three units down subtracts 3 from the entire function: \( y = |x + 2| - 3 - 3 = |x + 2| - 6 \).  
The new equation is \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \). For an absolute value function \( y = |x - h| + k \), the vertex is at \( (h, k) \). Here, \( |x + 2| = |x - (-2)| \), so \( h = -2 \), and \( k = -6 \). Thus, the vertex (minimum point) is \( (-2, -6) \), confirming the coordinates.

**Final Answer**: The coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph are \( (-2, -6) \).
