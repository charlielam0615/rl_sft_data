**Problem Statement**: The graph of the equation \( y = |x| - 3 \) is translated two units to the left and three units down. We need to determine the coordinates of the minimum point of the resulting graph.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the original graph and its minimum point.  
2. Apply the translations to the graph equation.  
3. Identify the minimum point of the new graph.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the original graph of \( y = |x| - 3 \) and find its minimum point. This can be achieved by analyzing the equation, which is a transformation of the absolute value function \( y = |x| \), and determining the vertex, which is the minimum point for an absolute value function opening upward.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation \( y = |x| - 3 \) represents the graph of \( y = |x| \), which has a vertex at \( (0, 0) \), shifted downward by 3 units due to the \(-3\). Since the absolute value function \( y = |x| \) has a minimum at its vertex, the vertex of \( y = |x| - 3 \) is at \( x = 0 \), and the y-coordinate is \( y = |0| - 3 = -3 \). Thus, the minimum point of the original graph is \( (0, -3) \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the translations (two units left and three units down) to the original graph’s equation and determine the new equation. This can be achieved by applying the rules of graph transformations: a translation left by \( h \) units replaces \( x \) with \( x + h \), and a translation down by \( k \) units subtracts \( k \) from the function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the original equation \( y = |x| - 3 \):  
- A translation two units to the left replaces \( x \) with \( x + 2 \), so the equation becomes \( y = |x + 2| - 3 \).  
- A translation three units down subtracts 3 from the function, so the new equation is:  
  \( y = |x + 2| - 3 - 3 = |x + 2| - 6 \).  
Thus, the equation of the translated graph is \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the minimum point of the new graph \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \). This can be achieved by identifying the vertex of the absolute value function, which is the point where the expression inside the absolute value equals zero, adjusted by the constant term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \) is an absolute value function. The vertex occurs when the expression inside the absolute value is zero: \( x + 2 = 0 \), so \( x = -2 \). Substituting \( x = -2 \) into the equation:  
\( y = |-2 + 2| - 6 = |0| - 6 = -6 \).  
Thus, the minimum point of the new graph is \( (-2, -6) \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the minimum point \( (-2, -6) \) is correct by confirming the translation effects on the original minimum point. This can be achieved by applying the translations directly to the original vertex and checking consistency with the new equation’s vertex.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The original minimum point is \( (0, -3) \).  
- Translating two units left subtracts 2 from the x-coordinate: \( 0 - 2 = -2 \).  
- Translating three units down subtracts 3 from the y-coordinate: \( -3 - 3 = -6 \).  
This gives the new minimum point as \( (-2, -6) \), which matches the vertex of \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \).  
To further validate, test another point on the new graph. For \( x = 0 \):  
\( y = |0 + 2| - 6 = |2| - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4 \).  
The point \( (0, -4) \) should lie on the new graph. Compared to the original graph at \( x = 0 \), \( y = |0| - 3 = -3 \), the y-coordinate is 3 units lower (\( -3 - 3 = -6 \)), and the x-shift is consistent, confirming the translation.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coordinates of the minimum point of the translated graph.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the original graph’s minimum point (completed: \( (0, -3) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply translations to find the new equation (completed: \( y = |x + 2| - 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the minimum point of the new graph (completed: \( (-2, -6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: confirmed via translation and point testing).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the minimum point \( (-2, -6) \) has been determined and validated.

**Final Answer**: The coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph are \( (-2, -6) \).
