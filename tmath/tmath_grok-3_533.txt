### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form (\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)).  
2. Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
3. Use the sum of roots formula for a quadratic equation to find the sum of the solutions.  
4. Validate the result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 - 4x - 14 = 3x + 16 \]  
Subtract \( 3x + 16 \) from both sides:  
\[ x^2 - 4x - 14 - 3x - 16 = 0 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ x^2 - 4x - 3x - 14 - 16 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard form: \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of the quadratic equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the standard form \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \) to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is:  
\[ x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \]  
Comparing to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( a = 1 \)  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( b = -7 \)  
- Constant term: \( c = -30 \)  
So, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -30 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the sum of the solutions using the sum of roots formula.  
**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Use the coefficients identified in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the sum of roots formula for \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \):  
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \)  
- Sum of roots = \( -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-7}{1} = 7 \)  
The sum of the solutions is 7.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the sum of the solutions.  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the quadratic equation explicitly to find the roots, then compute their sum to confirm it matches the result from the formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
With \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -30 \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-30) = 49 + 120 = 169 \)  
- Roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{169}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 13}{2} \]  
\[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 13}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]  
\[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 13}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \]  
Sum of the roots: \( 10 + (-3) = 7 \).  
This matches the sum obtained from the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} = 7 \).
