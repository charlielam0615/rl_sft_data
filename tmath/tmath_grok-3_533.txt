**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form (\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)).  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the two solutions.  
3. Calculate the sum of the solutions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form.  
How to Achieve: Move all terms to one side of the equation by subtracting \( 3x + 16 \) from both sides.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with \( x^2 - 4x - 14 = 3x + 16 \), subtract \( 3x + 16 \) from both sides:  
\[ x^2 - 4x - 14 - 3x - 16 = 0 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \]  
The equation is now in standard form: \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the standard form of the equation is correct.  
How to Achieve: Check the simplification by expanding or recomputing the terms moved across the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, revisit the original equation \( x^2 - 4x - 14 = 3x + 16 \). After moving terms:  
Left side: \( x^2 - 4x - 14 - 3x - 16 = x^2 - 7x - 30 \).  
Right side: 0.  
The coefficients are: \( x^2: 1 \), \( x: -4 - 3 = -7 \), constant: \( -14 - 16 = -30 \).  
This confirms \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \) to find the two solutions.  
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -30 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), \( c = -30 \).  
Compute the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-30) = 49 + 120 = 169 \]  
Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{169}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm 13}{2} \]  
Solutions:  
\[ x_1 = \frac{7 + 13}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]  
\[ x_2 = \frac{7 - 13}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \]  
The solutions are \( x = 10 \) and \( x = -3 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( x = 10 \) and \( x = -3 \) satisfy the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute each solution into \( x^2 - 4x - 14 = 3x + 16 \) and check equality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = 10 \):  
Left side: \( 10^2 - 4(10) - 14 = 100 - 40 - 14 = 46 \).  
Right side: \( 3(10) + 16 = 30 + 16 = 46 \).  
\( 46 = 46 \), so \( x = 10 \) is valid.  

For \( x = -3 \):  
Left side: \( (-3)^2 - 4(-3) - 14 = 9 + 12 - 14 = 7 \).  
Right side: \( 3(-3) + 16 = -9 + 16 = 7 \).  
\( 7 = 7 \), so \( x = -3 \) is valid.  
Both solutions are correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the solutions.  
How to Achieve: Add the two solutions \( x = 10 \) and \( x = -3 \). Alternatively, use the fact that for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Method 1: Direct addition:  
\[ 10 + (-3) = 10 - 3 = 7 \]  

Method 2: Using the quadratic formula sum of roots:  
For \( x^2 - 7x - 30 = 0 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \).  
Sum of roots: \( -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-7}{1} = 7 \).  

Both methods yield the sum as 7.
