**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the right-hand side by evaluating the expression inside the absolute value.  
2. Set up the equation with the simplified right-hand side.  
3. Solve for \( x \) by isolating the variable.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the right-hand side by evaluating \( |{-17 + 3}| \).  
How to Achieve: Compute the expression inside the absolute value, then apply the absolute value function.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Evaluate the expression:  
\[ -17 + 3 = -14 \]  
Take the absolute value:  
\[ |{-14}| = 14 \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 2x + 4 = 14 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = 14 \) for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 4 from both sides and then dividing by 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ 2x + 4 = 14 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 2x = 14 - 4 \]  
\[ 2x = 10 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} \]  
\[ x = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = 5 \) satisfies the original equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the left-hand side and compare it with the right-hand side.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Left-hand side:  
\[ 2(5) + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \]  
Right-hand side (already computed):  
\[ |{-17 + 3}| = |{-14}| = 14 \]  
Since \( 14 = 14 \), the solution \( x = 5 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the right-hand side (completed: \( |{-17 + 3}| = 14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation \( 2x + 4 = 14 \) (completed: \( x = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: \( x = 5 \) satisfies the equation).  
Current Goal: None (problem solved).  
The solution \( x = 5 \) has been reached and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) that makes the equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \) true is \( x = 5 \).
