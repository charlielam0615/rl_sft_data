### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation:  
1. Simplify the right-hand side by evaluating the expression inside the absolute value.  
2. Set up the resulting equation after simplification.  
3. Solve the equation for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Simplify the right-hand side by evaluating \( |{-17 + 3}| \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute the expression inside the absolute value (\( -17 + 3 \)) and then apply the absolute value to obtain a numerical result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \( -17 + 3 \):  
\[ -17 + 3 = -14 \]  
Take the absolute value:  
\[ |{-14}| = 14 \]  
The right-hand side simplifies to 14, so the equation becomes:  
\[ 2x + 4 = 14 \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = 14 \) for \( x \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 4 from both sides and then dividing both sides by 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:  
\[ 2x + 4 = 14 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 2x = 14 - 4 \]  
\[ 2x = 10 \]  
Divide both sides by 2:  
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} \]  
\[ x = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that \( x = 5 \) satisfies the original equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the left-hand side and recompute the right-hand side, then check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the left-hand side:  
\[ 2(5) + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \]  
Recompute the right-hand side:  
\[ |{-17 + 3}| = |{-14}| = 14 \]  
Compare:  
\[ 14 = 14 \]  
The equation holds true for \( x = 5 \).

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) that satisfies \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the right-hand side (completed: \( |{-17 + 3}| = 14 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = 14 \) (completed: \( x = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: \( x = 5 \) satisfies the equation).  

**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) that makes the equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \) true is \( x = 5 \).
