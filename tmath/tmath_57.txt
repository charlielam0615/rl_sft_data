0.9 + 1.2 + 2.4 = 4.5
$$  

Thus, the sum of all $ x $-values for which $ y = 1.8 $ is $ \boxed{4.5} $.

We are given a piecewise linear function composed of five line segments and asked to find the sum of all x-values for which the function equals 1.8. Let's walk through the process step-by-step using backward subgoaling to ensure correctness.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We are to find all x-values such that $ y = 1.8 $, and then sum them. The function is defined in five segments with specific domains. For each segment, we must:

1. Solve the equation $ y = 1.8 $.
2. Check if the resulting x-value lies within the segment's domain.
3. If valid, retain the x-value for summation.

---

### **Step 2: Review Segment Equations and Domains**

| Segment | Equation | Domain |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | $ y = 2x + 3 $ | $ x \in [-4, -2] $ |
| 2 | $ y = -x - 3 $ | $ x \in [-2, -1] $ |
| 3 | $ y = 2x $ | $ x \in [-1, 1] $ |
| 4 | $ y = -x + 3 $ | $ x \in [1, 2] $ |
| 5 | $ y = 2x - 3 $ | $ x \in [2, 4] $ |

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $ in Each Segment**

#### **Segment 1: $ y = 2x + 3 $**
$$
1.8 = 2x + 3 \Rightarrow 2x = -1.2 \Rightarrow x = -0.6
$$
Check domain: $ x = -0.6 \notin [-4, -2] $ → **Invalid**

#### **Segment 2: $ y = -x - 3 $**
$$
1.8 = -x - 3 \Rightarrow -x = 4.8 \Rightarrow x = -4.8
$$
Check domain: $ x = -4.8 \notin [-2, -1] $ → **Invalid**

#### **Segment 3: $ y = 2x $**
$$
1.8 = 2x \Rightarrow x = 0.9
$$
Check domain: $ x = 0.9 \in [-1, 1] $ → **Valid**

#### **Segment 4: $ y = -x + 3 $**
$$
1.8 = -x + 3 \Rightarrow -x = -1.2 \Rightarrow x = 1.2
$$
Check domain: $ x = 1.2 \in [1, 2] $ → **Valid**

#### **Segment 5: $ y = 2x - 3 $**
$$
1.8 = 2x - 3 \Rightarrow 2x = 4.8 \Rightarrow x = 2.4
$$
Check domain: $ x = 2.4 \in [2, 4] $ → **Valid**

---

### **Step 4: Sum Valid x-values**

From steps above, the valid x-values are:
- $ x = 0.9 $ (from segment 3)
- $ x = 1.2 $ (from segment 4)
- $ x = 2.4 $ (from segment 5)

Sum:
$$
0.9 + 1.2 + 2.4 = 4.5
$$

---

### **Step 5: Final Self-Verification**

- All equations were set up correctly.
- All solutions were checked for domain validity.
- The sum of valid x-values is consistent with the calculations.
- No segment was overlooked.
- The total sum is $ \boxed{4.5} $.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4.5}
$$

### **Step 6: Backward Subgoaling**

We now verify the correctness of the final answer by working backward from the conclusion and confirming that each step logically supports it.

---

#### **6.1 Final Conclusion:**
We are to find the **sum of all x-values** such that the piecewise function equals **1.8**.

---

#### **6.2 Reverse Step 5: Summing Valid x-values**

We concluded that the valid x-values are:
- $ x = 0.9 $
- $ x = 1.2 $
- $ x = 2.4 $

Sum:  
$$
0.9 + 1.2 + 2.4 = 4.5
$$

✅ This sum is correct and directly follows from the individual x-values.

---

#### **6.3 Reverse Step 4: Validating x-values Against Domains**

- **Segment 3:** $ x = 0.9 $ is in $ [-1, 1] $ → Valid  
- **Segment 4:** $ x = 1.2 $ is in $ [1, 2] $ → Valid  
- **Segment 5:** $ x = 2.4 $ is in $ [2, 4] $ → Valid

These x-values were correctly identified and retained.

---

#### **6.4 Reverse Step 3: Solving for x in Each Segment**

- **Segment 1:**  
  $ 1.8 = 2x + 3 \Rightarrow x = -0.6 $, which is **not** in $ [-4, -2] $ → Correctly discarded

- **Segment 2:**  
  $ 1.8 = -x - 3 \Rightarrow x = -4.8 $, which is **not** in $ [-2, -1] $ → Correctly discarded

- **Segment 3:**  
  $ 1.8 = 2x \Rightarrow x = 0.9 $, which **is** in $ [-1, 1] $ → Correctly retained

- **Segment 4:**  
  $ 1.8 = -x + 3 \Rightarrow x = 1.2 $, which **is** in $ [1, 2] $ → Correctly retained

- **Segment 5:**  
  $ 1.8 = 2x - 3 \Rightarrow x = 2.4 $, which **is** in $ [2, 4] $ → Correctly retained

Each equation was solved correctly and evaluated for domain consistency.

---

#### **6.5 Reverse Step 2: Segment Equations and Domains**

| Segment | Equation | Domain |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | $ y = 2x + 3 $ | $ x \in [-4, -2] $ |
| 2 | $ y = -x - 3 $ | $ x \in [-2, -1] $ |
| 3 | $ y = 2x $ | $ x \in [-1, 1] $ |
| 4 | $ y = -x + 3 $ | $ x \in [1, 2] $ |
| 5 | $ y = 2x - 3 $ | $ x \in [2, 4] $ |

These are consistent with the problem setup and correctly used in solving.

---

#### **6.6 Reverse Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We were asked to find all **x-values** for which the **piecewise function equals 1.8** and then to **sum** them.

- We correctly interpreted the problem.
- We applied the function equations in their respective domains.
- We only included x-values that were both solutions to the equations and within the valid domains.

---

### ✅ Final Self-Verification (Solution Complete)

- The sum of valid x-values is consistent across all steps.
- No segment was double-counted or missed.

[PLANNING]
Identify the scope of the verification. Since this is the final step before submission, the verification must cover all aspects of the solution: the equations solved, domain validations, and the summation of valid x-values. The goal is to confirm that the final answer is fully justified and free of errors.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The solution process involves solving five linear equations derived from the piecewise function for $ y = 1.8 $, validating each solution against its domain, and summing the valid x-values. Let's retrace these steps:  

1. **Equations and Domain Validations**:  
   - **Segment 1**: $ 1.8 = 2x + 3 \Rightarrow x = -0.6 $. The domain $ [-4, -2] $ does not include $ -0.6 $, so this is correctly excluded.  
   - **Segment 2**: $ 1.8 = -x - 3 \Rightarrow x = -4.8 $. The domain $ [-2, -1] $ does not include $ -4.8 $, so this is correctly excluded.  
   - **Segment 3**: $ 1.8 = 2x \Rightarrow x = 0.9 $. The domain $ [-1, 1] $ includes $ 0.9 $, so this is valid.  
   - **Segment 4**: $ 1.8 = -x + 3 \Rightarrow x = 1.2 $. The domain $ [1, 2] $ includes $ 1.2 $, so this is valid.  
   - **Segment 5**: $ 1.8 = 2x - 3 \Rightarrow x = 2.4 $. The domain $ [2, 4] $ includes $ 2.4 $, so this is valid.  

2. **Summation of Valid x-Values**:  
   - Valid x-values: $ 0.9, 1.2, 2.4 $.  
   - Sum: $ 0.9 + 1.2 = 2.1 $, $ 2.1 + 2.4 = 4.5 $. The arithmetic is correct.  

3. **Logical Consistency**:  
   - All equations were solved correctly using algebraic manipulation.  
   - Domain checks were performed rigorously, and only values within the specified intervals were retained.  
   - No steps were omitted, and the backward reasoning confirms the final answer aligns with the problem's constraints.  

No discrepancies or errors were identified in the reasoning, calculations, or validations. The final answer is fully supported by the solution process.
