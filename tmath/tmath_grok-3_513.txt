### Problem Restatement
We need to compute the value of \(-2 \S 3\), where the operation \(\S\) is defined as \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\). This means we need to substitute \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression and calculate the result.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the given operation \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\).  
2. Substitute the values \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression.  
3. Perform the arithmetic to compute the final result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(-2 \S 3\) using the definition \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\). This will be achieved by substituting \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression and performing the arithmetic operations.

[IMP]  
Substitute \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\):  
- First term: \(a(b + 1) = -2(3 + 1) = -2 \cdot 4 = -8\).  
- Second term: \(ab = (-2) \cdot 3 = -6\).  
- Combine: \(-8 + (-6) = -8 - 6 = -14\).  
Thus, \(-2 \S 3 = -14\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \(-2 \S 3 = -14\). This will be achieved by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps to ensure no errors were made.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
- Operation: \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\).  
- For \(a = -2\), \(b = 3\):  
  - \(b + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4\).  
  - First term: \(-2 \cdot 4 = -8\).  
  - Second term: \(-2 \cdot 3 = -6\).  
  - Total: \(-8 + (-6) = -8 - 6 = -14\).  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming \(-2 \S 3 = -14\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(-2 \S 3\) using the definition \(a \S b = a(b + 1) + ab\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the operation definition (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \(a = -2\), \(b = 3\) and compute (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer and ensure all steps align with the problem requirements. The computation and validation indicate \(-2 \S 3 = -14\).
