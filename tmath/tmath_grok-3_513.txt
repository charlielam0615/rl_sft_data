**Problem Statement**: We are given a custom operation defined as \( a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab \). We need to compute the value of \( (-2) \$ 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, we need to compute the value of \( (-2) \$ 3 \) using the given operation \( a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab \). The first step is to break this down into a clear subtask: substitute the values \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \) into the expression and perform the calculation systematically.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( (-2) \$ 3 \) using the formula \( a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab \). To achieve this, substitute \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \) into the expression, simplify step-by-step, and calculate the final value.

[IMP]
Using the definition \( a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab \), substitute \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \):

\[
(-2) \$ 3 = (-2)(3 + 1) + (-2)(3)
\]

1. Compute the first term: \( (-2)(3 + 1) = (-2)(4) = -8 \).
2. Compute the second term: \( (-2)(3) = -6 \).
3. Add the two terms: \( -8 + (-6) = -8 - 6 = -14 \).

Thus, the value of \( (-2) \$ 3 \) is \( -14 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation of \( (-2) \$ 3 = -14 \). This can be achieved by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps to ensure no errors were made.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( (-2) \$ 3 \) to validate:

\[
(-2) \$ 3 = (-2)(3 + 1) + (-2)(3)
\]

- First term: \( 3 + 1 = 4 \), so \( (-2)(4) = -8 \).
- Second term: \( (-2)(3) = -6 \).
- Total: \( -8 + (-6) = -14 \).

The calculation is consistent with the previous result. To further validate, consider the expression algebraically:

\[
a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab = ab + a + ab = 2ab + a
\]

Substitute \( a = -2 \), \( b = 3 \):

\[
2(-2)(3) + (-2) = -12 - 2 = -14
\]

This confirms the result is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Compute the value of \( (-2) \$ 3 \) using the operation \( a \$ b = a(b + 1) + ab \).
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \) into the expression and compute (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Validate the computation to ensure accuracy (completed in Step 3).

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that all steps have been addressed and the solution is complete. The computation and validation are consistent, yielding \( -14 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( (-2) \$ 3 \) is \( -14 \).
