### Problem Statement
We need to compute \( f(f(f(17))) \) for the piecewise function:
\[
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
x^2 - 4 & \text{if } x < 7, \\
x - 13 & \text{if } x \geq 7.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \( f(f(f(17))) \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute \( f(17) \).
2. Compute \( f(f(17)) \).
3. Compute \( f(f(f(17))) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( f(17) \). Since \( 17 \geq 7 \), apply the second branch of the piecewise function, \( f(x) = x - 13 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 17 \):
\[
f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(17)) = f(4) \). Since \( f(17) = 4 \) and \( 4 < 7 \), apply the first branch of the piecewise function, \( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 4 \):
\[
f(4) = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(17))) = f(f(4)) = f(12) \). Since \( f(4) = 12 \) and \( 12 \geq 7 \), apply the second branch of the piecewise function, \( f(x) = x - 13 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 12 \):
\[
f(12) = 12 - 13 = -1
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(f(f(17))) \). Recompute the steps to ensure correctness: \( f(17) \), \( f(4) \), and \( f(12) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
1. \( x = 17 \), \( 17 \geq 7 \): \( f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4 \).
2. \( x = 4 \), \( 4 < 7 \): \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \).
3. \( x = 12 \), \( 12 \geq 7 \): \( f(12) = 12 - 13 = -1 \).

The results match the previous computations.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(17))) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(17) = 4 \).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(17)) = f(4) = 12 \).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(17))) = f(12) = -1 \).

Current goal: Completed computation of \( f(f(f(17))) = -1 \).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[
f(f(f(17))) = -1
\]
