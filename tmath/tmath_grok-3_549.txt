**Problem Statement**: We need to evaluate the composite function \( f(f(f(17))) \) for the piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 - 4 & \text{if } x < 7, \\ x - 13 & \text{if } x \geq 7. \end{cases} \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(f(f(17))) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(17) \).  
2. Compute \( f \) of the result from step 1, i.e., \( f(f(17)) \).  
3. Compute \( f \) of the result from step 2, i.e., \( f(f(f(17))) \).  
Each step involves applying the piecewise function based on the input value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(17) \). Since \( 17 \geq 7 \), use the second piece of the function, \( f(x) = x - 13 \).  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 17 \), since \( 17 \geq 7 \), we apply \( f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(17)) = f(4) \). Since \( 4 < 7 \), use the first piece of the function, \( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \).  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 4 \), since \( 4 < 7 \), we apply \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(17))) = f(12) \). Since \( 12 \geq 7 \), use the second piece of the function, \( f(x) = x - 13 \).  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 12 \), since \( 12 \geq 7 \), we apply \( f(12) = 12 - 13 = -1 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(17))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(17) = 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(17)) = f(4) = 12 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(17))) = f(12) = -1 \).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the computation of \( f(f(f(17))) \), which has been computed as \( -1 \).  

[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\( f(f(f(17))) = -1 \)
