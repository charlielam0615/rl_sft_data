**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \), compute the value of \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(4) \).  
2. Compute \( f(g(4)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(4) \).  
4. Compute \( g(f(4)) \).  
5. Subtract \( g(f(4)) \) from \( f(g(4)) \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(4) \).  
Description: Evaluate the function \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) at \( x = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( g(4) \):  
\[ g(x) = 3x + 5 \]  
\[ g(4) = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 \]  
So, \( g(4) = 17 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(g(4)) \).  
Description: Use the result \( g(4) = 17 \) and evaluate \( f(x) = x + 3 \) at \( x = 17 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( f(g(4)) \):  
\[ f(x) = x + 3 \]  
\[ f(g(4)) = f(17) = 17 + 3 = 20 \]  
So, \( f(g(4)) = 20 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(4) \).  
Description: Evaluate the function \( f(x) = x + 3 \) at \( x = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( f(4) \):  
\[ f(x) = x + 3 \]  
\[ f(4) = 4 + 3 = 7 \]  
So, \( f(4) = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(f(4)) \).  
Description: Use the result \( f(4) = 7 \) and evaluate \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) at \( x = 7 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( g(f(4)) \):  
\[ g(x) = 3x + 5 \]  
\[ g(f(4)) = g(7) = 3(7) + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26 \]  
So, \( g(f(4)) = 26 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \).  
Description: Use the results \( f(g(4)) = 20 \) and \( g(f(4)) = 26 \) to perform the subtraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \):  
\[ f(g(4)) = 20, \quad g(f(4)) = 26 \]  
\[ f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 = -6 \]  
So, \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = -6 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \).  
Description: Recalculate each step briefly to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verification:  
- \( g(4) = 3(4) + 5 = 17 \).  
- \( f(g(4)) = f(17) = 17 + 3 = 20 \).  
- \( f(4) = 4 + 3 = 7 \).  
- \( g(f(4)) = g(7) = 3(7) + 5 = 26 \).  
- \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 = -6 \).  
All calculations are consistent with previous results.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(4) \) [Completed: \( g(4) = 17 \)].  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(4)) \) [Completed: \( f(g(4)) = 20 \)].  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(4) \) [Completed: \( f(4) = 7 \)].  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( g(f(4)) \) [Completed: \( g(f(4)) = 26 \)].  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \) [Completed: \( -6 \)].  
  - Subgoal 6: Verify the computation [Completed].  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = -6 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = -6 \]
