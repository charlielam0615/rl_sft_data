### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \), where \( f(x) = x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \):  
1. Compute \( g(4) \).  
2. Use the result to find \( f(g(4)) \).  
3. Compute \( f(4) \).  
4. Use the result to find \( g(f(4)) \).  
5. Subtract \( g(f(4)) \) from \( f(g(4)) \) to get the final answer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(4) \). This involves substituting \( x = 4 \) into \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( g(x) \):  
\( g(4) = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 \).  
So, \( g(4) = 17 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(4)) \). Using the result from Step 2, substitute \( g(4) = 17 \) into \( f(x) = x + 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 17 \) into \( f(x) \):  
\( f(g(4)) = f(17) = 17 + 3 = 20 \).  
So, \( f(g(4)) = 20 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(4) \). This involves substituting \( x = 4 \) into \( f(x) = x + 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( f(x) \):  
\( f(4) = 4 + 3 = 7 \).  
So, \( f(4) = 7 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(4)) \). Using the result from Step 4, substitute \( f(4) = 7 \) into \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 7 \) into \( g(x) \):  
\( g(f(4)) = g(7) = 3(7) + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26 \).  
So, \( g(f(4)) = 26 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \). Using the results from Steps 3 and 5, subtract \( g(f(4)) = 26 \) from \( f(g(4)) = 20 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute the difference:  
\( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 = -6 \).  
So, the result is \(-6\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations by recomputing each step to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute each step:  
- \( g(4) = 3(4) + 5 = 17 \).  
- \( f(g(4)) = f(17) = 17 + 3 = 20 \).  
- \( f(4) = 4 + 3 = 7 \).  
- \( g(f(4)) = g(7) = 3(7) + 5 = 26 \).  
- \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 = -6 \).  
All calculations are consistent with the previous results, confirming the answer is correct.

### Step 8: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(4) \) (completed: \( g(4) = 17 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(4)) \) (completed: \( f(g(4)) = 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(4) \) (completed: \( f(4) = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( g(f(4)) \) (completed: \( g(f(4)) = 26 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \) (completed: \(-6\)).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the calculations (completed: verified correct).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal and all subgoals are completed.  
The final answer is \(-6\).
