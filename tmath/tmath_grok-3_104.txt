**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \(2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)\), where the operation \(\spadesuit\) is defined as \(a \spadesuit b = |a - b|\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \(2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)\), break it into subgoals:  
1. Compute the inner expression \(4 \spadesuit 7\).  
2. Use the result to compute \(2 \spadesuit\) with that value.  
3. Obtain the final numerical result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(4 \spadesuit 7\).  
How to Achieve: Apply the operation \(\spadesuit\), defined as \(a \spadesuit b = |a - b|\), to the numbers 4 and 7.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \(4 \spadesuit 7 = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)\), which is \(2 \spadesuit 3\).  
How to Achieve: Apply the operation \(\spadesuit\) to the numbers 2 and the result from the previous step, 3.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \(2 \spadesuit 3 = |2 - 3| = |-1| = 1\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(4 \spadesuit 7\) (completed: result is 3).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(2 \spadesuit 3\) (completed: result is 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Obtain the final numerical result (current goal).  
The current goal is to confirm the final result, which is 1 based on the previous step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)\) is \(1\).
