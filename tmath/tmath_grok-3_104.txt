**Problem Restatement**: The operation $\spadesuit$ is defined as $a \spadesuit b = |a - b|$. We need to find the value of $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)$, break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the inner operation $4 \spadesuit 7$.  
2. Use the result to compute $2 \spadesuit$ with that value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute $4 \spadesuit 7$.  
How to Achieve: Apply the definition $a \spadesuit b = |a - b|$ to find $|4 - 7|$.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the definition $a \spadesuit b = |a - b|$:  
$4 \spadesuit 7 = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)$.  
How to Achieve: Substitute the result of $4 \spadesuit 7 = 3$ into $2 \spadesuit 3$, then apply the definition $a \spadesuit b = |a - b|$ to find $|2 - 3|$.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, $4 \spadesuit 7 = 3$. Thus, the expression becomes $2 \spadesuit 3$.  
Using the definition $a \spadesuit b = |a - b|$:  
$2 \spadesuit 3 = |2 - 3| = |-1| = 1$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)$.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate each step to ensure correctness and check if the final result aligns with the operationâ€™s definition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recalculate:  
- Inner operation: $4 \spadesuit 7 = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3$.  
- Outer operation: $2 \spadesuit 3 = |2 - 3| = |-1| = 1$.  
The steps are consistent, and the operation $\spadesuit$ was applied correctly. The result is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7)$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute $4 \spadesuit 7$ (completed: result = 3).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute $2 \spadesuit 3$ (completed: result = 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed: result confirmed as 1).  
Current Goal: None (problem solved).  
The final result is $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7) = 1$.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: $2 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 7) = 1$.
