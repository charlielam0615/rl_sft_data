**Problem Restatement**: Calculate the sum of all integers from 80 to 90, inclusive.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the sequence of numbers from 80 to 90, inclusive.
2. Determine the number of terms in the sequence.
3. Use the arithmetic series formula to calculate the sum.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the sequence of numbers and determine the number of terms.
How to Achieve: List the numbers from 80 to 90, inclusive, and count the terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence of numbers is: 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90.
To find the number of terms, use the formula for the count of terms in an inclusive sequence: 
Number of terms = (last term - first term) + 1 = (90 - 80) + 1 = 11.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the sequence using the arithmetic series formula.
How to Achieve: Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Number of terms (n) = 11, first term = 80, last term = 90.
Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term) = (11/2) * (80 + 90) = (11/2) * 170 = 11 * 85 = 935.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculated sum.
How to Achieve: Manually add the numbers from 80 to 90 to confirm the sum matches 935.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Manual calculation: 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 + 89 + 90.
Pair terms: (80 + 90) + (81 + 89) + (82 + 88) + (83 + 87) + (84 + 86) + 85 = 170 + 170 + 170 + 170 + 170 + 85 = 5 * 170 + 85 = 850 + 85 = 935.
The manual sum matches the formula result of 935.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the sum of integers from 80 to 90, inclusive.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the sequence of numbers (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of terms (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the sum (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
The final sum is 935.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all integers from 80 to 90, inclusive, is 935.
