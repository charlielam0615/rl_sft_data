**Problem Restatement**: Calculate the sum of all integers from 80 to 90, inclusive.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the sequence of numbers (80 to 90, inclusive).  
2. Determine the number of terms in the sequence.  
3. Use the arithmetic series sum formula to calculate the sum.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the sequence of numbers and confirm it includes all integers from 80 to 90. This will be achieved by listing the numbers explicitly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sequence of numbers from 80 to 90, inclusive, is: 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of terms in the sequence. This will be achieved by counting the integers from 80 to 90, inclusive, using the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the number of terms, use the formula for the count of integers in an inclusive range:  
Number of terms = (last term - first term) + 1 = (90 - 80) + 1 = 11.  
There are 11 terms in the sequence.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the sequence using the arithmetic series sum formula. This will be achieved by applying the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the arithmetic series sum formula:  
- Number of terms (n) = 11  
- First term = 80  
- Last term = 90  
Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) = 11/2 * (80 + 90) = 11/2 * 170 = 11 * 85 = 935.  
The sum of the integers from 80 to 90, inclusive, is 935.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculated sum. This will be achieved by manually adding the numbers to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Manually add the numbers: 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 + 89 + 90.  
Pairing terms: (80 + 90) + (81 + 89) + (82 + 88) + (83 + 87) + (84 + 86) + 85 = 170 + 170 + 170 + 170 + 170 + 85 = 5 * 170 + 85 = 850 + 85 = 935.  
The manual calculation confirms the sum is 935.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the sum of integers from 80 to 90, inclusive.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the sequence of numbers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the sum (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The sum of all integers from 80 to 90, inclusive, is 935.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all integers from 80 through 90, inclusive, is 935.
