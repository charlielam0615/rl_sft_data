**Problem Restatement**: The odds of pulling a prize out of a box are given as 3:4. We need to find the probability of not pulling the prize and express it as a common fraction.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Interpret the odds 3:4 to determine the probability of pulling the prize.  
2. Calculate the probability of not pulling the prize.  
3. Express the result as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Interpret the odds 3:4 to find the probability of pulling the prize.  
How to Achieve: Odds of 3:4 mean 3 favorable outcomes (pulling the prize) to 4 unfavorable outcomes (not pulling the prize). The total outcomes are 3 + 4 = 7. The probability of pulling the prize is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given odds of 3:4, the probability of pulling the prize is calculated as follows:  
- Favorable outcomes = 3  
- Unfavorable outcomes = 4  
- Total outcomes = 3 + 4 = 7  
- Probability of pulling the prize = 3 / 7  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of not pulling the prize.  
How to Achieve: The probability of not pulling the prize is 1 minus the probability of pulling the prize. Using the result from the previous step, subtract the probability of pulling the prize (3/7) from 1.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The probability of not pulling the prize is:  
- Probability of not pulling = 1 - Probability of pulling  
- = 1 - 3/7  
- = 7/7 - 3/7  
- = 4/7  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated probability of not pulling the prize.  
How to Achieve: Check if the probability aligns with the given odds. The odds 3:4 imply 4 unfavorable outcomes out of 7 total outcomes, so the probability of not pulling the prize should be 4/7. Also, ensure the fraction 4/7 is in its simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Validation:  
- From the odds 3:4, unfavorable outcomes = 4, total outcomes = 7. Thus, probability of not pulling = 4/7, which matches the calculated result.  
- Check if 4/7 is simplified: The greatest common divisor of 4 and 7 is 1, so 4/7 is in its simplest form.  
The calculation is valid.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability of not pulling the prize as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Interpret the odds 3:4 to find the probability of pulling the prize (completed: 3/7).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the probability of not pulling the prize (completed: 4/7).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the result as a common fraction (completed: 4/7 is a common fraction).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, and the answer is 4/7.

**Final Answer**: The probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is \(\frac{4}{7}\).
