**Problem Statement**: The odds for pulling a prize out of the box are given as 3:4. We need to find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Interpret the odds (3:4) to determine the probabilities of pulling and not pulling the prize.
2. Calculate the probability of not pulling the prize.
3. Express the final answer as a common fraction.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Interpret the odds (3:4) to determine the probabilities.
**How to Achieve**: The odds of 3:4 for pulling the prize mean 3 favorable outcomes (pulling the prize) to 4 unfavorable outcomes (not pulling the prize). Convert these odds into a probability by calculating the total outcomes and determining the probability of not pulling the prize.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The odds of 3:4 indicate 3 parts for pulling the prize and 4 parts for not pulling it. The total parts are 3 + 4 = 7. The probability of pulling the prize is 3 out of 7 total outcomes, or 3/7. Therefore, the probability of not pulling the prize is the complement: 1 - 3/7 = 4/7.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated probability of not pulling the prize.
**How to Achieve**: Check that the probabilities sum to 1 and confirm the odds align with the given ratio.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The probability of pulling the prize is 3/7, and the probability of not pulling the prize is 4/7. Their sum is 3/7 + 4/7 = 7/7 = 1, which is correct since probabilities must sum to 1. Additionally, the odds of pulling the prize (3:4) match the ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes (3/7 : 4/7), as 3/7 รท 4/7 = 3/4, confirming the odds ratio.

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, expressed as a common fraction.
  - Subgoal 1: Interpret the odds (3:4) to determine probabilities (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the probability of not pulling the prize (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Express the final answer as a common fraction (pending).

**Current Goal**: Express the final answer as a common fraction.

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Express the probability of not pulling the prize as a common fraction.
**How to Achieve**: Use the calculated probability from Step 2 and ensure it is in the simplest form of a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, the probability of not pulling the prize is 4/7. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 4 and 7 have no common factors other than 1. Thus, the probability of not pulling the prize is 4/7.

**Final Answer**: The probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is **4/7**.
