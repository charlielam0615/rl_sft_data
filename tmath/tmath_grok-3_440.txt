**Problem Restatement**: Anton has two ant species, A and B, in an ant farm. Each day, Species A doubles in number, and Species B triples. On Day 0, there are 30 ants total. On Day 5, there are 3281 ants total. We need to determine how many ants on Day 5 are of Species A.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the initial number of ants of each species.  
2. Model the growth of each species over time based on their daily multiplication rates.  
3. Use the given total ant counts on Day 0 and Day 5 to set up equations.  
4. Solve the equations to find the initial number of Species A ants.  
5. Calculate the number of Species A ants on Day 5.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations for the ant populations. Define the initial number of Species A ants on Day 0 as \( x \) and Species B ants as \( y \). Use the given conditions (Day 0 total: 30 ants; Day 5 total: 3281 ants) and the growth rates (Species A doubles daily, Species B triples daily) to create equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( x \) be the number of Species A ants on Day 0, and \( y \) be the number of Species B ants on Day 0.  
- On Day 0: \( x + y = 30 \).  
- Species A doubles daily, so on Day \( n \), the number of Species A ants is \( x \cdot 2^n \).  
- Species B triples daily, so on Day \( n \), the number of Species B ants is \( y \cdot 3^n \).  
- On Day 5, the total number of ants is: \( x \cdot 2^5 + y \cdot 3^5 = 3281 \).  
Since \( 2^5 = 32 \) and \( 3^5 = 243 \), the equation for Day 5 is:  
\[ 32x + 243y = 3281 \].  
Thus, we have the system of equations:  
1. \( x + y = 30 \)  
2. \( 32x + 243y = 3281 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the initial number of Species A ants (\( x \)). Use substitution or elimination to solve the equations \( x + y = 30 \) and \( 32x + 243y = 3281 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
1. \( x + y = 30 \)  
2. \( 32x + 243y = 3281 \)  

From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):  
\[ y = 30 - x \]  

Substitute into the second equation:  
\[ 32x + 243(30 - x) = 3281 \]  
\[ 32x + 243 \cdot 30 - 243x = 3281 \]  
\[ 32x + 7290 - 243x = 3281 \]  
\[ -211x + 7290 = 3281 \]  
\[ -211x = 3281 - 7290 \]  
\[ -211x = -4009 \]  
\[ x = \frac{4009}{211} \]  

Check if \( x \) is an integer by computing \( 4009 \div 211 \):  
\[ 211 \cdot 19 = 4009 \] (since \( 211 \cdot 19 = 211 \cdot (20 - 1) = 4220 - 211 = 4009 \)).  
Thus, \( x = 19 \).  

Now, find \( y \):  
\[ y = 30 - x = 30 - 19 = 11 \]  

Verify in the second equation:  
\[ 32 \cdot 19 + 243 \cdot 11 = 608 + 2673 = 3281 \]  
The solution satisfies both equations, so \( x = 19 \) (Species A ants on Day 0) and \( y = 11 \) (Species B ants on Day 0).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking the calculations and ensuring the values make sense in the context of the problem. Verify the equations and the physical constraints (e.g., integer number of ants).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute key steps:  
- Day 0: \( x + y = 19 + 11 = 30 \), which matches.  
- Day 5: Species A ants = \( 19 \cdot 2^5 = 19 \cdot 32 = 608 \).  
  Species B ants = \( 11 \cdot 3^5 = 11 \cdot 243 = 2673 \) (since \( 243 \cdot 11 = 243 \cdot (10 + 1) = 2430 + 243 = 2673 \)).  
  Total on Day 5: \( 608 + 2673 = 3281 \), which matches.  
- Check constraints: \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 11 \) are positive integers, as required for counting ants.  

The calculations are consistent, and the solution is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of Species A ants on Day 5 using the initial value \( x = 19 \). Apply the growth formula for Species A.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Species A ants on Day 5:  
\[ 19 \cdot 2^5 = 19 \cdot 32 = 608 \]  
Thus, there are 608 Species A ants on Day 5.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of Species A ants on Day 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for initial ant counts (\( x \) for Species A, \( y \) for Species B).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations using Day 0 and Day 5 totals.  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve equations to find \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution.  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate Species A ants on Day 5.  

**Current Goal**: Completed calculating Species A ants on Day 5 (608 ants). All subgoals are achieved, and the main goal is resolved.

**Final Answer**: On Day 5, there are 608 ants of Species A in the ant farm.
