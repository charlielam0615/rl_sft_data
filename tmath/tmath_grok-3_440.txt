### Problem Restatement
Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The population of Species A doubles every day, and the population of Species B triples every day. On Day 0, the total number of ants is 30. On Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281. We need to determine how many ants on Day 5 are of Species A.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the number of Species A ants on Day 5.  
- Subgoal 1: Define variables for the initial number of ants of Species A and Species B on Day 0.  
- Subgoal 2: Model the growth of both species over 5 days based on their growth rates.  
- Subgoal 3: Use the given total ant counts on Day 0 and Day 5 to set up equations.  
- Subgoal 4: Solve the equations to find the initial number of Species A ants.  
- Subgoal 5: Calculate the number of Species A ants on Day 5.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define variables and model the growth of Species A and Species B.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( A \) be the number of Species A ants on Day 0, and \( B \) be the number of Species B ants on Day 0. Since Species A doubles daily, on Day \( n \), the number of Species A ants is \( A \cdot 2^n \). Since Species B triples daily, the number of Species B ants on Day \( n \) is \( B \cdot 3^n \). Use the given total on Day 0 to set up the first equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let:  
- \( A \): Number of Species A ants on Day 0.  
- \( B \): Number of Species B ants on Day 0.  

Given on Day 0:  
\[ A + B = 30 \]  

The population of Species A on Day \( n \) is \( A \cdot 2^n \), and Species B is \( B \cdot 3^n \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up an equation for the total number of ants on Day 5.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the growth models to express the number of ants on Day 5 for both species and sum them to equal the given total of 3281 ants.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
On Day 5:  
- Species A: \( A \cdot 2^5 = A \cdot 32 \)  
- Species B: \( B \cdot 3^5 = B \cdot 243 \)  

Given the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281:  
\[ 32A + 243B = 3281 \]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of Species A ants on Day 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for initial counts (Completed: \( A \) for Species A, \( B \) for Species B).  
  - Subgoal 2: Model growth rates (Completed: Species A: \( A \cdot 2^n \), Species B: \( B \cdot 3^n \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up equations (Completed: \( A + B = 30 \), \( 32A + 243B = 3281 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve equations for \( A \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate Species A ants on Day 5.  

**Current Goal**: Solve the equations to find \( A \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( A \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equations \( A + B = 30 \) and \( 32A + 243B = 3281 \). Solve for \( B \) in terms of \( A \) from the first equation, substitute into the second, and solve for \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( A + B = 30 \):  
\[ B = 30 - A \]  

Substitute into the second equation:  
\[ 32A + 243(30 - A) = 3281 \]  

Expand and simplify:  
\[ 32A + 243 \cdot 30 - 243A = 3281 \]  
\[ 32A + 7290 - 243A = 3281 \]  
\[ -211A + 7290 = 3281 \]  
\[ -211A = 3281 - 7290 \]  
\[ -211A = -4009 \]  
\[ A = \frac{4009}{211} \]  

Calculate \( A \):  
\[ 4009 \div 211 \approx 19 \] (since \( 211 \cdot 19 = 4009 \), as \( 211 \cdot 19 = 211 \cdot (20 - 1) = 4220 - 211 = 4009 \)).  
Thus, \( A = 19 \).  

Verify \( B \):  
\[ B = 30 - A = 30 - 19 = 11 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution for \( A \) and \( B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( A = 19 \) and \( B = 11 \) into both equations to check if they hold.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check Day 0:  
\[ A + B = 19 + 11 = 30 \] (Satisfies the condition).  

Check Day 5:  
- Species A: \( 19 \cdot 2^5 = 19 \cdot 32 = 608 \)  
- Species B: \( 11 \cdot 3^5 = 11 \cdot 243 = 2673 \) (since \( 243 \cdot 11 = 243 \cdot (10 + 1) = 2430 + 243 = 2673 \))  
- Total: \( 608 + 2673 = 3281 \) (Satisfies the condition).  

The values \( A = 19 \) and \( B = 11 \) satisfy both equations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of Species A ants on Day 5.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the value of \( A = 19 \) and the growth model for Species A to compute the number of ants on Day 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Number of Species A ants on Day 5:  
\[ 19 \cdot 2^5 = 19 \cdot 32 = 608 \]  
[/IMP]
