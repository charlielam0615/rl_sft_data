**Problem Restatement**: Given the complex numbers \( A = 4 - 3i \), \( M = -4 + i \), \( S = i \), and the real number \( P = 2 \), compute the expression \( A - M + S - P \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( A - M + S - P \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( A - M \).  
2. Add \( S \) to the result of \( A - M \).  
3. Subtract \( P \) from the result of \( (A - M) + S \).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( A - M \), where \( A = 4 - 3i \) and \( M = -4 + i \). This will be achieved by subtracting the real and imaginary parts of \( M \) from those of \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( A - M \):  
\( A = 4 - 3i \), \( M = -4 + i \).  
\( A - M = (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i) = 4 - 3i + 4 - i = (4 + 4) + (-3i - i) = 8 - 4i \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( (A - M) + S \), where \( A - M = 8 - 4i \) and \( S = i \). This will be achieved by adding the imaginary part of \( S \) to the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( (A - M) + S \):  
\( A - M = 8 - 4i \), \( S = i \).  
\( (A - M) + S = (8 - 4i) + i = 8 + (-4i + i) = 8 - 3i \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( (A - M + S) - P \), where \( A - M + S = 8 - 3i \) and \( P = 2 \). This will be achieved by subtracting the real number \( P \) from the real part of the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \( (A - M + S) - P \):  
\( A - M + S = 8 - 3i \), \( P = 2 \).  
\( (A - M + S) - P = (8 - 3i) - 2 = (8 - 2) - 3i = 6 - 3i \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( A - M + S - P = 6 - 3i \). This will be achieved by recomputing the expression directly to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, compute \( A - M + S - P \) directly:  
\( A = 4 - 3i \), \( M = -4 + i \), \( S = i \), \( P = 2 \).  
\( A - M = (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i) = 4 + 4 - 3i - i = 8 - 4i \).  
\( (A - M) + S = (8 - 4i) + i = 8 - 4i + i = 8 - 3i \).  
\( (A - M + S) - P = (8 - 3i) - 2 = 8 - 2 - 3i = 6 - 3i \).  
The result matches \( 6 - 3i \), confirming the computation is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( A - M + S - P \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( A - M \) (completed: \( 8 - 4i \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( (A - M) + S \) (completed: \( 8 - 3i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( (A - M + S) - P \) (completed: \( 6 - 3i \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the final result (completed: confirmed \( 6 - 3i \)).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( 6 - 3i \)
