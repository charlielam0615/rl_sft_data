### Problem Statement
We need to compute the expression \( A - M + S - P \), where \( A = 4 - 3i \), \( M = -4 + i \), \( S = i \), and \( P = 2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \( A - M + S - P \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute \( A - M \).
2. Add \( S \) to the result of \( A - M \).
3. Subtract \( P \) from the result of the previous step.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute \( A - M \), where \( A = 4 - 3i \) and \( M = -4 + i \). This will be achieved by subtracting the real and imaginary parts of \( M \) from those of \( A \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \( A - M \):
\[
A - M = (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i)
\]
Distribute the subtraction:
\[
= 4 - 3i + 4 - i
\]
Combine real and imaginary parts:
\[
= (4 + 4) + (-3i - i) = 8 - 4i
\]
So, \( A - M = 8 - 4i \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to add \( S \) to the result of \( A - M \), where \( S = i \) and \( A - M = 8 - 4i \). This will be achieved by adding the real and imaginary parts of \( S \) to those of \( A - M \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \( (A - M) + S \):
\[
(8 - 4i) + i
\]
Combine imaginary parts (real part of \( S = i \) is 0):
\[
= 8 + (-4i + i) = 8 - 3i
\]
So, \( (A - M) + S = 8 - 3i \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to subtract \( P \) from the result of \( (A - M) + S \), where \( P = 2 \) and \( (A - M) + S = 8 - 3i \). This will be achieved by subtracting \( P \) from the real part of \( (A - M) + S \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \( (A - M) + S - P \):
\[
(8 - 3i) - 2
\]
Subtract \( P = 2 \) from the real part (imaginary part of \( P \) is 0):
\[
= (8 - 2) - 3i = 6 - 3i
\]
So, \( (A - M) + S - P = 6 - 3i \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the result \( 6 - 3i \) by recomputing the expression \( A - M + S - P \) in a single step to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( A - M + S - P \):
\[
A - M + S - P = (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i) + i - 2
\]
Simplify step-by-step:
\[
= (4 - 3i + 4 - i) + i - 2 = (8 - 4i) + i - 2 = 8 - 3i - 2 = 6 - 3i
\]
The result matches \( 6 - 3i \), confirming the computation is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-management system:
- Main goal: Compute \( A - M + S - P \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( A - M \). (Completed: \( 8 - 4i \))
  - Subgoal 2: Add \( S \) to \( A - M \). (Completed: \( 8 - 3i \))
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract \( P \) from \( (A - M) + S \). (Completed: \( 6 - 3i \))
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the final result. (Completed: \( 6 - 3i \))
Current goal: None (all subgoals completed, final result validated).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( A - M + S - P \) is \( 6 - 3i \).
