Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Solve the quadratic equation $ 2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6 $.  
2. Simplify the equation to $ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 $.  
3. Factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for $ x $.  
4. Verify the solutions by plugging them into the original equations.  
5. List the intersection points in order of increasing $ x $-coordinate.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We will solve $ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 $ using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = -6 $, and $ c = -16 $.  

Substitute these values into the formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 64}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2}
$$  

Now compute the two possible solutions:  
1. $ x = \frac{6 + 10}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 $  
2. $ x = \frac{6 - 10}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 $  

So, the $ x $-coordinates of the intersection points are $ x = -2 $ and $ x = 8 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check if the solutions x = -2 and x = 8 satisfy both original equations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. For x = -2:  
   - First equation: $ y = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10 = 8 + 20 - 10 = 18 $  
   - Second equation: $ y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 $  
   Both equations yield $ y = 18 $.  

2. For x = 8:  
   - First equation: $ y = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10 = 128 - 80 - 10 = 38 $  
   - Second equation: $ y = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6 = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38 $  
   Both equations yield $ y = 38 $.  

All solutions satisfy both original equations.
