Goal of this step: Define the two-digit number $ N $ in terms of its tens and units digits.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the tens digit of $ N $ be $ a $ and the units digit be $ b $, where $ a, b $ are integers such that $ 1 \leq a \leq 9 $ and $ 0 \leq b \leq 9 $.  

Then, the number $ N $ can be expressed as:  
$$ N = 10a + b $$  
The product of its digits is:  
$$ P(N) = a \cdot b $$  
The sum of its digits is:  
$$ S(N) = a + b $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up the equation $ N = P(N) + S(N) $ using the definitions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we have:  
$$ N = 10a + b $$  
$$ P(N) = a \cdot b $$  
$$ S(N) = a + b $$  

The equation $ N = P(N) + S(N) $ becomes:  
$$ 10a + b = ab + a + b $$  

Simplify the right-hand side:  
$$ 10a + b = ab + a + b $$  
Subtract $ b $ from both sides:  
$$ 10a = ab + a $$  
Subtract $ a $ from both sides:  
$$ 9a = ab $$  
Divide both sides by $ a $ (since $ a \neq 0 $):  
$$ 9 = b $$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation to find the value of $ N $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we found that $ b = 9 $.  

Since $ N = 10a + b $, and $ b = 9 $, we can substitute $ b $ into the equation:  
$$ N = 10a + 9 $$  

Now substitute $ b = 9 $ into the original equation $ N = P(N) + S(N) $:  
$$ 10a + 9 = a \cdot 9 + a + 9 $$  

Simplify the right-hand side:  
$$ 10a + 9 = 9a + a + 9 $$  
$$ 10a + 9 = 10a + 9 $$  

This confirms that the equation is valid for any $ a $, but we must remember $ a $ is a digit from 1 to 9. Therefore, $ a $ can be any value in this range, but $ b $ is fixed at 9. To find the specific value of $ N $, we need to test values of $ a $ to find the one satisfying the original condition $ N = P(N) + S(N) $.  

Let’s test $ a = 1 $:  
$$ N = 10 \cdot 1 + 9 = 19 $$  
$$ P(N) = 1 \cdot 9 = 9 $$  
$$ S(N) = 1 + 9 = 10 $$  
$$ P(N) + S(N) = 9 + 10 = 19 = N $$  

This satisfies the condition. To ensure correctness, let's verify further.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the validity of the derived solution for all possible two-digit numbers satisfying the condition.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
Let's systematically test the derived condition $ b = 9 $ across all valid two-digit numbers (where $ a \in [1,9] $):

1. **General Solution Validity**  
   The algebraic derivation $ 9a = ab \Rightarrow b = 9 $ holds for all $ a \in [1,9] $ because $ a \neq 0 $ (as $ N $ is a two-digit number). This means **all** numbers of the form $ 10a + 9 $ (i.e., 19, 29, 39, ..., 99) satisfy $ N = P(N) + S(N) $. For example:  
   - $ N = 19 $: $ 1 \cdot 9 + 1 + 9 = 9 + 10 = 19 $ ✅  
   - $ N = 29 $: $ 2 \cdot 9 + 2 + 9 = 18 + 11 = 29 $ ✅  
   - $ N = 99 $: $ 9 \cdot 9 + 9 + 9 = 81 + 18 = 99 $ ✅  

2. **Uniqueness of the Units Digit**  
   The problem asks for the units digit of $ N $, not the specific value of $ N $. All valid solutions share the same units digit $ b = 9 $, as derived algebraically. This consistency confirms the correctness of the solution.  

3. **Edge Case Validation**  
   Testing $ a = 1 $ (smallest possible tens digit): $ N = 19 $ satisfies the condition.  
   Testing $ a = 9 $ (largest possible tens digit): $ N = 99 $ also satisfies the condition.  
   Intermediate values (e.g., $ a = 5 $, $ N = 59 $) similarly satisfy the condition.  

**Conclusion**: The algebraic derivation is correct, and the units digit $ b = 9 $ is consistent across all valid two-digit numbers satisfying the condition. No errors were identified in the reasoning.
