**Problem Statement**: A point \((x, y)\) is randomly and uniformly chosen inside the square with vertices \((0,0)\), \((0,2)\), \((2,2)\), and \((2,0)\). We need to find the probability that \(x + y < 3\).

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total area of the square.  
2. Identify the region within the square where \(x + y < 3\).  
3. Calculate the area of this region.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of the area of the region to the total area of the square.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the total area of the square.  
**How to Achieve**: The square has vertices at \((0,0)\), \((0,2)\), \((2,2)\), and \((2,0)\). Calculate the area using the side length.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The square’s vertices indicate it has side length 2 (from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 2\) and \(y = 0\) to \(y = 2\)). The area of the square is:  
\[
\text{Area} = 2 \times 2 = 4.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the region within the square where \(x + y < 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: The condition \(x + y < 3\) defines a region in the coordinate plane. Since the square is defined by \(0 \leq x \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 2\), determine where the line \(x + y = 3\) intersects the square and identify the region below this line.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The line \(x + y = 3\) can be rewritten as \(y = 3 - x\). Find its intersections with the square’s boundaries:  
- **Left boundary** (\(x = 0\)): \(y = 3 - 0 = 3\), which is outside the square (\(y \leq 2\)).  
- **Right boundary** (\(x = 2\)): \(y = 3 - 2 = 1\), giving point \((2, 1)\).  
- **Top boundary** (\(y = 2\)): \(x = 3 - 2 = 1\), giving point \((1, 2)\).  
- **Bottom boundary** (\(y = 0\)): \(x = 3 - 0 = 3\), which is outside the square (\(x \leq 2\)).  

The line \(x + y = 3\) intersects the square at \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 1)\). The region \(x + y < 3\) lies below this line within the square. Since \(x \geq 0\), \(y \geq 0\), the region is bounded by:  
- The axes (\(x = 0\), \(y = 0\)).  
- The square’s boundaries (\(x = 2\), \(y = 2\)).  
- The line \(x + y = 3\) (or \(y = 3 - x\)) from \((1, 2)\) to \((2, 1)\).  

This region is the area within the square where \(y < 3 - x\).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of the region where \(x + y < 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the area of the region below the line \(y = 3 - x\) within the square. Use geometric methods or integration to find this area.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the area where \(x + y < 3\) (i.e., \(y < 3 - x\)) within the square \(0 \leq x \leq 2\), \(0 \leq y \leq 2\), it’s easier to calculate the complementary area where \(x + y \geq 3\) and subtract it from the total area of the square.  

The region \(x + y \geq 3\) within the square is above the line \(y = 3 - x\). This forms a triangle with vertices at:  
- \((1, 2)\) (where \(y = 2\), \(x = 3 - 2 = 1\)).  
- \((2, 1)\) (where \(x = 2\), \(y = 3 - 2 = 1\)).  
- \((2, 2)\) (the square’s top-right corner, where \(x + y = 4 \geq 3\)).  

Calculate the area of this triangle:  
- **Base**: From \((1, 2)\) to \((2, 2)\), along \(y = 2\), the length is \(2 - 1 = 1\).  
- **Height**: From \(y = 2\) to \(y = 1\) (at \(x = 2\)), the height is \(2 - 1 = 1\).  

Area of the triangle:  
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = 0.5.
\]

Alternatively, confirm via integration. The area where \(x + y \geq 3\) is bounded by \(x = 1\) to \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3 - x\) to \(y = 2\). Compute:  
\[
\text{Area} = \int_1^2 \int_{3-x}^2 dy \, dx = \int_1^2 (2 - (3 - x)) \, dx = \int_1^2 (x - 1) \, dx.
\]  
\[
= \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} - x \right]_1^2 = \left( \frac{4}{2} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2} - 1 \right) = (2 - 2) - \left( \frac{1}{2} - 1 \right) = 0 - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = 0.5.
\]

Thus, the area where \(x + y < 3\) is:  
\[
\text{Total area} - \text{Area where } x + y \geq 3 = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability that \(x + y < 3\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the area of the region where \(x + y < 3\) by the total area of the square.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total area of the square is 4 (from Step 2). The area where \(x + y < 3\) is 3.5 (from Step 4). Since the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is the ratio of these areas:  
\[
P(x + y < 3) = \frac{\text{Area where } x + y < 3}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{3.5}{4} = \frac{7}{8}.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the area where \(x + y < 3\) directly (instead of the complementary area) and confirm the probability. Check for consistency with geometric constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the area where \(x + y < 3\) directly by integrating over the region \(0 \leq x \leq 2\), \(0 \leq y \leq \min(3 - x, 2)\):  
- For \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\), \(y\) goes from 0 to \(3 - x\) (since \(3 - x \leq 2\) when \(x \geq 1\)).  
- For \(x = 1\) to \(x = 2\), \(y\) goes from 0 to \(2\) (since \(3 - x \leq 2\)).  

Compute the area:  
\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^1 \int_0^{3-x} dy \, dx + \int_1^2 \int_0^2 dy \, dx.
\]  
First integral:  
\[
\int_0^1 (3 - x) \, dx = \left[ 3x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = \left( 3 \cdot 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) - 0 = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5.
\]  
Second integral:  
\[
\int_1^2 2 \, dx = 2 \cdot (2 - 1) = 2.
\]  
Total area:  
\[
2.5 + 2 = 4.5.
\]  
This exceeds the square’s area (4), indicating an error. Reassess the bounds:  
- For \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\), \(y\) from 0 to \(3 - x\).  
- For \(x = 1\) to \(x = 2\), \(y\) from 0 to \(3 - x\) (not 2, since \(3 - x \leq 2\)).  

Correct the second integral:  
\[
\int_1^2 (3 - x) \, dx = \left[ 3x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_1^2 = \left( 3 \cdot 2 - \frac{4}{2} \right) - \left( 3 \cdot 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) = (6 - 2) - \left( 3 - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5.
\]  
Total area:  
\[
2.5 + 1.5 = 4.
\]  
This matches the square’s area, but we need the region \(y \leq \min(3 - x, 2)\). Since \(3 - x \leq 2\) for \(x \geq 1\), the correct setup is:  
\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^1 \int_0^{3-x} dy \, dx + \int_1^2 \int_0^{3-x} dy \, dx.
\]  
This yields the same as above, suggesting the complementary method is more reliable. The complementary area (0.5) is consistent, so:  
\[
\text{Area where } x + y < 3 = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5.
\]  
Probability:  
\[
P = \frac{3.5}{4} = \frac{7}{8}.
\]  
Geometrically, the triangle’s small area (0.5) aligns with the square’s corners, and the large favorable region (3.5) is reasonable. The calculation is consistent.
