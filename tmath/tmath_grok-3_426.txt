**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( f(g(-2)) \), where \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \) and \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve \( f(g(-2)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(-2) \).  
2. Use the result of \( g(-2) \) as the input for \( f(x) \).  
3. Compute \( f \) at the resulting value to find \( f(g(-2)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(-2) \), where \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = -2 \) into the function \( g(x) \) and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \):  
\( g(-2) = (-2 - 1)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(-2)) \), which is \( f(9) \), using \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) \) and performing the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \):  
\( f(9) = 3 \cdot 9 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(-2)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(-2) \) (completed: \( g(-2) = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(9) \) (completed: \( f(9) = 29 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the final result of \( f(g(-2)) \).  
The calculations show \( g(-2) = 9 \) and \( f(9) = 29 \), so \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \). This will be achieved by rechecking the calculations for \( g(-2) \) and \( f(9) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck \( g(-2) \):  
\( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \), so \( g(-2) = (-2 - 1)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9 \). Correct.  
Recheck \( f(9) \):  
\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \), so \( f(9) = 3 \cdot 9 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29 \). Correct.  
The result \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \) is validated.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \)
