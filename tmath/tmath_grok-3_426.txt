### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( f(g(-2)) \), where \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \) and \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \). This requires evaluating \( g(x) \) at \( x = -2 \), then using that result as the input for \( f(x) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \( f(g(-2)) \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Evaluate \( g(-2) \) by substituting \( x = -2 \) into \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \).
2. Use the result from \( g(-2) \) as the input for \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \).
3. Compute the final value of \( f(g(-2)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Evaluate \( g(-2) \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \), compute the expression, and obtain the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( g(x) = (x - 1)^2 \):
\[
g(-2) = (-2 - 1)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9
\]
So, \( g(-2) = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Evaluate \( f(g(-2)) \), which is \( f(9) \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \), compute the expression, and obtain the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \):
\[
f(9) = 3 \cdot 9 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29
\]
So, \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the solution.
How to Achieve: Recompute \( g(-2) \) and \( f(g(-2)) \) to ensure no errors in calculations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \( g(-2) \):
\[
g(-2) = (-2 - 1)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9
\]
Recompute \( f(9) \):
\[
f(9) = 3 \cdot 9 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29
\]
The calculations are consistent, confirming \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(g(-2)) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Evaluate \( g(-2) \). (Completed: \( g(-2) = 9 \))
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate \( f(g(-2)) \) using the result from Subgoal 1. (Completed: \( f(9) = 29 \))
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution. (Completed: Calculations verified)

Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.
The final answer is \( f(g(-2)) = 29 \).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\( f(g(-2)) = 29 \)
