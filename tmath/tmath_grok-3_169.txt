**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = 0.75 \), where \( x \neq 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation:  
1. Simplify the expression \( \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} \).  
2. Combine the result with \( \frac{1}{x} \).  
3. Set the resulting expression equal to 0.75 and solve for \( x \).  
4. Validate the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \( \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} \). This can be achieved by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and performing the necessary algebraic operations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the division:  
\[ \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = \frac{2}{x} \cdot \frac{x}{4} = \frac{2 \cdot x}{x \cdot 4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}. \]  
The original equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the simplified equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75 \) for \( x \). This can be achieved by isolating \( \frac{1}{x} \) and solving the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75. \]  
Subtract \( \frac seksualifikasi \frac{1}{2} \) from both sides:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} = 0.75 - \frac{1}{2} = 0.25. \]  
Thus:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} = 0.25. \]  
Multiply through by \( x \):  
\[ 1 = 0.25x. \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 4 \) by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = 0.75 \):  
- Compute \( \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).  
- Compute \( \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = \frac{2}{4} \div \frac{4}{4} = \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \).  
- Combine: \( 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75 \).  
The equation holds true:  
\[ 0.75 = 0.75. \]  
The solution \( x = 4 \) is valid.
