**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = 0.75\), where \( x \neq 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression \(\frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x}\) by handling the division of fractions.  
2. Combine the resulting terms with \(\frac{1}{x}\).  
3. Set the simplified equation equal to 0.75 and solve for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x}\). This can be achieved by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and simplifying the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the division:  
\[
\frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = \frac{2}{x} \times \frac{x}{4} = \frac{2 \cdot x}{x \cdot 4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]  
The equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the simplified equation \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75\) for \( x \). This can be achieved by isolating \(\frac{1}{x}\) and solving the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Subtract \(\frac{1}{2}\) from both sides:  
\[
\frac{1}{x} = 0.75 - \frac{1}{2} = 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\frac{1}{x} = 0.25 \implies x = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 4 \) satisfies the original equation \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = 0.75\). This can be achieved by substituting \( x = 4 \) into the original equation and checking if the left-hand side equals 0.75.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \):  
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} \div \frac{4}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} \div 1 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75.
\]  
The left-hand side equals 0.75, confirming the solution is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x} = 0.75\) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(\frac{2}{x} \div \frac{4}{x}\) (completed: simplified to \(\frac{1}{2}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine terms and solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.75\) (completed: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation).  
**Current Goal**: Verification is complete; the solution \( x = 4 \) is confirmed.
