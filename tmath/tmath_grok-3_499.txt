### Problem Statement
Simplify the expression \((2x^3)^3\).

I will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and organizing the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To simplify \((2x^3)^3\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Apply the power rule for exponents to handle the cube of the expression.  
2. Simplify the coefficient (2).  
3. Simplify the variable part (x^3).  
4. Combine the results into a single expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the power rule to \((2x^3)^3\). This involves using the rule \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) and \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\) to distribute the exponent 3 to both the coefficient 2 and the variable \(x^3\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the power rule \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\), rewrite \((2x^3)^3\) as:  
\[ 2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3 \]  
Next, apply the rule \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\) to the variable part:  
\[ (x^3)^3 = x^{3 \cdot 3} = x^9 \]  
So, the expression becomes:  
\[ 2^3 \cdot x^9 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the coefficient \(2^3\). This involves calculating the value of \(2^3\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \(2^3\):  
\[ 2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \]  
So, the expression \(2^3 \cdot x^9\) becomes:  
\[ 8 \cdot x^9 = 8x^9 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the simplified expression \(8x^9\). Check the steps to ensure correctness by reapplying the power rule and verifying calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
- Original: \((2x^3)^3\).  
- Apply \((2x^3)^3 = 2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3\).  
- Coefficient: \(2^3 = 8\).  
- Variable: \((x^3)^3 = x^{3 \cdot 3} = x^9\).  
- Result: \(8x^9\).  
The steps align, and no errors are found. The expression is in its simplest form, as \(8x^9\) has no further factors to combine.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \((2x^3)^3\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the power rule (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the coefficient (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the variable part (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Combine results (completed).  
- Current goal: Confirm the final simplified expression.  
The final expression is \(8x^9\), and all subgoals have been addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The simplified expression is \(8x^9\).
