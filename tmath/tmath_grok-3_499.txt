**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((2x^3)^3\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem of simplifying \((2x^3)^3\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the structure of the expression.  
2. Apply the power rule for exponents to simplify the expression.  
3. Combine the results to present the simplified form.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the structure of the expression \((2x^3)^3\). This involves recognizing it as a power of a product, where the base is \(2x^3\) and the exponent is 3. The plan is to apply the exponent rule \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) to separate the coefficient and the variable, then simplify each part.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The expression \((2x^3)^3\) is a power of a product, where the base consists of the coefficient 2 and the variable term \(x^3\), raised to the third power. Using the exponent rule \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\), we can rewrite \((2x^3)^3\) as \(2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the power rule for exponents to simplify \(2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3\). This involves computing the exponent for the coefficient and applying the rule \((x^m)^n = x^{m \cdot n}\) for the variable term.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \(2^3 = 8\). For the variable term, apply the power rule: \((x^3)^3 = x^{3 \cdot 3} = x^9\). Thus, \(2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3 = 8 \cdot x^9\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the simplified expression \(8x^9\). This involves verifying the application of the exponent rules and ensuring the result is in its simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, consider the original expression \((2x^3)^3\). Expand it directly: \((2x^3)^3 = (2x^3) \cdot (2x^3) \cdot (2x^3) = 2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3 = 8 \cdot x^{3+3+3} = 8x^9\). Alternatively, apply the rule \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\): \((2x^3)^3 = 2^3 \cdot (x^3)^3 = 8 \cdot x^9\). Both methods yield \(8x^9\), confirming the result is correct. The expression is in its simplest form, as 8 is a constant and \(x^9\) has no further simplification without additional context.
