**Problem Restatement**: Given the operation \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \), we need to find the value of \( A \) such that \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( A \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( B = 4 \) into the given operation to form an equation.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( A \).  
3. Verify the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Form and solve the equation for \( A \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( B = 4 \) into \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \), set the result equal to 58, and solve for \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \), substitute \( B = 4 \) into the operation:  
\[ 3A + 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 58 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 3A + 8 + 5 = 58 \]  
\[ 3A + 13 = 58 \]  
Subtract 13 from both sides:  
\[ 3A = 45 \]  
Divide by 3:  
\[ A = 15 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( A = 15 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( A = 15 \) and \( B = 4 \) back into the operation and check if the result equals 58.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( A = 15 \), \( B = 4 \):  
\[ A \clubsuit 4 = 3 \cdot 15 + 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 45 + 8 + 5 = 58 \]  
The result matches the given value of 58, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( A \) such that \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Form the equation by substituting \( B = 4 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation for \( A \) (completed, \( A = 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution verified).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
Final Answer: \( A = 15 \).
