**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \( A \) such that \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \), where the operation \( \clubsuit \) is defined as \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( A \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( B = 4 \) into the definition of \( A \clubsuit B \).  
2. Set the expression equal to 58.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( A \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( A \clubsuit 4 \) using the given definition and set it equal to 58. This will be achieved by substituting \( B = 4 \) into \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \), forming the equation, and solving for \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( B = 4 \) into the definition:  
\[ A \clubsuit 4 = 3A + 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 3A + 8 + 5 = 3A + 13 \]  
Set this equal to 58:  
\[ 3A + 13 = 58 \]  
Solve for \( A \):  
\[ 3A = 58 - 13 = 45 \]  
\[ A = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( A = 15 \) by substituting it back into the expression \( A \clubsuit 4 \) and checking if the result equals 58.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( A = 15 \), \( B = 4 \) into \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \):  
\[ 15 \clubsuit 4 = 3 \cdot 15 + 2 \cdot 4 + 5 = 45 + 8 + 5 = 58 \]  
The result matches the given value, so \( A = 15 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( A \) such that \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( B = 4 \) into \( A \clubsuit B = 3A + 2B + 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set the expression equal to 58 and solve for \( A \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by substituting \( A \) back into the expression.  

**Current Goal**: Completed â€” the solution \( A = 15 \) has been found and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The value of \( A \) for which \( A \clubsuit 4 = 58 \) is \( A = 15 \).
