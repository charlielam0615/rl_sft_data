**Problem Restatement**: Calculate the perimeter of a triangle with vertices at points \( A(1,2) \), \( B(1,8) \), and \( C(5,5) \) on a Cartesian coordinate plane. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the perimeter into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the length of side \( AB \) using the distance formula.  
2. Calculate the length of side \( BC \) using the distance formula.  
3. Calculate the length of side \( CA \) using the distance formula.  
4. Sum the lengths of \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) to find the perimeter.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the length of side \( AB \). This will be achieved by applying the distance formula between points \( A(1,2) \) and \( B(1,8) \):  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For points \( A(1,2) \) and \( B(1,8) \):  
\[ AB = \sqrt{(1 - 1)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 6^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6 \]  
The length of side \( AB \) is 6 units.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the length of side \( BC \). This will be achieved by applying the distance formula between points \( B(1,8) \) and \( C(5,5) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For points \( B(1,8) \) and \( C(5,5) \):  
\[ BC = \sqrt{(5 - 1)^2 + (5 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
The length of side \( BC \) is 5 units.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the length of side \( CA \). This will be achieved by applying the distance formula between points \( C(5,5) \) and \( A(1,2) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For points \( C(5,5) \) and \( A(1,2) \):  
\[ CA = \sqrt{(1 - 5)^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
The length of side \( CA \) is 5 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the perimeter of triangle \( ABC \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate length of \( AB \) (completed: 6 units).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate length of \( BC \) (completed: 5 units).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate length of \( CA \) (completed: 5 units).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the lengths to find the perimeter (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Sum the lengths of \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) to compute the perimeter.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the perimeter by summing the lengths of sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \). This will be achieved by adding the previously computed distances: 6 + 5 + 5.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Perimeter = \( AB + BC + CA = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16 \)  
The perimeter of the triangle is 16 units.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the perimeter calculation. This will be achieved by checking the distance calculations and ensuring the sum is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Recheck \( AB \): \( \sqrt{(1 - 1)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( BC \): \( \sqrt{(5 - 1)^2 + (5 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \). Correct.  
- Recheck \( CA \): \( \sqrt{(1 - 5)^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \). Correct.  
- Sum: \( 6 + 5 + 5 = 16 \). Correct.  
The perimeter calculation is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The perimeter of the triangle with vertices \( A(1,2) \), \( B(1,8) \), and \( C(5,5) \) is 16 units.
