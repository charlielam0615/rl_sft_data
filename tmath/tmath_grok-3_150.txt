**Problem Restated**: Find the perimeter of a triangle with vertices at points \( A(1,2) \), \( B(1,8) \), and \( C(5,4) \) on a Cartesian coordinate plane.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the triangle's perimeter into subgoals:  
1. Calculate the length of side \( AB \).  
2. Calculate the length of side \( BC \).  
3. Calculate the length of side \( CA \).  
4. Sum the lengths of \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) to find the perimeter.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the length of side \( AB \). Achieve this by using the distance formula between points \( A(1,2) \) and \( B(1,8) \):  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the distance \( AB \):  
\[ AB = \sqrt{(1 - 1)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 6^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6 \]  
The length of side \( AB \) is 6 units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the length of side \( BC \). Achieve this by using the distance formula between points \( B(1,8) \) and \( C(5,4) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the distance \( BC \):  
\[ BC = \sqrt{(5 - 1)^2 + (4 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2} \]  
The length of side \( BC \) is \( 4\sqrt{2} \) units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the length of side \( CA \). Achieve this by using the distance formula between points \( C(5,4) \) and \( A(1,2) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the distance \( CA \):  
\[ CA = \sqrt{(1 - 5)^2 + (2 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]  
The length of side \( CA \) is \( 2\sqrt{5} \) units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
List and organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- Main goal: Find the perimeter of triangle \( ABC \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate length of \( AB \) (completed: 6 units).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate length of \( BC \) (completed: \( 4\sqrt{2} \) units).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate length of \( CA \) (completed: \( 2\sqrt{5} \) units).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the lengths to find the perimeter (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Current goal is to sum the lengths \( AB = 6 \), \( BC = 4\sqrt{2} \), and \( CA = 2\sqrt{5} \) to find the perimeter. All side lengths have been calculated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to calculate the perimeter by summing the lengths of sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \). Achieve this by adding \( 6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the perimeter:  
\[ \text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CA = 6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5} \]  
The expression cannot be simplified further without numerical approximation, so the exact perimeter is \( 6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5} \) units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the perimeter calculation. Achieve this by checking the distance formula calculations and the summation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify each side length:  
- \( AB \): \( \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (8-2)^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6 \). Correct.  
- \( BC \): \( \sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (4-8)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2} \). Correct.  
- \( CA \): \( \sqrt{(1-5)^2 + (2-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \). Correct.  
Verify summation:  
- Perimeter = \( 6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5} \). No arithmetic errors in the expression.  
The calculations are valid.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The perimeter of the triangle is \( 6 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{5} \) units.
