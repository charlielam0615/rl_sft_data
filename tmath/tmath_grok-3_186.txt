**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( c \) that make the solutions of the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 11x + c = 0 \) rational. Let’s break this into subgoals:  
1. Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have rational solutions, which typically involves the discriminant.  
2. Express the discriminant in terms of \( c \) and ensure it yields rational solutions.  
3. Find the positive integer values of \( c \) that satisfy this condition.  
4. Compute the product of the two valid \( c \) values.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the condition for the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 11x + c = 0 \) to have rational solutions. This can be achieved by ensuring the discriminant of the quadratic is a perfect square, as rational solutions for a quadratic with integer coefficients require the discriminant to be a perfect square.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is given by \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). Here, \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \), and \( c = c \). Thus, the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = 11^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot c = 121 - 20c. \]  
For the solutions to be rational, \( \Delta \) must be a perfect square, and since the solutions are real (as rational numbers are real), \( \Delta \geq 0 \). Therefore, we need:  
\[ 121 - 20c \geq 0 \implies c \leq \frac{121}{20} = 6.05. \]  
Since \( c \) is a positive integer, possible values are \( c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). Additionally, \( 121 - 20c \) must be a perfect square, say \( k^2 \), for some integer \( k \).  
\[ 121 - 20c = k^2. \]  
We will test \( c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) to find when \( 121 - 20c \) is a perfect square.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the positive integer values of \( c \) such that \( 121 - 20c \) is a perfect square. This can be achieved by testing \( c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) and checking if \( 121 - 20c \) equals a perfect square.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s compute \( 121 - 20c \) for each \( c \):  
- For \( c = 1 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 1 = 121 - 20 = 101 \). Check: \( 10^2 = 100 \), \( 11^2 = 121 \). Not a perfect square.  
- For \( c = 2 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 2 = 121 - 40 = 81 \). Check: \( 9^2 = 81 \). Perfect square.  
- For \( c = 3 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 3 = 121 - 60 = 61 \). Check: \( 7^2 = 49 \), \( 8^2 = 64 \). Not a perfect square.  
- For \( c = 4 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 4 = 121 - 80 = 41 \). Check: \( 6^2 = 36 \), \( 7^2 = 49 \). Not a perfect square.  
- For \( c = 5 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 5 = 121 - 100 = 21 \). Check: \( 4^2 = 16 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \). Not a perfect square.  
- For \( c = 6 \): \( 121 - 20 \cdot 6 = 121 - 120 = 1 \). Check: \( 1^2 = 1 \). Perfect square.  

Thus, \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \) make the discriminant a perfect square (\( 81 = 9^2 \) and \( 1 = 1^2 \)).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \) yield rational solutions by computing the roots of the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 11x + c = 0 \) for these values.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( c = 2 \):  
\[ \Delta = 81 \], so \( \sqrt{\Delta} = 9 \). The roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{-11 \pm 9}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-11 \pm 9}{10}. \]  
- \( x_1 = \frac{-11 + 9}{10} = \frac{-2}{10} = -\frac{1}{5} \).  
- \( x_2 = \frac{-11 - 9}{10} = \frac{-20}{10} = -2 \).  
Both roots (\( -\frac{1}{5}, -2 \)) are rational.  

For \( c = 6 \):  
\[ \Delta = 1 \], so \( \sqrt{\Delta} = 1 \). The roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-11 \pm 1}{10}. \]  
- \( x_1 = \frac{-11 + 1}{10} = \frac{-10}{10} = -1 \).  
- \( x_2 = \frac{-11 - 1}{10} = \frac{-12}{10} = -\frac{6}{5} \).  
Both roots (\( -1, -\frac{6}{5} \)) are rational.  

The values \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \) are confirmed to yield rational solutions.
