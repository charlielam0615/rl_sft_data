### Step 2: Define the Condition for Rational Solutions
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the mathematical condition for the quadratic equation \( 5x^2 + 11x + c = 0 \) to have rational solutions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula and the requirement that solutions are rational, which typically involves the discriminant being a perfect square for integer or rational coefficients.

[IMP]
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the solutions are given by the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \), and \( c = c \). The solutions are rational if the discriminant, \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \), is a perfect square (since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are integers, a perfect square discriminant ensures the square root is rational, making the solutions rational). Thus, we need:
\[
\Delta = 11^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot c = 121 - 20c
\]
to be a perfect square. Let’s denote:
\[
121 - 20c = k^2
\]
where \( k \) is a non-negative integer (since the discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions).

### Step 3: Solve for \( c \) to Make Discriminant a Perfect Square
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find positive integer values of \( c \) such that \( 121 - 20c \) is a perfect square.  
- **How to Achieve**: Rearrange the equation \( 121 - 20c = k^2 \), solve for \( c \), and test integer values of \( k \) to find positive integer solutions for \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the equation:
\[
121 - 20c = k^2
\]
Solve for \( c \):
\[
20c = 121 - k^2 \implies c = \frac{121 - k^2}{20}
\]
For \( c \) to be a positive integer, \( 121 - k^2 \) must be positive and divisible by 20, and \( k^2 \) must be a perfect square. Since \( k^2 \leq 121 \) (because \( c > 0 \implies 121 - k^2 > 0 \)), we have:
\[
k^2 < 121 \implies k \leq 11 \quad (\text{since } 11^2 = 121)
\]
Additionally, for real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:
\[
121 - 20c \geq 0 \implies 20c \leq 121 \implies c \leq \frac{121}{20} \approx 6.05 \implies c \leq 6
\]
Since \( c \) is a positive integer, possible values are \( c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). Now, \( 121 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 20. Let’s test possible perfect squares \( k^2 \):
- \( k = 0 \): \( k^2 = 0 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 0}{20} = \frac{121}{20} = 6.05 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 1 \): \( k^2 = 1 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 1}{20} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \), integer.
- \( k = 2 \): \( k^2 = 4 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 4}{20} = \frac{117}{20} = 5.85 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 3 \): \( k^2 = 9 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 9}{20} = \frac{112}{20} = 5.6 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 4 \): \( k^2 = 16 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 16}{20} = \frac{105}{20} = 5.25 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 5 \): \( k^2 = 25 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 25}{20} = \frac{96}{20} = 4.8 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 6 \): \( k^2 = 36 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 36}{20} = \frac{85}{20} = 4.25 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 7 \): \( k^2 = 49 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 49}{20} = \frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 8 \): \( k^2 = 64 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 64}{20} = \frac{57}{20} = 2.85 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 9 \): \( k^2 = 81 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 81}{20} = \frac{40}{20} = 2 \), integer.
- \( k = 10 \): \( k^2 = 100 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 100}{20} = \frac{21}{20} = 1.05 \), not an integer.
- \( k = 11 \): \( k^2 = 121 \), \( c = \frac{121 - 121}{20} = 0 \), not positive.

Thus, \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \) are the candidate positive integers.

### Step 4: Verify Rational Solutions for \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that the quadratic equation has rational solutions for \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute the discriminant and solutions for each \( c \), confirming they are rational.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \( c = 2 \):
  \[
  \Delta = 121 - 20 \cdot 2 = 121 - 40 = 81 = 9^2
  \]
  Solutions:
  \[
  x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-11 \pm 9}{10}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-11 +  9}{10} = \frac{-2}{10} = -\frac{1}{5}, \quad x = \frac{-11 - 9}{10} = \frac{-20}{10} = -2
  \]
  Both \( -\frac{1}{5} \) and \( -2 \) are rational.

- For \( c = 6 \):
  \[
  \Delta = 121 - 20 \cdot 6 = 121 - 120 = 1 = 1^2
  \]
  Solutions:
  \[
  x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-11 \pm 1}{10}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-11 + 1}{10} = \frac{-10}{10} = -1, \quad x = \frac{-11 - 1}{10} = \frac{-12}{10} = -\frac{6}{5}
  \]
  Both \( -1 \) and \( -\frac{6}{5} \) are rational.

Both values satisfy the condition.

### Step 5: Check for Other Possible Values
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
Reconsider the range of \( c \) and \( k \) to ensure no other positive integers satisfy the condition.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Since \( c \leq 6 \) was derived from the discriminant being non-negative, and we tested all integer \( k \) from 0 to 11, let’s confirm no other \( c \) values were missed. The equation \( c = \frac{121 - k^2}{20} \) requires \( 121 - k^2 \) to be divisible by 20. We tested all \( k^2 \leq 121 \), and only \( k = 1 \) (\( c = 6 \)) and \( k = 9 \) (\( c = 2 \)) worked. For completeness, negative \( k \) yields the same \( k^2 \), and larger \( k \) makes \( c \) negative or non-integer. Thus, no other positive integers are possible.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6: Compute the Product
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the product of the two valid \( c \) values.  
- **How to Achieve**: Multiply the identified values \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The two values are \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 6 \). Their product is:
\[
2 \cdot 6 = 12
\]
[/IMP]
