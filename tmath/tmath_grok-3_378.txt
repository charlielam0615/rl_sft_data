**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( x \) given the system of linear equations:
1. \( 2x - y = 5 \)
2. \( x + 2y = 5 \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( x \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
2. Extract the value of \( x \) from the solution.
Choose a method to solve the system, such as substitution or elimination, and proceed with the steps.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \( x \) and \( y \).
How to Achieve: Use the substitution method. From the second equation, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \), substitute into the first equation, and solve for \( y \). Then, find \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the second equation, \( x + 2y = 5 \), solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 5 - 2y \]

Substitute \( x = 5 - 2y \) into the first equation, \( 2x - y = 5 \):
\[ 2(5 - 2y) - y = 5 \]
\[ 10 - 4y - y = 5 \]
\[ 10 - 5y = 5 \]
\[ -5y = -5 \]
\[ y = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 5 - 2y \):
\[ x = 5 - 2(1) = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \) is correct.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \) into both original equations and check if they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first equation, \( 2x - y = 5 \):
\[ 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \]
This is true.

Check the second equation, \( x + 2y = 5 \):
\[ 3 + 2(1) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]
This is true.

The solution \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \) satisfies both equations.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Extract the value of \( x \) (obtained \( x = 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 3).

Current Goal: Extract and confirm the value of \( x \).
The value of \( x = 3 \) has been computed and verified.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) is \( 3 \).
