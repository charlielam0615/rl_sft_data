**Problem Statement**: Solve the system of linear equations \(2x - y = 5\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) to find the value of \(x\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(x\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).  
2. Isolate \(x\) from the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(2x - y = 5\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) to find \(x\). This can be achieved by using the elimination or substitution method to solve for \(x\) and \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To solve the system \(2x - y = 5\) and \(x + 2y = 5\), use the elimination method to eliminate \(y\):  
- Multiply the first equation by 2: \(2(2x - y) = 2 \cdot 5 \implies 4x - 2y = 10\).  
- Add this to the second equation:  
  \[
  (4x - 2y) + (x + 2y) = 10 + 5 \implies 5x = 15 \implies x = 3.
  \]  
The value of \(x\) is 3.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(x = 3\) satisfies both equations. This can be achieved by substituting \(x = 3\) into both equations to find \(y\) and checking consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 3\) into the second equation \(x + 2y = 5\):  
\[
3 + 2y = 5 \implies 2y = 2 \implies y = 1.
\]  
Now, check the first equation \(2x - y = 5\):  
\[
2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
\]  
Both equations are satisfied with \(x = 3\) and \(y = 1\). Thus, \(x = 3\) is valid.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \(x\) in the system \(2x - y = 5\) and \(x + 2y = 5\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate \(x\) (completed in Step 2, \(x = 3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 3).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final value of \(x\).  
The solution \(x = 3\) has been computed and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(x\) is 3.
