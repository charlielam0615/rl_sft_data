Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the given values into the equation $ x \star 24 = 7 $ and solve for $ x $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the definition $ a \star b = \frac{\sqrt{a + b}}{\sqrt{a - b}} $, substitute $ a = x $ and $ b = 24 $ into the operation:  
$$
x \star 24 = \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7
$$  
To eliminate the square roots, square both sides of the equation:  
$$
\left(\frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}}\right)^2 = 7^2
$$  
$$
\frac{x + 24}{x - 24} = 49
$$  
Now solve for $ x $:  
Multiply both sides by $ x - 24 $:  
$$
x + 24 = 49(x - 24)
$$  
Distribute the right-hand side:  
$$
x + 24 = 49x - 1176
$$  
Simplify the equation:  
$$
x - 49x = -1176 - 24
$$  
$$
-48x = -1200
$$  
$$
x = \frac{-1200}{-48} = 25
$$

I am focusing on step 4: performing a self-verification to ensure the solution is correct.

[PLANNING]
Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the validity of the solution $ x = 25 $ by substituting it back into the original equation and verifying domain constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Substitute $ x = 25 $ into the original operation**:  
   $$
   25 \star 24 = \frac{\sqrt{25 + 24}}{\sqrt{25 - 24}} = \frac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1}} = \frac{7}{1} = 7
   $$  
   This matches the given equation $ x \star 24 = 7 $, confirming the algebraic solution is consistent.  

2. **Verify domain constraints**:  
   - The denominator $ \sqrt{x - 24} $ requires $ x - 24 > 0 $ (since division by zero is undefined and square roots of negative numbers are invalid in real numbers).  
   - For $ x = 25 $: $ x - 24 = 1 > 0 $, satisfying the constraint.  
   - The numerator $ \sqrt{x + 24} $ requires $ x + 24 \geq 0 $. For $ x = 25 $: $ 25 + 24 = 49 \geq 0 $, which is valid.  

3. **Check for extraneous solutions**:  
   Squaring both sides of an equation can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. However, $ x = 25 $ satisfies all constraints and the original equation directly, so no extraneous solutions exist here.  

All steps confirm $ x = 25 $ is a valid solution.
