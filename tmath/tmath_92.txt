Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor the denominator on the right-hand side of the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The denominator on the right-hand side is $ x^3 + x^2 - 20x $. We factor out $ x $ first:
$$ x^3 + x^2 - 20x = x(x^2 + x - 20). $$
Now, factor $ x^2 + x - 20 $:
$$ x^2 + x - 20 = (x + 5)(x - 4). $$
Thus, the denominator becomes:
$$ x(x + 5)(x - 4). $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express the left-hand side with a common denominator.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The denominators on the left-hand side are $ x + 5 $ and $ x^2 - 4x $. Factoring $ x^2 - 4x $ gives $ x(x - 4) $. The common denominator for the left-hand side is $ x(x + 5)(x - 4) $, which matches the factored form of the denominator on the right-hand side.  

To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we rewrite each term to have the common denominator $ x(x + 5)(x - 4) $:

$$
\frac{G}{x+5} = \frac{G \cdot x(x - 4)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)} = \frac{Gx(x - 4)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)}
$$
$$
\frac{H}{x(x - 4)} = \frac{H(x + 5)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)} = \frac{H(x + 5)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)}.
$$

The left-hand side becomes:
$$
\frac{Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)}.
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine the terms on the left-hand side into a single fraction and equate the numerators.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The numerator of the left-hand side is:  
$$ Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5). $$  
Expanding both terms:  
$$ Gx(x - 4) = Gx^2 - 4Gx, $$  
$$ H(x + 5) = Hx + 5H. $$  
Adding them together:  
$$ Gx^2 - 4Gx + Hx + 5H = Gx^2 + (-4G + H)x + 5H. $$  

The right-hand side has the numerator $ x^2 - 2x + 10 $.  
Since both sides have the same denominator $ x(x + 5)(x - 4) $, we equate the numerators:  
$$ Gx^2 + (-4G + H)x + 5H = x^2 - 2x + 10. $$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ G $ and $ H $ by equating the coefficients of the polynomials on both sides.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the polynomial equation:  
1. Coefficient of $ x^2 $:  
   $$
   G = 1
   $$  
2. Coefficient of $ x $:  
   $$
   -4G + H = -2
   $$  
   Substituting $ G = 1 $:  
   $$
   -4(1) + H = -2 \Rightarrow -4 + H = -2 \Rightarrow H = 2
   $$  
3. Constant term:  
   $$
   5H = 10
   $$  
   Substituting $ H = 2 $:  
   $$
   5(2) = 10 \Rightarrow 10 = 10 \quad \text{(Verified)}
   $$  

Thus, $ G = 1 $ and $ H = 2 $.

Goal of this step: Compute $ H/G $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substituting the values $ G = 1 $ and $ H = 2 $:

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution, including factoring, combining fractions, equating coefficients, and computing the final ratio.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
First, verify the factoring of the denominator on the right-hand side. The original denominator is $ x^3 + x^2 - 20x $. Factoring out $ x $ gives $ x(x^2 + x - 20) $. The quadratic $ x^2 + x - 20 $ factors into $ (x + 5)(x - 4) $, which is correct. Thus, the denominator is correctly factored as $ x(x + 5)(x - 4) $.

Next, verify the common denominator for the left-hand side. The denominators $ x + 5 $ and $ x^2 - 4x = x(x - 4) $ have a least common denominator of $ x(x + 5)(x - 4) $. The terms are rewritten as $ \frac{Gx(x - 4)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)} $ and $ \frac{H(x + 5)}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)} $. Combining these gives the numerator $ Gx^2 - 4Gx + Hx + 5H $, which is expanded and simplified correctly.

Equate the numerators:
$$
Gx^2 + (-4G + H)x + 5H = x^2 - 2x + 10.
$$
Matching coefficients:
- $ G = 1 $ (from $ x^2 $-term),
- $ -4G + H = -2 $ (from $ x $-term),
- $ 5H = 10 $ (constant term).

Solving $ G = 1 $, substituting into $ -4(1) + H = -2 $ gives $ H = 2 $. Substituting $ H = 2 $ into $ 5H = 10 $ confirms $ 10 = 10 $, verifying consistency. The final ratio $ H/G = 2/1 = 2 $ is correct. All steps are logically sound and free of arithmetic errors.
