**Problem Restatement**: I need to find the sum of the x-values that satisfy the equation \(5 = \frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2}\). This involves solving for x in the given equation and then summing up those x-values.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable steps. First, I need to simplify the given equation by addressing the fraction. My initial subgoal is to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by (x + 2), assuming x ≠ -2 to avoid division by zero. Next, I will rearrange the equation to form a polynomial equal to zero. Then, I will solve for the roots of that polynomial. Finally, I will sum the x-values that satisfy the original equation, ensuring to check if x = -2 is a valid solution.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation by eliminating the denominator.  
Description: I will multiply both sides of the equation by (x + 2) to remove the fraction, while noting that x cannot be -2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting with the equation \(5 = \frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2}\), I multiply both sides by (x + 2):  
\(5(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\).  
This simplifies to:  
\(5x + 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\).  
Now, I bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:  
\(0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x - 5x - 10\),  
which becomes:  
\(0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\).  
I now have a cubic polynomial to solve: \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Solve the cubic equation \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0\).  
Description: I will attempt to find the roots of the cubic polynomial using the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots, and then factor the polynomial accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To solve \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0\), I apply the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of -10 divided by factors of 1, giving ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10.  
Testing x = 5:  
\(5^3 - 2(5^2) - 13(5) - 10 = 125 - 50 - 65 - 10 = 0\).  
So, x = 5 is a root. I can factor (x - 5) out of the polynomial using synthetic division:  
Coefficients: 1, -2, -13, -10  
Bring down 1, multiply by 5: 1 * 5 = 5; add to -2: 3  
3 * 5 = 15; add to -13: 2  
2 * 5 = 10; add to -10: 0  
Thus, the polynomial factors as (x - 5)(x^2 + 3x + 2).  
Now, solve x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 by factoring:  
(x + 1)(x + 2) = 0, so x = -1 or x = -2.  
The potential roots are x = 5, x = -1, and x = -2.

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the solutions in the original equation.  
Description: I will substitute each potential root back into the original equation to ensure they do not make the denominator zero and that they satisfy the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I have potential solutions x = 5, x = -1, and x = -2. I must check each in the original equation \(5 = \frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2}\).  
- For x = 5: Denominator = 5 + 2 = 7 (not zero). Numerator = \(5^3 - 2(5^2) - 8(5) = 125 - 50 - 40 = 35\), so \(35/7 = 5\), which equals the left side. Valid.  
- For x = -1: Denominator = -1 + 2 = 1 (not zero). Numerator = \((-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 8(-1) = -1 - 2 + 8 = 5\), so \(5/1 = 5\), which equals the left side. Valid.  
- For x = -2: Denominator = -2 + 2 = 0. Since division by zero is undefined, x = -2 is not a valid solution.  
Therefore, the valid solutions are x = 5 and x = -1.

[/PLANNING]

The valid x-values are 5 and -1. Their sum is:  
\(5 + (-1) = 4\).  
Therefore, the sum of the x-values that satisfy the equation is 4.
