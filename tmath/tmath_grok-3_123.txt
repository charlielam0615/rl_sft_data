### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation by eliminating the fraction.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator $x + 2$ to clear the fraction, ensuring $x \neq -2$ to avoid division by zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 5 = \frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \]  
Multiply both sides by $x + 2$:  
\[ 5(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x \]  
Simplify the left-hand side:  
\[ 5x + 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x \]  
Move all terms to one side to form a polynomial equation:  
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x - 5x - 10 = 0 \]  
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0 \]  
The equation is now a cubic polynomial:  
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the cubic equation $x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0$ to find all $x$-values.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots, test them, and factor the polynomial to find all roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The cubic equation is:  
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0 \]  
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of the constant term ($-10$) divided by factors of the leading coefficient ($1$), i.e., $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 5, \pm 10$.  

Test $x = 5$:  
\[ 5^3 - 2(5^2) - 13(5) - 10 = 125 - 50 - 65 - 10 = 0 \]  
Since $x = 5$ is a root, use synthetic division to factor the polynomial:  

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
5 & 1 & -2 & -13 & -10 \\
  &   & 5  & 15  & 10  \\
\hline
  & 1 & 3  & 2   & 0   \\
\end{array}
\]

Quotient is $x^2 + 3x + 2$, so:  
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = (x - 5)(x^2 + 3x + 2) \]  

Factor the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2) \]  
Thus, the polynomial is:  
\[ (x - 5)(x + 1)(x + 2) = 0 \]  
Roots are:  
\[ x = 5, \quad x = -1, \quad x = -2 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all roots satisfy the original equation, considering the restriction $x \neq -2$.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each root into the original equation and check if it holds, noting that $x = -2$ may be invalid due to the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original equation:  
\[ 5 = \frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \]  

- For $x = 5$:  
\[ \frac{5^3 - 2(5^2) - 8(5)}{5 + 2} = \frac{125 - 50 - 40}{7} = \frac{35}{7} = 5 \]  
Satisfies the equation.  

- For $x = -1$:  
\[ \frac{(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 8(-1)}{-1 + 2} = \frac{-1 - 2 + 8}{1} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \]  
Satisfies the equation.  

- For $x = -2$:  
\[ \frac{(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 - 8(-2)}{-2 + 2} = \frac{-8 - 8 + 16}{0} \]  
The denominator is zero, so $x = -2$ is not a valid solution.  

Valid roots are $x = 5$ and $x = -1$.
