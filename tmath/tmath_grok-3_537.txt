### Problem Statement
We need to find the positive value of \( m \) for which the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) has exactly one real root.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for a quadratic to have exactly one real root.  
2. Set up the quadratic equation and apply the condition.  
3. Solve for the positive value of \( m \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the condition for a quadratic to have exactly one real root. A quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) has exactly one real root when its discriminant is zero (\( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0 \)). We will apply this to the given quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)),  
- \( b = 4m \) (coefficient of \( x \)),  
- \( c = m \) (constant term).  

The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (4m)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot m = 16m^2 - 4m. \]  

For exactly one real root, set the discriminant to zero:  
\[ 16m^2 - 4m = 0. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \) to find the values of \( m \), and identify the positive value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ 16m^2 - 4m = 0. \]  
Factorize:  
\[ 4m (4m - 1) = 0. \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ 4m = 0 \implies m = 0, \]  
\[ 4m - 1 = 0 \implies 4m = 1 \implies m = \frac{1}{4}. \]  

The solutions are \( m = 0 \) and \( m = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the problem asks for the positive value, we consider \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) results in exactly one real root for the quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \). Substitute \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) into the quadratic and check the discriminant or solve for the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) into the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x + \frac{1}{4} = x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = 0. \]  

Calculate the discriminant:  
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = \frac{1}{4} \).  
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 - 1 = 0. \]  

Since \( \Delta = 0 \), the quadratic has exactly one real root.  

Alternatively, solve the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = 0. \]  
Rewrite:  
\[ x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = \left( x + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = 0. \]  
\[ x + \frac{1}{2} = 0 \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}. \]  

This confirms a single real root at \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the other solution, \( m = 0 \), to ensure it does not satisfy the condition of having exactly one real root, as we need the positive value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( m = 0 \) into the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 4 \cdot 0 \cdot x + 0 = x^2 = 0. \]  

Solve:  
\[ x^2 = 0 \implies x = 0. \]  

This has one real root, but the quadratic \( x^2 = 0 \) is degenerate (not a standard quadratic with \( a \neq 0 \)). In the context of quadratics, we typically consider non-degenerate cases. Let’s check the discriminant:  
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \).  
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = 0^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0. \]  

While \( m = 0 \) technically yields one root, it reduces the quadratic to a linear equation, which may not align with the problem’s intent for a standard quadratic. Since the problem specifies a positive value, we discard \( m = 0 \).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the positive value of \( m \) for which \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) has exactly one real root.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for one real root (discriminant = 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the condition to find \( m \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the resulting equation \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions \( m = 0 \) and \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Select the positive value \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by ensuring all steps align and the positive value \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) is correct.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the positive value of \( m \). Retrieve information from previous steps related to the discriminant and the validation of \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From Step 2: The discriminant for \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) is \( \Delta = 16m^2 - 4m \), and setting it to zero gives \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \).  
From Step 3: Solving \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \) yields \( m = 0 \) and \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
From Step 4: For \( m = \frac{1}{4} \), the quadratic \( x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = 0 \) has discriminant \( \Delta = 0 \), confirming one real root at \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \).  
From Step 5: For \( m = 0 \), the quadratic becomes \( x^2 = 0 \), which is degenerate and may not satisfy the problem’s intent for a standard quadratic.  

The positive value \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) satisfies the condition.

### Final Answer
The positive value of \( m \) for which the quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) has exactly one real root is \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).
