**Problem Restatement**: Find the positive value of \( m \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) has exactly one real root.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for a quadratic to have exactly one real root using the discriminant.  
2. Set up the discriminant equation for the given quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( m \).  
4. Identify the positive value of \( m \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the condition for a quadratic to have exactly one real root.  
How to Achieve: Use the discriminant of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), which is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). For exactly one real root, set \( \Delta = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). If \( \Delta = 0 \), the quadratic has exactly one real root, as the roots are equal (a double root).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up the discriminant equation for the quadratic \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \).  
How to Achieve: Identify coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then compute the discriminant and set it equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic is \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \). Comparing with \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):  
- \( a = 1 \)  
- \( b = 4m \)  
- \( c = m \)  
The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (4m)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot m = 16m^2 - 4m \]  
For exactly one real root, set \( \Delta = 0 \):  
\[ 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the discriminant equation \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \) for \( m \).  
How to Achieve: Factorize the equation and solve for \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ 4m (4m - 1) = 0 \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ 4m = 0 \implies m = 0 \]  
\[ 4m - 1 = 0 \implies 4m = 1 \implies m = \frac{1}{4} \]  
So, \( m = 0 \) or \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the positive value of \( m \) such that \( x^2 + 4mx + m = 0 \) has exactly one real root.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for exactly one real root (completed: \( \Delta = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the discriminant equation (completed: \( 16m^2 - 4m = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( m \) (completed: \( m = 0, \frac{1}{4} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the positive value of \( m \) (current).  
Current Goal: Identify the positive value of \( m \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the positive value of \( m \).  
How to Achieve: From the solutions \( m = 0 \) and \( m = \frac{1}{4} \), select the positive value and verify it satisfies the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The solutions are \( m = 0 \) and \( m = \frac{1}{4} \). Since the problem asks for the positive value, consider \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
Verify: Substitute \( m = \frac{1}{4} \) into the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x + \frac{1}{4} = x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = 0 \]  
Compute the discriminant:  
\[ a = 1, b = 1, c = \frac{1}{4} \]  
\[ \Delta = 1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 - 1 = 0 \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), the quadratic has exactly one real root.  
Check \( m = 0 \):  
\[ x^2 + 4 \cdot 0 \cdot x + 0 = x^2 = 0 \]  
This has one root (\( x = 0 \)), but since the problem specifies a positive \( m \), discard \( m = 0 \).  
Thus, the positive value is \( m = \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The positive value of \( m \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).
