**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the constant \( s \) in the equivalent equation \((x + r)^2 = s\), which Marina derived by completing the square for the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( s \), we need to complete the square on the given quadratic equation \( 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \) and transform it into the form \((x + r)^2 = s\). The subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form for completing the square.  
2. Factor out the coefficient of \( x^2 \) from the first two terms.  
3. Complete the square inside the expression.  
4. Simplify to match the form \((x + r)^2 = s\) and identify \( s \).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the quadratic equation and start completing the square.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the entire equation by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) to simplify, then isolate the quadratic and linear terms to prepare for completing the square.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \]  
Move the constant term to the other side:  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x = 720 \]  
Divide through by 9 to make the coefficient of \( x^2 \) equal to 1:  
\[ x^2 - 2x = 80 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Complete the square for the expression \( x^2 - 2x = 80 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the coefficient of \( x \), halve it, square it, and add it to both sides to form a perfect square trinomial on the left.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x^2 - 2x \), the coefficient of \( x \) is \(-2\). Halve it to get \(-1\), and square it to get \( 1 \). Add 1 to both sides:  
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 80 + 1 \]  
The left side becomes a perfect square:  
\[ (x - 1)^2 = 81 \]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the equation \((x - 1)^2 = 81\) is equivalent to the original equation and identify \( s \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the derived equation to the form \((x + r)^2 = s\), and expand the derived equation to check equivalence with the original.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The derived equation is \((x - 1)^2 = 81\). Compare with \((x + r)^2 = s\):  
- Here, \( r = -1 \) (since \( x - 1 = x + (-1) \)) and \( s = 81 \).  
To validate, expand \((x - 1)^2 = 81\):  
\[ (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 81 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x = 80 \]  
Multiply through by 9 to match the original coefficient:  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x = 720 \]  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \]  
This matches the original equation, confirming correctness. Thus, \( s = 81 \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( s \) in the equation \((x + r)^2 = s\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic equation (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Complete the square (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify to find \( s \) and validate (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution by confirming \( s \).  
The value of \( s \) has been identified as 81, and the equation \((x - 1)^2 = 81\) is verified as equivalent.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( s \) is 81.
