**Problem Statement**: We need to find the constant \( s \) in the equivalent equation \((x + r)^2 = s\), which Marina derived by completing the square for the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( s \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form.  
2. Apply the completing the square method to transform the equation into the form \((x + r)^2 = s\).  
3. Identify the constant \( s \) from the resulting equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the completing the square method to the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \) to obtain the form \((x + r)^2 = s\). This involves dividing the equation by the leading coefficient, rewriting the quadratic expression, and completing the square to isolate the constant \( s \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the quadratic equation:  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \]  

Move the constant term to the right side:  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x = 720 \]  

Divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient, 9, to make the coefficient of \( x^2 \) equal to 1:  
\[ x^2 - 2x = 80 \]  

To complete the square, focus on the left side \( x^2 - 2x \). Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-2\), halve it to get \(-1\), and square it to get \( 1 \). Add and subtract this square inside the equation:  
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1 = 80 \]  

Rewrite the equation by grouping the perfect square trinomial:  
\[ (x - 1)^2 - 1 = 80 \]  

Move the \(-1\) to the right side:  
\[ (x - 1)^2 = 80 + 1 \]  
\[ (x - 1)^2 = 81 \]  

This is the form \((x + r)^2 = s\), where \( r = -1 \) and \( s = 81 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the derived equation \((x - 1)^2 = 81\) correctly represents the original quadratic equation and confirm the value of \( s \). This will be done by expanding the derived equation and checking if it matches the original after transformations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand \((x - 1)^2 = 81\):  
\[ (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 81 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 80 = 0 \]  

Multiply through by 9 to match the original equationâ€™s leading coefficient:  
\[ 9(x^2 - 2x - 80) = 0 \]  
\[ 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \]  

This matches the original equation \( 9x^2 - 18x - 720 = 0 \), confirming the transformation is correct. Thus, \( s = 81 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the constant \( s \) in the equation \((x + r)^2 = s\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply completing the square to derive \((x + r)^2 = s\) (completed, found \( r = -1 \), \( s = 81 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the derived equation (completed, transformation verified).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution by stating the value of \( s \).  
The value of \( s \) is 81, as derived and validated.
