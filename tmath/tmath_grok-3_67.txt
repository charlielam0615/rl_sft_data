### Problem Statement
We are given a binary operation defined by \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \) for all real numbers \( a \) and \( b \). We need to find the value of \( 3 \oplus 1 \).

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 3 \oplus 1 \) using the given operation \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \). To achieve this, substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \) into the formula and perform the arithmetic.

[IMP]  
Using the operation \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \), substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \):  
\[ 3 \oplus 1 = 3 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 1 = 9 + 4 = 13. \]

### Final Answer
\[ 3 \oplus 1 = 13 \]
