**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( 3 \oplus 1 \).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the definition of the operation \( \oplus \).  
- Subgoal 2: Apply the operation to the given values \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \).  
- Subgoal 3: Compute the result using the formula provided.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 3 \oplus 1 \) using the operation \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \). This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \) into the formula and performing the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the operation definition \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \), substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \):  
\[ 3 \oplus 1 = 3 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 1 \]  
Calculate:  
\[ 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \]  
\[ 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \]  
\[ 9 + 4 = 13 \]  
Thus, \( 3 \oplus 1 = 13 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computation \( 3 \oplus 1 = 13 \). This will be achieved by rechecking the substitution and arithmetic steps to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute to validate:  
The operation is \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \). For \( a = 3 \), \( b = 1 \):  
\[ 3 \oplus 1 = 3 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 1 = 9 + 4 = 13 \]  
The calculation is consistent with the previous result. Additionally, the operation is a simple linear expression, and no alternative interpretations or edge cases apply for real numbers. The result is correct.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( 3 \oplus 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the operation \( a \oplus b = 3a + 4b \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the operation to \( a = 3 \), \( b = 1 \) (completed, result: 13).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed, confirmed result: 13).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and no further subgoals are needed.  
The final result is \( 3 \oplus 1 = 13 \).

**Final Answer**: \( 3 \oplus 1 = 13 \)
