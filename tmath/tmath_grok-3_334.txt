**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all real values of \( b \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 + bx + 9 = 0 \) has two non-real roots. The answer should be expressed in interval notation.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to determine the conditions under which the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \) has non-real roots. This involves:  
1. Identifying the condition for non-real roots using the discriminant of the quadratic.  
2. Solving the resulting inequality for \( b \).  
3. Expressing the solution in interval notation.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the condition for non-real roots.  
**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the roots are non-real if the discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac < 0 \). Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = b \), and \( c = 9 \). Compute the discriminant and set up the inequality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The discriminant of the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \) is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 9 = b^2 - 36 \]  
For the roots to be non-real, we need:  
\[ b^2 - 36 < 0 \]  
Solving this inequality:  
\[ b^2 < 36 \]  
\[ |b| < 6 \]  
\[ -6 < b < 6 \]  
This suggests that the roots are non-real when \( b \) is in the interval \( (-6, 6) \).

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the inequality \( -6 < b < 6 \) correctly identifies when the quadratic has non-real roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Test boundary values and a value within the interval to confirm the discriminant is negative, and check outside the interval to ensure the discriminant is non-negative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Test \( b = 0 \) (inside the interval)**:  
  \[ \Delta = 0^2 - 36 = -36 < 0 \]  
  The discriminant is negative, indicating non-real roots.  
- **Test \( b = 6 \) (boundary)**:  
  \[ \Delta = 6^2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0 \]  
  The discriminant is zero, indicating real (double) roots, not non-real.  
- **Test \( b = -6 \) (boundary)**:  
  \[ \Delta = (-6)^2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0 \]  
  The discriminant is zero, indicating real roots.  
- **Test \( b = 7 \) (outside the interval)**:  
  \[ \Delta = 7^2 - 36 = 49 - 36 = 13 > 0 \]  
  The discriminant is positive, indicating real roots.  
The inequality \( b^2 < 36 \) (i.e., \( -6 < b < 6 \)) correctly identifies when the discriminant is negative, corresponding to non-real roots.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find all real values of \( b \) such that \( x^2 + bx + 9 \) has non-real roots, expressed in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the condition for non-real roots (completed: discriminant \( b^2 - 36 < 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the inequality for \( b \) (completed: \( -6 < b < 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: tested boundary and interior points).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the solution in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the result from the inequality \( -6 < b < 6 \) and write it in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The values of \( b \) that satisfy \( b^2 < 36 \) are \( -6 < b < 6 \). In interval notation, this is:  
\[ (-6, 6) \]

**Final Answer**

The real values of \( b \) for which the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \) has two non-real roots are:  
\[ \boxed{(-6, 6)} \]
