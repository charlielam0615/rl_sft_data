### Problem Restatement
We need to find all real values of \( b \) such that the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + bx + 9 \) has two non-real roots. The solution should be expressed in interval notation.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for a quadratic to have non-real roots.  
2. Apply this condition to the given quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \).  
3. Solve for the parameter \( b \).  
4. Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Determine the condition for a quadratic to have non-real roots.  
- **How to achieve it**: Use the discriminant of a quadratic equation. For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the discriminant is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). Non-real roots occur when \( \Delta < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the roots are non-real if the discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac < 0 \). This is because the roots are given by the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  
If \( \Delta < 0 \), the square root involves imaginary numbers, leading to complex (non-real) roots.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Apply the discriminant condition to the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \).  
- **How to achieve it**: Identify coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), compute the discriminant, and set up the inequality \( \Delta < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 9 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = b \), \( c = 9 \).  
- Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 9 = b^2 - 36 \]  
- Condition for non-real roots:  
\[ b^2 - 36 < 0 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Solve the inequality \( b^2 - 36 < 0 \) for \( b \).  
- **How to achieve it**: Simplify the inequality and find the range of \( b \) that satisfies it.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ b^2 - 36 < 0 \]  
\[ b^2 < 36 \]  
\[ |b| < \sqrt{36} \]  
\[ |b| < 6 \]  
\[ -6 < b < 6 \]  
This gives the interval:  
\[ b \in (-6, 6) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Verify that \( b \in (-6, 6) \) ensures non-real roots and that values outside this interval do not.  
- **How to achieve it**: Test values of \( b \) inside, at, and outside the interval to confirm the discriminantâ€™s behavior and root types.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Test \( b = 0 \) (inside \( (-6, 6) \))**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 + 9 \).  
  Discriminant: \( \Delta = 0^2 - 36 = -36 < 0 \).  
  Roots are non-real (e.g., \( x = \pm 3i \)).  
- **Test \( b = 6 \) (boundary)**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \).  
  Discriminant: \( \Delta = 6^2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0 \).  
  Roots are real and equal (\( x = -3 \)), not non-real.  
- **Test \( b = -6 \) (boundary)**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2 \).  
  Discriminant: \( \Delta = (-6)^2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0 \).  
  Roots are real and equal (\( x = 3 \)), not non-real.  
- **Test \( b = 7 \) (outside \( (-6, 6) \))**:  
  Quadratic: \( x^2 + 7x + 9 \).  
  Discriminant: \( \Delta = 7^2 - 36 = 49 - 36 = 13 > 0 \).  
  Roots are real and distinct.  
The inequality \( -6 < b < 6 \) correctly identifies where \( \Delta < 0 \), ensuring non-real roots. Boundary points (\( b = \pm 6 \)) and values outside yield real roots.
