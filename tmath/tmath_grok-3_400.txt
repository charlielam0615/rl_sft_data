### Problem Statement

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to achieve the final goal of rewriting the quadratic and finding \(ab\):  
1. Rewrite the quadratic \(9x^2 - 30x - 42\) in the form \((ax + b)^2 + c\).  
2. Identify the integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the rewritten form.  
3. Compute the product \(ab\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the quadratic \(9x^2 - 30x - 42\) in the form \((ax + b)^2 + c\).  
**How to Achieve**: Factor out the leading coefficient, complete the square for the quadratic expression, and express the result in the desired form with integer coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To rewrite \(9x^2 - 30x - 42\) in the form \((ax + b)^2 + c\), we start by completing the square. Since the leading coefficient is 9, we factor it out from the first two terms:

\[ 9x^2 - 30x - 42 = 9\left(x^2 - \frac{30}{9}x\right) - 42 = 9\left(x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x\right) - 42 \]

Focus on the expression inside the parentheses, \(x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x\). To complete the square, take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-\frac{10}{3}\), halve it to get \(-\frac{5}{3}\), and square it:

\[ \left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9} \]

Add and subtract \(\frac{25}{9}\) inside the parentheses:

\[ x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x = x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x + \frac{25}{9} - \frac{25}{9} = \left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{9} \]

Substitute back into the expression:

\[ 9\left(x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x\right) = 9\left[\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{9}\right] = 9\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - 9 \cdot \frac{25}{9} = 9\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - 25 \]

So the quadratic becomes:

\[ 9\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - 25 - 42 = 9\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 - 67 \]

To express this in the form \((ax + b)^2 + c\), rewrite the term inside the parentheses. Note that:

\[ x - \frac{5}{3} = x + \left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) \]

Thus:

\[ 9\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \left[3\left(x - \frac{5}{3}\right)\right]^2 = \left(3x - 5\right)^2 \]

So the expression is:

\[ (3x - 5)^2 - 67 \]

Here, \(a = 3\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -67\), all integers. This matches the form \((ax + b)^2 + c\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \((3x - 5)^2 - 67\) is equivalent to \(9x^2 - 30x - 42\).  
**How to Achieve**: Expand \((3x - 5)^2 - 67\) and compare it to the original quadratic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \((3x - 5)^2 - 67\):

\[ (3x - 5)^2 = (3x - 5)(3x - 5) = 9x^2 - 15x - 15x + 25 = 9x^2 - 30x + 25 \]

Then:

\[ (3x - 5)^2 - 67 = 9x^2 - 30x + 25 - 67 = 9x^2 - 30x - 42 \]

This matches the original quadratic \(9x^2 - 30x - 42\), confirming the rewritten form is correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the product \(ab\).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify \(a\) and \(b\) from the rewritten form \((3x - 5)^2 - 67\) and multiply them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the form \((3x - 5)^2 - 67\), we have \(a = 3\) and \(b = -5\). Thus:

\[ ab = 3 \cdot (-5) = -15 \]

So, \(ab = -15\).
