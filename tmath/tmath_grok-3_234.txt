**Problem Statement**: We need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), which passes through the points \((-1, 7)\), \((5, 7)\), and \((6, 10)\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the x-coordinate of the vertex:  
1. Use the given points to set up a system of equations to determine \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
2. Solve the system to find the coefficients of the quadratic equation.  
3. Use the vertex formula for a quadratic \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where the x-coordinate is \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
4. Compute the x-coordinate of the vertex using the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a system of equations using the points \((-1, 7)\), \((5, 7)\), and \((6, 10)\). Substitute each point into the quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) to create three equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute the points into \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \):  
- For \((-1, 7)\): \( 7 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \implies 7 = a - b + c \)  
- For \((5, 7)\): \( 7 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c \implies 7 = 25a + 5b + c \)  
- For \((6, 10)\): \( 10 = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c \implies 10 = 36a + 6b + c \)  

The system of equations is:  
1. \( a - b + c = 7 \)  
2. \( 25a + 5b + c = 7 \)  
3. \( 36a + 6b + c = 10 \)

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Use elimination or substitution to solve the system.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the system:  
1. \( a - b + c = 7 \)  
2. \( 25a + 5b + c = 7 \)  
3. \( 36a + 6b + c = 10 \)  

**Eliminate \(c\)**:  
Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:  
\[ (25a + 5b + c) - (a - b + c) = 7 - 7 \]  
\[ 24a + 6b = 0 \implies 4a + b = 0 \implies b = -4a \quad (4) \]  

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:  
\[ (36a + 6b + c) - (25a + 5b + c) = 10 - 7 \]  
\[ 11a + b = 3 \quad (5) \]  

**Solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:  
Substitute \( b = -4a \) from equation 4 into equation 5:  
\[ 11a + (-4a) = 3 \implies 7a = 3 \implies a = \frac{3}{7} \]  
Then, \( b = -4a = -4 \cdot \frac{3}{7} = -\frac{12}{7} \).  

**Find \(c\)**:  
Use equation 1: \( a - b + c = 7 \). Substitute \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \):  
\[ \frac{3}{7} - \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right) + c = 7 \implies \frac{3}{7} + \frac{12}{7} + c = 7 \implies \frac{15}{7} + c = 7 \implies c = 7 - \frac{15}{7} = \frac{49}{7} - \frac{15}{7} = \frac{34}{7} \]  

Thus, \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \), \( c = \frac{34}{7} \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the coefficients by substituting \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \), \( c = \frac{34}{7} \) into the original equations to ensure they satisfy all given points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each point:  
- For \((-1, 7)\):  
\[ y = \frac{3}{7}(-1)^2 + \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right)(-1) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3}{7} + \frac{12}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3 + 12 + 34}{7} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \]  
- For \((5, 7)\):  
\[ y = \frac{3}{7}(5)^2 + \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right)(5) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3 \cdot 25}{7} - \frac{12 \cdot 5}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{75 - 60 + 34}{7} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \]  
- For \((6, 10)\):  
\[ y = \frac{3}{7}(6)^2 + \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right)(6) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3 \cdot 36}{7} - \frac{12 \cdot 6}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{108 - 72 + 34}{7} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]  

All points satisfy the equation, so the coefficients are correct.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) with \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The vertex formula is \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Substitute \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \):  
\[ x = -\frac{-\frac{12}{7}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{7}} = \frac{\frac{12}{7}}{\frac{6}{7}} = \frac{12}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]  

The x-coordinate of the vertex is \( x = 2 \).
