### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the x-coordinate of the vertex, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set up a system of equations using the given points to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up a system of equations using the points \((-1, 7)\), \((5, 7)\), and \((6, 10)\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute each point into the quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) to create three equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \((-1, 7)\):  
\( 7 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \implies 7 = a - b + c \)  

Substitute \((5, 7)\):  
\( 7 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c \implies 7 = 25a + 5b + c \)  

Substitute \((6, 10)\):  
\( 10 = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c \implies 10 = 36a + 6b + c \)  

System of equations:  
1. \( a - b + c = 7 \)  
2. \( 25a + 5b + c = 7 \)  
3. \( 36a + 6b + c = 10 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the system of equations is correct.  
How to Achieve: Check that substituting the points into the quadratic equation yields the correct equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-check substitution for \((-1, 7)\):  
\( y = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b + c = 7 \). Correct.  

Re-check substitution for \((5, 7)\):  
\( y = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 25a + 5b + c = 7 \). Correct.  

Re-check substitution for \((6, 10)\):  
\( y = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c = 36a + 6b + c = 10 \). Correct.  

The system is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
How to Achieve: Use elimination or substitution to solve the system:  
1. \( a - b + c = 7 \)  
2. \( 25a + 5b + c = 7 \)  
3. \( 36a + 6b + c = 10 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Eliminate \( c \) from equations 1 and 2:  
\( (25a + 5b + c) - (a - b + c) = 7 - 7 \)  
\( 24a + 6b = 0 \implies 4a + b = 0 \implies b = -4a \)  

Eliminate \( c \) from equations 2 and 3:  
\( (36a + 6b + c) - (25a + 5b + c) = 10 - 7 \)  
\( 11a + b = 3 \)  

Substitute \( b = -4a \) into \( 11a + b = 3 \):  
\( 11a - 4a = 3 \implies 7a = 3 \implies a = \frac{3}{7} \)  

Find \( b \):  
\( b = -4 \cdot \frac{3}{7} = -\frac{12}{7} \)  

Substitute \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \) into equation 1:  
\( \frac{3}{7} - \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right) + c = 7 \implies \frac{3}{7} + \frac{12}{7} + c = 7 \implies \frac{15}{7} + c = 7 \implies c = 7 - \frac{15}{7} = \frac{34}{7} \)  

Coefficients: \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \), \( c = \frac{34}{7} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the coefficients \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \), \( c = \frac{34}{7} \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute coefficients back into the original equations and check if they hold.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Equation 1: \( a - b + c = 7 \):  
\( \frac{3}{7} - \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3}{7} + \frac{12}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \). Holds.  

Equation 2: \( 25a + 5b + c = 7 \):  
\( 25 \cdot \frac{3}{7} + 5 \cdot \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{75}{7} - \frac{60}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{75 - 60 + 34}{7} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \). Holds.  

Equation 3: \( 36a + 6b + c = 10 \):  
\( 36 \cdot \frac{3}{7} + 6 \cdot \left(-\frac{12}{7}\right) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{108}{7} - \frac{72}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{108 - 72 + 34}{7} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \). Holds.  

Coefficients are correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up a system of equations using the given points (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (completed: \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \), \( c = \frac{34}{7} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the vertex formula to find the x-coordinate (pending).  

Current Goal: Use the vertex formula to find the x-coordinate.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the vertex formula.  
How to Achieve: Apply the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) with \( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Vertex formula: \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
\( a = \frac{3}{7} \), \( b = -\frac{12}{7} \).  
\( x = -\frac{-\frac{12}{7}}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{7}} = \frac{\frac{12}{7}}{\frac{6}{7}} = \frac{12}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \).  

The x-coordinate of the vertex is \( 2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the x-coordinate of the vertex.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the quadratic equation and check if the resulting point lies on the parabola, or confirm symmetry using given points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Quadratic: \( y = \frac{3}{7}x^2 - \frac{12}{7}x + \frac{34}{7} \).  
At \( x = 2 \):  
\( y = \frac{3}{7}(2)^2 - \frac{12}{7}(2) + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{3}{7} \cdot 4 - \frac{24}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{12}{7} - \frac{24}{7} + \frac{34}{7} = \frac{12 - 24 + 34}{7} = \frac{22}{7} \).  

Alternatively, check symmetry: The points \((-1, 7)\) and \((5, 7)\) have the same y-coordinate, suggesting the vertex lies midway in x:  
\( \frac{-1 + 5}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \). This matches \( x = 2 \).  

The x-coordinate \( x = 2 \) is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is \( 2 \).
