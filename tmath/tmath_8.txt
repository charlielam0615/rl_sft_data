Goal of this step: Identify the type of function to determine the nature of its minimum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given function is $ 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $. This is a quadratic function in the form $ ax^2 + bx + c $, where $ a = 2 $, $ b = -12 $, and $ c = 3 $. Since $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards, and the function has a minimum value at its vertex.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the vertex formula for a quadratic function $ ax^2 + bx + c $ to find the value of $ x $ that minimizes the function.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The vertex of a quadratic function $ ax^2 + bx + c $ occurs at $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. For the given function $ 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $:  
- $ a = 2 $  
- $ b = -12 $  

Substitute into the vertex formula:  
$$
x = -\frac{-12}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
$$  
Thus, the value of $ x $ that gives the minimum value is $ 3 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the found value of $ x $ into the function to verify the minimum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = 3 $ into the function $ 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $:  
$$
2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 3 = 2(9) - 36 + 3 = 18 - 36 + 3 = -15
$$  
Thus, the minimum value of the function is $ -15 $ at $ x = 3 $.

[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $ 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $, we:  
1. Identified the function as quadratic in the form $ ax^2 + bx + c $, with $ a = 2 $, $ b = -12 $, and $ c = 3 $.  
2. Noted that since $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex gives the minimum value.  
3. Used the vertex formula $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $ to find the $ x $-value at the vertex.  
4. Substituted $ x = 3 $ into the function to calculate the minimum value, which was $ -15 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Function Type Verification**:  
   The function $ 2x^2 - 12x + 3 $ is a quadratic in the standard form $ ax^2 + bx + c $, with $ a = 2 > 0 $. This guarantees a minimum at the vertex. No issues detected.

2. **Vertex Formula Application**:  
   - Formula: $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $  
   - Substitution: $ x = -\frac{-12}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 $.  
   - Calculation is algebraically correct. No issues detected.

3. **Substitution Verification**:  
   - Substituted $ x = 3 $:  
     $ 2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 3 = 2(9) - 36 + 3 = 18 - 36 + 3 $.  
   - Step-by-step arithmetic:  
     $ 18 - 36 = -18 $, then $ -18 + 3 = -15 $.  
   - Final value $ -15 $ matches expectations for the minimum. No issues detected.

4. **Logical Consistency**:  
   - All steps align with quadratic function properties.  
   - No contradictory assumptions or errors in reasoning.  

Conclusion: All calculations and logical deductions are correct.
