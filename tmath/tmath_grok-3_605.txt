### Problem Restatement
Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning for a non-leap year (365 days). The outcomes determine his cereal choice as follows:
- If he rolls a composite number (4 or 6), he eats sweetened cereal.
- If he rolls a prime number (2, 3, or 5), he eats unsweetened cereal.
- If he rolls a 1, he rolls again until he gets a number other than 1, and then applies the above rules.
We need to find the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal. The Asymptote diagram appears unrelated to the probability problem, so we will focus on the probabilistic aspect.

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Break Down the Problem
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and sweetened cereal over 365 days, we break the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine the probability of eating unsweetened cereal on a given day.
2. Determine the probability of eating sweetened cereal on a given day.
3. Calculate the expected number of days for each cereal type over 365 days.
4. Compute the expected difference between these counts.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Analyze the Die Roll Probabilities
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the probability of eating unsweetened and sweetened cereal on a single day.  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify the outcomes of the die roll, accounting for rerolls when a 1 is rolled, and classify each outcome as prime (unsweetened) or composite (sweetened). Use probability theory to calculate the probabilities.

[IMP]
A fair six-sided die has outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, each with probability 1/6. If Bob rolls a 1, he rerolls until a non-1 outcome (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is obtained. We need the probabilities of the final outcomes after rerolls.

- **Outcomes and Classification**:
  - Prime numbers: {2, 3, 5} (unsweetened cereal).
  - Composite numbers: {4, 6} (sweetened cereal).
  - 1: Reroll until a non-1 is obtained.

- **Probability of Non-1 Outcome**:
  The probability of rolling a non-1 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is 5/6. If a 1 is rolled (probability 1/6), Bob rerolls, and this process repeats until a non-1 is obtained. The number of rolls follows a geometric distribution, but we are interested in the final non-1 outcome.

- **Conditional Probabilities**:
  Given a non-1 outcome, the die roll is equally likely among {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so each has probability:
  \[
  P(\text{outcome} = k \mid \text{non-1}) = \frac{1}{5} \quad \text{for} \quad k \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
  \]
  The unconditional probability of each outcome after rerolls accounts for the fact that we only consider the final non-1 roll. Since the reroll process ensures we eventually get a non-1, the probability of each outcome {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is:
  \[
  P(\text{final outcome} = k) = \frac{1}{5}, \quad k \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
  \]

- **Probability of Cereal Types**:
  - **Unsweetened cereal (prime: 2, 3, 5)**:
    \[
    P(\text{unsweetened}) = P(2) + P(3) + P(5) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{5}.
    \]
  - **Sweetened cereal (composite: 4, 6)**:
    \[
    P(\text{sweetened}) = P(4) + P(6) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5}.
    \]

Thus, on any given day, Bob eats unsweetened cereal with probability 3/5 and sweetened cereal with probability 2/5.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validate the Probability Calculations
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the probabilities for unsweetened and sweetened cereal.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the probabilities sum to 1 and consider an alternative method to confirm the results.

[IMP]
- **Sum of Probabilities**:
  \[
  P(\text{unsweetened}) + P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = 1.
  \]
  This confirms the probabilities cover all possible outcomes.

- **Alternative Method (Geometric Series)**:
  Consider the reroll process explicitly. The probability of rolling a 1 and rerolling is 1/6, and the probability of a non-1 is 5/6. The final outcome probabilities can be derived by considering the first non-1 roll. For outcome \( k \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \):
  - First roll is \( k \): probability = \( \frac{1}{6} \).
  - First roll is 1, second roll is \( k \): probability = \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \).
  - First roll is 1, second is 1, third is \( k \): probability = \( \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \).
  - And so on.

  The total probability for outcome \( k \):
  \[
  P(k) = \frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \cdots = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{1}{5}.
  \]
  This matches our earlier calculation. Thus:
  - \( P(\text{unsweetened}) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \).
  - \( P(\text{sweetened}) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \).

The calculations are consistent.

### Step 4: Organize Goals and Track Progress
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Compute the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and sweetened cereal in a non-leap year (365 days).
  - **Subgoal 1**: Determine the probability of eating unsweetened cereal on a given day (Completed: 3/5).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Determine the probability of eating sweetened cereal on a given day (Completed: 2/5).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Calculate the expected number of days for each cereal type over 365 days.
  - **Subgoal 4**: Compute the expected difference between these counts.
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the expected number of days for each cereal type over 365 days.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Calculate Expected Number of Days
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened and sweetened cereal over 365 days.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the probabilities from Step 2 and the number of days (365) to find the expected counts via the linearity of expectation.

[IMP]
Each day is an independent trial with:
- \( P(\text{unsweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} \).
- \( P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{2}{5} \).

Over 365 days, let:
- \( U \): Number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal.
- \( S \): Number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal.

Since each day is a Bernoulli trial:
- Expected number of unsweetened cereal days:
  \[
  E[U] = 365 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = 365 \cdot 0.6 = 219.
  \]
- Expected number of sweetened cereal days:
  \[
  E[S] = 365 \cdot \frac{2}{5} = 365 \cdot 0.4 = 146.
  \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Compute the Expected Difference
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the expected value of the difference \( U - S \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the linearity of expectation to find \( E[U - S] = E[U] - E[S] \).

[IMP]
The expected value of the difference is:
\[
E[U - S] = E[U] - E[S] = 219 - 146 = 73.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Review Past Information for Final Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the expected difference by recalling relevant calculations.  
- **Core Content**: Probabilities of cereal types and expected counts over 365 days.

[REVIEW]
- From Step 2: Probabilities are \( P(\text{unsweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} \), \( P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{2}{5} \).
- From Step 3: Validated probabilities sum to 1 and were confirmed via geometric series.
- From Step 5: Expected days are \( E[U] = 219 \), \( E[S] = 146 \).
- From Step 6: Expected difference is \( E[U - S] = 73 \).

These values are consistent across steps, confirming the calculations.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Final Verification
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm the expected difference is correct.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check the linearity of expectation and ensure all days are accounted for.

[IMP]
- **Linearity of Expectation**: Since \( U + S = 365 \) (every day results in either unsweetened or sweetened cereal), we verify:
  \[
  E[U] + E[S] = 219 + 146 = 365.
  \]
  This holds, confirming all days are accounted for.
- **Alternative Check**: The difference can be expressed per day:
  \[
  E[U - S] = 365 \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} - \frac{2}{5} \right) = 365 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = 73.
  \]
This matches our result, confirming correctness.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year is:

\[
\boxed{73}
\]
