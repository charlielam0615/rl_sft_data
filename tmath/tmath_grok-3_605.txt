### Problem Restatement
Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning for 365 days (a non-leap year). The outcomes determine his cereal choice:
- If he rolls a composite number (4 or 6), he eats sweetened cereal.
- If he rolls a prime number (2, 3, or 5), he eats unsweetened cereal.
- If he rolls a 1, he rolls again (and continues rolling until he gets a number other than 1).
We need to find the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal, i.e., \( E[U - S] \), where \( U \) is the number of days eating unsweetened cereal and \( S \) is the number of days eating sweetened cereal. The Asymptote diagram appears unrelated to the probability problem, so we will focus on the text.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( E[U - S] \), break the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine the probability of eating unsweetened cereal on a given day.
2. Determine the probability of eating sweetened cereal on a given day.
3. Calculate the expected number of days for unsweetened (\( E[U] \)) and sweetened (\( E[S] \)) cereal over 365 days.
4. Compute the expected difference \( E[U - S] \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the probability of eating unsweetened cereal on a given day.
How to Achieve: Since rolling a 1 leads to rerolling, compute the probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, or 5) after resolving all rerolls. Use conditional probability or a geometric series to account for rerolls.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A fair six-sided die has outcomes \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, each with probability \( \frac{1}{6} \). If Bob rolls a 1, he rerolls until getting a number from \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
- Probability of stopping on a roll (not rolling 1): \( P(\text{not 1}) = \frac{5}{6} \).
- Outcomes after stopping are \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, each equally likely, so \( P(\text{each outcome} \mid \text{not 1}) = \frac{1}{5} \).
- Unconditional probability of rolling outcome \( k \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \):
  \[
  P(\text{roll } k) = P(\text{stop on } k \mid \text{not 1}) \cdot P(\text{not 1}) = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}.
  \]
Alternatively, consider rerolls as a geometric series:
- Probability of rolling 1 repeatedly then rolling \( k \): \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{1}{5} \).
Prime numbers are \{2, 3, 5\}, so:
\[
P(\text{unsweetened}) = P(2) + P(3) + P(5) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the probability of eating sweetened cereal on a given day.
How to Achieve: Compute the probability of rolling a composite number (4 or 6) after resolving rerolls, using the probabilities derived previously.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Composite numbers are \{4, 6\}, so:
\[
P(\text{sweetened}) = P(4) + P(6) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5}.
\]
Alternatively, since outcomes \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} are equally likely after rerolls:
\[
P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{\text{Number of composite outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{2}{5}.
\]
Verify: \( P(\text{unsweetened}) + P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = 1 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( E[U - S] \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute probability of unsweetened cereal (\( \frac{3}{5} \), completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute probability of sweetened cereal (\( \frac{2}{5} \), completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate expected number of days for unsweetened (\( E[U] \)) and sweetened (\( E[S] \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( E[U - S] \).
Current Goal: Calculate expected number of days for unsweetened and sweetened cereal.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the expected number of days for unsweetened (\( E[U] \)) and sweetened (\( E[S] \)) cereal over 365 days.
How to Achieve: Use the probabilities from previous steps and the linearity of expectation for a binomial distribution over 365 independent trials.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each day is an independent trial:
- \( P(\text{unsweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} \), so \( E[U] = 365 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = 219 \).
- \( P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{2}{5} \), so \( E[S] = 365 \cdot \frac{2}{5} = 146 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the expected difference \( E[U - S] \).
How to Achieve: Use the linearity of expectation and the computed values of \( E[U] \) and \( E[S] \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
By linearity of expectation:
\[
E[U - S] = E[U] - E[S] = 219 - 146 = 73.
\]
Alternatively, for each day, define \( X_i = 1 \) if unsweetened, \( -1 \) if sweetened, 0 otherwise:
- \( P(X_i = 1) = \frac{3}{5} \), \( P(X_i = -1) = \frac{2}{5} \).
- \( E[X_i] = 1 \cdot \frac{3}{5} + (-1) \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{5} \).
- Over 365 days: \( E[U - S] = 365 \cdot E[X_i] = 365 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = 73 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the solution.
How to Achieve: Check calculations and ensure probabilities and expectations align with the problemâ€™s constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Probabilities: \( P(\text{unsweetened}) = \frac{3}{5} \), \( P(\text{sweetened}) = \frac{2}{5} \), sum to 1.
- Expected days: \( E[U] = 219 \), \( E[S] = 146 \), total 365 days.
- Alternative method (per-day difference) yields the same result: 73.
The calculations are consistent, and the Asymptote diagram does not appear to affect the probability computation.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is \( \boxed{73} \).
