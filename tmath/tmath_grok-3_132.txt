**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to evaluate \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\).  
Subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\sqrt{12}\).  
2. Apply the floor function to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\).  
3. Square the result to obtain \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\sqrt{12}\). This can be achieved by simplifying \(\sqrt{12}\) and, if necessary, estimating its numerical value to prepare for the floor function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{12}\):  
\(\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}\).  
To estimate numerically, note that \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), so:  
\(2\sqrt{3} \approx 2 \cdot 1.732 = 3.464\).  
Thus, \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the floor function to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\). Using the result from the previous step (\(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\)), determine the greatest integer less than or equal to this value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\), the floor function \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to 3.464, which is 3.  
Thus, \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to square the result of the floor function, i.e., compute \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\). Using the result from the previous step (\(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3\)), calculate \(3^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 3^2 = 9\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\sqrt{12}\) (completed: \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the floor function to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\) (completed: \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Square the result to obtain \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\) (completed: \(3^2 = 9\)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking the correctness of the computed value \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9\). Verify the steps by recomputing or analyzing the process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Recompute \(\sqrt{12}\): Since \(3^2 = 9\) and \(4^2 = 16\), \(\sqrt{12}\) is between 3 and 4 (closer to 3, as \(12\) is closer to \(9\)). Numerically, \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\).  
- Floor function: \(\lfloor 3.464 \rfloor = 3\), as 3 is the greatest integer less than or equal to 3.464.  
- Square: \(3^2 = 9\).  
The calculations are consistent, and the result \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9\) is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9\).
