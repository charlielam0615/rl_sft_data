**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\sqrt{12}\).  
2. Apply the floor function to \(\sqrt{12}\) to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\).  
3. Square the result to obtain \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\sqrt{12}\). This can be achieved by calculating the square root of 12, either exactly or approximately, to proceed with the floor function.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(\sqrt{12}\), note that \(12 = 4 \cdot 3\), so:  
\[
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}.
\]  
Since \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), we have:  
\[
\sqrt{12} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \approx 2 \cdot 1.732 = 3.464.
\]  
Thus, \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the floor function to \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\) to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\). This can be achieved by identifying the greatest integer less than or equal to 3.464.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\), the greatest integer less than or equal to 3.464 is 3. Thus:  
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3.
\]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to square the result, \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3\), to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\). This can be achieved by computing \(3^2\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 3^2 = 9.
\]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\sqrt{12}\) (completed: \(\sqrt{12} \approx 3.464\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the floor function to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor\) (completed: \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor = 3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Square the result to find \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2\) (completed: \(3^2 = 9\)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is completed, as \(\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9\).

### Final Answer
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{12} \rfloor^2 = 9
