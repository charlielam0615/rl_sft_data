### Problem Statement
We need to fully factor the expression \( 2x^2 - 8 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of factoring \( 2x^2 - 8 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify any common factors in the terms.  
2. Factor out the common factor, if any.  
3. Check if the resulting expression can be factored further (e.g., as a difference of squares).  
4. Verify the factored form is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify and factor out the common factor from \( 2x^2 - 8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the terms \( 2x^2 \) and \(-8\) for common factors, then apply the distributive property to factor them out.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression is \( 2x^2 - 8 \).  
- The term \( 2x^2 = 2 \cdot x^2 \), and \(-8 = -2 \cdot 4\).  
- The common factor between \( 2x^2 \) and \(-8\) is \( 2 \).  
- Factor out \( 2 \):  
  \( 2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Factor the expression \( x^2 - 4 \) further, if possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize \( x^2 - 4 \) as a difference of squares and apply the formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression \( x^2 - 4 \) can be written as \( x^2 - 2^2 \), which is a difference of squares.  
Using the formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), where \( a = x \) and \( b = 2 \):  
\( x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2) \).  
Thus, the full factorization so far is:  
\( 2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the factored form \( 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \) is correct and complete.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the factored expression and compare it to the original expression \( 2x^2 - 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \):  
- First, expand \( (x - 2)(x + 2) \):  
  \( (x - 2)(x + 2) = x \cdot x + x \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot x - 2 \cdot 2 = x^2 + 2x - 2x - 4 = x^2 - 4 \).  
- Multiply by \( 2 \):  
  \( 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8 \).  
The expanded form matches the original expression \( 2x^2 - 8 \), confirming the factorization is correct.  
Check for further factoring:  
- \( x - 2 \) and \( x + 2 \) are linear and cannot be factored further over the real numbers.  
- The coefficient \( 2 \) is a constant and cannot be factored further.  
Thus, the factorization \( 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \) is complete.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Fully factor \( 2x^2 - 8 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify and factor out the common factor (completed: factored out \( 2 \), resulting in \( 2(x^2 - 4) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Factor \( x^2 - 4 \) further (completed: recognized as \( (x - 2)(x + 2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factored form (completed: expanded to confirm equivalence to \( 2x^2 - 8 \)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal of factoring \( 2x^2 - 8 \) is complete, with the final factored form being \( 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The fully factored form of the expression \( 2x^2 - 8 \) is \( 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \).
