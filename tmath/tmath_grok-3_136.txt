**Problem Restatement**: The task is to fully factor the expression \(2x^2 - 8\).

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To fully factor the expression \(2x^2 - 8\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify common factors in the expression.  
2. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).  
3. Check if the resulting expression can be factored further.  
4. Verify the factored form is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify and factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from \(2x^2 - 8\).  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the terms \(2x^2\) and \(-8\) for common numerical and variable factors, then factor out the GCF.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is \(2x^2 - 8\).  
- The terms are \(2x^2\) and \(-8\).  
- Numerical factors: The GCF of 2 and 8 is 2.  
- Variable factors: Only \(2x^2\) contains \(x\), so no common variable factor exists beyond the constant.  
- Thus, the GCF of the expression is 2.  
Factor out the GCF:  
\[ 2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4) \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check if the expression \(x^2 - 4\) can be factored further.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize the form of \(x^2 - 4\) and apply appropriate factoring techniques, such as the difference of squares.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression inside the parentheses is \(x^2 - 4\).  
- This is a difference of squares, since \(x^2 - 4 = x^2 - 2^2\).  
- The difference of squares formula is \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).  
- Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = 2\), so:  
\[ x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2) \]  
- Combine with the GCF from Step 2:  
\[ 2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the factored form \(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\) is correct and complete.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the factored expression and compare it to the original expression \(2x^2 - 8\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\):  
- First, expand \((x - 2)(x + 2)\):  
\[ (x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 2x + 2x - 4 = x^2 - 4 \]  
- Then multiply by 2:  
\[ 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8 \]  
The expanded form matches the original expression \(2x^2 - 8\), confirming the factoring is correct.  
Check for further factoring:  
- \(x - 2\) and \(x + 2\) are linear and cannot be factored further over the real numbers.  
- The constant 2 is a scalar and cannot be factored further.  
Thus, \(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\) is the fully factored form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Fully factor the expression \(2x^2 - 8\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify common factors (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Factor out the GCF (completed in Step 2: \(2(x^2 - 4)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Factor the remaining expression (completed in Step 3: \(x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the factored form (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, main goal achieved).  
The final factored form is \(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The fully factored form of the expression \(2x^2 - 8\) is \(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\).
