**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of the piecewise function \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \), where:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x + 9 & \text{if } x < -2, \\
5 - 2x & \text{if } x \geq -2.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( f(3) \), break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies by checking the condition for \( x = 3 \).
2. Apply the appropriate function to compute \( f(3) \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine which piece of the function applies for \( x = 3 \).
How to Achieve: Compare \( x = 3 \) with the condition thresholds \( x < -2 \) and \( x \geq -2 \) to select the correct expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( x = 3 \), check the conditions:
- \( x < -2 \): \( 3 < -2 \) is false.
- \( x \geq -2 \): \( 3 \geq -2 \) is true.
Thus, the second piece, \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \), applies for \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( f(3) \) using the appropriate function.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the expression \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \) and calculate the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \):
\[
f(3) = 5 - 2 \cdot 3 = 5 - 6 = -1
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed value \( f(3) = -1 \).
How to Achieve: Re-check the condition for \( x = 3 \) and recompute the value to ensure consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-verify:
- Condition: \( x = 3 \geq -2 \), so use \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \).
- Calculation: \( f(3) = 5 - 2 \cdot 3 = 5 - 6 = -1 \).
The result is consistent with the previous computation.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \( f(3) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine which piece of the function applies for \( x = 3 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(3) \) using the appropriate function (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed).
Current Goal: The main goal is completed, with \( f(3) = -1 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = -1 \)
