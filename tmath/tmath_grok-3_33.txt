**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of the piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x + 9 & \text{if } x < -2, \\
5 - 2x & \text{if } x \geq -2.
\end{cases}
\]
at \( x = 3 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(3) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies by evaluating the condition for \( x = 3 \).  
2. Apply the appropriate function rule to compute \( f(3) \).  
3. Validate the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies for \( x = 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the condition \( x \geq -2 \) or \( x < -2 \) for \( x = 3 \), then select the corresponding function rule.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 3 \), evaluate the conditions:  
- \( x < -2 \): \( 3 < -2 \) is false.  
- \( x \geq -2 \): \( 3 \geq -2 \) is true.  
Thus, the function rule \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \) applies for \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(3) \) using the appropriate function rule.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \):  
\( f(3) = 5 - 2 \cdot 3 = 5 - 6 = -1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of \( f(3) = -1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the condition and computation to confirm the result is consistent with the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate the condition for \( x = 3 \):  
- \( 3 \geq -2 \), so \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \).  
Recompute: \( f(3) = 5 - 2 \cdot 3 = 5 - 6 = -1 \).  
The condition and calculation are consistent, confirming \( f(3) = -1 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies for \( x = 3 \). (Completed: \( x \geq -2 \), use \( f(x) = 5 - 2x \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(3) \) using the appropriate rule. (Completed: \( f(3) = -1 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result. (Completed: Calculation verified)  
**Current Goal**: Completed, as all subgoals are resolved, and \( f(3) = -1 \).

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = -1 \)
