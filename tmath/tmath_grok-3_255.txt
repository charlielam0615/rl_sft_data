**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation. The main goal is to find \( x \) that satisfies the equation. Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation by combining terms with the common denominator \( x+3 \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify the solution and check for restrictions (e.g., denominator cannot be zero).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation by combining terms with the common denominator \( x+3 \). This will be achieved by combining the fractions on the left-hand side and setting the result equal to the right-hand side.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since all terms have the same denominator \( x+3 \), combine the numerators on the left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{5x - 3}{x+3}.
\]  
The equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{5x - 3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the simplified equation \(\frac{5x - 3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\). This will be achieved by eliminating the denominators (if valid) and solving the resulting linear equation, while noting restrictions on \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since the denominators are identical and nonzero (i.e., \( x \neq -3 \)), multiply both sides by \( x+3 \):  
\[
5x - 3 = 1.
\]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[
5x = 4 \implies x = \frac{4}{5}.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking for consistency, ensuring the denominator is not zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) into the original equation:  
Left-hand side:  
\[
\frac{5 \cdot \frac{4}{5}}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } - \frac{3}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } = \frac{4}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } - \frac{3}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } = \frac{4 - 3}{ \frac{4}{5} + \frac{15}{5} } = \frac{1}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{5}{19}.
\]  
Right-hand side:  
\[
\frac{1}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } = \frac{1}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{5}{19}.
\]  
Both sides are equal, so \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) is valid. Check the denominator: \( x + 3 = \frac{4}{5} + 3 = \frac{19}{5} \neq 0 \), so no restrictions are violated.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( x \) in \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by combining terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed in Step 3, solution \( x = \frac{4}{5} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution and check restrictions (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution process, as all subgoals are complete and the solution is verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The solution to the equation is \( x = \frac{4}{5} \).
