**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \): \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation by combining terms with the common denominator \( x+3 \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Validate the solution by checking for restrictions and substituting back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation by combining terms with the common denominator \( x+3 \).  
How to Achieve: Since all terms share the denominator \( x+3 \), combine the numerators over the common denominator and set up a new equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation is \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\).  
Since all terms have the same denominator, combine the numerators:  
\[
\frac{5x - 3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}
\]
This simplifies the equation while maintaining its structure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the simplified equation \(\frac{5x - 3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\) for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Since the denominators are identical, equate the numerators and solve the resulting linear equation, considering any restrictions on \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \(\frac{5x - 3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\), since the denominators are the same and \( x+3 \neq 0 \) (implying \( x \neq -3 \)), equate the numerators:  
\[
5x - 3 = 1
\]
Add 3 to both sides:  
\[
5x = 4
\]
Divide by 5:  
\[
x = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Note the restriction: \( x \neq -3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the solution \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking the restriction.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) into \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\) and verify both sides are equal, ensuring \( x \neq -3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{4}{5} \) into the original equation:  
Left side:  
\[
\frac{5 \cdot \frac{4}{5}}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } - \frac{3}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } = \frac{4}{ \frac{4}{5} + \frac{15}{5} } - \frac{3}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{4}{ \frac{19}{5} } - \frac{3}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{4 - 3}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{1}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{5}{19}
\]
Right side:  
\[
\frac{1}{ \frac{4}{5} + 3 } = \frac{1}{ \frac{19}{5} } = \frac{5}{19}
\]
Since \(\frac{5}{19} = \frac{5}{19}\), the solution satisfies the equation.  
Check restriction: \( x = \frac{4}{5} \neq -3 \), so it is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \(\frac{5x}{x+3} - \frac{3}{x+3} = \frac{1}{x+3}\) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by combining terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the simplified equation (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 4).  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution process, as all subgoals are completed.  
The solution is \( x = \frac{4}{5} \), with the restriction \( x \neq -3 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( x = \frac{4}{5} \)
