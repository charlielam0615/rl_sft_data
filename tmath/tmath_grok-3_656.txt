### Problem Statement
We are given the binomial coefficients \(\binom{23}{3} = 1771\), \(\binom{23}{4} = 8855\), and \(\binom{23}{5} = 33649\), and we need to find \(\binom{25}{5}\). We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find \(\binom{25}{5}\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between binomial coefficients, such as \(\binom{n}{k}\) and \(\binom{n+1}{k}\).  
2. Derive a formula or method to compute \(\binom{25}{5}\) using the given values, particularly \(\binom{23}{5}\).  
3. Apply the method to calculate the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify a mathematical relationship to compute \(\binom{25}{5}\) using the given binomial coefficients. We will explore Pascal’s identity, which relates \(\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1}\), to express \(\binom{25}{5}\) in terms of coefficients with \(n=24\) or \(n=23\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pascal’s identity states:  
\[
\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1}
\]
To find \(\binom{25}{5}\), set \(n+1 = 25\) and \(k = 5\):  
\[
\binom{25}{5} = \binom{24}{5} + \binom{24}{4}
\]
Next, apply Pascal’s identity again for \(\binom{24}{5}\) and \(\binom{24}{4}\):  
- For \(\binom{24}{5}\), set \(n+1 = 24\), \(k = 5\):  
\[
\binom{24}{5} = \binom{23}{5} + \binom{23}{4}
\]
- For \(\binom{24}{4}\), set \(n+1 = 24\), \(k = 4\):  
\[
\binom{24}{4} = \binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{3}
\]
Since \(\binom{23}{5} = 33649\), \(\binom{23}{4} = 8855\), and \(\binom{23}{3} = 1771\) are given, we can use these to compute \(\binom{24}{5}\) and \(\binom{24}{4}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\binom{24}{5}\) and \(\binom{24}{4}\) using the given values and Pascal’s identity, then use these to find \(\binom{25}{5}\). We will substitute the known values into the equations derived in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \(\binom{24}{4}\):  
\[
\binom{24}{4} = \binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{3} = 8855 + 1771 = 10626
\]
Calculate \(\binom{24}{5}\):  
\[
\binom{24}{5} = \binom{23}{5} + \binom{23}{4} = 33649 + 8855 = 42504
\]
Now compute \(\binom{25}{5}\):  
\[
\binom{25}{5} = \binom{24}{5} + \binom{24}{4} = 42504 + 10626 = 53130
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of \(\binom{25}{5} = 53130\) by checking the calculations or using an alternative method, such as the binomial coefficient formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s validate by recomputing key steps:  
- Recheck \(\binom{24}{4}\): \(8855 + 1771 = 10626\). Correct.  
- Recheck \(\binom{24}{5}\): \(33649 + 8855 = 42504\). Correct.  
- Recheck \(\binom{25}{5}\): \(42504 + 10626 = 53130\). Correct.  

For further validation, compute \(\binom{25}{5}\) directly:  
\[
\binom{25}{5} = \frac{25!}{5! \cdot 20!} = \frac{25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 \cdot 21}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}
\]
Calculate the numerator:  
\[
25 \cdot 24 = 600, \quad 600 \cdot 23 = 13800, \quad 13800 \cdot 22 = 303600, \quad 303600 \cdot 21 = 6375600
\]
Denominator:  
\[
5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120
\]
So:  
\[
\frac{6375600}{120} = 53130
\]
This matches our result, confirming \(\binom{25}{5} = 53130\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current state.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(\binom{25}{5}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Derive a method using Pascal’s identity to relate \(\binom{25}{5}\) to known coefficients.  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute intermediate values \(\binom{24}{5}\) and \(\binom{24}{4}\) using given values.  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \(\binom{25}{5}\) by summing \(\binom{24}{5}\) and \(\binom{24}{4}\).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result using direct computation.  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \(\binom{25}{5} = 53130\) has been computed and validated.
