Goal of this step: Convert the given equation into the standard form of a circle.

The given equation is:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y
$$  
To convert this into the standard form of a circle, we need to rewrite it in the form:  
$$
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2
$$  
First, rearrange the equation:  
$$
x^2 - x + y^2 - 3y = 6.5
$$  
Next, complete the square for the $x$-terms and $y$-terms.  
For $x^2 - x$:  
$$
x^2 - x = \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{4}
$$  
For $y^2 - 3y$:  
$$
y^2 - 3y = \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{4}
$$  
Substitute these into the equation:  
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{4} + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{4} = 6.5
$$  
Simplify the constants on the left:  
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{10}{4} = 6.5
$$  
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 6.5 + \frac{10}{4}
$$  
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 6.5 + 2.5 = 9
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the radius from the standard form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the standard form of the circle:  
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 9
$$  
The right-hand side of the equation represents $ r^2 $, where $ r $ is the radius.  
So,  
$$
r^2 = 9 \Rightarrow r = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$  
Thus, the radius of the cookie is 3 units.

[REVIEW]
I am focusing on the completed subgoals:  
- The equation was rewritten into the standard form of a circle, resulting in:  
  $$
  \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 9
  $$  
- The radius was correctly identified as $ r = 3 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution, including algebraic manipulations, completing the square, and radius calculation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Original equation: x² + y² - 6.5 = x + 3y  
2. Rearranged equation: x² - x + y² - 3y = 6.5  
   - Verified: Correctly moved all terms to the left side.

3. Completing the square for x² - x:  
   - Half of -1 is -0.5, squared is 0.25.  
   - x² - x + 0.25 - 0.25 = (x - 0.5)² - 0.25  
   - Verified: Correct completion of the square.

4. Completing the square for y² - 3y:  
   - Half of -3 is -1.5, squared is 2.25.  
   - y² - 3y + 2.25 - 2.25 = (y - 1.5)² - 2.25  
   - Verified: Correct completion of the square.

5. Substituting into the equation:  
   - (x - 0.5)² - 0.25 + (y - 1.5)² - 2.25 = 6.5  
   - Combined constants: -0.25 - 2.25 = -2.5  
   - Final equation: (x - 0.5)² + (y - 1.5)² = 6.5 + 2.5 = 9  
   - Verified: Correct arithmetic and substitution.

6. Radius calculation:  
   - Standard form: (x - a)² + (y - b)² = r² → r² = 9 → r = 3  
   - Verified: Correct extraction of the radius.

All steps are logically consistent, mathematically sound, and free of arithmetic errors. The final radius calculation aligns with the derived standard form.
