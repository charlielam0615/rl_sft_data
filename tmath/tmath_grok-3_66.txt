### Problem Statement
We need to find the possible values of \( x \) for which the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) holds, and express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the quadratic inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \), break it into subgoals:  
1. Find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \) to identify critical points.  
2. Determine the intervals defined by these roots.  
3. Test each interval to find where the inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) is satisfied.  
4. Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \). This will be achieved by factoring the quadratic expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the roots, factor \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \):  
We need two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add to \(-7\) (the coefficient of \( x \)). These numbers are \(-1\) and \(-6\).  
Thus, the quadratic factors as:  
\[ x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0 \]  
The roots are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Using the roots \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \), define the intervals to test: \((-\infty, 1)\), \((1, 6)\), and \((6, \infty)\). The next subgoal is to test these intervals to determine where \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test the intervals \((-\infty, 1)\), \((1, 6)\), and \((6, \infty)\) to find where \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \). This will be achieved by selecting a test point in each interval and evaluating the quadratic expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) \) has roots at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \). Since the parabola opens upward (the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), the expression is negative between the roots. Test the intervals:  

- **Interval \((-\infty, 1)\)**: Choose \( x = 0 \).  
  \[ (0 - 1)(0 - 6) = (-1)(-6) = 6 > 0 \]  
  Not negative.  

- **Interval \((1, 6)\)**: Choose \( x = 3 \).  
  \[ (3 - 1)(3 - 6) = (2)(-3) = -6 < 0 \]  
  Negative, so this interval satisfies the inequality.  

- **Interval \((6, \infty)\)**: Choose \( x = 7 \).  
  \[ (7 - 1)(7 - 6) = (6)(1) = 6 > 0 \]  
  Not negative.  

Thus, the inequality holds in \((1, 6)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking the boundaries \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \) to confirm the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)) and the interval is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the boundary points:  
- At \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ (1 - 1)(1 - 6) = (0)(-5) = 0 \]  
  Since \( 0 \not< 0 \), \( x = 1 \) is not included.  
- At \( x = 6 \):  
  \[ (6 - 1)(6 - 6) = (5)(0) = 0 \]  
  Since \( 0 \not< 0 \), \( x = 6 \) is not included.  

The solution \((1, 6)\) is consistent, as the inequality is strict and holds only between the roots.

### Step 6

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) and express the solution in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the roots of \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \) (completed: roots are \( x = 1, 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine intervals \((-\infty, 1)\), \((1, 6)\), \((6, \infty)\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Test intervals to find where the inequality holds (completed: satisfied in \((1, 6)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution at boundaries (completed: \( x = 1, 6 \) not included).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express the solution in interval notation (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the solution to \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) in interval notation, based on the interval \((1, 6)\) where the inequality holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) is satisfied for \( x \) in the open interval \((1, 6)\). Thus, the solution in interval notation is:  
\[ (1, 6) \]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The possible values for \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) are \( (1, 6) \).
