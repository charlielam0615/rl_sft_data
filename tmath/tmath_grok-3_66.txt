### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \), break it into subgoals:  
1. Solve the corresponding quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \) to find the roots, which define the boundary points.  
2. Determine the intervals created by these roots.  
3. Test each interval to identify where the inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) holds.  
4. Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \) to find the roots. This will be achieved by factoring the quadratic expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Factor the quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 6 \):  
We need two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add to \(-7\) (the coefficient of \( x \)). These numbers are \(-1\) and \(-6\).  
Thus, \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) \).  
Set the equation to zero:  
\( (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0 \).  
The roots are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \).

### Step 3: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Using the roots \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \), the next subgoals are:  
1. Identify the intervals defined by the roots: \( (-\infty, 1) \), \( (1, 6) \), and \( (6, \infty) \).  
2. Test a point in each interval to determine where \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \).  
3. Combine the intervals where the inequality holds.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test the intervals \( (-\infty, 1) \), \( (1, 6) \), and \( (6, \infty) \) to determine where \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \). This will be achieved by substituting a test point from each interval into the expression \( (x - 1)(x - 6) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) \) changes sign at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \). Test each interval:  

- **Interval \( (-\infty, 1) \)**: Choose \( x = 0 \).  
  \( (0 - 1)(0 - 6) = (-1)(-6) = 6 > 0 \). The inequality does not hold.  

- **Interval \( (1, 6) \)**: Choose \( x = 2 \).  
  \( (2 - 1)(2 - 6) = (1)(-4) = -4 < 0 \). The inequality holds.  

- **Interval \( (6, \infty) \)**: Choose \( x = 7 \).  
  \( (7 - 1)(7 - 6) = (6)(1) = 6 > 0 \). The inequality does not hold.  

The inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) holds in the interval \( (1, 6) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking the behavior of the quadratic and the boundary points. This will be achieved by confirming the roots and testing the boundaries \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The quadratic is \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) \), with roots at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 6 \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (1), the parabola opens upward, so the expression is negative between the roots.  
Check boundary points:  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( (1 - 1)(1 - 6) = 0 \cdot (-5) = 0 \), which is not \( < 0 \).  
- At \( x = 6 \): \( (6 - 1)(6 - 6) = 5 \cdot 0 = 0 \), which is not \( < 0 \).  
This confirms the strict inequality \( < 0 \) holds only between the roots, in \( (1, 6) \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) and express the solution in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0 \) to find roots (completed: roots are \( x = 1, 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine intervals (\( (-\infty, 1) \), \( (1, 6) \), \( (6, \infty) \)) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Test intervals to find where the inequality holds (completed: holds in \( (1, 6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: confirmed \( (1, 6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express the solution in interval notation (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Express the solution in interval notation.

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the solution in interval notation. This will be achieved by stating the interval where the inequality holds, based on previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous steps, the inequality \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) holds in the interval \( (1, 6) \). Thus, the possible values for \( x \) are in the interval \( (1, 6) \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The possible values for \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0 \) are \( (1, 6) \).
