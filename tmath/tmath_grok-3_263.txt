**Problem Restatement**: We need to find positive integers \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \neq y \), such that \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \), and determine the smallest possible value of \( x + y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Transform the given equation to eliminate fractions.  
2. Find positive integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) where \( x \neq y \).  
3. Compute \( x + y \) for each solution and identify the smallest value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to transform the equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \) into a form that allows us to find integer solutions. Achieve this by combining the fractions on the left-hand side and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{y + x}{xy} \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{x + y}{xy} = \frac{1}{18} \]  
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:  
\[ x + y = \frac{xy}{18} \]  
Multiply both sides by 18:  
\[ 18(x + y) = xy \]  
Rearrange into standard form:  
\[ xy - 18x - 18y = 0 \]  
Add 324 to both sides to factorize:  
\[ xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324 \]  
This can be rewritten as:  
\[ (x - 18)(y - 18) = 324 \]  
Now we need to find positive integer pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy this equation, ensuring \( x \neq y \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find positive integer pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy \( (x - 18)(y - 18) = 324 \) and \( x \neq y \), then compute \( x + y \) to find the smallest sum. Achieve this by finding integer factor pairs of 324 and solving for \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation is:  
\[ (x - 18)(y - 18) = 324 \]  
Let \( a = x - 18 \) and \( b = y - 18 \), so:  
\[ a \cdot b = 324 \]  
Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, and \( x - 18 = a \), \( y - 18 = b \), we need \( x = a + 18 \geq 1 \), so \( a \geq -17 \), and similarly \( b \geq -17 \). Since \( a \cdot b = 324 \), we consider both positive and negative integer factor pairs of 324. The positive factor pairs of 324 are:  
\[ (1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27), (18, 18) \]  
Since \( x \neq y \), we exclude the case where \( x - 18 = y - 18 \) (i.e., \( a = b = 18 \), as it implies \( x = y \)). For each pair \( (a, b) \), compute \( x = a + 18 \), \( y = b + 18 \), and check if \( x \neq y \). Also consider negative factors, since \( a \cdot b = 324 \):  
\[ (-1, -324), (-2, -162), (-3, -108), (-4, -81), (-6, -54), (-9, -36), (-12, -27), (-18, -18) \]  

**Positive factor pairs**:  
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 324 \):  
  \( x = 1 + 18 = 19 \), \( y = 324 + 18 = 342 \), \( x + y = 19 + 342 = 361 \).  
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = 162 \):  
  \( x = 2 + 18 = 20 \), \( y = 162 + 18 = 180 \), \( x + y = 20 + 180 = 200 \).  
- \( a = 3 \), \( b = 108 \):  
  \( x = 3 + 18 = 21 \), \( y = 108 + 18 = 126 \), \( x + y = 21 + 126 = 147 \).  
- \( a = 4 \), \( b = 81 \):  
  \( x = 4 + 18 = 22 \), \( y = 81 + 18 = 99 \), \( x + y = 22 + 99 = 121 \).  
- \( a = 6 \), \( b = 54 \):  
  \( x = 6 + 18 = 24 \), \( y = 54 + 18 = 72 \), \( x + y = 24 + 72 = 96 \).  
- \( a = 9 \), \( b = 36 \):  
  \( x = 9 + 18 = 27 \), \( y = 36 + 18 = 54 \), \( x + y = 27 + 54 = 81 \).  
- \( a = 12 \), \( b = 27 \):  
  \( x = 12 + 18 = 30 \), \( y = 27 + 18 = 45 \), \( x + y = 30 + 45 = 75 \).  
- \( a = 18 \), \( b = 18 \):  
  \( x = 18 + 18 = 36 \), \( y = 18 + 18 = 36 \), but \( x = y \), so exclude this pair.  

**Negative factor pairs**:  
- \( a = -1 \), \( b = -324 \):  
  \( x = -1 + 18 = 17 \), \( y = -324 + 18 = -306 \), but \( y \) is negative, so exclude.  
- \( a = -2 \), \( b = -162 \):  
  \( x = -2 + 18 = 16 \), \( y = -162 + 18 = -144 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -3 \), \( b = -108 \):  
  \( x = -3 + 18 = 15 \), \( y = -108 + 18 = -90 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -4 \), \( b = -81 \):  
  \( x = -4 + 18 = 14 \), \( y = -81 + 18 = -63 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -6 \), \( b = -54 \):  
  \( x = -6 + 18 = 12 \), \( y = -54 + 18 = -36 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -9 \), \( b = -36 \):  
  \( x = -9 + 18 = 9 \), \( y = -36 + 18 = -18 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -12 \), \( b = -27 \):  
  \( x = -12 + 18 = 6 \), \( y = -27 + 18 = -9 \), exclude (negative \( y \)).  
- \( a = -18 \), \( b = -18 \):  
  \( x = -18 + 18 = 0 \), \( y = -18 + 18 = 0 \), exclude (non-positive and \( x = y \)).  

All negative factor pairs yield at least one negative or zero value for \( x \) or \( y \), so they are invalid. The valid pairs are:  
- \( (x, y) = (19, 342) \), sum = 361  
- \( (x, y) = (20, 180) \), sum = 200  
- \( (x, y) = (21, 126) \), sum = 147  
- \( (x, y) = (22, 99) \), sum = 121  
- \( (x, y) = (24, 72) \), sum = 96  
- \( (x, y) = (27, 54) \), sum = 81  
- \( (x, y) = (30, 45) \), sum = 75  

The smallest sum is 75 for \( (x, y) = (30, 45) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solution \( x = 30 \), \( y = 45 \) satisfies the original equation \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \) and confirm it yields the smallest \( x + y \). Achieve this by substituting the values into the equation and checking other solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 30 \), \( y = 45 \):  
\[ \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{45} = \frac{3}{90} + \frac{2}{90} = \frac{5}{90} = \frac{1}{18} \]  
The equation holds. Now, verify if 75 is the smallest sum by checking the sums from Step 3:  
- 361, 200, 147, 121, 96, 81, 75  
The smallest sum is indeed 75. To ensure completeness, note that factor pairs are symmetric (e.g., \( (a, b) = (12, 27) \) gives \( (x, y) = (30, 45) \), and \( (a, b) = (27, 12) \) gives \( (x, y) = (45, 30) \), which also sums to 75). No smaller positive integer solutions exist, as larger \( a \) values yield larger sums, and negative \( a \) values produce invalid (non-positive) results.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find positive integers \( x \neq y \) such that \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \) and minimize \( x + y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Transform the equation to eliminate fractions (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( x + y \) and identify the smallest sum (completed in Step 3).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution and present the final answer.
