### Problem Restatement
We need to find positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \neq y \) and \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \), and determine the smallest possible value of \( x + y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Derive an equation from \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \) to express the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).
2. Identify constraints: \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, and \( x \neq y \).
3. Find pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy the equation.
4. Compute \( x + y \) for each valid pair and identify the smallest value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Derive an equation from \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \).
Description: Combine the fractions on the left-hand side to form a single equation, then simplify to express the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18}
\]
Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{y + x}{xy}
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{x + y}{xy} = \frac{1}{18}
\]
Cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:
\[
18(x + y) = xy
\]
Rearrange into standard form:
\[
xy - 18x - 18y = 0
\]
Add 324 to both sides to complete the expression:
\[
xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324
\]
This can be factored as:
\[
(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324
\]
This equation will help find integer pairs \( (x, y) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find positive integer pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy \( (x - 18)(y - 18) = 324 \) and ensure \( x \neq y \).
Description: Identify the factor pairs of 324, compute corresponding \( x \) and \( y \), and verify they are positive integers satisfying all constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation is:
\[
(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324
\]
Let \( a = x - 18 \) and \( b = y - 18 \), so:
\[
a \cdot b = 324
\]
Then:
\[
x = a + 18, \quad y = b + 18
\]
Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, \( a + 18 > 0 \) and \( b + 18 > 0 \). Since 324 is positive, \( a \) and \( b \) can be positive or negative integers, but we need \( x \neq y \), so \( a + 18 \neq b + 18 \), implying \( a \neq b \).

Find the factor pairs of 324 (including negative pairs since \( a, b \) can be negative). The positive factor pairs of 324 (\( 324 = 2^2 \cdot 3^4 \)) are:
\[
(1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27), (18, 18)
\]
Negative pairs are:
\[
(-1, -324), (-2, -162), (-3, -108), (-4, -81), (-6, -54), (-9, -36), (-12, -27), (-18, -18)
\]
For each pair \( (a, b) \), compute \( x = a + 18 \), \( y = b + 18 \), and check if \( x \neq y \).

**Positive pairs:**
- \( (1, 324) \): \( x = 1 + 18 = 19 \), \( y = 324 + 18 = 342 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (2, 162) \): \( x = 2 + 18 = 20 \), \( y = 162 + 18 = 180 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (3, 108) \): \( x = 3 + 18 = 21 \), \( y = 108 + 18 = 126 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (4, 81) \): \( x = 4 + 18 = 22 \), \( y = 81 + 18 = 99 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (6, 54) \): \( x = 6 + 18 = 24 \), \( y = 54 + 18 = 72 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (9, 36) \): \( x = 9 + 18 = 27 \), \( y = 36 + 18 = 54 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (12, 27) \): \( x = 12 + 18 = 30 \), \( y = 27 + 18 = 45 \). \( x \neq y \).
- \( (18, 18) \): \( x = 18 + 18 = 36 \), \( y = 18 + 18 = 36 \). \( x = y \), so discard.

**Negative pairs:**
- \( (-1, -324) \): \( x = -1 + 18 = 17 \), \( y = -324 + 18 = -306 \). \( y < 0 \), so discard.
- Similarly, all negative pairs yield at least one negative \( x \) or \( y \), since \( -18 \leq a, b \leq -1 \), making \( x = a + 18 \leq 17 \), \( y = b + 18 \leq 17 \), but the paired factor (e.g., \( -324 + 18 = -306 \)) is negative.

Also consider pairs where one factor is negative, e.g., \( a = 1 \), \( b = -324 \):
- \( x = 1 + 18 = 19 \), \( y = -324 + 18 = -306 \). \( y < 0 \), so discard.
All such pairs produce at least one negative value.

Thus, valid pairs (from positive factors, excluding \( a = b \)) are:
\[
(19, 342), (20, 180), (21, 126), (22, 99), (24, 72), (27, 54), (30, 45)
\]
Since \( a \cdot b = 324 \), swapping \( a \) and \( b \) gives pairs like \( (342, 19) \), which weâ€™ll account for when computing sums.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the pairs satisfy \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \).
Description: Substitute each pair into the original equation to confirm correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test a few pairs to confirm:
- For \( (24, 72) \):
\[
\frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{72} = \frac{3 + 1}{72} = \frac{4}{72} = \frac{1}{18}
\]
- For \( (27, 54) \):
\[
\frac{1}{27} + \frac{1}{54} = \frac{2 + 1}{54} = \frac{3}{54} = \frac{1}{18}
\]
All pairs satisfy \( xy = 18(x + y) \), as derived, so they should hold. Spot-checking confirms the equation holds.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( x + y \) for each valid pair and find the smallest value.
Description: Sum \( x + y \) for each pair, including swapped pairs, and identify the minimum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \( x + y \):
- \( (19, 342) \): \( 19 + 342 = 361 \)
- \( (342, 19) \): \( 342 + 19 = 361 \)
- \( (20, 180) \): \( 20 + 180 = 200 \)
- \( (180, 20) \): \( 180 + 200 = 360 \)
- \( (21, 126) \): \( 21 + 126 = 147 \)
- \( (126, 21) \): \( 126 + 21 = 147 \)
- \( (22, 99) \): \( 22 + 99 = 121 \)
- \( (99, 22) \): \( 99 + 22 = 121 \)
- \( (24, 72) \): \( 24 + 72 = 96 \)
- \( (72, 24) \): \( 72 + 24 = 96 \)
- \( (27, 54) \): \( 27 + 54 = 81 \)
- \( (54, 27) \): \( 54 + 27 = 81 \)
- \( (30, 45) \): \( 30 + 45 = 75 \)
- \( (45, 30) \): \( 45 + 30 = 75 \)

The smallest sum is 75, from pairs \( (30, 45) \) and \( (45, 30) \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest possible value of \( x + y \) for positive integers \( x, y \) such that \( x \neq y \) and \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{18} \).
  - Subgoal 1: Derive an equation relating \( x \) and \( y \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Find valid integer pairs \( (x, y) \). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( x + y \) and identify the smallest sum. (Completed)
Current Goal: Confirm the smallest sum and finalize the answer.
The smallest sum identified is 75.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Goal: Confirm that no smaller sum is possible by checking constraints or missed pairs.
Description: Ensure all factor pairs of 324 were considered and constraints were met.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-evaluate factor pairs to ensure completeness. Since \( a \cdot b = 324 \), and \( x = a + 18 \), \( y = b + 18 \), we considered all positive factor pairs. Negative pairs were discarded, as they produced at least one negative \( x \) or \( y \). The constraint \( x \neq y \) eliminated \( (18, 18) \).

To double-check, note that \( x + y = (a + 18) + (b + 18) = a + b + 36 \). For smaller sums, \( a + b \) must be smaller. Since \( a \cdot b = 324 \), minimize \( a + b \):
- For \( a = 12 \), b = 27 \): \( a + b = 12 + 27 = 39 \), so \( x + y = 39 + 36 = 75 \).
- Smaller \( a \), e.g., \( a = 9 \), \( b = 36 \): \( 9 + 36 = 45 \), so \( x + y = 45 + 36 = 81 \).

No smaller \( a + b \) yields a smaller sum less than 75 while satisfying \( a \cdot b = 324 \). Thus, the minimum sum is 75 is confirmed.

### Final Answer
The smallest possible value for of \( x + y \) is \( \boxed{75} \).
