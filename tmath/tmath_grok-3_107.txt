**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other endpoint, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Recall the midpoint formula for a line segment.  
2. Set up equations using the given midpoint (1, -2) and one endpoint (4, 5).  
3. Solve for the coordinates of the other endpoint.  
4. Verify the solution by checking the midpoint.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review)  
Meta-data: Retrieve the midpoint formula, which relates the coordinates of the endpoints to the midpoint of a line segment.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The midpoint formula for a line segment with endpoints (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:  
Midpoint = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2).  
This formula will be used to set up equations for the unknown endpoint.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up and solve equations for the other endpoint using the midpoint formula.  
How to Achieve: Use the midpoint formula with the given midpoint (1, -2) and one endpoint (4, 5) to create equations for the unknown endpoint (x, y). Solve for x and y.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the other endpoint be (x, y). The midpoint is given as (1, -2), and one endpoint is (4, 5). Using the midpoint formula:  
((4 + x)/2, (5 + y)/2) = (1, -2).  

For the x-coordinate:  
(4 + x)/2 = 1  
4 + x = 2  
x = 2 - 4  
x = -2  

For the y-coordinate:  
(5 + y)/2 = -2  
5 + y = -4  
y = -4 - 5  
y = -9  

Thus, the other endpoint is (-2, -9).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that (-2, -9) is the correct endpoint by checking the midpoint.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the midpoint of the segment with endpoints (4, 5) and (-2, -9) and confirm it equals (1, -2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the midpoint of endpoints (4, 5) and (-2, -9):  
x-coordinate: (4 + (-2))/2 = 2/2 = 1  
y-coordinate: (5 + (-9))/2 = -4/2 = -2  
Midpoint = (1, -2), which matches the given midpoint.  
The solution is valid.
