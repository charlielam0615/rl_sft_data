**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other endpoint, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Recall the midpoint formula for a line segment.  
2. Use the midpoint formula with the given midpoint (1, -2) and endpoint (4, 5) to set up equations.  
3. Solve the equations to find the coordinates of the other endpoint.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review)  
Meta-data: Retrieve the midpoint formula, which relates the coordinates of the midpoint to the coordinates of the two endpoints.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The midpoint formula for a line segment with endpoints (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:  
((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2).  
This formula will be used to set up equations based on the given midpoint and known endpoint.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to set up and solve equations using the midpoint formula. Apply the formula with the midpoint (1, -2) and endpoint (4, 5) to find the other endpoint (x, y).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the midpoint (1, -2) and one endpoint (4, 5), let the other endpoint be (x, y). Using the midpoint formula:  
- For x-coordinate: (4 + x)/2 = 1  
- For y-coordinate: (5 + y)/2 = -2  

Solve for x:  
(4 + x)/2 = 1  
4 + x = 2  
x = 2 - 4  
x = -2  

Solve for y:  
(5 + y)/2 = -2  
5 + y = -4  
y = -4 - 5  
y = -9  

Thus, the other endpoint is (-2, -9).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify that (-2, -9) is the correct endpoint by checking if the midpoint of (4, 5) and (-2, -9) is (1, -2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the midpoint of endpoints (4, 5) and (-2, -9):  
- x-coordinate: (4 + (-2))/2 = 2/2 = 1  
- y-coordinate: (5 + (-9))/2 = -4/2 = -2  

The midpoint is (1, -2), which matches the given midpoint. The solution is valid.

[REVIEW]  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Find the other endpoint of the line segment.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the midpoint formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve equations using the midpoint formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  

Current goal: None, as the main goal is achieved. The other endpoint is (-2, -9).
