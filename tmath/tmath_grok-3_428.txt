**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the annual interest rate \( r \) (to the nearest hundredth) for a bank account that compounds annually, which is equivalent to a bank account with a 6% annual interest rate that compounds monthly.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to determine the equivalent annual interest rate \( r \) for an account with a 6% annual interest rate that compounds monthly. Letâ€™s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Understand the relationship between monthly compounding and annual compounding.  
2. Set up the formula for compound interest with monthly compounding.  
3. Set up the formula for equivalent annual compounding.  
4. Equate the two to solve for \( r \).  
5. Compute \( r \) and round to the nearest hundredth.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up the formulas for monthly and annual compounding and equate them to find \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the compound interest formula \( A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} \), where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), \( n \) is the number of compounding periods per year, and \( t \) is the time in years. For monthly compounding, \( n = 12 \), and for annual compounding, \( n = 1 \). Equate the growth factors over one year to find the equivalent annual rate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the monthly compounding account with a 6% annual interest rate (\( r = 0.06 \)), the interest rate per month is \( \frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \), and the number of compounding periods in one year is \( n = 12 \), \( t = 1 \). The growth factor over one year is:  
\[ (1 + \frac{0.06}{12})^{12} = (1 + 0.005)^{12} \]

For the equivalent annually compounding account with rate \( r \), the growth factor over one year (\( n = 1 \), \( t = 1 \)) is:  
\[ (1 + r) \]

Since the accounts are equivalent, their growth factors over one year must be equal:  
\[ (1 + 0.005)^{12} = 1 + r \]

Now, compute the left-hand side:  
\[ 1 + 0.005 = 1.005 \]  
\[ (1.005)^{12} \]

Calculate \( (1.005)^{12} \):  
\[ 1.005^{12} \approx 1.061677811864498 \]  
(Using a calculator for precision: \( 1.005^2 = 1.010025 \), \( 1.005^4 \approx 1.02015050 \), \( 1.005^8 \approx 1.04070722 \), \( 1.005^{12} \approx 1.061677811864498 \)).

Thus:  
\[ 1 + r = 1.061677811864498 \]  
\[ r = 1.061677811864498 - 1 = 0.061677811864498 \]

Convert \( r \) to a percentage:  
\[ r \approx 0.061677811864498 \times 100 = 6.1677811864498\% \]

To the nearest hundredth:  
\[ 6.1677811864498 \approx 6.17 \]

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated \( r \approx 6.17\% \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r = 0.0617 \) back into the annual compounding formula and compare the growth factor with the monthly compounding growth factor.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For annual compounding with \( r = 0.0617 \), the growth factor over one year is:  
\[ 1 + 0.0617 = 1.0617 \]

For monthly compounding with 6% annual rate:  
\[ (1.005)^{12} \approx 1.061677811864498 \]

Compare:  
\[ 1.0617 \approx 1.061677811864498 \]  
The values are very close, with a difference of approximately \( 0.000022188135502 \), which is negligible for practical purposes and confirms the calculation is correct to the nearest hundredth (6.17%).
