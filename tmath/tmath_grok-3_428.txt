### Problem Restatement
We need to find the equivalent annual interest rate \( r \) (to the nearest hundredth) for a bank account with a 6% annual interest rate that compounds monthly, such that it matches the growth of an account that compounds annually at rate \( r \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for the equivalent annual interest rate \( r \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Understand the formula for compound interest with monthly compounding.
2. Set up the equation for monthly compounding to match the annual compounding formula.
3. Solve for \( r \) using the equivalence.
4. Round the result to the nearest hundredth.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Derive the formula for monthly compounding and set it equal to the annual compounding formula to find \( r \).

**How to Achieve**: Use the compound interest formula \( A = P(1 + \frac{i}{n})^{nt} \) for monthly compounding, where \( i = 0.06 \), \( n = 12 \), and \( t = 1 \). Set this equal to the annual compounding formula \( A = P(1 + r) \), where \( t = 1 \), and solve for \( r \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The compound interest formula for an account with principal \( P \), annual interest rate \( i \), compounded \( n \) times per year over \( t \) years, is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{i}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

For monthly compounding with \( i = 0.06 \), \( n = 12 \), and \( t = 1 \):

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 1} = P \left(1 + 0.005\right)^{12} = P (1.005)^{12} \]

For annual compounding with rate \( r \) and \( t = 1 \):

\[ A = P (1 + r) \]

Since the final amounts must be equal after one year, set the two expressions equal (cancel \( P \), assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):

\[ (1.005)^{12} = 1 + r \]

Calculate \( (1.005)^{12} \):

\[ 1.005^{12} \]

Compute step-by-step:

\[ 1.005^2 = 1.010025 \]

\[ 1.005^4 = (1.010025)^2 \approx 1.02015050625 \]

\[ 1.005^8 = (1.02015050625)^2 \approx 1.04070715051 \]

\[ 1.005^{12} = 1.005^8 \cdot 1.005^4 \approx 1.04070715051 \cdot 1.02015050625 \approx 1.06167781186 \]

So:

\[ 1 + r = 1.06167781186 \]

\[ r = 1.06167781186 - 1 = 0.06167781186 \]

Convert to percentage:

\[ r \approx 0.06167781186 \cdot 100 = 6.167781186\% \]

To the nearest hundredth:

\[ 6.167781186 \approx 6.17 \]

Thus, \( r \approx 6.17\% \).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated equivalent annual interest rate \( r \approx 6.17\% \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r = 0.0617 \) back into the annual compounding formula and compare the growth with the monthly compounding formula over one year.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For monthly compounding with \( i = 0.06 \), \( n = 12 \), \( t = 1 \):

\[ A_{\text{monthly}} = P (1.005)^{12} \approx P \cdot 1.06167781186 \]

For annual compounding with \( r = 0.0617 \):

\[ A_{\text{annual}} = P (1 + 0.0617) = P \cdot 1.0617 \]

Compare:

\[ 1.06167781186 \approx 1.0617 \]

The values are extremely close, confirming the calculation. To ensure precision, compute the difference:

\[ 1.0617 - 1.06167781186 = 0.00002218814 \]

This difference is negligible (on the order of \( 10^{-5} \)), indicating the approximation is valid. Rounding to the nearest hundredth, \( r = 6.17\% \) is appropriate.
