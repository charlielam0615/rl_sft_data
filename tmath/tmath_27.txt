The given equation is $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$. 

We can combine the like terms $ax$ and $8x$ to get:
$$4x^2 + (a+8)x + 9 = 0$$

Goal of this step: Determine the condition for the quadratic equation to have only one solution (i.e., the discriminant must be zero).
[/PLANNING]

For a quadratic equation of the form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$, the discriminant is given by $D = B^2 - 4AC$. The equation has only one solution when $D = 0$.

In our case, $A = 4$, $B = (a+8)$, and $C = 9$.  
So the discriminant becomes:
$$D = (a+8)^2 - 4(4)(9)$$

We set $D = 0$ to find the values of $a$ that result in one solution:
$$
(a+8)^2 - 4(4)(9) = 0
$$
$$
(a+8)^2 - 144 = 0
$$
$$
(a+8)^2 = 144
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the resulting equation $ (a+8)^2 = 144 $ for $ a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We solve $ (a+8)^2 = 144 $ by taking the square root of both sides:  
$$
a+8 = \pm \sqrt{144}
$$  
$$
a+8 = \pm 12
$$  

This gives us two equations:  
1. $ a+8 = 12 $, which implies $ a = 4 $  
2. $ a+8 = -12 $, which implies $ a = -20 $  

The two values of $ a $ are $ 4 $ and $ -20 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Find the sum of the two values of $ a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The two values of $ a $ are $ 4 $ and $ -20 $.  

The sum of these values is:  
$$
4 + (-20) = -16
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Combining like terms**: The original equation $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$ was simplified to $4x^2 + (a+8)x + 9 = 0$. This is correct because $ax + 8x = (a+8)x$.

2. **Discriminant condition**: The discriminant of a quadratic $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$ is $B^2 - 4AC$. For one solution, the discriminant must equal zero. Here, $A = 4$, $B = (a+8)$, and $C = 9$. Substituting into the discriminant formula gives $(a+8)^2 - 4(4)(9) = (a+8)^2 - 144$. Setting this equal to zero is valid. 

3. **Solving $(a+8)^2 = 144$**: Taking square roots yields $a+8 = \pm 12$, leading to $a = 4$ and $a = -20$. These solutions are correct because $12^2 = 144$ and $(-12)^2 = 144$.

4. **Summing values**: $4 + (-20) = -16$. The arithmetic is correct.

All steps are logically sound and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
