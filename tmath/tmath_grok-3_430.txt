**Problem Restatement**: Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. We need to determine the minimum number of additional coins required so that each of the 12 friends receives at least one coin, and no two friends receive the same number of coins.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the minimum number of coins needed to give each of the 12 friends a different number of coins, starting with at least 1 coin per friend.  
2. Compare this with the 63 coins Alex currently has.  
3. Calculate the additional coins needed to meet the requirement.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the minimum number of coins required to give each of the 12 friends a different number of coins, starting with at least 1 coin per friend. This can be achieved by assigning the smallest possible distinct positive integers (1, 2, 3, ..., 12) to each friend and summing them to find the total coins needed.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To give each of the 12 friends a different number of coins, with each receiving at least 1 coin, assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 to the friends. The total number of coins required is the sum of these numbers:  
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 12 \]  
This is the sum of the first 12 positive integers, calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:  
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]  
For \( n = 12 \):  
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = \frac{156}{2} = 78 \]  
Thus, the minimum number of coins required is 78.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the additional coins needed by comparing the required coins (78) with the coins Alex has (63). This can be achieved by subtracting the number of coins Alex has from the required amount.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alex needs 78 coins to give each of the 12 friends a different number of coins (1, 2, ..., 12). He currently has 63 coins. The additional coins needed are:  
\[ 78 - 63 = 15 \]  
Thus, Alex needs 15 additional coins.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if 15 additional coins allow Alex to distribute a total of 78 coins (63 + 15) to the 12 friends, with each receiving a different number of coins starting from at least 1. This can be done by confirming the distribution and ensuring no two friends receive the same number of coins.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With 15 additional coins, Alex has:  
\[ 63 + 15 = 78 \text{ coins} \]  
Distributing these as 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 coins to the 12 friends uses exactly:  
\[ 1 + 2 + \dots + 12 = 78 \text{ coins} \]  
Each friend receives a unique number of coins (1 through 12), satisfying the condition that no two friends receive the same number. The solution is valid, as 78 coins are sufficient, and 63 coins alone would not be (since \( 1 + 2 + \dots + 11 = 66 \), which is still more than 63). Thus, 15 is the minimum number of additional coins needed.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs so each of the 12 friends receives a different number of coins, with at least 1 coin each.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the minimum number of coins required for 12 friends to each receive a different number of coins (Achieved: 78 coins).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compare the required coins with Alexâ€™s current coins to find the additional coins needed (Achieved: 15 coins).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by confirming the distribution meets all conditions (Achieved: Distribution of 1, 2, ..., 12 is valid).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to validate the solution, which has been completed. The main goal is now fully addressed.

**Final Answer**: Alex needs a minimum of **15 additional coins** to give each of his 12 friends a different number of coins, with each receiving at least 1 coin.
