### Problem Restatement
Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. We need to determine the minimum number of additional coins required so that Alex can distribute at least one coin to each friend, with no two friends receiving the same number of coins. This implies each friend must receive a unique number of coins, and we must minimize the additional coins needed beyond the 63 Alex already has.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the minimum number of coins needed to give each of the 12 friends a unique number of coins, starting from at least 1 coin each.  
2. Compare this total with the 63 coins Alex has to find the additional coins required.  
3. Ensure the distribution satisfies the condition that no two friends receive the same number of coins.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the minimum total number of coins needed to give each of the 12 friends a unique number of coins, starting with at least 1 coin each.  
- **How to Achieve**: Assume the smallest possible unique numbers of coins are used, starting from 1 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., 12). Compute the sum of these numbers to find the minimum total coins required.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To minimize the total number of coins, assign the smallest possible unique positive integers to the 12 friends: 1, 2, 3, ..., 12.  
Calculate the sum of the first 12 positive integers using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:  
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]  
For \( n = 12 \):  
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = \frac{156}{2} = 78 \]  
Thus, the minimum number of coins needed is 78.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the additional coins needed by comparing the required coins (78) with the coins Alex has (63).  
- **How to Achieve**: Subtract the number of coins Alex has from the minimum number required to find the additional coins needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The minimum number of coins needed is 78 (from Step 2). Alex has 63 coins.  
Calculate the additional coins required:  
\[ 78 - 63 = 15 \]  
Thus, Alex needs at least 15 additional coins.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that distributing 78 coins as 1, 2, ..., 12 to the 12 friends satisfies the problem and that 15 additional coins is the minimum.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check that the distribution gives each friend a unique number of coins and confirm no smaller total (closer to 63) is possible.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Verification of Distribution**: Assigning 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 coins to the 12 friends ensures each receives a unique number of coins, satisfying the condition. The total is 78 coins, as calculated.  
- **Minimality Check**: To use fewer than 78 coins, try a different set of 12 unique positive integers. The smallest sum comes from consecutive integers starting at 1 (1 to 12). Any other set, e.g., 2, 3, ..., 13 (skipping 1), gives:  
  \[ \text{Sum} = \frac{13 \cdot 14}{2} - 1 = 91 - 1 = 90 \]  
  This is larger than 78. Starting with numbers greater than 1 or non-consecutive numbers increases the sum further. Thus, 78 is the minimum total.  
- **Additional Coins**: Since 78 coins are needed and Alex has 63, the additional coins required are \( 78 - 63 = 15 \). If Alex had only 14 additional coins, the total would be \( 63 + 14 = 77 \), which is less than 78 and cannot be distributed as 12 unique positive integers (since the minimum sum for 12 unique numbers is 78).  
Therefore, 15 additional coins is the minimum.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs to give each of his 12 friends at least one coin, with no two friends receiving the same number.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the minimum total coins needed for 12 unique distributions (achieved: 78 coins).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine additional coins by comparing with Alexâ€™s 63 coins (achieved: 15 coins).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution ensures unique distributions and minimality (achieved: confirmed 15 is minimal).  

**Current Goal**: The problem is solved, as all subgoals are achieved, and the solution (15 additional coins) is validated.

### Final Answer
Alex needs a minimum of **15 additional coins** to give each of his 12 friends at least one coin, with no two friends receiving the same number of coins.
