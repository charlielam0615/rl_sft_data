**Problem Statement**: Find the y-coordinate of the point on the y-axis that is equidistant from points \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(-1, 4) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the y-coordinate of the point on the y-axis equidistant from points \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(-1, 4) \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Define the point on the y-axis as \( (0, y) \).  
2. Set up the condition for equidistance by equating the distances from \( (0, y) \) to \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(-1, 4) \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation to find the y-coordinate.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up the equidistance condition by calculating the distances from the point \( (0, y) \) on the y-axis to points \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(-1, 4) \), and equating them.  
How to Achieve: Use the distance formula to compute the distances \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \) for each pair, set them equal, and simplify the equation.

[IMP]  
Let the point on the y-axis be \( (0, y) \).  
- Distance from \( (0, y) \) to \( A(-2, 0) \):  
  \( \sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4 + y^2} \)  
- Distance from \( (0, y) \) to \( B(-1, 4) \):  
  \( \sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (y - 4)^2} = \sqrt{1 + (y - 4)^2} \)  

Since the point is equidistant, set the distances equal:  
\( \sqrt{4 + y^2} = \sqrt{1 + (y - 4)^2} \)  

To eliminate the square roots, square both sides:  
\( 4 + y^2 = 1 + (y - 4)^2 \)  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\( 4 + y^2 = 1 + y^2 - 8y + 16 \)  
Simplify:  
\( 4 + y^2 = y^2 - 8y + 17 \)  
Subtract \( y^2 \) from both sides:  
\( 4 = -8y + 17 \)  
Solve for \( y \):  
\( 8y = 17 - 4 \)  
\( 8y = 13 \)  
\( y = \frac{13}{8} \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the point \( (0, \frac{13}{8}) \) is equidistant from \( A(-2, 0) \) and \( B(-1, 4) \).  
How to Achieve: Compute the distances from \( (0, \frac{13}{8}) \) to both points and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the distance from \( (0, \frac{13}{8}) \) to \( A(-2, 0) \):  
\( \sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + \left(\frac{13}{8} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \left(\frac{13}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{169}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{256}{64} + \frac{169}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{425}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{425}}{8} \)  

Compute the distance from \( (0, \frac{13}{8}) \) to \( B(-1, 4) \):  
\( \sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + \left(\frac{13}{8} - 4\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{13}{8} - \frac{32}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{-19}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{361}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64} + \frac{361}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{425}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{425}}{8} \)  

Both distances are equal, confirming the solution is correct.
