**Problem Statement**: Find the $y$-coordinate of the point on the $y$-axis that is equidistant from points $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the point on the $y$-axis, which has the form $(0, y)$.  
2. Set up the condition for equidistance by equating the distances from this point to $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$.  
3. Solve the resulting equation to find the $y$-coordinate.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation for the point $(0, y)$ that is equidistant from $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$. This will be achieved by using the distance formula to equate the distances and solving for $y$.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The point on the $y$-axis is $(0, y)$. Using the distance formula:  
- Distance from $(0, y)$ to $A(-2, 0)$:  
  $\sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4 + y^2}$  
- Distance from $(0, y)$ to $B(-1, 4)$:  
  $\sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (y - 4)^2} = \sqrt{1 + (y - 4)^2}$  

Since the point is equidistant, set the distances equal:  
$\sqrt{4 + y^2} = \sqrt{1 + (y - 4)^2}$  

Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:  
$4 + y^2 = 1 + (y - 4)^2$  

Expand the right-hand side:  
$4 + y^2 = 1 + y^2 - 8y + 16$  

Simplify:  
$4 + y^2 = y^2 - 8y + 17$  
$4 = -8y + 17$  
$-13 = -8y$  
$y = \frac{13}{8}$  

The $y$-coordinate is $\frac{13}{8}$.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the point $(0, \frac{13}{8})$ is equidistant from $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$ by computing the distances and checking if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the distance from $(0, \frac{13}{8})$ to $A(-2, 0)$:  
$\sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + \left(\frac{13}{8} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \left(\frac{13}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{169}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{256}{64} + \frac{169}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{425}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{425}}{8}$  

Compute the distance from $(0, \frac{13}{8})$ to $B(-1, 4)$:  
$4 = \frac{32}{8}$, so $y - 4 = \frac{13}{8} - \frac{32}{8} = -\frac{19}{8}$.  
$\sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + \left(\frac{13}{8} - 4\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(-\frac{19}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{361}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64} + \frac{361}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{425}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{425}}{8}$  

Both distances are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the $y$-coordinate of the point on the $y$-axis equidistant from $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the point on the $y$-axis as $(0, y)$.  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the equidistance condition using the distance formula.  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find $y$.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution by checking distances.  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align with the problem's requirements. The $y$-coordinate $\frac{13}{8}$ was found and validated.

**Final Answer**: The $y$-coordinate of the point on the $y$-axis that is equidistant from points $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(-1, 4)$ is $\frac{13}{8}$.
