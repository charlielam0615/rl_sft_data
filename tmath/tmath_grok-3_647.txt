**Problem Statement**: Determine the value of the binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\) for any positive integer \(n\), and express the answer in terms of \(n\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the definition of the binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\).  
2. Apply the definition to compute \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\).  
3. Simplify the expression to express the result in terms of \(n\).

### Step 2: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the definition of the binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\) to serve as the foundation for computing \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items without regard to order. It is defined as:  
\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]  
This formula will be used to compute \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\) using the binomial coefficient formula. This will be achieved by substituting \(k = n-1\) into the formula \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the binomial coefficient formula:  
\[
\dbinom{n}{n-1} = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!(n-(n-1))!} = \frac{n!}{(n-1)! \cdot 1!}
\]  
Since \(1! = 1\), this simplifies to:  
\[
\dbinom{n}{n-1} = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!}
\]  
Rewrite \(n! = n \cdot (n-1)!\):  
\[
\dbinom{n}{n-1} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1)!}{(n-1)!} = n
\]  
Thus, \(\dbinom{n}{n-1} = n\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(\dbinom{n}{n-1} = n\) is correct by checking the computation and considering alternative methods or examples.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, consider an alternative interpretation: \(\dbinom{n}{n-1}\) represents the number of ways to choose \(n-1\) items from \(n\), which is equivalent to choosing 1 item from \(n\) (since \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}\)). Thus:  
\[
\dbinom{n}{n-1} = \dbinom{n}{1} = \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1)!}{(n-1)!} = n
\]  
Additionally, test with specific values:  
- For \(n=1\), \(\dbinom{1}{0} = \frac{1!}{0!1!} = 1\).  
- For \(n=2\), \(\dbinom{2}{1} = \frac{2!}{1!1!} = 2\).  
- For \(n=3\), \(\dbinom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3\).  
These confirm that \(\dbinom{n}{n-1} = n\).
