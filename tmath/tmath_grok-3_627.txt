### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six six-sided dice.
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where all six dice show distinct numbers.
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
4. Express the probability as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six six-sided dice.

**How to Achieve**: Each die has 6 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 6). Since the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes is found by multiplying the number of outcomes for each die.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each of the six dice can land on any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Thus, the total number of possible outcomes is:

\[ 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 6^6 \]

Calculate \( 6^6 \):

\[ 6^2 = 36 \]
\[ 6^3 = 36 \times 6 = 216 \]
\[ 6^4 = 216 \times 6 = 1296 \]
\[ 6^5 = 1296 \times 6 = 7776 \]
\[ 6^6 = 7776 \times 6 = 46656 \]

So, the total number of possible outcomes is 46,656.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where all six dice show distinct numbers.

**How to Achieve**: Since the numbers must be distinct, each die must show a different number from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The order of the dice matters (each die is distinct), so we calculate the number of permutations of 6 distinct numbers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To get six distinct numbers, the first die can be any of the 6 numbers, the second die must be one of the remaining 5 numbers, the third die one of the remaining 4 numbers, and so on. This is the number of permutations of 6 numbers:

\[ 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \]

Calculate \( 6! \):

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]
\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \]
\[ 120 \times 3 = 360 \]
\[ 360 \times 2 = 720 \]
\[ 720 \times 1 = 720 \]

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 720.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

**How to Achieve**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, the total number of possible outcomes is 46,656.
From Step 3, the number of favorable outcomes is 720.

The probability is:

\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{720}{46656} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for total and favorable outcomes and ensure the probability is correctly computed.

**How to Achieve**: Recheck the calculations for \( 6^6 \) and \( 6! \), and simplify the fraction if possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute total outcomes:

\[ 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 46656 \] (confirmed).

Recompute favorable outcomes:

\[ 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \] (confirmed).

The fraction is:

\[ \frac{720}{46656} \]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 720 and 46,656. First, factorize:

- \( 720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 \)
- \( 46656 = 6^6 = (2 \times 3)^6 = 2^6 \times 3^6 \)

GCD is:

\[ \text{GCD} = 2^4 \times 3^2 = 16 \times 9 = 144 \]

Divide numerator and denominator by 144:

\[ \frac{720 \div 144}{46656 \div 144} = \frac{5}{324} \]

Check if \( \frac{5}{324} \) can be simplified further: 5 is prime, and 324 = \( 2^2 \times 3^4 \), so they share no common factors. The fraction is in its simplest form.
