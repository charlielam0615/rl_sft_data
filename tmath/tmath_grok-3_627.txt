**Problem Statement**: Calculate the probability of rolling six standard, six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers, expressing the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six six-sided dice.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where all six dice show distinct numbers.  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
4. Express the result as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six six-sided dice.  
How to Achieve: Each die has 6 faces, and there are 6 dice rolled independently. The total number of outcomes is 6 raised to the power of 6.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the total outcomes:  
Each die has 6 possible outcomes, and there are 6 dice. Thus, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
\( 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 46656 \).  
So, the total number of possible outcomes is 46656.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where all six dice show distinct numbers.  
How to Achieve: Since the dice are distinct and we need six different numbers from 1 to 6, compute the number of ways to assign six unique numbers to the six dice, considering the order of the dice matters.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To get six distinct numbers, the first die can show any of the 6 numbers, the second die must show a different number (5 choices), the third die a different number from the first two (4 choices), and so on. This is the number of permutations of 6 numbers:  
\( 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \).  
Thus, there are 720 favorable outcomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculations for total and favorable outcomes.  
How to Achieve: Verify the calculations for \( 6^6 \) and \( 6! \) to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify total outcomes:  
\( 6^6 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 \).  
Calculate step-by-step: \( 6^2 = 36 \), \( 6^3 = 36 \times 6 = 216 \), \( 6^4 = 216 \times 6 = 1296 \), \( 6^5 = 1296 \times 6 = 7776 \), \( 6^6 = 7776 \times 6 = 46656 \). Correct.  
Verify favorable outcomes:  
\( 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \).  
Calculate: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \), \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \), \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \), \( 360 \times 2 = 720 \), \( 720 \times 1 = 720 \). Correct.  
Both calculations are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of favorable outcomes (720) by the total number of outcomes (46656) to find the probability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:  
\( \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{720}{46656} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the probability as a common fraction.  
How to Achieve: Simplify the fraction \( \frac{720}{46656} \) by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Simplify \( \frac{720}{46656} \):  
First, find the GCD of 720 and 46656.  
Factorize:  
- \( 720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \).  
- \( 46656 = 6^6 = (2 \times 3)^6 = 2^6 \times 3^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \).  
Common factors: \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).  
GCD = \( 2^4 \times 3^2 = 16 \times 9 = 144 \).  
Divide numerator and denominator by 144:  
- Numerator: \( 720 \div 144 = 5 \).  
- Denominator: \( 46656 \div 144 = 324 \).  
Thus, \( \frac{720}{46656} = \frac{5}{324} \).  
Check if \( \frac{5}{324} \) is in simplest form: 5 is prime, and 324 = \( 2^2 \times 3^4 \), so they share no common factors other than 1. The fraction is simplified.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability of rolling six distinct numbers with six six-sided dice and express as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total possible outcomes (completed: 46656).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate favorable outcomes (completed: 720).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute probability as a ratio (completed: \( \frac{720}{46656} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express as a common fraction (completed: \( \frac{5}{324} \)).

[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability of rolling six standard, six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers is \( \frac{5}{324} \).
