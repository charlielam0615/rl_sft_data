We need to completely factor the expression \[(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\].

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to factor the expression completely:  
1. Simplify the given expression by handling the subtraction and combining like terms.  
2. Factor the resulting polynomial.  
3. Check if the factored form can be factored further to achieve complete factorization.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given expression by handling the subtraction and combining like terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Distribute the negative sign across the second polynomial and combine like terms based on the powers of \(a\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the expression:  
\[
(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)
\]

Distribute the negative sign:  
\[
= 6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7 + 7a^3 - a^2 + 7
\]

Combine like terms:  
- For \(a^3\): \(6a^3 + 7a^3 = 13a^3\)  
- For \(a^2\): \(92a^2 - a^2 = 91a^2\)  
- For the constant terms: \(-7 + 7 = 0\)

The simplified expression is:  
\[
13a^3 + 91a^2
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the simplified expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the simplification to ensure no errors in combining like terms and check if the result aligns with the original expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the simplification:  
Original: \((6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\)  
Distribute: \(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7 + 7a^3 - a^2 + 7\)  
Combine:  
- \(a^3\) terms: \(6a^3 + 7a^3 = 13a^3\)  
- \(a^2\) terms: \(92a^2 - a^2 = 91a^2\)  
- Constants: \(-7 + 7 = 0\)  

Result: \(13a^3 + 91a^2\), which matches the previous step.  

To further validate, substitute \(a = 1\):  
- Original: \((6(1)^3 + 92(1)^2 - 7) - (-7(1)^3 + 1^2 - 7) = (6 + 92 - 7) - (-7 + 1 - 7) = 91 - (-13) = 104\)  
- Simplified: \(13(1)^3 + 91(1)^2 = 13 + 91 = 104\)  
The values match, confirming the simplification is correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Factor the simplified expression \(13a^3 + 91a^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify common factors and factor the polynomial, checking for further factorization.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression is:  
\[
13a^3 + 91a^2
\]

Factor out the greatest common factor:  
- Both terms have \(a^2\) and a common factor of 13 (since \(13 \cdot 7 = 91\)).  
\[
13a^3 + 91a^2 = 13a^2(a + 7)
\]

Verify the factorization:  
Distribute \(13a^2(a + 7) = 13a^2 \cdot a + 13a^2 \cdot 7 = 13a^3 + 91a^2\), which matches the expression.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check if the factored form \(13a^2(a + 7)\) can be factored further.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze each factor to determine if it can be broken down further.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The factored expression is \(13a^2(a + 7)\).  
- \(13\) is a prime number and cannot be factored further.  
- \(a^2 = a \cdot a\), which is fully factored as a single variable.  
- \(a + 7\) is a linear polynomial. Check if it can be factored over the real numbers by finding roots:  
  Set \(a + 7 = 0 \implies a = -7\). This is a single real root, so \(a + 7\) is irreducible over the reals.  

Thus, \(13a^2(a + 7)\) is the complete factorization over the real numbers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Completely factor the expression \((6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by combining like terms (completed: \(13a^3 + 91a^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Factor the simplified expression (completed: \(13a^2(a + 7)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factorization is complete (completed: \(13\), \(a^2\), and \(a + 7\) are irreducible).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the expression is fully factored.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The completely factored form of the expression is:  
\[
\boxed{13a^2(a + 7)}
\]
