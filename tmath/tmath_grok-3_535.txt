**Problem Statement**: Completely factor the expression \[(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\].

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of factoring the expression into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given expression by removing the parentheses and combining like terms.  
2. Factor the resulting polynomial completely.  
3. Verify the factorization.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given expression by removing the parentheses and combining like terms.  
**How to Achieve**: Distribute the negative sign across the second polynomial, combine like terms by adding or subtracting coefficients of matching powers of \(a\), and simplify to obtain a single polynomial.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the expression:  
\[(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\]  

Distribute the negative sign:  
\[6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7 + 7a^3 - a^2 + 7\]  

Combine like terms:  
- For \(a^3\): \(6a^3 + 7a^3 = 13a^3\)  
- For \(a^2\): \(92a^2 - a^2 = 91a^2\)  
- For constants: \(-7 + 7 = 0\)  

The simplified expression is:  
\[13a^3 + 91a^2\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Factor the simplified polynomial \(13a^3 + 91a^2\) completely.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify common factors in the polynomial, factor them out, and check if the resulting expression can be factored further.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The polynomial is:  
\[13a^3 + 91a^2\]  

Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF):  
- Both terms share a common factor of \(a^2\).  
- The coefficients 13 and 91 have a GCF of 13 (since \(91 = 13 \times 7\)).  
- Thus, the GCF of the polynomial is \(13a^2\).  

Factor out \(13a^2\):  
\[13a^3 + 91a^2 = 13a^2(a + 7)\]  

Check if further factoring is possible:  
- \(13a^2\) is fully factored (13 is prime, \(a^2\) is a power).  
- The binomial \((a + 7)\) is linear and cannot be factored further over the real numbers.  

The factored form is:  
\[13a^2(a + 7)\]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the factorization \(13a^2(a + 7)\) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the factored expression and check if it matches the simplified polynomial \(13a^3 + 91a^2\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the factored expression:  
\[13a^2(a + 7) = 13a^2 \cdot a + 13a^2 \cdot 7 = 13a^3 + 91a^2\]  

This matches the simplified polynomial \(13a^3 + 91a^2\).  
The factorization is correct.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Completely factor the expression \[(6a^3 + 92a^2 - 7) - (-7a^3 + a^2 - 7)\].  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression by removing parentheses and combining like terms (completed: \(13a^3 + 91a^2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Factor the simplified polynomial completely (completed: \(13a^2(a + 7)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the factorization (completed: factorization verified).  

**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The factorization \(13a^2(a + 7)\) is the final result.

**Final Answer**:  
The completely factored form of the expression is:  
\[ \boxed{13a^2(a + 7)} \]
