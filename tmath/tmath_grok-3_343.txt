### Problem Statement
A school bus starts with 48 students. At each of the first three stops, one-half of the students on the bus get off. We need to determine how many students remain on the bus after the third stop.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the number of students remaining after each stop.  
- Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of students after the first stop.  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of students after the second stop.  
- Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of students after the third stop.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the first stop. Start with 48 students, and since one-half get off, divide the number of students by 2 to find the remaining students.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Initially, there are 48 students on the bus. At the first stop, one-half of the students get off, which means 48 ÷ 2 = 24 students get off. Therefore, the number of students remaining is 48 − 24 = 24.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the second stop. Using the result from the first stop (24 students), divide by 2 to find the number of students who get off and subtract to find those remaining.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After the first stop, there are 24 students on the bus. At the second stop, one-half of these students get off, which is 24 ÷ 2 = 12 students. Therefore, the number of students remaining is 24 − 12 = 12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the third stop. Using the result from the second stop (12 students), divide by 2 to find the number of students who get off and subtract to find those remaining.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After the second stop, there are 12 students on the bus. At the third stop, one-half of these students get off, which is 12 ÷ 2 = 6 students. Therefore, the number of students remaining is 12 − 6 = 6.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of students remaining on the bus after the third stop.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate students remaining after the first stop (completed: 24 students).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate students remaining after the second stop (completed: 12 students).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate students remaining after the third stop (completed: 6 students).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the number of students remaining after the third stop, which is 6 students.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by checking the logic and math for each stop to ensure the final answer (6 students) is correct.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Start with 48 students.  
- First stop: 48 ÷ 2 = 24 students get off, 48 − 24 = 24 remain.  
- Second stop: 24 ÷ 2 = 12 students get off, 24 − 12 = 12 remain.  
- Third stop: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 students get off, 12 − 6 = 6 remain.  
The calculations are consistent, and the logic of halving the number of students at each stop is correctly applied. The final answer of 6 students is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
After the third stop, **6 students** remain on the bus.
