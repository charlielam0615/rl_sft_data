**Problem Restatement**: A school bus starts with 48 students. At each of the first three stops, half of the students on the bus get off. We need to determine how many students remain on the bus after the third stop.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of students remaining after the first stop (half of 48 get off).  
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after the second stop (half of the remaining students get off).  
3. Calculate the number of students remaining after the third stop (half of the remaining students get off).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the first stop. To achieve this, take the initial number of students (48) and subtract half of them, as half get off at the first stop.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with 48 students. Half of 48 is 48 รท 2 = 24. So, 24 students get off, and 48 - 24 = 24 students remain after the first stop.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the second stop. To achieve this, take the number of students remaining after the first stop (24) and subtract half of them, as half get off at the second stop.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After the first stop, 24 students remain. Half of 24 is 24 รท 2 = 12. So, 12 students get off, and 24 - 12 = 12 students remain after the second stop.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of students remaining after the third stop. To achieve this, take the number of students remaining after the second stop (12) and subtract half of them, as half get off at the third stop.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
After the second stop, 12 students remain. Half of 12 is 12 รท 2 = 6. So, 6 students get off, and 12 - 6 = 6 students remain after the third stop.  
[/IMP]

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of students remaining on the bus after the third stop.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate students remaining after the first stop (completed: 24 students).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate students remaining after the second stop (completed: 12 students).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate students remaining after the third stop (completed: 6 students).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the number of students remaining after the third stop.  
The calculations show that 6 students remain after the third stop.

**Final Answer**: After the third stop, 6 students remain on the bus.
