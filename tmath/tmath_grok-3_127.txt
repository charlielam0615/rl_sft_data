**Problem Statement**: We need to find a monic polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree 2 that satisfies \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \). A monic polynomial of degree 2 has the form \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1. We need to determine the coefficients \( b \) and \( c \) and express the polynomial as \( ax^2 + bx + c \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the monic quadratic polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), we need to use the given conditions \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \) to set up equations for \( b \) and \( c \). The subgoals are:  
1. Use \( f(0) = 4 \) to find an equation involving \( c \).  
2. Use \( f(1) = 10 \) to find an equation involving \( b \) and \( c \).  
3. Solve the resulting system of equations to determine \( b \) and \( c \).  
4. Write the polynomial in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use \( f(0) = 4 \) to find an equation for \( c \). Since \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), evaluate \( f(0) \) by substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Evaluate \( f(0) \):  
\[ f(0) = 0^2 + b \cdot 0 + c = c \]  
Given \( f(0) = 4 \), we have:  
\[ c = 4 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use \( f(1) = 10 \) to find an equation involving \( b \) and \( c \). Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), and use the result from Step 2 (\( c = 4 \)) to solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Evaluate \( f(1) \):  
\[ f(1) = 1^2 + b \cdot 1 + c = 1 + b + c \]  
Given \( f(1) = 10 \) and \( c = 4 \) from Step 2, we have:  
\[ 1 + b + 4 = 10 \]  
\[ b + 5 = 10 \]  
\[ b = 5 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to ensure all necessary steps are completed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the monic quadratic polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \) such that \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Use \( f(0) = 4 \) to find \( c \) (completed: \( c = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use \( f(1) = 10 \) to find \( b \) (completed: \( b = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations (completed: \( b = 5 \), \( c = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Write the polynomial (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Write the polynomial using the coefficients found.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the polynomial \( f(x) \) in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), using \( a = 1 \) (since the polynomial is monic), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The polynomial is:  
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \]  
In the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \) satisfies \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \). Check both conditions by substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check \( f(0) \):  
\[ f(0) = 0^2 + 5 \cdot 0 + 4 = 4 \]  
This satisfies \( f(0) = 4 \).  
Check \( f(1) \):  
\[ f(1) = 1^2 + 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 \]  
This satisfies \( f(1) = 10 \).  
The polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \]  
In the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 4 \).
