**Problem Restatement**: We need to find a monic polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree 2 such that \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \). A monic polynomial of degree 2 has the form \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), where the leading coefficient is 1. We must express the answer as \( ax^2 + bx + c \), determining the real numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the condition \( f(0) = 4 \) to find \( c \).  
2. Use the condition \( f(1) = 10 \) to form an equation involving \( b \).  
3. Solve for \( b \).  
4. Write the polynomial in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use \( f(0) = 4 \) to find \( c \).  
Description: Evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 0 \), which gives \( f(0) = c \), and set it equal to 4 to determine \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), compute \( f(0) \):  
\( f(0) = 0^2 + b \cdot 0 + c = c \).  
Given \( f(0) = 4 \), we have:  
\( c = 4 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use \( f(1) = 10 \) to form an equation for \( b \).  
Description: Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( c = 4 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \), set equal to 10, and solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With \( c = 4 \), the polynomial is \( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 4 \). Compute \( f(1) \):  
\( f(1) = 1^2 + b \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 + b + 4 = b + 5 \).  
Given \( f(1) = 10 \), we have:  
\( b + 5 = 10 \).  
Solve for \( b \):  
\( b = 10 - 5 = 5 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure all subgoals are addressed and confirm the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the monic polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree 2 such that \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Use \( f(0) = 4 \) to find \( c \) (completed: \( c = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use \( f(1) = 10 \) to find \( b \) (completed: \( b = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Write the polynomial in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \) (pending).  
Current Goal: Write the polynomial using the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Write the polynomial in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \).  
Description: Since the polynomial is monic (degree 2), set \( a = 1 \), and use \( b = 5 \), \( c = 4 \) to express \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The polynomial is monic, so \( a = 1 \). With \( b = 5 \) and \( c = 4 \), we have:  
\( f(x) = 1 \cdot x^2 + 5x + 4 = x^2 + 5x + 4 \).  
Thus, in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = 4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the polynomial satisfies \( f(0) = 4 \) and \( f(1) = 10 \).  
Description: Substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \) to confirm the conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check \( f(0) \):  
\( f(0) = 0^2 + 5 \cdot 0 + 4 = 4 \). This satisfies \( f(0) = 4 \).  
Check \( f(1) \):  
\( f(1) = 1^2 + 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 \). This satisfies \( f(1) = 10 \).  
The polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The polynomial is \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \). In the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the coefficients are:  
\( a = 1, b = 5, c = 4 \).  
Thus, \( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \).
