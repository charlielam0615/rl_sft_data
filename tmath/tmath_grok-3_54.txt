### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Define the three consecutive odd integers in terms of a variable.  
2. Set up an equation based on the condition that their sum equals one-seventh of their product.  
3. Solve the equation to find the integers.  
4. Identify the middle integer when listed in ascending order.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the three consecutive odd integers and set up the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Represent the integers as \(n\), \(n+2\), and \(n+4\), where \(n\) is an odd integer. Formulate the equation where their sum equals one-seventh of their product.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let the three consecutive odd integers be \(n\), \(n+2\), and \(n+4\), where \(n\) is a positive, one-digit, odd integer (i.e., \(n \in \{1, 3, 5, 7\}\)).  
The sum is:  
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 3n + 6 \]  
The product is:  
\[ n \cdot (n+2) \cdot (n+4) \]  
Given that the sum is one-seventh of the product:  
\[ 3n + 6 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot n \cdot (n+2) \cdot (n+4) \]  
Multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ 7(3n + 6) = n \cdot (n+2) \cdot (n+4) \]  
\[ 21n + 42 = n(n^2 + 6n + 8) \]  
\[ 21n + 42 = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n \]  
Rearrange all terms to one side:  
\[ n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n - 21n - 42 = 0 \]  
\[ n^3 + 6n^2 - 13n - 42 = 0 \]  
This is a cubic equation to solve for \(n\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the cubic equation \(n^3 + 6n^2 - 13n - 42 = 0\) for one-digit, odd \(n\).  
**How to Achieve**: Test possible values of \(n\) (1, 3, 5, 7) in the cubic equation, as \(n\) must be a positive, one-digit, odd integer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test \(n = 1\):  
\[ 1^3 + 6 \cdot 1^2 - 13 \cdot 1 - 42 = 1 + 6 - 13 - 42 = -48 \neq 0 \]  

Test \(n = 3\):  
\[ 3^3 + 6 \cdot 3^2 - 13 \cdot 3 - 42 = 27 + 54 - 39 - 42 = 0 \]  

Since \(n = 3\) satisfies the equation, the integers are:  
\[ n = 3, \quad n+2 = 5, \quad n+4 = 7 \]  
Verify:  
- Sum: \(3 + 5 + 7 = 15\)  
- Product: \(3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 105\)  
- Check: \(\frac{1}{7} \cdot 105 = 15\), which matches the sum.  

Thus, the integers are 3, 5, and 7.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that 3, 5, and 7 are the only solution by checking other possible values of \(n\).  
**How to Achieve**: Test remaining odd integers (\(n = 1, 5, 7\)) in the cubic equation to ensure no other solutions exist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test \(n = 5\):  
\[ 5^3 + 6 \cdot 5^2 - 13 \cdot 5 - 42 = 125 + 150 - 65 - 42 = 168 \neq 0 \]  

Test \(n = 7\):  
\[ 7^3 + 6 \cdot 7^2 - 13 \cdot 7 - 42 = 343 + 294 - 91 - 42 = 504 \neq 0 \]  

Since only \(n = 3\) satisfies the equation, the integers 3, 5, and 7 are the only solution.

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the middle integer when 3, 5, and 7 are listed in ascending order.  
**How to Achieve**: Arrange the integers in ascending order and select the second (middle) integer.
