**Problem Restatement**: Compute the value of \( \frac{42!}{40!} \) without using a calculator.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the computation. The expression \( \frac{42!}{40!} \) involves factorials, so a subgoal is to simplify the fraction by leveraging the definition of factorials. Another subgoal is to compute the resulting expression manually.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the expression \( \frac{42!}{40!} \).  
How to Achieve: Use the definition of factorials, where \( 42! = 42 \times 41 \times 40! \), to rewrite the fraction and cancel common terms.  

[IMP]  
Given \( \frac{42!}{40!} \), express \( 42! \) as:  
\[ 42! = 42 \times 41 \times 40! \]  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[ \frac{42!}{40!} = \frac{42 \times 41 \times 40!}{40!} \]  
The \( 40! \) terms cancel out, leaving:  
\[ 42 \times 41 \]  
Now, compute \( 42 \times 41 \):  
\[ 42 \times 40 = 1680 \]  
\[ 42 \times 1 = 42 \]  
\[ 1680 + 42 = 1722 \]  
So, \( 42 \times 41 = 1722 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computation \( 42 \times 41 = 1722 \).  
How to Achieve: Perform the multiplication again using a different method (e.g., breaking down the numbers) to confirm the result.  

[IMP]  
To validate, compute \( 42 \times 41 \) by breaking it down:  
\[ 41 = 40 + 1 \]  
\[ 42 \times 41 = 42 \times (40 + 1) = (42 \times 40) + (42 \times 1) \]  
\[ 42 \times 40 = 1680 \]  
\[ 42 \times 1 = 42 \]  
\[ 1680 + 42 = 1722 \]  
The result matches the previous computation, confirming \( 42 \times 41 = 1722 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( \frac{42!}{40!} \) without a calculator.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression using factorial properties (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the resulting expression \( 42 \times 41 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation (completed).  
Current Goal: The computation is complete, and the result has been validated. The final answer is ready.
