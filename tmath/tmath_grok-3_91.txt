**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(4^6 = 8^n\) for \(n\).

To find \(n\), we need to express both sides of the equation in a comparable form, solve for \(n\), and verify the solution. We will use the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M) to structure the solution process, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \(4^6 = 8^n\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express 4 and 8 as powers of a common base to simplify the equation.  
2. Equate the exponents and solve for \(n\).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express 4 and 8 as powers of a common base and rewrite the equation \(4^6 = 8^n\). Since \(4 = 2^2\) and \(8 = 2^3\), rewrite both sides using base 2, then simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \(4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{2 \cdot 6} = 2^{12}\).  
Rewrite \(8^n = (2^3)^n = 2^{3n}\).  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 2^{12} = 2^{3n} \].  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 12 = 3n \].

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(12 = 3n\) for \(n\). This involves isolating \(n\) by dividing both sides by 3.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve \(12 = 3n\):  
\[ n = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \].  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(n = 4\) satisfies the original equation \(4^6 = 8^n\). Substitute \(n = 4\) into the equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(n = 4\):  
Left side: \(4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12} = 4096\).  
Right side: \(8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 2^{12} = 4096\).  
Since \(4096 = 4096\), the solution \(n = 4\) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(4^6 = 8^n\) for \(n\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express 4 and 8 as powers of a common base (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate exponents and solve for \(n\) (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as \(n = 4\) has been found and verified.

**Final Answer**: \(n = 4\).
