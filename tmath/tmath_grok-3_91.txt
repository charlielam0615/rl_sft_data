**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) such that \( 4^6 = 8^n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve \( 4^6 = 8^n \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express both sides of the equation with the same base to compare the exponents.
2. Solve for \( n \) by equating the exponents or manipulating the equation.
3. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Express both sides of the equation with the same base.

**How to Achieve**: Recognize that 4 and 8 are powers of 2 (\( 4 = 2^2 \), \( 8 = 2^3 \)). Rewrite \( 4^6 \) and \( 8^n \) in terms of base 2, then equate the exponents.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite \( 4^6 \):
\[ 4 = 2^2 \implies 4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{2 \cdot 6} = 2^{12} \]

Rewrite \( 8^n \):
\[ 8 = 2^3 \implies 8^n = (2^3)^n = 2^{3n} \]

The equation becomes:
\[ 2^{12} = 2^{3n} \]

Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:
\[ 12 = 3n \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Solve for \( n \).

**How to Achieve**: Solve the equation \( 12 = 3n \) by dividing both sides by 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[ 12 = 3n \]
\[ n = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( n = 4 \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( n = 4 \):
\[ 8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 2^{12} \]
\[ 4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12} \]

Since \( 2^{12} = 2^{12} \), the equation holds. Alternatively, compute numerically:
\[ 4^6 = 4096 \]
\[ 8^4 = (8 \cdot 8) \cdot (8 \cdot 8) = 64 \cdot 64 = 4096 \]

Both sides equal 4096, confirming the solution.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
