**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term in the expansion of \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the structure of the polynomials and their multiplication.  
2. Identify the terms in the product that contribute to the \( x^2 \) term.  
3. Compute the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term by summing the contributions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the terms in the product \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \) that result in an \( x^2 \) term after multiplication. This can be achieved by examining pairs of terms from each polynomial whose degrees sum to 2 and computing their coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the \( x^2 \) term in the expansion, multiply the polynomials \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \) and collect terms with degree 2. List the terms of each polynomial:  
- First polynomial: \( ax^3 \) (degree 3), \( 3x^2 \) (degree 2), \( -2x \) (degree 1).  
- Second polynomial: \( bx^2 \) (degree 2), \( -7x \) (degree 1), \( -4 \) (degree 0).  

For the product to yield an \( x^2 \) term, select pairs where the degrees of the terms sum to 2:  
1. \( (3x^2) \cdot (-4) \): Degree \( 2 + 0 = 2 \), coefficient \( 3 \cdot (-4) = -12 \).  
2. \( (-2x) \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), coefficient \( (-2) \cdot (-7) = 14 \).  
3. \( (ax^3) \cdot (bx^2) \): Degree \( 3 + 2 = 5 \), does not contribute to \( x^2 \).  
4. \( (ax^3) \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 3 + 1 = 4 \), does not contribute.  
5. \( (ax^3) \cdot (-4) \): Degree \( 3 + 0 = 3 \), does not contribute.  
6. \( (3x^2) \cdot (bx^2) \): Degree \( 2 + 2 = 4 \), does not contribute.  
7. \( (3x^2) \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), does not contribute.  
8. \( (-2x) \cdot (bx^2) \): Degree \( 1 + 2 = 3 \), does not contribute.  

The contributing pairs are:  
- \( 3x^2 \cdot (-4) = -12x^2 \).  
- \( (-2x) \cdot (-7x) = 14x^2 \).  

Sum the coefficients: \( -12 + 14 = 2 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of the \( x^2 \) termâ€™s coefficient by rechecking the contributing pairs and ensuring no terms were missed. This involves systematically verifying the degree sums and coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the pairs that produce an \( x^2 \) term:  
- First polynomial terms: \( ax^3 \), \( 3x^2 \), \( -2x \).  
- Second polynomial terms: \( bx^2 \), \( -7x \), \( -4 \).  

Verify each pair:  
- \( 3x^2 \cdot (-4) \): Degree \( 2 + 0 = 2 \), coefficient \( 3 \cdot (-4) = -12 \).  
- \( (-2x) \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), coefficient \( (-2) \cdot (-7) = 14 \).  

Other pairs:  
- \( ax^3 \cdot bx^2 \): Degree \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).  
- \( ax^3 \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 3 + 1 = 4 \).  
- \( ax^3 \cdot (-4) \): Degree \( 3 + 0 = 3 \).  
- \( 3x^2 \cdot bx^2 \): Degree \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).  
- \( 3x^2 \cdot (-7x) \): Degree \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).  
- \( (-2x) \cdot bx^2 \): Degree \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).  

No additional pairs yield degree 2. Sum the coefficients again: \( -12 + 14 = 2 \). The calculation is consistent.
