### Problem Statement
We need to find the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term in the expansion of the product \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term in the expansion of \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \), we can break down the problem into the following subgoals:
1. Multiply the two polynomials to obtain the resulting polynomial.
2. Identify the terms in the expansion that contribute to the \( x^2 \) term.
3. Sum the coefficients of all terms that produce \( x^2 \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the two polynomials \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \).
How to Achieve: Distribute each term of the first polynomial across all terms of the second polynomial, collecting all resulting terms.

[IMP]
To multiply the polynomials \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \), we distribute each term:

- \( ax^3 \cdot (bx^2 - 7x - 4) = abx^5 - 7ax^4 - 4ax^3 \)
- \( 3x^2 \cdot (bx^2 - 7x - 4) = 3bx^4 - 21x^3 - 12x^2 \)
- \( -2x \cdot (bx^2 - 7x - 4) = -2bx^3 + 14x^2 + 8x \)

Combine all terms:
\[ abx^5 - 7ax^4 - 4ax^3 + 3bx^4 - 21x^3 - 12x^2 - 2bx^3 + 14x^2 + 8x \]

Group like terms by degree:
- \( x^5 \): \( abx^5 \)
- \( x^4 \): \( -7ax^4 + 3bx^4 = (-7a + 3b)x^4 \)
- \( x^3 \): \( -4ax^3 - 21x^3 - 2bx^3 = (-4a - 2b - 21)x^3 \)
- \( x^2 \): \( -12x^2 + 14x^2 = (-12 + 14)x^2 = 2x^2 \)
- \( x \): \( 8x \)

The resulting polynomial is:
\[ abx^5 + (-7a + 3b)x^4 + (-4a - 2b - 21)x^3 + 2x^2 + 8x \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the terms in the expansion that contribute to the \( x^2 \) term.
How to Achieve: From the expanded polynomial, extract the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the expansion \( abx^5 + (-7a + 3b)x^4 + (-4a - 2b - 21)x^3 + 2x^2 + 8x \), the term involving \( x^2 \) is \( 2x^2 \). Thus, the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term is 2.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term is correct.
How to Achieve: Recompute the \( x^2 \) terms by explicitly listing all term pairs from the polynomial multiplication that produce \( x^2 \), and confirm the coefficient.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, we identify all pairs of terms from \( (ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) \) whose exponents sum to 2:
- \( 3x^2 \cdot (-4) = -12x^2 \) (exponents: \( 2 + 0 = 2 \))
- \( -2x \cdot (-7x) = 14x^2 \) (exponents: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \))

Sum the coefficients: \( -12 + 14 = 2 \).

This confirms the \( x^2 \) term is \( 2x^2 \), so the coefficient is 2.
