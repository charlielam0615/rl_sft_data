**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To evaluate \( i^{22} + i^{222} \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Compute \( i^{22} \).  
2. Compute \( i^{222} \).  
3. Add the results to obtain \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( i^{22} \).  
How to Achieve: Use the cyclical nature of powers of \( i \), where \( i^1 = i \), \( i^2 = -1 \), \( i^3 = -i \), \( i^4 = 1 \), and the cycle repeats every 4 powers. Determine the exponent 22 modulo 4 to find the equivalent power within the cycle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute \( i^{22} \):  
- Calculate \( 22 \mod 4 \):  
  \( 22 \div 4 = 5 \) (since \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)), remainder \( 22 - 20 = 2 \).  
  Thus, \( 22 \mod 4 = 2 \).  
- Since \( 22 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( i^{22} = i^2 = -1 \).  
Result: \( i^{22} = -1 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( i^{222} \).  
How to Achieve: Apply the same method as for \( i^{22} \), using the cyclical property of \( i \). Compute 222 modulo 4 to find the equivalent power.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute \( i^{222} \):  
- Calculate \( 222 \mod 4 \):  
  \( 222 \div 4 = 55 \) (since \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \)), remainder \( 222 - 220 = 2 \).  
  Thus, \( 222 \mod 4 = 2 \).  
- Since \( 222 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( i^{222} = i^2 = -1 \).  
Result: \( i^{222} = -1 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals to provide context for the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( i^{22} \) (completed: \( i^{22} = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( i^{222} \) (completed: \( i^{222} = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results \( i^{22} + i^{222} \) (pending).  
Current Goal: Add \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
How to Achieve: Use the computed values \( i^{22} = -1 \) and \( i^{222} = -1 \) to perform the addition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute \( i^{22} + i^{222} \):  
- From previous steps: \( i^{22} = -1 \), \( i^{222} = -1 \).  
- Add the results: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).  
Result: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -2 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the computation of \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -2 \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute the powers using an alternative approach (e.g., express powers in terms of \( i^4 \)) and verify the sum matches the previous result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- For \( i^{22} \):  
  \( 22 \div 4 = 5 \), so \( i^{22} = (i^4)^5 \cdot i^2 \). Since \( i^4 = 1 \), \( (i^4)^5 = 1^5 = 1 \), and \( i^2 = -1 \). Thus, \( i^{22} = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \).  
- For \( i^{222} \):  
  \( 222 \div 4 = 55 \), so \( i^{222} = (i^4)^{55} \cdot i^2 \). Since \( i^4 = 1 \), \( (i^4)^{55} = 1^{55} = 1 \), and \( i^2 = -1 \). Thus, \( i^{222} = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \).  
- Sum: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).  
The result matches: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -2 \).  
Validation: The computation is correct.
