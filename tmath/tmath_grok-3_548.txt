### Problem Statement
Evaluate the expression \( i^{22} + i^{222} \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit satisfying \( i^2 = -1 \).

I will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set \( M \), selecting one action per step from the Planning (\( P \)), Implementation (\( I \)), or Review (\( R \)) subsets, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To evaluate \( i^{22} + i^{222} \), break the problem into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Compute \( i^{22} \).  
2. Compute \( i^{222} \).  
3. Add the results to obtain \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute \( i^{22} \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the cyclical property of powers of \( i \), where \( i^1 = i \), \( i^2 = -1 \), \( i^3 = -i \), \( i^4 = 1 \), and the cycle repeats every 4 powers. Reduce the exponent 22 modulo 4 to find the equivalent power, then compute \( i^{22} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute \( i^{22} \):  
- Divide 22 by 4: \( 22 \div 4 = 5 \) (quotient), with remainder \( 22 - 4 \cdot 5 = 22 - 20 = 2 \).  
- Thus, \( 22 \mod 4 = 2 \), so \( i^{22} = i^2 \).  
- Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( i^{22} = -1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute \( i^{222} \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Similarly, use the cyclical property of powers of \( i \). Reduce the exponent 222 modulo 4 to find the equivalent power, then compute \( i^{222} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To compute \( i^{222} \):  
- Divide 222 by 4: \( 222 \div 4 = 55 \) (quotient), with remainder \( 222 - 4 \cdot 55 = 222 - 220 = 2 \).  
- Thus, \( 222 \mod 4 = 2 \), so \( i^{222} = i^2 \).  
- Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have \( i^{222} = -1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( i^{22} \) (completed: \( i^{22} = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( i^{222} \) (completed: \( i^{222} = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  

**Current Goal:** Add \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute \( i^{22} + i^{222} \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the results from previous steps (\( i^{22} = -1 \), \( i^{222} = -1 \)) and add them: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -1 + (-1) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the computed values:  
- \( i^{22} = -1 \).  
- \( i^{222} = -1 \).  
- Add them: \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate the computation of \( i^{22} + i^{222} = -2 \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Recompute the powers using the cyclical property to confirm the exponentsâ€™ remainders and verify the addition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- For \( i^{22} \): Exponent 22 mod 4 = 2 (as computed: \( 22 - 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \)), so \( i^{22} = i^2 = -1 \). Correct.  
- For \( i^{222} \): Exponent 222 mod 4 = 2 (as computed: \( 222 - 4 \cdot 55 = 2 \)), so \( i^{222} = i^2 = -1 \). Correct.  
- Addition: \( -1 + (-1) = -2 \). Correct.  
The computation is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( i^{22} + i^{222} \) is \( -2 \).

\[ \boxed{-2} \]
