[IMP]
In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This means:  

$$
(x - 1) - \frac{1}{2} = 3x - (x - 1)
$$  

Simplify both sides:  

Left side:  
$$
(x - 1) - \frac{1}{2} = x - 1 - \frac{1}{2} = x - \frac{3}{2}
$$  

Right side:  
$$
3x - (x - 1) = 3x - x + 1 = 2x + 1
$$  

Set both sides equal:  
$$
x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1
$$  

Solve for $ x $:  
$$
x - 2x = 1 + \frac{3}{2} \Rightarrow -x = \frac{5}{2} \Rightarrow x = -\frac{5}{2}
$$

1. **Original Equation**:  
   $ (x - 1) - \frac{1}{2} = 3x - (x - 1) $  
   Substituting $ x = -\frac{5}{2} $:  
   Left side:  
   $ \left(-\frac{5}{2} - 1\right) - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -4 $.  
   Right side:  
   $ 3(-\frac{5}{2}) - \left(-\frac{5}{2} - 1\right) = -\frac{15}{2} - (-\frac{7}{2}) = -\frac{15}{2} + \frac{7}{2} = -4 $.  
   Both sides equal $-4$, confirming the solution satisfies the equation.  

2. **Common Difference Consistency**:  
   Sequence terms with $ x = -\frac{5}{2} $:  
   - First term: $ \frac{1}{2} $  
   - Second term: $ x - 1 = -\frac{5}{2} - 1 = -\frac{7}{2} $  
   - Third term: $ 3x = 3(-\frac{5}{2}) = -\frac{15}{2} $  
   Differences:  
   - $ -\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -4 $  
   - $ -\frac{15}{2} - (-\frac{7}{2}) = -4 $  
   The common difference $ d = -4 $ is consistent.  

3. **Algebraic Steps**:  
   - Simplified left side: $ x - \frac{3}{2} $  
   - Simplified right side: $ 2x + 1 $  
   - Solved $ x - \frac{3}{2} = 2x + 1 \Rightarrow -x = \frac{5}{2} \Rightarrow x = -\frac{5}{2} $.  
   All steps are logically valid and error-free.  

No discrepancies found. The solution is consistent with the arithmetic sequence definition and algebraic manipulations.
