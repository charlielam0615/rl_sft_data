### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( xyz \), where \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive numbers satisfying the system of equations:
1. \( x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \)
2. \( y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \)
3. \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \)

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( xyz \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).  
2. Compute the product \( xyz \) using the solutions.

### Step 2

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). To achieve this, substitute expressions from one equation into another to reduce the number of variables and solve systematically.

Start with the second equation: \( y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \).  
Solve for \( y \):  
\[ y = 1 - \frac{1}{z} \]  

Substitute \( y = 1 - \frac{1}{z} \) into the first equation: \( x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \).  
\[ x + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} = 4 \]  
Simplify the denominator:  
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{z} = \frac{z - 1}{z} \]  
So,  
\[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} = \frac{z}{z - 1} \]  
The first equation becomes:  
\[ x + \frac{z}{z - 1} = 4 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = 4 - \frac{z}{z - 1} \]  
Rewrite with a common denominator:  
\[ x = \frac{4(z - 1) - z}{z - 1} = \frac{4z - 4 - z}{z - 1} = \frac{3z - 4}{z - 1} \]  

Now use the third equation: \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \).  
Substitute \( x = \frac{3z - 4}{z - 1} \):  
\[ \frac{1}{x} = \frac{z - 1}{3z - 4} \]  
So,  
\[ z + \frac{z - 1}{3z - 4} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
Multiply through by \( 3(3z - 4) \) to clear denominators:  
\[ 3z(3z - 4) + 3(z - 1) = 7(3z - 4) \]  
Expand:  
\[ 9z^2 - 12z + 3z - 3 = 21z - 28 \]  
\[ 9z^2 - 9z - 3 = 21z - 28 \]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ 9z^2 - 9z - 3 - 21z + 28 = 0 \]  
\[ 9z^2 - 30z + 25 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 9 \), \( b = -30 \), \( c = 25 \):  
\[ \Delta = (-30)^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 25 = 900 - 900 = 0 \]  
\[ z = \frac{30}{2 \cdot 9} = \frac{30}{18} = \frac{5}{3} \]  

Now find \( y \):  
\[ y = 1 - \frac{1}{z} = 1 - \frac{1}{\frac{5}{3}} = 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \]  

Find \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{3z - 4}{z - 1} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{5}{3} - 4}{\frac{5}{3} - 1} = \frac{5 - 4}{\frac{5}{3} - \frac{3}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2} \]  

Verify:  
- First equation: \( x + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{\frac{2}{5}} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{2} = 4 \). Satisfied.  
- Second equation: \( y + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} = 1 \). Satisfied.  
- Third equation: \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \). Satisfied.  

The solution is \( x = \frac{3}{2} \), \( y = \frac{2}{5} \), \( z = \frac{5}{3} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( xyz \) using the values \( x = \frac{3}{2} \), \( y = \frac{2}{5} \), and \( z = \frac{5}{3} \). Multiply these values to find the product.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[ xyz = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{3} \]  
Simplify:  
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3} = \frac{30}{30} = 1 \]  
So, \( xyz = 1 \).

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( xyz \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the product \( xyz \). (Completed in Step 3)  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution by tracking the goal hierarchy, ensuring all steps align with finding \( xyz \). The main goal has been achieved, as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) were found and used to compute \( xyz = 1 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( xyz \) is \( 1 \).
