### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( xyz \), where \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive numbers satisfying the system of equations:
1. \( x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \)
2. \( y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \)
3. \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( xyz \). Subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find possible values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).  
2. Compute the product \( xyz \) using the solutions.  
3. Verify that the solutions are consistent and valid for positive numbers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve the system of equations to find \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Achieve this by expressing variables in terms of each other using the given equations and substituting to form a solvable equation.

Start with the given equations:  
1. \( x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \implies \frac{1}{y} = 4 - x \implies y = \frac{1}{4 - x} \)  
2. \( y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{z} = 1 - y \implies z = \frac{1}{1 - y} \)  
3. \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \implies \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} - z \implies x = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{3} - z} = \frac{3}{7 - 3z} \)  

Substitute \( y = \frac{1}{4 - x} \) into the second equation:  
\[ z = \frac{1}{1 - y} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{4 - x}} = \frac{4 - x}{(4 - x) - 1} = \frac{4 - x}{3 - x} \]  

Now substitute \( z = \frac{4 - x}{3 - x} \) into the third equation:  
\[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{4 - x}{3 - x} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
Multiply through by \( x (3 - x) \) to clear denominators:  
\[ x (4 - x) + (3 - x) = \frac{7}{3} x (3 - x) \]  
Left side:  
\[ x (4 - x) + (3 - x) = 4x - x^2 + 3 - x = -x^2 + 3x + 3 \]  
Right side:  
\[ \frac{7}{3} x (3 - x) = \frac{7}{3} (3x - x^2) = -\frac{7}{3} x^2 + 7x \]  
Equate:  
\[ -x^2 + 3x + 3 = -\frac{7}{3} x^2 + 7x \]  
Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:  
\[ -3x^2 + 9x + 9 = -7x^2 + 21x \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation:  
\[ 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = (2x - 3)^2 = 0 \implies x = \frac{3}{2} \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to use \( x = \frac{3}{2} \) to find \( y \) and \( z \), then compute \( xyz \). Achieve this by substituting \( x \) back into the equations for \( y \) and \( z \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using \( x = \frac{3}{2} \):  
- From the first equation:  
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \implies \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \implies \frac{1}{y} = 4 - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \implies y = \frac{2}{5} \]  
- From the second equation:  
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \implies \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{z} = 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \implies z = \frac{5}{3} \]  
- Compute \( xyz \):  
  \[ xyz = x \cdot y \cdot z = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3} = 1 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{3}{2} \), \( y = \frac{2}{5} \), and \( z = \frac{5}{3} \) satisfy all three equations and are positive. Achieve this by substituting into each equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check each equation:  
1. \( x + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{\frac{2}{5}}} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{2} = 4 \). Satisfied.  
2. \( y + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{\frac{5}{3}}} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} = 1 \). Satisfied.  
3. \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}}} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \). Satisfied.  
All numbers are positive: \( x = \frac{3}{2} > 0 \), \( y = \frac{2}{5} > 0 \), \( z = \frac{5}{3} > 0 \).
