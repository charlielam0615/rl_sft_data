**Problem Statement**: A point \((x, y)\) is randomly selected from a rectangular region with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2008,0)\), \((2008,2009)\), and \((0,2009)\). We need to find the probability that \(x > 2y\) and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability.  
1. Determine the total area of the rectangular region.  
2. Define the region where \(x > 2y\) within the rectangle.  
3. Calculate the area of the region where \(x > 2y\).  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of the favorable area to the total area.  
5. Express the probability as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the total area of the rectangular region.  
**How to Achieve**: The rectangle has vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2008,0)\), \((2008,2009)\), and \((0,2009)\). Calculate the area using the formula for a rectangle: length Ã— width.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The rectangle's width (along the x-axis) is \(2008 - 0 = 2008\), and its height (along the y-axis) is \(2009 - 0 = 2009\). Thus, the total area is:  
\[
2008 \times 2009
\]  
This area represents the total possible outcomes for the random point \((x, y)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the region where \(x > 2y\) within the rectangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the boundaries of the rectangle and the condition \(x > 2y\). Since points are chosen uniformly, describe the region in the rectangle where \(x > 2y\) holds, considering the constraints \(0 \leq x \leq 2008\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 2009\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The rectangle is defined by \(0 \leq x \leq 2008\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 2009\). The condition \(x > 2y\) can be rewritten as \(y < \frac{x}{2}\). We need to find the area within the rectangle where \(y < \frac{x}{2}\).  

- At \(x = 0\), \(y < 0\), but since \(y \geq 0\), no points satisfy \(y < 0\).  
- At \(y = 0\), \(x > 0\), which includes the line segment from \((0,0)\) to \((2008,0)\).  
- At \(x = 2008\), \(2y < 2008 \implies y < 1004\). So, for \(x = 2008\), \(y\) ranges from 0 to 1004.  
- At \(y = 2009\), \(x > 2 \times 2009 = 4018\), but since \(x \leq 2008\), no points satisfy this (as \(4018 > 2008\)).  

Thus, the region is bounded by:  
- The x-axis (\(y = 0\)),  
- The line \(y = \frac{x}{2}\),  
- The line \(x = 2008\),  
- The line \(y = 1004\) (since at \(x = 2008\), \(y = \frac{2008}{2} = 1004\)).  

This forms a right triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2008,0)\), and \((2008,1004)\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of the region where \(x > 2y\).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the area of the triangular region identified in the previous step using the formula for the area of a triangle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The favorable region is a right triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((2008,0)\), and \((2008,1004)\).  
- The base is along the x-axis from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 2008\), so the base length is 2008.  
- The height is along \(y\) at \(x = 2008\), where \(y = 1004\).  

The area of a right triangle is:  
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2008 \times 1004
\]  
Calculate:  
\[
2008 \times 1004 = 2008 \times (1000 + 4) = 2008 \times 1000 + 2008 \times 4 = 2,008,000 + 8032 = 2,016,032
\]  
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2,016,032 = 1,008,016
\]  
So, the area of the favorable region is \(1,008,016\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that \(x > 2y\) for a point \((x, y)\) in the rectangle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total area of the rectangle (completed: \(2008 \times 2009\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Define the region where \(x > 2y\) (completed: triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((2008,0)\), \((2008,1004)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area of the favorable region (completed: \(1,008,016\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability as the ratio of the favorable area to the total area (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 5: Express the probability as a common fraction.  

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of the favorable area to the total area.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability as the ratio of the favorable area to the total area.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the area of the favorable region by the total area of the rectangle and simplify the resulting fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total area of the rectangle is \(2008 \times 2009\). The favorable area is \(1,008,016\). The probability is:  
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable Area}}{\text{Total Area}} = \frac{1,008,016}{2008 \times 2009}
\]  
Factorize the numerator and denominator:  
- Numerator: \(1,008,016 = 2^4 \times 63,001\).  
- Denominator: \(2008 = 2^3 \times 251\), \(2009 = 7^2 \times 41\), so \(2008 \times 2009 = 2^3 \times 251 \times 7^2 \times 41\).  

The fraction becomes:  
\[
\frac{2^4 \times 63,001}{2^3 \times 251 \times 7^2 \times 41}
\]  
Simplify by canceling \(2^3\):  
\[
\frac{2^{4-3} \times 63,001}{251 \times 7^2 \times 41} = \frac{2 \times 63,001}{251 \times 7^2 \times 41}
\]  
Calculate the denominator:  
\[
7^2 = 49, \quad 251 \times 41 = 10,291, \quad 49 \times 10,291 = 504,259
\]  
So:  
\[
\frac{2 \times 63,001}{504,259} = \frac{126,002}{504,259}
\]  
Check if further simplification is possible:  
- \(126,002 = 2 \times 63,001\), and \(63,001\) is prime (not divisible by 251, 7, or 41).  
- \(504,259 = 251 \times 7^2 \times 41\).  

No common factors exist, so the fraction is in its simplest form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations for the favorable area and the probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the favorable area and confirm the fraction is simplified correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the favorable area:  
The triangle has base \(2008\) and height \(1004\).  
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2008 \times 1004
\]  
\[
2008 \times 1004 = 2,016,032, \quad \frac{1}{2} \times 2,016,032 = 1,008,016
\]  
This matches the previous calculation.  

Recompute the total area:  
\[
2008 \times 2009
\]  
This is consistent. The probability fraction is:  
\[
\frac{1,008,016}{2008 \times 2009}
\]  
Recheck simplification:  
\[
1,008,016 \div 2 = 504,008, \quad 2008 \div 2 = 1004
\]  
\[
\frac{504,008}{1004 \times 2009}
\]  
\[
504,008 \div 2 = 252,004, \quad 1004 \div 2 = 502
\]  
\[
\frac{252,004}{502 \times 2009}
\]  
\[
252,004 \div 2 = 126,002, \quad 502 \div 2 = 251
\]  
\[
\frac{126,002}{251 \times 2009}
\]  
\[
251 \times 2009 = 504,259
\]  
\[
\frac{126,002}{504,259}
\]  
The fraction matches. Check for common factors:  
- \(126,002 = 2 \times 63,001\), and \(63,001\) is prime.  
- \(504,259 = 251 \times 7^2 \times 41\).  

No further simplification is possible.

**How to Achieve**: Present the simplified fraction from the previous step as the final answer.

\]  
This is a common fraction in its simplest form.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{126002}{504259}}
\]
