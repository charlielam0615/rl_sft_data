**Problem Statement**: Find a nonzero value of \( p \) such that the quadratic equation \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has only one solution.

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set \( M \), selecting one action per step from Planning (\( P \)), Implementation (\( I \)), or Review (\( R \)) categories, following the specified format.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand what it means for a quadratic equation to have only one solution.  
- Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution using the discriminant.  
- Subgoal 3: Apply this condition to the given equation \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) to find \( p \).  
- Subgoal 4: Verify that the solution satisfies the requirement of a single solution and \( p \neq 0 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand what it means for a quadratic equation to have only one solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Recall the properties of quadratic equations. A quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) has one solution when the discriminant is zero, leading to a repeated root.  

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the number of real solutions depends on the discriminant, defined as \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \).  
- If \( \Delta > 0 \), there are two distinct real roots.  
- If \( \Delta = 0 \), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).  
- If \( \Delta < 0 \), there are no real roots.  
Since the problem asks for exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero (\( \Delta = 0 \)).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the condition for one solution to the given equation \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation, compute the discriminant, set it equal to zero, and solve for \( p \).  

[IMP]  
The equation is \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \). Comparing with \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):  
- \( a = p \),  
- \( b = -12 \),  
- \( c = 4 \).  

The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot p \cdot 4 = 144 - 16p. \]  

For exactly one solution, set the discriminant to zero:  
\[ 144 - 16p = 0. \]  

Solve for \( p \):  
\[ 16p = 144 \implies p = \frac{144}{16} = 9. \]  

Thus, \( p = 9 \). Note that \( p \neq 0 \), which satisfies the problemâ€™s requirement.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( p = 9 \) results in exactly one solution and satisfies all conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( p = 9 \) into the equation, solve for the roots, and confirm there is only one solution.  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( p = 9 \) into the equation:  
\[ 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0. \]  

To confirm one solution, check the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 4 = 144 - 144 = 0. \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), the equation has exactly one real root.  

Alternatively, solve the equation to find the root:  
\[ 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0. \]  
Notice that this can be factored:  
\[ 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = (3x - 2)^2 = 0. \]  

Set the factor to zero:  
\[ 3x - 2 = 0 \implies x = \frac{2}{3}. \]  

The equation has a repeated root at \( x = \frac{2}{3} \), confirming exactly one solution. Additionally, \( p = 9 \neq 0 \), satisfying the nonzero condition.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find a nonzero \( p \) such that \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has only one solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand what it means for a quadratic equation to have only one solution (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for one solution using the discriminant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the condition to find \( p \) (completed, \( p = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed, confirmed one root at \( x = \frac{2}{3} \)).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \( p = 9 \) has been found and verified to produce exactly one solution. No further subgoals are needed.

**Final Answer**:  
The value of \( p \) such that \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has only one solution is \( p = 9 \).  

\[ \boxed{9} \]
