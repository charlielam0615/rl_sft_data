### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
2. Apply this condition to the given equation \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \).  
3. Solve for the nonzero value of \( p \) that satisfies this condition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution. A quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) has exactly one solution when its discriminant is zero (\( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0 \)). This will be achieved by recalling the discriminant formula and applying it to the given equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is given by:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]  
The equation has exactly one solution if \( \Delta = 0 \). For the given equation \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = p \)  
- \( b = -12 \)  
- \( c = 4 \)  
Thus, the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot p \cdot 4 = 144 - 16p \]  
Set the discriminant equal to zero for exactly one solution:  
\[ 144 - 16p = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 144 - 16p = 0 \) for \( p \) and ensure \( p \neq 0 \). This will be achieved by solving the linear equation algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ 144 - 16p = 0 \]  
\[ 16p = 144 \]  
\[ p = \frac{144}{16} = 9 \]  
Since \( p = 9 \neq 0 \), it satisfies the condition of being nonzero.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( p = 9 \) results in the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) having exactly one solution. This will be achieved by substituting \( p = 9 \) into the discriminant and checking if it equals zero, and optionally solving the equation to confirm.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( p = 9 \) into the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 144 - 16 \cdot 9 = 144 - 144 = 0 \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), the equation \( 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has exactly one solution. To further confirm, solve the quadratic equation:  
\[ 9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \]  
This can be factored as:  
\[ (3x - 2)^2 = 0 \]  
\[ 3x - 2 = 0 \]  
\[ x = \frac{2}{3} \]  
The equation has exactly one solution, \( x = \frac{2}{3} \), confirming the discriminant result.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find a nonzero \( p \) such that \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has exactly one solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for a quadratic to have one solution (completed: discriminant \( \Delta = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the condition to find \( p \) (completed: \( p = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed: \( p = 9 \) yields one solution at \( x = \frac{2}{3} \)).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as no further steps are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The nonzero value of \( p \) such that \( px^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 \) has exactly one solution is \( p = 9 \).
