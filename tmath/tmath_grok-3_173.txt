### Problem Statement
In the given diagram, \( D \) is the midpoint of segment \( \overline{AB} \), and \( E \) is the midpoint of segment \( \overline{BC} \). The coordinates of the points are provided as follows:
- \( A(0, 6) \)
- \( B(0, 0) \)
- \( C(8, 0) \)
- \( D(0, 3) \)
- \( E(4, 0) \)

We need to find the sum of the slope and the \( y \)-intercept of the line passing through points \( C \) and \( D \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Verify that \( D \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \) and \( E \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{BC} \).
2. Determine the slope of the line passing through points \( C(8, 0) \) and \( D(0, 3) \).
3. Find the \( y \)-intercept of the line passing through \( C \) and \( D \).
4. Compute the sum of the slope and the \( y \)-intercept.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( D(0, 3) \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \) and \( E(4, 0) \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{BC} \). This will be achieved by calculating the midpoints of segments \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) using the midpoint formula and comparing them to the given coordinates of \( D \) and \( E \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To verify \( D \) as the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), use the midpoint formula for points \( A(0, 6) \) and \( B(0, 0) \):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]
\[
\text{Midpoint of } \overline{AB} = \left( \frac{0 + 0}{2}, \frac{6 + 0}{2} \right) = \left( 0, 3 \right)
\]
This matches \( D(0, 3) \), so \( D \) is indeed the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \).

For \( E \), use points \( B(0, 0) \) and \( C(8, 0) \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } \overline{BC} = \left( \frac{0 + 8}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2} \right) = \left( 4, 0 \right)
\]
This matches \( E(4, 0) \), so \( E \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{BC} \).

The coordinates are consistent with the problem statement.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the slope of the line passing through points \( C(8, 0) \) and \( D(0, 3) \). This will be achieved by applying the slope formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the slope of the line through \( C(8, 0) \) and \( D(0, 3) \):
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - 8} = \frac{3}{-8} = -\frac{3}{8}
\]
The slope is \( -\frac{3}{8} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the \( y \)-intercept of the line passing through points \( C(8, 0) \) and \( D(0, 3) \). This will be achieved by using the slope from Step 3 and one of the points to find the \( y \)-intercept using the point-slope form of the line equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the slope \( m = -\frac{3}{8} \) and point \( C(8, 0) \), write the equation in point-slope form:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
\[
y - 0 = -\frac{3}{8}(x - 8)
\]
Convert to slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \):
\[
y = -\frac{3}{8}x + \frac{24}{8} = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
\]
The \( y \)-intercept is \( b = 3 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the slope and the \( y \)-intercept of the line through \( C \) and \( D \). This will be achieved by adding the slope from Step 3 and the \( y \)-intercept from Step 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The slope is \( -\frac{3}{8} \), and the \( y \)-intercept is \( 3 \). Compute the sum:
\[
-\frac{3}{8} + 3 = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{24}{8} = \frac{24 - 3}{8} = \frac{21}{8}
\]
The sum of the slope and the \( y \)-intercept is \( \frac{21}{8} \).
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the slope of the line through \( C \) and \( D \). (Completed in Step 3)
  - Subgoal 3: Find the \( y \)-intercept of the line through \( C \) and \( D \). (Completed in Step 4)
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum of the slope and \( y \)-intercept. (Completed in Step 5)

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to compute the sum, which has been achieved. No further subgoals are needed.

**Summary**: The sum of the slope \( -\frac{3}{8} \) and the \( y \)-intercept \( 3 \) is \( \frac{21}{8} \).
