**Problem Statement**: In a diagram, points \(D\) and \(E\) are the midpoints of segments \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{BC}\), respectively. The coordinates of the points are \(A(0,6)\), \(B(0,0)\), \(C(8,0)\), \(D(0,3)\), and \(E(4,0)\). We need to find the sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the line passing through points \(C\) and \(D\).

---

### Step 1: Verify that \(D\) and \(E\) are midpoints
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Confirm that \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) and \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\).
- How to Achieve: Use the midpoint formula \((x_m, y_m) = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\) to check coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \(D\), midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) with \(A(0,6)\) and \(B(0,0)\):
  \[
  x_D = \frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0, \quad y_D = \frac{6 + 0}{2} = 3
  \]
  So, \(D(0,3)\), which matches the given coordinates.
- For \(E\), midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\) with \(B(0,0)\) and \(C(8,0)\):
  \[
  x_E = \frac{0 + 8}{2} = 4, \quad y_E = \frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0
  \]
  So, \(E(4,0)\), which matches the given coordinates.
The coordinates are valid.

### Step 2: Define the goal for finding the line through \(C\) and \(D\)
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
- Break down the goal into subgoals:
  1. Calculate the slope of the line through points \(C(8,0)\) and \(D(0,3)\).
  2. Determine the \(y\)-intercept of this line.
  3. Compute the sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3: Calculate the slope of line \(CD\)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Find the slope of the line through points \(C(8,0)\) and \(D(0,3)\).
- How to Achieve: Use the slope formula \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) with coordinates of \(C\) and \(D\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Points: \(C(8,0)\), \(D(0,3)\).
- Slope:
  \[
  m = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - 8} = \frac{3}{-8} = -\frac{3}{8}
  \]
So, the slope is \(-\frac{3}{8}\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the \(y\)-intercept of line \(CD\)
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Find the \(y\)-intercept of the line through points \(C(8,0)\) and \(D(0,3)\).
- How to Achieve: Use the point-slope form \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with the slope from Step 3 and one point (e.g., \(C\)) to find the \(y\)-intercept by converting to slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Slope: \(m = -\frac{3}{8}\).
- Using point \(C(8,0)\):
  \[
  y - 0 = -\frac{3}{8}(x - 8)
  \]
  \[
  y = -\frac{3}{8}x + \frac{3 \cdot 8}{8} = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
  \]
- Slope-intercept form: \(y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3\).
- The \(y\)-intercept is \(b = 3\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Review progress and organize goals
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- Goal Hierarchy:
  - Main Goal: Find the sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the line through \(C\) and \(D\).
    - Subgoal 1: Calculate the slope (Completed: Slope = \(-\frac{3}{8}\)).
    - Subgoal 2: Calculate the \(y\)-intercept (Completed: \(y\)-intercept = 3).
    - Subgoal 3: Compute the sum of slope and \(y\)-intercept (Pending).
- Current Goal: Compute the sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Compute the sum of slope and \(y\)-intercept
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Find the sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept.
- How to Achieve: Add the slope \(-\frac{3}{8}\) and the \(y\)-intercept 3, converting to a common form if necessary.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Slope: \(-\frac{3}{8}\).
- \(y\)-intercept: 3.
- Convert 3 to a fraction: \(3 = \frac{24}{8}\).
- Sum:
  \[
  -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{24}{8} = \frac{-3 + 24}{8} = \frac{21}{8}
  \]
So, the sum is \(\frac{21}{8}\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validate the final result
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the slope, \(y\)-intercept, and their sum.
- How to Achieve: Recalculate the slope and \(y\)-intercept using an alternative point (e.g., \(D\)) and confirm the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recalculate slope using points \(C(8,0)\) and \(D(0,3)\):
  \[
  m = \frac{0 - 3}{8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{8} = -\frac{3}{8}
  \]
  Matches previous result.
- Recalculate \(y\)-intercept using point \(D(0,3)\):
  \[
  y = -\frac{3}{8}x + b
  \]
  At \(D(0,3)\):
  \[
  3 = -\frac{3}{8} \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 3
  \]
  Matches previous result.
- Sum:
  \[
  -\frac{3}{8} + 3 = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{24}{8} = \frac{21}{8}
  \]
The calculations are consistent.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the line passing through points \(C\) and \(D\) is \(\frac{21}{8}\).
