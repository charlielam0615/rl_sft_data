**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the inequality and find the least integer \( x \).  
1. Solve the absolute value inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) to find the range of possible \( x \) values.  
2. Identify the integer values within this range.  
3. Determine the smallest integer from those values.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the absolute value inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \).  
**How to Achieve**: The inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) means \( -16 \leq 2x + 7 \leq 16 \). Solve this compound inequality by isolating \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the inequality:  
\[ -16 \leq 2x + 7 \leq 16 \]  

Subtract 7 from all parts:  
\[ -16 - 7 \leq 2x \leq 16 - 7 \]  
\[ -23 \leq 2x \leq 9 \]  

Divide all parts by 2:  
\[ -\frac{23}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{9}{2} \]  
\[ -11.5 \leq x \leq 4.5 \]  

The solution to the inequality is \( x \in [-11.5, 4.5] \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the integer values within the range \( [-11.5, 4.5] \).  
**How to Achieve**: List all integers \( x \) such that \( -11.5 \leq x \leq 4.5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The range \( -11.5 \leq x \leq 4.5 \) includes all real numbers from \(-11.5\) to \(4.5\). The integers in this interval are those \( x \) where \( x \geq \lceil -11.5 \rceil = -11 \) and \( x \leq \lfloor 4.5 \rfloor = 4 \).  
Thus, the integers are:  
\[ -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the smallest integer from the list of integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the smallest integer from the set \( \{-11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The integers in the range are \( -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).  
The smallest integer is \( -11 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = -11 \) satisfies the inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) and confirm it is the smallest integer.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = -11 \) into the inequality and check if it holds. Then, test the next smaller integer (\( x = -12 \)) to ensure it does not satisfy the inequality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \( x = -11 \):  
\[ 2(-11) + 7 = -22 + 7 = -15 \]  
\[ |-15| = 15 \leq 16 \]  
This satisfies the inequality.  

Check \( x = -12 \):  
\[ 2(-12) + 7 = -24 + 7 = -17 \]  
\[ |-17| = 17 \not\leq 16 \]  
This does not satisfy the inequality.  

Since \( x = -11 \) satisfies the inequality and \( x = -12 \) does not, \( x = -11 \) is indeed the smallest integer.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the least integer \( x \) such that \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) (completed: \( x \in [-11.5, 4.5] \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify integers in the range \( [-11.5, 4.5] \) (completed: \( -11, -10, \ldots, 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the smallest integer (completed: \( -11 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: \( x = -11 \) satisfies, \( x = -12 \) does not).  

**Current Goal**: Completed (validation confirms \( x = -11 \) is the solution).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The least integer value of \( x \) such that \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) is \( -11 \).
