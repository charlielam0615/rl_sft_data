**Problem Statement**: Find the least integer value of \( x \) such that \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the least integer \( x \) that satisfies the inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \). Subgoals:  
1. Solve the absolute value inequality to find the range of possible \( x \).  
2. Identify all integer values within this range.  
3. Determine the smallest integer from this set.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) to find the range of possible \( x \). This will be achieved by interpreting the absolute value inequality as a compound inequality and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) means:  
\[ -16 \leq 2x + 7 \leq 16 \]  
Subtract 7 from all parts:  
\[ -16 - 7 \leq 2x \leq 16 - 7 \]  
\[ -23 \leq 2x \leq 9 \]  
Divide by 2:  
\[ -\frac{23}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{9}{2} \]  
\[ -11.5 \leq x \leq 4.5 \]  
Thus, \( x \) lies in the interval \([-11.5, 4.5]\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all integer values of \( x \) within the range \([-11.5, 4.5]\). This will be achieved by listing all integers from the lower bound to the upper bound.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The range \([-11.5, 4.5]\) includes all real numbers from \(-11.5\) to \(4.5\). Since \( x \) must be an integer:  
- The lower bound is \(-11.5\), so the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(-11.5\) is \(-11\) (since \(-11 \geq -11.5\)).  
- The upper bound is \(4.5\), so the largest integer less than or equal to \(4.5\) is \(4\) (since \(4 \leq 4.5\)).  
Thus, the possible integers are: \(-11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the integers from \(-11\) to \(4\) satisfy the original inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \). This will be achieved by testing boundary values and confirming the range.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test the boundary integers:  
- For \( x = -11 \): \( 2(-11) + 7 = -22 + 7 = -15 \), so \( | -15 | = 15 \leq 16 \). Valid.  
- For \( x = 4 \): \( 2(4) + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \), so \( |15| = 15 \leq 16 \). Valid.  
- For \( x = -12 \): \( 2(-12) + 7 = -24 + 7 = -17 \), so \( | -17 | = 17 > 16 \). Invalid.  
- For \( x = 5 \): \( 2(5) + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17 \), so \( |17| = 17 > 16 \). Invalid.  
Since \( x \) is continuous within the interval and the inequality is satisfied at the boundaries, all integers from \(-11\) to \(4\) are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the least integer \( x \) from the set of valid integers \([-11, 4]\). This will be achieved by identifying the smallest integer in the list.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The valid integers are \(-11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). The smallest integer is \(-11\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the least integer \( x \) such that \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) (completed: range \([-11.5, 4.5]\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify all integers in the range \([-11.5, 4.5]\) (completed: \(-11\) to \(4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the integer solutions (completed: confirmed \(-11\) to \(4\) are valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Find the least integer (completed: \(-11\)).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the least integer \( x = -11 \) as the final answer.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The least integer value of \( x \) such that \( |2x + 7| \leq 16 \) is \(-11\).
