Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the function machine diagram and process.
2. Apply the operations in sequence to the input value of 10.
3. Determine the comparison result at the "Compare with 18" step.
4. Follow the correct path based on the comparison result.
5. Calculate the final output.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the first operation, "Multiply by 2", to the input value of 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first operation is to multiply the input value by 2. With an input of 10, this operation results in $10 \times 2 = 20$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the result of comparing the value 20 with 18.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
After multiplying the input by 2, the result is 20. The next step is to compare this result with 18. Since 20 is greater than 18, the comparison result is "greater than 18".
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the correct subsequent operation based on the comparison result.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since 20 is greater than 18, the function machine directs the process to the "Subtract 5" operation. Applying this operation to the current value of 20 results in $20 - 5 = 15$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The operations performed so far and the current value in the function machine.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
So far, the input value of 10 was multiplied by 2 to get 20. Then, it was compared with 18, resulting in it being greater than 18. Based on this, the "Subtract 5" operation was applied, resulting in 15.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the final output of the function machine.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The last operation performed was "Subtract 5," which resulted in the value 15. Since the function machine connects this result directly to the output, the final output of the function machine is 15.
[/IMP]
[PLANNING]
Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All steps in the function machine's processing of input 10, including arithmetic operations, comparison logic, and final output determination.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Input Validation**: The problem explicitly states the input is 10. This is correctly used as the starting value.  
2. **First Operation (Multiply by 2)**:  
   - Calculation: $10 \times 2 = 20$.  
   - This is mathematically correct and aligns with the diagram's first block.  
3. **Comparison with 18**:  
   - Result of first operation: 20.  
   - Comparison: $20 > 18$ is true.  
   - The diagram's conditional logic correctly directs the "greater than 18" path to "Subtract 5".  
4. **Second Operation (Subtract 5)**:  
   - Calculation: $20 - 5 = 15$.  
   - This is correct and follows the diagram's specified operation for the "greater than 18" branch.  
5. **Final Output**:  
   - The result of the last operation (15) is directly assigned to the output as per the diagram's flow.  
   - No further operations or conditions are present to modify this value.  

All steps are logically consistent, arithmetic is accurate, and the conditional logic is properly applied. No errors detected.
