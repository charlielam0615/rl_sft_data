**Problem Statement**: Find the number of pairs of positive integers \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve the equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\) for positive integer pairs \((x, y)\).  

1. Recognize that \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((x - y)(x + y) = 51\).  
2. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive integers, determine the possible values for the factors \(x - y\) and \(x + y\).  
3. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) using the factor pairs, ensuring they are positive integers.  
4. Count all valid pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\) as \((x - y)(x + y) = 51\) and identify possible factor pairs for 51. This will be achieved by listing the positive factor pairs of 51 and setting up equations for \(x - y\) and \(x + y\).

Since \(x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 51\), we need to find pairs of positive integers \((a, b)\) such that \(a \cdot b = 51\), where \(a = x - y\) and \(b = x + y\). The positive factor pairs of 51 are:  
- \(1 \cdot 51 = 51\)  
- \(3 \cdot 17 = 51\)  

For each pair \((a, b)\):  
- Solve the system: \(x - y = a\), \(x + y = b\).  
- Add the equations: \((x - y) + (x + y) = a + b \implies 2x = a + b \implies x = \frac{a + b}{2}\).  
- Subtract the equations: \((x + y) - (x - y) = b - a \implies 2y = b - a \implies y = \frac{b - a}{2}\).  
- For \(x\) and \(y\) to be positive integers, \(a + b\) and \(b - a\) must be even, and \(x, y > 0\).  

**Case 1**: \(a = 1\), \(b = 51\)  
- \(x = \frac{1 + 51}{2} = \frac{52}{2} = 26\)  
- \(y = \frac{51 - 1}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25\)  
- Pair: \((x, y) = (26, 25)\)  
- Verify: \(26^2 - 25^2 = 676 - 625 = 51\). Valid.  

**Case 2**: \(a = 3\), \(b = 17\)  
- \(x = \frac{3 + 17}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10\)  
- \(y = \frac{17 - 3}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7\)  
- Pair: \((x, y) = (10, 7)\)  
- Verify: \(10^2 - 7^2 = 100 - 49 = 51\). Valid.  

**Case 3**: \(a = 17\), \(b = 3\)  
- \(x = \frac{17 + 3}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10\)  
- \(y = \frac{3 - 17}{2} = \frac{-14}{2} = -7\)  
- Since \(y\) is negative, this pair is not valid.  

**Case 4**: \(a = 51\), \(b = 1\)  
- \(x = \frac{51 + 1}{2} = \frac{52}{2} = 26\)  
- \(y = \frac{1 - 51}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25\)  
- Since \(y\) is negative, this pair is not valid.  

Since 51 has no other positive factor pairs, the valid pairs are \((26, 25)\) and \((10, 7)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions by checking if any other factor pairs or approaches yield additional valid pairs \((x, y)\). This will be achieved by considering negative factor pairs and rechecking the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To ensure completeness, consider negative factor pairs of 51 (e.g., \((-1) \cdot (-51) = 51\), \((-3) \cdot (-17) = 51\)). However, since \(x - y\) and \(x + y\) represent differences and sums of positive integers, and \(x + y > x - y > 0\), negative factors are unlikely to yield valid solutions. Letâ€™s test:  

**Case 1**: \(a = -1\), \(b = -51\)  
- \(x = \frac{-1 - 51}{2} = \frac{-52}{2} = -26\) (not positive). Invalid.  

**Case 2**: \(a = -3\), \(b = -17\)  
- \(x = \frac{-3 - 17}{2} = \frac{-20}{2} = -10\) (not positive). Invalid.  

No valid pairs arise from negative factors. The positive factor pairs were exhaustively checked in Step 2, and only \((26, 25)\) and \((10, 7)\) satisfy \(x, y > 0\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of positive integer pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Factor the equation as \((x - y)(x + y) = 51\) and identify factor pairs (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) using factor pairs and check for positive integers (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate by checking for other possible solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the valid pairs (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Count the valid pairs \((x, y)\).  
From previous steps, the valid pairs are \((26, 25)\) and \((10, 7)\). Thus, there are 2 pairs.

### Final Answer
There are 2 pairs of positive integers \((x, y)\) that satisfy \(x^2 - y^2 = 51\): \((10, 7)\) and \((26, 25)\).
