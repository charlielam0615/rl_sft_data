### Problem Restatement
We have two infinite geometric series. The first series has a first term of 12 and a second term of 4. The second series has the same first term of 12, a second term of 4 + n, and its sum is four times the sum of the first series. We need to find the value of n.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for n.  
1. Determine the common ratio and sum of the first geometric series using the given first term (12) and second term (4).  
2. Express the common ratio and sum of the second geometric series using the first term (12) and second term (4 + n).  
3. Set up an equation based on the condition that the sum of the second series is four times the sum of the first series.  
4. Solve the equation to find the value of n.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the common ratio and sum of the first geometric series. Achieve this by using the first term (a₁ = 12) and second term (a₂ = 4) to compute the common ratio (r) and then apply the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, S = a₁ / (1 - r), assuming |r| < 1 for convergence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the first series, the first term is a₁ = 12, and the second term is a₂ = 4.  
The second term of a geometric series is given by a₂ = a₁ * r.  
Thus, 4 = 12 * r, so r = 4 / 12 = 1/3.  
Since |r| = |1/3| < 1, the series converges.  
The sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a₁ / (1 - r).  
For the first series:  
S₁ = 12 / (1 - 1/3) = 12 / (2/3) = 12 * 3/2 = 18.  
So, the sum of the first series is 18, and the common ratio is 1/3.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the common ratio and sum of the second geometric series. Use the first term (12) and second term (4 + n) to find the common ratio, then compute the sum using the infinite geometric series formula, ensuring the series converges.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the second series, the first term is a₁ = 12, and the second term is a₂ = 4 + n.  
The second term is a₂ = a₁ * r₂, where r₂ is the common ratio of the second series.  
Thus, 4 + n = 12 * r₂, so r₂ = (4 + n) / 12.  
The sum of the second series is S₂ = a₁ / (1 - r₂), assuming |r₂| < 1 for convergence.  
Substitute a₁ = 12 and r₂ = (4 + n) / 12:  
S₂ = 12 / (1 - (4 + n) / 12) = 12 / ((12 - (4 + n)) / 12) = 12 * 12 / (12 - 4 - n) = 144 / (8 - n).  
So, the sum of the second series is S₂ = 144 / (8 - n), provided |(4 + n) / 12| < 1.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up an equation using the condition that the sum of the second series is four times the sum of the first series, then solve for n. Use the sum of the first series (18) and the sum of the second series (144 / (8 - n)) to form the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The problem states that the sum of the second series is four times the sum of the first series:  
S₂ = 4 * S₁.  
From Step 2, S₁ = 18, so 4 * S₁ = 4 * 18 = 72.  
From Step 3, S₂ = 144 / (8 - n).  
Set up the equation:  
144 / (8 - n) = 72.  
Solve for n:  
144 = 72 * (8 - n).  
Divide both sides by 72:  
144 / 72 = 8 - n.  
2 = 8 - n.  
n = 8 - 2 = 6.  
So, n = 6.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if n = 6 satisfies all conditions, including the convergence of the second series and the sum condition. Substitute n = 6 into the second series’ common ratio and sum, and verify that S₂ = 4 * S₁.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute n = 6 into the second series’ parameters:  
Second term: 4 + n = 4 + 6 = 10.  
Common ratio: r₂ = (4 + n) / 12 = 10 / 12 = 5/6.  
Check convergence: |r₂| = |5/6| ≈ 0.833 < 1, so the series converges.  
Sum of the second series: S₂ = 12 / (1 - 5/6) = 12 / (1/6) = 12 * 6 = 72.  
Check the sum condition: 4 * S₁ = 4 * 18 = 72, which matches S₂ = 72.  
All conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]
