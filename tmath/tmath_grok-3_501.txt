### Problem Restatement
We have two infinite geometric series. The first series has a first term \( a = 12 \) and a second term \( 4 \), so its common ratio is \( r = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \). Its sum is given by the formula for an infinite geometric series, \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \). The second series has the same first term \( a = 12 \), a second term of \( 4 + n \), and its sum is four times the sum of the first series. We need to find the value of \( n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the sum of the first geometric series using the given first term and second term.
2. Determine the common ratio of the second series using its first term (12) and second term (4 + n).
3. Express the sum of the second series using its first term and common ratio.
4. Set up an equation based on the condition that the second series’ sum is four times the first series’ sum.
5. Solve for \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the first geometric series. Achieve this by identifying the first term and common ratio, then applying the infinite geometric series sum formula \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The first series has:
- First term: \( a = 12 \)
- Second term: \( 4 \)
- Common ratio: \( r = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \)

Since \( |r| = \frac{1}{3} < 1 \), the series converges. The sum is:
\[
S_1 = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{12}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{12}{\frac{2}{3}} = 12 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 18
\]
So, the sum of the first series is 18.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to determine the common ratio of the second series. Achieve this by using the first term (12) and second term (4 + n) to compute the ratio \( r_2 = \frac{\text{second term}}{\text{first term}} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second series has:
- First term: \( a = 12 \)
- Second term: \( 4 + n \)

The common ratio is:
\[
r_2 = \frac{4 + n}{12}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to express the sum of the second series. Achieve this by applying the infinite geometric series sum formula \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \) using the first term and the common ratio of the second series.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second series has first term \( a = 12 \) and common ratio \( r_2 = \frac{4 + n}{12} \). Assuming \( \left| \frac{4 + n}{12} \right| < 1 \) for convergence, the sum is:
\[
S_2 = \frac{a}{1 - r_2} = \frac{12}{1 - \frac{4 + n}{12}} = \frac{12}{\frac{12 - (4 + n)}{12}} = \frac{12 \cdot 12}{12 - (4 + n)} = \frac{144}{8 - n}
\]
So, the sum of the second series is \( \frac{144}{8 - n} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to set up an equation using the condition that the second series’ sum is four times the first series’ sum. Achieve this by equating \( S_2 = 4 \cdot S_1 \) and substituting the sums found previously.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of the first series is \( S_1 = 18 \). The sum of the second series is \( S_2 = \frac{144}{8 - n} \). The problem states that \( S_2 = 4 \cdot S_1 \). Thus:
\[
\frac{144}{8 - n} = 4 \cdot 18
\]
\[
\frac{144}{8 - n} = 72
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \frac{144}{8 - n} = 72 \) for \( n \). Achieve this by isolating \( n \) through algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[
\frac{144}{8 - n} = 72
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 8 - n \):
\[
144 = 72 (8 - n)
\]
Divide both sides by 72:
\[
\frac{144}{72} = 8 - n
\]
\[
2 = 8 - n
\]
Solve for \( n \):
\[
n = 8 - 2 = 6
\]
So, \( n = 6 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if \( n = 6 \) satisfies the problem conditions. Achieve this by recomputing the second series’ sum with \( n = 6 \) and verifying that it equals four times the first series’ sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With \( n = 6 \):
- Second term of the second series: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \)
- Common ratio: \( r_2 = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Since \( \left| \frac{5}{6} \right| < 1 \), the series converges.
- Sum of the second series:
\[
S_2 = \frac{12}{1 - \frac{5}{6}} = \frac{12}{\frac{1}{6}} = 12 \cdot 6 = 72
\]
- Sum of the first series: \( S_1 = 18 \)
- Check: \( S_2 = 4 \cdot S_1 \Rightarrow 72 = 4 \cdot 18 = 72 \), which holds.

The solution satisfies the condition.
[/IMP]
