**Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the probability that two 20-sided dice, each with 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and 1 sparkly side, show the same color when rolled.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine the probability of each color appearing on a single die.
2. Calculate the probability of both dice showing the same color for each color.
3. Sum these probabilities to find the total probability of the dice showing the same color.

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the probability of each color appearing on a single die.
How to Achieve: Each die has 20 sides, with 4 maroon, 7 teal, 8 cyan, and 1 sparkly side. Calculate the probability as the number of sides of each color divided by the total number of sides (20).

[IMP]
- Maroon: 4/20 = 1/5
- Teal: 7/20
- Cyan: 8/20 = 2/5
- Sparkly: 1/20

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of both dice showing the same color for each color.
How to Achieve: Since the dice are independent, the probability of both showing the same color is the product of the individual probabilities for each color. Compute this for maroon, teal, cyan, and sparkly.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- Maroon: (4/20) * (4/20) = (1/5) * (1/5) = 1/25
- Teal: (7/20) * (7/20) = 49/400
- Cyan: (8/20) * (8/20) = (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25
- Sparkly: (1/20) * (1/20) = 1/400
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the probabilities to find the total probability of the dice showing the same color.
How to Achieve: Add the probabilities of both dice showing maroon, teal, cyan, or sparkly. Use a common denominator (400) to compute the sum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Convert probabilities:
- Maroon: 1/25 = 16/400
- Teal: 49/400
- Cyan: 4/25 = 64/400
- Sparkly: 1/400
Total: (16/400) + (49/400) + (64/400) + (1/400) = 130/400 = 13/40
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the total probability calculation.
How to Achieve: Ensure the sum of individual probabilities is correct by recomputing and checking for errors. Confirm the denominator and numerator alignment.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Recompute:
- Maroon: 4/20 * 4/20 = 16/400
- Teal: 7/20 * 7/20 = 49/400
- Cyan: 8/20 * 8/20 = 64/400
- Sparkly: 1/20 * 1/20 = 1/400
Sum: 16 + 49 + 64 + 1 = 130
Total: 130/400 = 13/40
The calculation is consistent.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The probability that both dice show the same color is 13/40.
