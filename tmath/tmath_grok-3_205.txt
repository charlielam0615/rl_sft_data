**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( 2^{-x} \) given the equation \( 64^5 = 32^x \), and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( 64^5 = 32^x \) for \( 2^{-x} \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express 64 and 32 as powers of 2 to rewrite the equation.  
2. Equate the exponents to solve for \( x \).  
3. Compute \( 2^{-x} \) using the value of \( x \).  
4. Express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite 64 and 32 as powers of 2 and equate the exponents to solve for \( x \). This will be achieved by expressing both sides of the equation \( 64^5 = 32^x \) in terms of base 2, then setting the exponents equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite 64 and 32 as powers of 2:  
- \( 64 = 2^6 \), so \( 64^5 = (2^6)^5 = 2^{6 \cdot 5} = 2^{30} \).  
- \( 32 = 2^5 \), so \( 32^x = (2^5)^x = 2^{5x} \).  

The equation becomes:  
\[ 2^{30} = 2^{5x} \].  

Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 30 = 5x \].  

Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \].

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution for \( x \) by substituting \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 6 \) into \( 64^5 = 32^x \):  
- Left side: \( 64^5 = (2^6)^5 = 2^{30} \).  
- Right side: \( 32^6 = (2^5)^6 = 2^{5 \cdot 6} = 2^{30} \).  

Since \( 2^{30} = 2^{30} \), the solution \( x = 6 \) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 2^{-x} \) using \( x = 6 \) and express the result as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( 2^{-x} \):  
\[ x = 6 \], so \[ 2^{-x} = 2^{-6} \].  

Express as a fraction:  
\[ 2^{-6} = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64} \].

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( 2^{-x} \) given \( 64^5 = 32^x \), expressed as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite 64 and 32 as powers of 2 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x \) by equating exponents (completed, \( x = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution for \( x \) (completed, solution verified).
