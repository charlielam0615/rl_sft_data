**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the value of \(2^{-x}\) as a common fraction, given that \(64^5 = 32^x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express 64 and 32 as powers of 2 to rewrite the equation \(64^5 = 32^x\).  
2. Solve for \(x\) by equating the exponents of the same base.  
3. Compute \(2^{-x}\) using the value of \(x\).  
4. Express \(2^{-x}\) as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite \(64^5 = 32^x\) using base 2.  
How to Achieve: Express 64 and 32 as powers of 2, then rewrite the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \(64 = 2^6\) and \(32 = 2^5\), we can rewrite the equation:  
\(64^5 = (2^6)^5 = 2^{6 \cdot 5} = 2^{30}\),  
\(32^x = (2^5)^x = 2^{5x}\).  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\(2^{30} = 2^{5x}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(2^{30} = 2^{5x}\).  
How to Achieve: Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents and solve for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \(2^{30} = 2^{5x}\), equate the exponents:  
\(30 = 5x\).  
Solving for \(x\):  
\(x = \frac{30}{5} = 6\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution for \(x\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 6\) back into the original equation to check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 6\):  
Left side: \(64^5 = (2^6)^5 = 2^{30}\).  
Right side: \(32^6 = (2^5)^6 = 2^{5 \cdot 6} = 2^{30}\).  
Since \(2^{30} = 2^{30}\), the solution \(x = 6\) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(2^{-x}\) using \(x = 6\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 6\) into \(2^{-x}\) and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \(x = 6\), compute:  
\(2^{-x} = 2^{-6}\).  
Since \(2^{-6} = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64}\), we have:  
\(2^{-x} = \frac{1}{64}\).  
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(2^{-x}\) as a common fraction given \(64^5 = 32^x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite \(64^5 = 32^x\) using base 2 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \(x\) (completed, \(x = 6\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(2^{-x}\) (completed, \(2^{-x} = \frac{1}{64}\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Express \(2^{-x}\) as a common fraction (completed, \(\frac{1}{64}\)).  
Current Goal: Confirm the final answer is in the correct format.  
The result \(\frac{1}{64}\) is a common fraction, satisfying the problemâ€™s requirement.

### Final Answer
The value of \(2^{-x}\) is \(\frac{1}{64}\).  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{64}} \]
