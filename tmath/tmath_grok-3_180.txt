**Problem Statement**: We need to find the range of the function \( f(x) = ax + b \), where \( a < 0 \), and the function is defined only for \( x \in [0, 1] \). The range should be expressed in interval notation in terms of \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for the range of \( f(x) = ax + b \) over \( x \in [0, 1] \), we need to determine the set of all possible values of \( f(x) \). Since \( f(x) \) is a linear function, we can break this down into the following subgoals:
1. Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints of the domain, \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), to find the boundary values.
2. Determine the behavior of \( f(x) \) over the interval, considering the sign of \( a \).
3. Identify the minimum and maximum values of \( f(x) \) to express the range in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), and analyze the function’s behavior.

**How to Achieve**: Compute \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \) to find the values of the function at the boundaries. Since \( f(x) = ax + b \) is linear, the range will be determined by the values at the endpoints, and we need to consider the effect of \( a < 0 \) on the function’s behavior.

[IMP]
Evaluate the function at the endpoints:
- At \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = a \cdot 0 + b = b \).
- At \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = a \cdot 1 + b = a + b \).

Since \( f(x) = ax + b \) is a linear function, it is continuous and monotonic over \( [0, 1] \). The slope \( a \) determines whether the function is increasing or decreasing:
- Given \( a < 0 \), the function is decreasing (as \( x \) increases, \( ax \) becomes more negative, reducing \( f(x) \)).

For a decreasing function, the maximum value occurs at the left endpoint (\( x = 0 \)), and the minimum occurs at the right endpoint (\( x = 1 \)). Thus:
- Maximum value: \( f(0) = b \).
- Minimum value: \( f(1) = a + b \).

Since \( a < 0 \), we note that \( a + b < b \), confirming that \( f(1) < f(0) \), consistent with a decreasing function.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that the range is determined by the endpoint values and express it correctly.

**How to Achieve**: Check if the function’s monotonicity ensures all values between \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \) are achieved, and express the range in interval notation based on the minimum and maximum values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( f(x) = ax + b \) is linear and continuous on the closed interval \( [0, 1] \), it achieves all values between its minimum and maximum. For a decreasing function (\( a < 0 \)):
- The function starts at \( f(0) = b \) (maximum) and ends at \( f(1) = a + b \) (minimum).
- The range is all values from the minimum to the maximum, i.e., from \( a + b \) to \( b \).

In interval notation, the range is \( [a + b, b] \), assuming \( a + b \leq b \), which holds since \( a < 0 \). To ensure correctness:
- If \( a + b = b \), then \( a = 0 \), which contradicts \( a < 0 \). Thus, \( a + b < b \), and the interval \( [a + b, b] \) is non-degenerate.
- The interval is closed because the endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) are included in the domain.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the range of \( f(x) = ax + b \) for \( x \in [0, 1] \) in interval notation.
  - Subgoal 1: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the behavior of \( f(x) \) based on \( a < 0 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the minimum and maximum values and express the range (completed).

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to validate the range, which has been addressed. The range has been determined as \( [a + b, b] \).

All subgoals are complete, and the main goal is achieved.

### Final Answer
The range of \( f(x) = ax + b \), where \( a < 0 \) and \( x \in [0, 1] \), is \( [a + b, b] \).
