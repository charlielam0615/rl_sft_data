**Problem Statement**: We need to find the range of the function \( f(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, \( a < 0 \), and the function is defined only for \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 1] \). The range should be expressed in interval notation in terms of \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the range of \( f(x) = ax + b \) over \( [0, 1] \), we need to determine the set of all possible values of \( f(x) \). Since \( f(x) \) is a linear function and the domain is a closed interval, we can break this down into subgoals:  
1. Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints of the domain \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).  
2. Analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) over \( [0, 1] \) considering \( a < 0 \).  
3. Determine the minimum and maximum values of \( f(x) \) to form the range in interval notation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( f(0) = b \) and \( f(1) = a + b \). These values will help identify the potential minimum and maximum of the function over the interval.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( x = 0 \), we have:  
\[ f(0) = a \cdot 0 + b = b \]  

For \( x = 1 \), we have:  
\[ f(1) = a \cdot 1 + b = a + b \]  

These are the values of the function at the boundaries of the domain.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) over \( [0, 1] \) to determine the minimum and maximum values, considering \( a < 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( f(x) = ax + b \) is a linear function, its graph is a straight line. The slope \( a < 0 \) implies the function is decreasing. Thus, the maximum value occurs at the smallest \( x \) (i.e., \( x = 0 \)), and the minimum value occurs at the largest \( x \) (i.e., \( x = 1 \)). We will use the endpoint values from Step 2 to confirm this.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( a < 0 \), the function \( f(x) = ax + b \) is decreasing over \( [0, 1] \). This means:  
- At \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = b \), which is the maximum value.  
- At \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = a + b \), which is the minimum value because the negative slope \( a \) reduces the function value as \( x \) increases.  

To confirm, the slope of the function is \( a \), and since \( a < 0 \), for \( x_1 < x_2 \), we have \( f(x_1) > f(x_2) \). Thus, the function decreases from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the range is determined by the endpoint values and that no other values outside \( [f(1), f(0)] \) are possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the function is continuous on \( [0, 1] \) and confirm that all values between \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \) are achieved, given the function’s linearity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = ax + b \) is linear and thus continuous on the closed interval \( [0, 1] \). Since it is decreasing (\( a < 0 \)), \( f(x) \) takes on all values between \( f(0) = b \) and \( f(1) = a + b \). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, for any \( y \) between \( f(1) \) and \( f(0) \), there exists an \( x \in [0, 1] \) such that \( f(x) = y \). Since \( f(1) = a + b < b = f(0) \) (because \( a < 0 \)), the range is the interval from the minimum \( f(1) \) to the maximum \( f(0) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the range of \( f(x) = ax + b \) over \( [0, 1] \) in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) (completed: \( f(0) = b \), \( f(1) = a + b \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) considering \( a < 0 \) (completed: function is decreasing, so \( f(0) \) is max, \( f(1) \) is min).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the range using the minimum and maximum values (in progress: use endpoint values).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate that the range is correct (completed: function is continuous, covers all values between endpoints).  

**Current Goal**: Finalize the range in interval notation using the minimum (\( f(1) = a + b \)) and maximum (\( f(0) = b \)).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the range of \( f(x) \) in interval notation using the minimum and maximum values.  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( f(x) \) is decreasing, the range is from the minimum value \( f(1) = a + b \) to the maximum value \( f(0) = b \). Express this as a closed interval \( [a + b, b] \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) \) is decreasing over \( [0, 1] \), with:  
- Minimum value at \( x = 1 \): \( f(1) = a + b \).  
- Maximum value at \( x = 0 \): \( f(0) = b \).  

Since \( a < 0 \), \( a + b < b \), so the range of \( f(x) \) is all values from \( a + b \) to \( b \), inclusive. In interval notation, the range is:  
\[ [a + b, b] \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that the range \( [a + b, b] \) is correct and accounts for all possible values of \( f(x) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the endpoint values and the function’s behavior to ensure no values outside \( [a + b, b] \) are possible and that the interval is properly formatted.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate:  
- At \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = b \).  
- At \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = a + b \).  
- Since \( a < 0 \), \( a + b < b \), so \( f(1) < f(0) \).  
- The function is linear and continuous, so it takes all values between \( a + b \) and \( b \).  
- The interval \( [a + b, b] \) is closed because the endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) are included in the domain.  

No values outside this interval are possible since \( f(x) \) is strictly decreasing and bounded by the endpoints. The range \( [a + b, b] \) is correctly formatted in interval notation.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The range of \( f(x) = ax + b \) for \( 0 \le x \le 1 \) and \( a < 0 \) is:  
\[ [a + b, b] \]
