### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the slope of the line using the given points.  
2. Determine the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (\(y = mx + b\)).  
3. Find the \(y\)-intercept by setting \(x = 0\) in the line equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the slope of the line passing through \((2, 16)\) and \((-8, -4)\). Use the slope formula \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) to compute the slope.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the points \((2, 16)\) and \((-8, -4)\):  
- \(x_1 = 2\), \(y_1 = 16\), \(x_2 = -8\), \(y_2 = -4\).  
- Slope \(m = \frac{-4 - 16}{-8 - 2} = \frac{-20}{-10} = 2\).  
The slope of the line is \(2\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (\(y = mx + b\)) using the slope from Step 2 and one of the given points. Use the point \((2, 16)\) to solve for the \(y\)-intercept \(b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The slope \(m = 2\). Using the point \((2, 16)\) in the equation \(y = mx + b\):  
- \(16 = 2 \cdot 2 + b\).  
- \(16 = 4 + b\).  
- \(b = 16 - 4 = 12\).  
The equation of the line is \(y = 2x + 12\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the \(y\)-intercept by setting \(x = 0\) in the line equation \(y = 2x + 12\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(y = 2x + 12\):  
- \(y = 2 \cdot 0 + 12 = 12\).  
The line intersects the \(y\)-axis at the point \((0, 12)\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the \(y\)-intercept by using the second point \((-8, -4)\) in the line equation \(y = 2x + 12\) to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \((-8, -4)\) into \(y = 2x + 12\):  
- Left side: \(y = -4\).  
- Right side: \(2 \cdot (-8) + 12 = -16 + 12 = -4\).  
The point satisfies the equation, confirming the line equation is correct. The \(y\)-intercept at \((0, 12)\) is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the point where the line through \((2, 16)\) and \((-8, -4)\) intersects the \(y\)-axis.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the slope of the line (completed: slope = 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the line equation (completed: \(y = 2x + 12\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the \(y\)-intercept (completed: \((0, 12)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified using point \((-8, -4)\)).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The line intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 12)\).
