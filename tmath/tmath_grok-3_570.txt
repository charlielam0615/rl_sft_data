**Problem Statement**: Find the point where the line passing through the points (2, 16) and (-8, -4) intersects the y-axis.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the y-intercept, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Find the slope of the line using the given points.  
2. Use the slope and one point to determine the line’s equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).  
3. Identify the y-intercept by finding the point where x = 0.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the slope of the line using the points (2, 16) and (-8, -4).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the slope formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \) with the given points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the slope formula:  
\( m = \frac{-4 - 16}{-8 - 2} = \frac{-20}{-10} = 2 \).  
The slope of the line is 2.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the line’s equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) using the slope and one point.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the slope \( m = 2 \) and one point, e.g., (2, 16), into the slope-intercept equation to solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the point (2, 16) and slope \( m = 2 \):  
\( y = mx + b \implies 16 = 2 \cdot 2 + b \implies 16 = 4 + b \implies b = 12 \).  
The line’s equation is \( y = 2x + 12 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find the y-intercept by determining the point where the line intersects the y-axis (x = 0).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the line’s equation \( y = 2x + 12 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 0 \):  
\( y = 2 \cdot 0 + 12 = 12 \).  
The line intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 12).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the y-intercept by checking if the line’s equation satisfies both given points.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute both points (2, 16) and (-8, -4) into \( y = 2x + 12 \) and confirm they hold.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For (2, 16):  
\( y = 2 \cdot 2 + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16 \). This satisfies the equation.  
For (-8, -4):  
\( y = 2 \cdot (-8) + 12 = -16 + 12 = -4 \). This satisfies the equation.  
The equation \( y = 2x + 12 \) is valid, confirming the y-intercept at (0, 12).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the point where the line through (2, 16) and (-8, -4) intersects the y-axis.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the slope of the line (completed: slope = 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the line’s equation (completed: \( y = 2x + 12 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the y-intercept (completed: (0, 12)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: equation satisfies both points).  
**Current Goal**: Completed – the y-intercept is (0, 12).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The line intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 12).
