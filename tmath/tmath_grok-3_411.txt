**Problem Restatement**: Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. Steve took 24 minutes to run 3 miles. We need to determine how many minutes it would take Jordan to run 5 miles, assuming both maintain their respective running rates.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate Steve’s running speed (miles per minute).  
2. Determine the time Jordan took to run 2 miles based on the given relationship (half the time Steve took for 3 miles).  
3. Calculate Jordan’s running speed.  
4. Use Jordan’s speed to find the time to run 5 miles.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate Steve’s running speed.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the distance Steve ran (3 miles) by the time taken (24 minutes) to find his speed in miles per minute.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Steve’s speed = 3 miles / 24 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the time Jordan took to run 2 miles.  
**How to Achieve**: Since Jordan’s time for 2 miles is half the time Steve took for 3 miles, calculate half of Steve’s time (24 minutes).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Steve’s time for 3 miles = 24 minutes.  
Jordan’s time for 2 miles = 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate Jordan’s running speed.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the distance Jordan ran (2 miles) by the time taken (12 minutes) to find his speed in miles per minute.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Jordan’s speed = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the time for Jordan to run 5 miles.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the distance (5 miles) by Jordan’s speed (0.1667 miles per minute) to find the time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Time for Jordan to run 5 miles = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Check calculations and ensure the relationship between Jordan’s and Steve’s times holds. Recalculate Jordan’s time for 2 miles using his speed and confirm consistency with the problem’s conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Jordan’s speed = 0.1667 miles per minute.  
Time to run 2 miles = 2 / (1/6) = 12 minutes, which matches the earlier result.  
Steve’s time for 3 miles = 24 minutes, and Jordan’s time for 2 miles = 12 minutes, satisfying the condition that Jordan’s time is half of Steve’s.  
The calculation for 5 miles: 5 / (1/6) = 30 minutes is consistent.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the time for Jordan to run 5 miles.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Steve’s running speed (completed: 0.125 miles/min).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine Jordan’s time for 2 miles (completed: 12 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate Jordan’s running speed (completed: 0.1667 miles/min).
