**Problem Statement**: Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. Steve took 24 minutes to run 3 miles. Using the same rates, we need to determine how many minutes it would take Jordan to run 5 miles.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate Steve's running speed (miles per minute).  
2. Determine the time Jordan took to run 2 miles based on the relationship that Jordan's time is half of Steve's time for 3 miles.  
3. Calculate Jordan's running speed.  
4. Use Jordan's speed to find the time required to run 5 miles.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Steve's running speed. This can be achieved by dividing the distance Steve ran (3 miles) by the time taken (24 minutes).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Steve ran 3 miles in 24 minutes.  
Speed = Distance / Time = 3 miles / 24 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the time Jordan took to run 2 miles, given that it is half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. Since Steve’s time is 24 minutes, compute half of this time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Steve took 24 minutes to run 3 miles.  
Jordan’s time for 2 miles is half of Steve’s time: 24 minutes / 2 = 12 minutes.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate Jordan’s running speed using the distance (2 miles) and time (12 minutes) from the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes.  
Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute ≈ 0.1667 miles per minute.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system:  
- Main goal: Find the time for Jordan to run 5 miles.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Steve’s speed (completed: 0.125 miles per minute).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine Jordan’s time for 2 miles (completed: 12 minutes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate Jordan’s speed (completed: 1/6 miles per minute).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate time for Jordan to run 5 miles (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to calculate the time for Jordan to run 5 miles. Previous steps established:  
- Steve’s speed: 0.125 miles per minute.  
- Jordan’s time for 2 miles: 12 minutes.  
- Jordan’s speed: 1/6 miles per minute.  
These provide the necessary information to compute the time for 5 miles using Jordan’s speed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time for Jordan to run 5 miles using Jordan’s speed (1/6 miles per minute). Divide the distance (5 miles) by the speed to find the time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Jordan’s speed = 1/6 miles per minute.  
Time = Distance / Speed = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the calculated time (30 minutes for Jordan to run 5 miles) is consistent with the problem’s conditions. Recalculate Jordan’s speed using an alternative method (e.g., comparing rates relative to Steve) and verify the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Steve’s speed = 3 miles / 24 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.  
- Jordan ran 2 miles in half of Steve’s time (12 minutes), so Jordan’s speed = 2 / 12 = 1/6 miles per minute.  
- Alternatively, since Jordan’s time for 2 miles is half of Steve’s time for 3 miles, compare relative rates: Steve’s rate = 3/24 = 1/8 miles per minute; Jordan’s rate for 2 miles in 12 minutes = 2/12 = 1/6 miles per minute.  
- Time for 5 miles = 5 / (1/6) = 30 minutes.  
- Cross-check: If Jordan’s speed is 1/6 miles per minute, then 5 miles * 6 minutes/mile = 30 minutes, which matches.  
The calculations are consistent.

**Final Answer**: Jordan would take 30 minutes to run 5 miles.
