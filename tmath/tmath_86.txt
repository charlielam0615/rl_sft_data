Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve $ -x - 3 = 0 $ for $ x \le 1 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Solving $ -x - 3 = 0 $:
$$
-x - 3 = 0 \\
-x = 3 \\
x = -3
$$
Since $ x = -3 $ is less than or equal to 1, it satisfies the domain condition.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve $ \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 $ for $ x > 1 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Solving $ \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 $:
$$
\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 \\
\frac{x}{2} = -1 \\
x = -2
$$
However, $ x = -2 $ is not greater than 1, so it does not satisfy the domain condition.

I am listing relevant information for the solutions to $ f(x) = 0 $:  
- For $ -x - 3 = 0 $, we found $ x = -3 $, which satisfies $ x \le 1 $.  
- For $ \frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0 $, we found $ x = -2 $, which does not satisfy $ x > 1 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Sum all valid solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The only valid solution is $ x = -3 $. Since there are no other valid solutions, the sum of all values of $ x $ such that $ f(x) = 0 $ is simply $ -3 $.  
$$
\text{Sum} = -3
$$

Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Review the previously computed solutions to $ f(x) = 0 $.  
2. Perform backward subgoaling to re-examine the logic and verify correctness.  
   2.1. Confirm the validity of solving each piecewise equation.  
   2.2. Ensure domain conditions are correctly applied.  
3. Conduct a final verification of the sum of valid solutions.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Re-examining the entire solution process for logical consistency and mathematical correctness.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **First subgoal (x ≤ 1):**  
   - Equation: $-x - 3 = 0$.  
   - Solution: $x = -3$.  
   - Domain check: $-3 \leq 1$ → Valid.  
   - Correctness: The algebra is straightforward. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -3$, and the domain condition is satisfied.  

2. **Second subgoal (x > 1):**  
   - Equation: $\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0$.  
   - Solution: $x = -2$.  
   - Domain check: $-2 > 1$ → Invalid.  
   - Correctness: The solution $x = -2$ is mathematically valid for the equation but violates the domain constraint. No mistake in rejecting it.  

3. **Summation of valid solutions:**  
   - Only $x = -3$ is valid. Sum = $-3$.  
   - Correctness: Since there are no other solutions to sum, the result is accurate.  

4. **Overall logic:**  
   - The piecewise function was split correctly into cases.  
   - Domain conditions were applied rigorously.  
   - No alternative solutions or edge cases were overlooked (e.g., $x = 1$ is explicitly covered in the first case and does not yield a solution).  

**Conclusion:** All steps are logically sound and mathematically correct.
