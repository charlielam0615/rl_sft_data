### Problem Restatement
We need to find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates of point $P$ that lies on the line $x = -3$ and is 10 units away from the point $(5, 2)$. Since $P$ is on $x = -3$, its coordinates are $(-3, y)$. The distance between $P(-3, y)$ and $(5, 2)$ is 10 units. We will calculate the possible $y$-coordinates and find their product.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Express the distance condition using the coordinates of $P(-3, y)$ and $(5, 2)$.  
2. Set up an equation based on the distance being 10 units.  
3. Solve the equation to find possible $y$-coordinates.  
4. Compute the product of all $y$-coordinates.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the distance equation. Achieve this by applying the distance formula between points $P(-3, y)$ and $(5, 2)$, setting the distance equal to 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use the distance formula:  
\[
\sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2} = 10
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (y - 2)^2} = 10
\]  
\[
\sqrt{64 + (y - 2)^2} = 10
\]  
Square both sides:  
\[
64 + (y - 2)^2 = 100
\]  
\[
(y - 2)^2 = 36
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation $(y - 2)^2 = 36$ to find all possible $y$-coordinates. Achieve this by taking the square root of both sides and solving for $y$.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[
(y - 2)^2 = 36
\]  
\[
y - 2 = \pm 6
\]  
\[
y - 2 = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 2 = -6
\]  
\[
y = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -4
\]  
The possible $y$-coordinates are $y = 8$ and $y = -4$.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that $y = 8$ and $y = -4$ satisfy the distance condition. Achieve this by substituting each $y$-value into the distance formula and checking if the distance equals 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For $y = 8$, point $P$ is $(-3, 8)$:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]  
Valid.  

For $y = -4$, point $P$ is $(-3, -4)$:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + ((-4) - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]  
Valid.  

Both $y = 8$ and $y = -4$ satisfy the condition.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the product of all possible $y$-coordinates, which are $y = 8$ and $y = -4$. Achieve this by multiplying the $y$-values.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Product of $y$-coordinates:  
\[
8 \times (-4) = -32
\]  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
