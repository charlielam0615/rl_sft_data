**Problem Statement**: Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates of point $P$ that lies on the line $x = -3$ and is 10 units away from the point $(5, 2)$.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the coordinates of point $P$ given it lies on $x = -3$.  
2. Use the distance formula to find the $y$-coordinates of $P$ such that the distance from $P$ to $(5, 2)$ is 10 units.  
3. Calculate the product of all possible $y$-coordinates.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the coordinates of point $P$ and set up the distance equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Since $P$ lies on the line $x = -3$, its coordinates are $(-3, y)$. Use the distance formula between $P(-3, y)$ and $(5, 2)$ to form an equation where the distance equals 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since $P$ has coordinates $(-3, y)$ and the distance to $(5, 2)$ is 10, apply the distance formula:  
\[
\sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2} = 10
\]
Simplify the $x$-coordinate difference:  
\[
(-3 - 5)^2 = (-8)^2 = 64
\]
The equation becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{64 + (y - 2)^2} = 10
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[
64 + (y - 2)^2 = 100
\]
Subtract 64 from both sides:  
\[
(y - 2)^2 = 36
\]
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[
y - 2 = \pm 6
\]
Solve for $y$:  
\[
y - 2 = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 2 = -6
\]
\[
y = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -4
\]
Thus, the possible $y$-coordinates of $P$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -4$.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the $y$-coordinates $y = 8$ and $y = -4$ satisfy the distance condition.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each $y$-coordinate into the distance formula to confirm the distance from $P(-3, y)$ to $(5, 2)$ is 10 units.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
**Check $y = 8$**:  
Coordinates of $P$ are $(-3, 8)$. Distance to $(5, 2)$:  
\[
\sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]
This satisfies the condition.  

**Check $y = -4$**:  
Coordinates of $P$ are $(-3, -4)$. Distance to $(5, 2)$:  
\[
\sqrt{((-3) - 5)^2 + ((-4) - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]
This also satisfies the condition.  

Both $y = 8$ and $y = -4$ are valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates of point $P$ that lies on $x = -3$ and is 10 units from $(5, 2)$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the coordinates of $P$ (completed: $P(-3, y)$).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find $y$-coordinates using the distance formula (completed: $y = 8, -4$).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the product of all possible $y$-coordinates (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the product of the $y$-coordinates $y = 8$ and $y = -4$.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the product of the $y$-coordinates.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the $y$-coordinates obtained ($y = 8$ and $y = -4$).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The possible $y$-coordinates are $y = 8$ and $y = -4$. Their product is:  
\[
8 \times (-4) = -32
\]
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The product of all possible $y$-coordinates is $-32$.
