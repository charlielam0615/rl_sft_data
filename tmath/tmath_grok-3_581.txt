**Problem Statement**: Bill can buy jags at $1 each, jigs at $2 each, and jogs at $7 each. He must buy at least one of each item and spend exactly $50. Determine the largest number of jogs he can purchase.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the largest number of jogs Bill can buy while spending exactly $50 and purchasing at least one jag, one jig, and one jog, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define the variables and constraints based on the problem.  
2. Set up an equation to represent the total cost.  
3. Maximize the number of jogs while satisfying the constraints.  
4. Verify the solution ensures at least one of each item and exact expenditure.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define the variables and set up the cost equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Assign variables to the number of jags, jigs, and jogs, and formulate an equation based on their costs and the total budget of $50.  

[IMP]  
Let:  
- \( x \) = number of jags ($1 each),  
- \( y \) = number of jigs ($2 each),  
- \( z \) = number of jogs ($7 each).  

The total cost must be exactly $50, and Bill must buy at least one of each item:  
\[ x \cdot 1 + y \cdot 2 + z \cdot 7 = 50 \]  
\[ x, y, z \geq 1 \] (since at least one of each item is required).  
Additionally, \( x, y, z \) must be non-negative integers, as Bill cannot buy a fraction of an item. The goal is to maximize \( z \), the number of jogs.

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the goal is to maximize the number of jogs (\( z \)), adjust the approach to focus on testing high values of \( z \) first, as jogs are the most expensive item at $7 each. Reformulate the subgoals:  
1. Express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( z \) using the cost equation.  
2. Test integer values of \( z \) starting from the maximum possible, ensuring \( x, y \geq 1 \).  
3. Validate solutions to ensure they meet the $50 total and integer constraints.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( z \) and determine the maximum possible \( z \).  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the cost equation to isolate \( x \) and \( y \), estimate the maximum \( z \), and test values to find the largest \( z \) that satisfies all constraints.  

[IMP]  
From the cost equation:  
\[ x + 2y + 7z = 50 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = 50 - 2y - 7z \]  
Since \( x \geq 1 \):  
\[ 50 - 2y - 7z \geq 1 \]  
\[ 2y + 7z \leq 49 \]  
Also, \( y \geq 1 \). To maximize \( z \), estimate the upper bound for \( z \):  
If \( y = 1 \) (minimum), then:  
\[ 2 \cdot 1 + 7z \leq 49 \]  
\[ 7z \leq 47 \]  
\[ z \leq \lfloor 47/7 \rfloor = 6 \]  
Thus, \( z \leq 6 \). Start with \( z = 6 \) and work downward, ensuring \( x, y \geq 1 \) and all are integers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Test integer values of \( z \) starting from 6 to find the largest \( z \) that satisfies the equation and constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( z \) values into \( x = 50 - 2y - 7z \), ensure \( x, y \geq 1 \), and check if \( x \) is an integer.  

[IMP]  
Test \( z = 6 \):  
\[ 2y + 7 \cdot 6 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y + 42 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y \leq 7 \]  
\[ y \leq 3.5 \]  
Since \( y \) is an integer and \( y \geq 1 \), try \( y = 1, 2, 3 \):  
- For \( y = 1 \):  
  \[ x = 50 - 2 \cdot 1 - 7 \cdot 6 = 50 - 2 - 42 = 6 \]  
  Solution: \( x = 6, y = 1, z = 6 \). Check:  
  \[ 6 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 7 = 6 + 2 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Valid, satisfies \( x, y, z \geq 1 \).  
- For \( y = 2 \):  
  \[ x = 50 - 2 \cdot 2 - 7 \cdot 6 = 50 - 4 - 42 = 4 \]  
  Solution: \( x = 4, y = 2, z = 6 \). Check:  
  \[ 4 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 7 = 4 + 4 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Valid.  
- For \( y = 3 \):  
  \[ x = 50 - 2 \cdot 3 - 7 \cdot 6 = 50 - 6 - 42 = 2 \]  
  Solution: \( x = 2, y = 3, z = 6 \). Check:  
  \[ 2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 7 = 2 + 6 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Valid.  

Test \( z = 5 \):  
\[ 2y + 7 \cdot 5 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y + 35 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y \leq 14 \]  
\[ y \leq 7 \]  
Try \( y = 1 \):  
\[ x = 50 - 2 \cdot 1 - 7 \cdot 5 = 50 - 2 - 35 = 13 \]  
Solution: \( x = 13, y = 1, z = 5 \). Check:  
\[ 13 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 7 = 13 + 2 + 35 = 50 \]  
Valid.  

Test \( z = 7 \):  
\[ 2y + 7 \cdot 7 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y + 49 \leq 49 \]  
\[ 2y \leq 0 \]  
Since \( y \geq 1 \), this is impossible. Thus, \( z = 7 \) is not feasible.  

Since \( z = 6 \) is the largest value yielding valid solutions, the maximum number of jogs is 6.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the largest number of jogs Bill can buy while spending exactly $50 and buying at least one jag, jig, and jog.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up the cost equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( z \) to maximize \( z \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Test integer values of \( z \) to find the maximum feasible value (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions to ensure constraints are met (in progress).  
**Current Goal**: Validate the solutions for \( z = 6 \) and confirm it is the maximum.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the solutions for \( z = 6 \) and confirm no higher \( z \) is possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Recheck the solutions for \( z = 6 \), test \( z = 5 \) and lower values briefly, and confirm \( z = 7 \) is infeasible to ensure \( z = 6 \) is the maximum.  

[IMP]  
From Step 5, valid solutions for \( z = 6 \):  
- \( x = 6, y = 1, z = 6 \): \( 6 + 2 + 42 = 50 \).  
- \( x = 4, y = 2, z = 6 \): \( 4 + 4 + 42 = 50 \).  
- \( x = 2, y = 3, z = 6 \): \( 2 + 6 + 42 = 50 \).  
All satisfy \( x, y, z \geq 1 \) and total $50.  

For \( z = 5 \), a valid solution exists (e.g., \( x = 13, y = 1, z = 5 \)), but \( z = 5 < 6 \).  
For \( z = 7 \), we found \( 2y + 49 \leq 49 \), which is impossible since \( y \geq 1 \).  
No higher \( z \) is feasible, confirming \( z = 6 \) is the maximum.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the maximum number of jogs and the constraints ensuring at least one of each item and exact $50 expenditure.  

[REVIEW]  
- The cost equation is \( x + 2y + 7z = 50 \), with \( x, y, z \geq 1 \) (Step 2).  
- The maximum \( z \leq 6 \) was derived from \( 2y + 7z \leq 49 \) (Step 4).  
- Valid solutions for \( z = 6 \): \( (x=6, y=1, z=6) \), \( (x=4, y=2, z=6) \), \( (x=2, y=3, z=6) \) (Step 5).  
- \( z = 7 \) is infeasible; \( z = 5 \) is feasible but lower (Steps 5, 7).  
The largest number of jogs is 6.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The largest number of jogs Bill can purchase is **6**.
