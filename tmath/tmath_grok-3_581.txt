### Problem Statement
Bill can purchase jags for $1 each, jigs for $2 each, and jogs for $7 each. He must buy at least one of each item and spend exactly $50. The goal is to determine the largest number of jogs he can purchase.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the maximum number of jogs while satisfying the constraints.  
1. Define variables: Let \( x \) be the number of jags, \( y \) the number of jigs, and \( z \) the number of jogs.  
2. Set up the equation based on the total cost: \( 1x + 2y + 7z = 50 \).  
3. Ensure constraints: \( x \geq 1 \), \( y \geq 1 \), \( z \geq 1 \), and all are integers.  
4. Maximize \( z \) (number of jogs) while satisfying the equation and constraints.  
5. Solve by expressing variables and testing possible values for \( z \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the equation \( x + 2y + 7z = 50 \) for integer values of \( x \geq 1 \), \( y \geq 1 \), \( z \geq 1 \), maximizing \( z \). This will be achieved by expressing \( x \) in terms of \( y \) and \( z \), ensuring \( x \) is a positive integer, and testing high values of \( z \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the equation:  
\[ x = 50 - 2y - 7z \]  
Since \( x \geq 1 \), we need:  
\[ 50 - 2y - 7z \geq 1 \]  
\[ 2y + 7z \leq 49 \]  
Additionally, \( y \geq 1 \), \( z \geq 1 \). To maximize \( z \), start with the largest possible \( z \) and find corresponding \( y \) and \( x \). Since each jog costs $7, the maximum \( z \) without constraints is \( \lfloor 50 / 7 \rfloor = 7 \). Test values of \( z \) starting from 7 and decreasing:  

- For \( z = 7 \):  
  \[ 7 \times 7 = 49 \]  
  \[ 50 - 49 = 1 \]  
  This leaves $1, enough for 1 jag (\( x = 1 \)), but not enough for any jigs (\( y \geq 1 \)), since jigs cost $2 each. So, \( z = 7 \) is not feasible.  

- For \( z = 6 \):  
  \[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \]  
  \[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]  
  Now solve:  
  \[ x + 2y = 8 \]  
  \[ x = 8 - 2y \]  
  Since \( x \geq 1 \):  
  \[ 8 - 2y \geq 1 \]  
  \[ 2y \leq 7 \]  
  \[ y \leq 3.5 \]  
  Since \( y \) is an integer, \( y \leq 3 \). Also, \( y \geq 1 \). Test possible values:  
  - \( y = 1 \): \( x = 8 - 2 \times 1 = 6 \). Solution: \( (x, y, z) = (6, 1, 6) \).  
  - \( y = 2 \): \( x = 8 - 2 \times 2 = 4 \). Solution: \( (x, y, z) = (4, 2, 6) \).  
  - \( y = 3 \): \( x = 8 - 2 \times 3 = 2 \). Solution: \( (x, y, z) = (2, 3, 6) \).  
  All satisfy \( x \geq 1 \), \( y \geq 1 \), \( z \geq 1 \), and \( 6 + 2 \times 1 + 7 \times 6 = 6 + 2 + 42 = 50 \), etc.  

- For \( z = 5 \):  
  \[ 7 \times 5 = 35 \]  
  \[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]  
  \[ x + 2y = 15 \]  
  \[ x = 15 - 2y \]  
  \[ 15 - 2y \geq 1 \]  
  \[ 2y \leq 14 \]  
  \[ y \leq 7 \]  
  Possible \( y = 1, 2, \ldots, 7 \). Examples:  
  - \( y = 1 \): \( x = 15 - 2 \times 1 = 13 \). Solution: \( (13, 1, 5) \).  
  - \( y = 7 \): \( x = 15 - 2 \times 7 = 1 \). Solution: \( (1, 7, 5) \).  

Since we want the largest \( z \), \( z = 6 \) is higher than \( z = 5 \). Test \( z = 8 \):  
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 > 50 \]  
Not possible. Thus, \( z = 6 \) is the maximum feasible value.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions for \( z = 6 \) and confirm no higher \( z \) is possible. This will be achieved by checking the calculations for \( z = 6 \) and re-testing \( z = 7 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify \( z = 6 \):  
- Solution \( (x, y, z) = (6, 1, 6) \):  
  \[ 6 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 6 \times 7 = 6 + 2 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Constraints: \( x = 6 \geq 1 \), \( y = 1 \geq 1 \), \( z = 6 \geq 1 \). Valid.  
- Solution \( (4, 2, 6) \):  
  \[ 4 \times 1 + 2 \times 2 + 6 \times 7 = 4 + 4 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Constraints satisfied. Valid.  
- Solution \( (2, 3, 6) \):  
  \[ 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 + 6 \times 7 = 2 + 6 + 42 = 50 \]  
  Constraints satisfied. Valid.  

Re-test \( z = 7 \):  
\[ 7 \times 7 = 49 \]  
\[ 50 - 49 = 1 \]  
\[ x + 2y = 1 \]  
\[ x = 1 - 2y \]  
Since \( x \geq 1 \):  
\[ 1 - 2y \geq 1 \]  
\[ -2y \geq 0 \]  
\[ y \leq 0 \]  
But \( y \geq 1 \), so no solutions exist. Confirm \( z = 7 \) is not feasible.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Maximize the number of jogs (\( z \)) while spending exactly $50 and buying at least one jag, jig, and jog.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \( x + 2y + 7z = 50 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure constraints \( x \geq 1 \), \( y \geq 1 \), \( z \geq 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for integer solutions, maximizing \( z \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions for the highest \( z \).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the maximum \( z \) is 6, as validated in the previous step.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the maximum number of jogs (\( z = 6 \)). Retrieve information from previous steps related to the solutions for \( z = 6 \) and the infeasibility of \( z = 7 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- From Step 2: For \( z = 6 \), valid solutions are \( (x, y, z) = (6, 1, 6) \), \( (4, 2, 6) \), \( (2, 3, 6) \), each satisfying \( x + 2y + 7z = 50 \) and constraints.  
- From Step 2: For \( z = 7 \), only $1 remains after buying 7 jogs, insufficient for \( y \geq 1 \).  
- From Step 3: Validation confirmed \( z = 6 \) solutions are correct, and \( z = 7 \) is not possible due to no valid \( y \geq 1 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The largest number of jogs Bill can purchase is 6.  
Possible combinations include buying 6 jogs with:  
- 6 jags and 1 jig,  
- 4 jags and 2 jigs, or  
- 2 jags and 3 jigs.  

Each satisfies the $50 budget and the requirement to buy at least one of each item.
