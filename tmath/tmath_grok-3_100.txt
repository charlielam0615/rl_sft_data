**Problem Statement**: Mr. Sanchez's students were asked to add two positive integers. Juan subtracted by mistake and got 2. Maria mistakenly multiplied and got 120. We need to find the correct sum of the two integers.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the two positive integers and their sum:  
1. Define the two positive integers as \(x\) and \(y\).  
2. Set up equations based on Juan's subtraction (\(x - y = 2\)) and Maria's multiplication (\(x \cdot y = 120\)).  
3. Solve the system of equations to find \(x\) and \(y\).  
4. Calculate the correct sum (\(x + y\)).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the system of equations to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equations \(x - y = 2\) and \(x \cdot y = 120\). Solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) from the first equation, substitute into the second, and solve the resulting quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(x - y = 2\), we get \(y = x - 2\).  
Substitute into \(x \cdot y = 120\):  
\[ x \cdot (x - 2) = 120 \]  
\[ x^2 - 2x - 120 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -2\), \(c = -120\):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-120) = 4 + 480 = 484 \]  
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 22}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-20}{2} = -10 \]  
Since \(x\) must be a positive integer, discard \(x = -10\). Thus, \(x = 12\).  
Then, \(y = x - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\).  
Verify: \(x \cdot y = 12 \cdot 10 = 120\), and \(x - y = 12 - 10 = 2\), which satisfies both conditions.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the values \(x = 12\) and \(y = 10\) satisfy both given conditions and ensure they are positive integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that \(x - y = 2\), \(x \cdot y = 120\), and confirm \(x\) and \(y\) are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(x = 12\), \(y = 10\):  
- Subtraction: \(12 - 10 = 2\), which matches Juan's result.  
- Multiplication: \(12 \cdot 10 = 120\), which matches Maria's result.  
- Both \(12\) and \(10\) are positive integers, satisfying the problem's conditions.  
The solution is valid.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the correct sum of the two integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the values of \(x\) and \(y\) found in Step 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The two integers are \(x = 12\) and \(y = 10\).  
The correct sum is:  
\[ x + y = 12 + 10 = 22 \]
