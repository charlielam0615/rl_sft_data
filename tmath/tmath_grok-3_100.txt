**Problem Restatement**: Two positive integers need to be added. Juan mistakenly subtracted them and got 2, so the difference of the two numbers is 2. Maria mistakenly multiplied them and got 120, so their product is 120. We need to find the correct sum of these two numbers.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Represent the two positive integers as variables.  
2. Set up equations based on Juan’s subtraction (difference = 2) and Maria’s multiplication (product = 120).  
3. Solve the equations to find the two numbers.  
4. Add the two numbers to get the correct answer.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Represent the two numbers and set up equations.  
How to Achieve: Let the two positive integers be \( x \) and \( y \), with \( x \geq y \). From Juan’s mistake, \( x - y = 2 \). From Maria’s mistake, \( x \cdot y = 120 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Define the two positive integers as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \geq y \).  
Based on Juan’s subtraction mistake:  
\[ x - y = 2 \]  
Based on Maria’s multiplication mistake:  
\[ x \cdot y = 120 \]  
These equations will be used to find \( x \) and \( y \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equations \( x - y = 2 \) and \( x \cdot y = 120 \) to find \( x \) and \( y \).  
How to Achieve: Use substitution to solve the system of equations. From \( x - y = 2 \), express \( x \) in terms of \( y \), substitute into the second equation, and solve for \( y \). Then find \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( x - y = 2 \):  
\[ x = y + 2 \]  
Substitute \( x = y + 2 \) into \( x \cdot y = 120 \):  
\[ (y + 2) \cdot y = 120 \]  
\[ y^2 + 2y = 120 \]  
\[ y^2 + 2y - 120 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = -120 \):  
\[ y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-120)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
\[ y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 480}}{2} \]  
\[ y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} \]  
\[ y = \frac{-2 \pm 22}{2} \]  
\[ y = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-24}{2} = -12 \]  
Since \( y \) is a positive integer, \( y = 10 \).  
Then, \( x = y + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 \).  
So, the two numbers are \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 10 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 10 \) satisfy both conditions.  
How to Achieve: Check if \( x - y = 2 \) and \( x \cdot y = 120 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = 12 \), \( y = 10 \):  
- Juan’s condition: \( x - y = 12 - 10 = 2 \), which matches.  
- Maria’s condition: \( x \cdot y = 12 \cdot 10 = 120 \), which matches.  
The numbers \( 12 \) and \( 10 \) satisfy both equations.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the correct answer by adding the two numbers.  
How to Achieve: Add \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 10 \) to get the sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The correct operation is addition:  
\[ x + y = 12 + 10 = 22 \]  
The correct answer is \( 22 \).  
[/IMP]
