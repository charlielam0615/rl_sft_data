**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all values of \( b \) such that \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \), where \( \lceil b \rceil \) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds \( b \) up to the nearest integer.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand the ceiling function and express \( \lceil b \rceil \).  
2. Set up an equation using the definition of the ceiling function.  
3. Solve for possible values of \( b \).  
4. Validate the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express \( \lceil b \rceil \) and set up the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: The ceiling function \( \lceil b \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( b \). Let \( \lceil b \rceil = n \), where \( n \) is an integer and \( n-1 < b \leq n \). Substitute into the equation \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \) to get \( b + n = 17.8 \), so \( b = 17.8 - n \). Ensure \( b \) satisfies \( n-1 < b \leq n \).

[IMP]  
Let \( \lceil b \rceil = n \), where \( n \) is an integer. Then:  
\[ b + n = 17.8 \implies b = 17.8 - n. \]  
Since \( \lceil b \rceil = n \), we need \( n-1 < b \leq n \). Substituting \( b = 17.8 - n \), we get:  
\[ n-1 < 17.8 - n \leq n. \]  
Solve the inequality:  
- Left: \( n-1 < 17.8 - n \)  
  \[ n + n < 17.8 + 1 \implies 2n < 18.8 \implies n < 9.4. \]  
  Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \leq 9 \).  
- Right: \( 17.8 - n \leq n \)  
  \[ 17.8 \leq 2n \implies 8.9 \leq n \implies n \geq 8.9. \]  
  Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \geq 9 \).  
Combining, \( n = 9 \).  
Thus, \( b = 17.8 - 9 = 8.8 \), and \( \lceil b \rceil = \lceil 8.8 \rceil = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( b = 8.8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( b = 8.8 \) into the original equation and check if it holds. Also, confirm if other values of \( n \) yield valid solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( b = 8.8 \):  
\[ \lceil 8.8 \rceil = 9 \implies b + \lceil b \rceil = 8.8 + 9 = 17.8. \]  
This satisfies the equation.  
Test other integer values of \( n \):  
- If \( n = 8 \):  
  \[ b = 17.8 - 8 = 9.8 \implies \lceil 9.8 \rceil = 10 \neq 8. \]  
  Invalid.  
- If \( n = 10 \):  
  \[ b = 17.8 - 10 = 7.8 \implies \lceil 7.8 \rceil = 8 \neq 10. \]  
  Invalid.  
Since \( n = 9 \) is the only integer satisfying \( n \leq 9 \) and \( n \geq 9 \), no other solutions exist.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find all \( b \) such that \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the ceiling function and express \( \lceil b \rceil \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation using \( \lceil b \rceil = n \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution and check for other solutions. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm all possible solutions have been found.  
The solution \( b = 8.8 \) was validated, and other values of \( n \) were tested, confirming no additional solutions.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The only value of \( b \) that satisfies \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \) is \( b = 8.8 \).
