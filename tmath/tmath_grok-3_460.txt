### Problem Statement
We need to find all values of \( b \) such that \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \), where \( \lceil b \rceil \) denotes the ceiling function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( b \).  
1. Understand the ceiling function and express \( \lceil b \rceil \).  
2. Set up the equation using the definition of the ceiling function.  
3. Solve for \( b \) by considering possible integer values for \( \lceil b \rceil \).  
4. Validate the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( \lceil b \rceil \) and set up the equation. The ceiling function \( \lceil b \rceil \) is the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( n \geq b \). We will use this to rewrite the given equation \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \) and solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \( \lceil b \rceil = n \), where \( n \) is an integer and \( n \geq b \). The given equation becomes:  
\[ b + n = 17.8 \]  
Thus,  
\[ b = 17.8 - n \]  
Since \( n = \lceil b \rceil \), we need \( n \geq b \), so:  
\[ n \geq 17.8 - n \]  
Solving this inequality:  
\[ n + n \geq 17.8 \]  
\[ 2n \geq 17.8 \]  
\[ n \geq 8.9 \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \geq 9 \). Additionally, since \( n \geq b \), we have \( b \leq n \), so:  
\[ 17.8 - n \leq n \]  
\[ 17.8 \leq 2n \]  
\[ n \leq 8.9 \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \leq 8 \). Combining both constraints:  
\[ n \geq 9 \quad \text{and} \quad n \leq 8 \]  
This is a contradiction, suggesting no integer \( n \) satisfies both conditions simultaneously. However, let’s explore the boundary case where \( n = 9 \) (since \( n \geq 8.9 \)) and check if a consistent solution exists.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The previous step led to a contradiction, indicating that assuming a single integer \( n \) may need adjustment. Adjust the subgoal to consider the ceiling function’s behavior more carefully, particularly testing integer values around the boundary (e.g., \( n = 8, 9 \)) and re-evaluating the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test possible integer values for \( n = \lceil b \rceil \) around the boundary (e.g., \( n = 8, 9 \)) and solve for \( b \). We will substitute these values into \( b = 17.8 - n \) and check if \( \lceil b \rceil = n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test possible integer values for \( n \):  
- If \( n = 9 \):  
  \[ b = 17.8 - 9 = 8.8 \]  
  Check \( \lceil b \rceil = \lceil 8.8 \rceil = 9 \), which matches \( n = 9 \).  
  Verify:  
  \[ b + \lceil b \rceil = 8.8 + 9 = 17.8 \]  
  This satisfies the equation.  
- If \( n = 8 \):  
  \[ b = 17.8 - 8 = 9.8 \]  
  Check \( \lceil b \rceil = \lceil 9.8 \rceil = 10 \), which does not match \( n = 8 \).  
- If \( n = 10 \):  
  \[ b = 17.8 - 10 = 7.8 \]  
  Check \( \lceil b \rceil = \lceil 7.8 \rceil = 8 \), which does not match \( n = 10 \).  
Thus, \( b = 8.8 \) with \( n = 9 \) is a candidate solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( b = 8.8 \) by ensuring it satisfies all conditions of the equation and checking if other values of \( b \) are possible. We will also consider the ceiling function’s definition to ensure all cases are covered.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( b = 8.8 \):  
\[ \lceil 8.8 \rceil = 9 \]  
\[ 8.8 + 9 = 17.8 \]  
This satisfies the equation.  
To ensure no other solutions, consider the constraint \( n - 1 < b \leq n \) (since \( \lceil b \rceil = n \)). Substituting \( b = 17.8 - n \):  
\[ n - 1 < 17.8 - n \leq n \]  
- Left: \( n - 1 < 17.8 - n \)  
  \[ 2n < 18.8 \]  
  \[ n < 9.4 \]  
  So, \( n \leq 9 \) (since \( n \) is an integer).  
- Right: \( 17.8 - n \leq n \)  
  \[ 17.8 \leq 2n \]  
  \[ n \geq 8.9 \]  
  So, \( n \geq 9 \).  
Thus, \( n = 9 \). Now check the range for \( b \):  
\[ 9 - 1 < b \leq 9 \]  
\[ 8 < b \leq 9 \]  
With \( b = 17.8 - 9 = 8.8 \), we have \( 8 < 8.8 \leq 9 \), which is satisfied.  
Test other \( n \):  
- For \( n = 8 \), \( b = 9.8 \), but \( \lceil 9.8 \rceil = 10 \neq 8 \).  
- For \( n = 10 \), \( b = 7.8 \), but \( \lceil 7.8 \rceil = 8 \neq 10 \).  
No other \( n \) yields a consistent solution. Thus, \( b = 8.8 \) is the only solution.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find all values of \( b \) such that \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the ceiling function and set up the equation.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( b \) using possible integer values for \( \lceil b \rceil \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution and check for other possible values.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( b = 8.8 \) is the only solution and finalize the answer.

### Final Answer
The only value of \( b \) that satisfies \( b + \lceil b \rceil = 17.8 \) is \( b = 8.8 \).
