**Problem Statement**: On an algebra test with \(5x\) problems, Lucky Lacy missed \(x\) problems. We need to determine the percentage of problems she got correct.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct.  
2. Determine the percentage of correct problems relative to the total.  
3. Express the percentage in a simplified form.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the number of problems missed (\(x\)) from the total number of problems (\(5x\)) to find the number of correct answers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total problems = \(5x\).  
Problems missed = \(x\).  
Problems correct = \(5x - x = 4x\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the percentage of problems Lacy got correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for percentage: \(\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of correct problems}}{\text{Total number of problems}}\right) \times 100\). Substitute the values from the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Number of correct problems = \(4x\).  
Total problems = \(5x\).  
Percentage correct = \(\left(\frac{4x}{5x}\right) \times 100 = \frac{4}{5} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the percentage calculation.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculation by ensuring the formula was applied correctly and test with a specific value of \(x\) to confirm the result is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula used was \(\left(\frac{4x}{5x}\right) \times 100\). The \(x\) terms cancel out, yielding \(\frac{4}{5} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
To test, let \(x = 2\):  
- Total problems = \(5x = 10\).  
- Missed problems = \(x = 2\).  
- Correct problems = \(10 - 2 = 8\).  
- Percentage = \(\left(\frac{8}{10}\right) \times 100 = 80\%\).  
This matches the calculated result, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the percentage of problems Lucky Lacy got correct.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct (completed: \(4x\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the percentage of correct problems (completed: \(80\%\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation (completed: validated with \(x = 2\)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as the percentage has been calculated and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: Lucky Lacy got \(80\%\) of the problems correct.
