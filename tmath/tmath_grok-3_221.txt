**Problem Statement**: On an algebra test with \(5x\) problems, Lucky Lacy missed \(x\) problems. We need to determine the percentage of problems she got correct.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct.  
2. Determine the percentage of correct problems relative to the total.  
3. Express the percentage in a simplified form.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the number of problems missed (\(x\)) from the total number of problems (\(5x\)) to find the number of correct answers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total problems = \(5x\).  
Problems missed = \(x\).  
Problems correct = \(5x - x = 4x\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the percentage of problems Lacy got correct.  
How to Achieve: Divide the number of correct problems (\(4x\)) by the total number of problems (\(5x\)) and multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Percentage correct = \(\frac{\text{Problems correct}}{\text{Total problems}} \times 100 = \frac{4x}{5x} \times 100 = \frac{4}{5} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the percentage of problems Lacy got correct.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the number of problems Lacy got correct (Completed: \(4x\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the percentage of correct problems (Completed: 80%).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the percentage in a simplified form (Current).  
Current Goal: Express the percentage in a simplified form.  
The percentage calculated is 80%, which is already in a simplified form.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculated percentage.  
How to Achieve: Check the calculation by re-evaluating the steps and ensuring the result makes sense for different values of \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- Correct problems = \(4x\).  
- Percentage = \(\frac{4x}{5x} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
Test with \(x = 1\): Total problems = \(5 \times 1 = 5\), missed = 1, correct = \(5 - 1 = 4\), percentage = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
Test with \(x = 2\): Total problems = \(5 \times 2 = 10\), missed = 2, correct = \(10 - 2 = 8\), percentage = \(\frac{8}{10} \times 100 = 80\%\).  
The result is consistent and independent of \(x\), confirming the calculation.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: Lucky Lacy got 80% of the problems correct.
