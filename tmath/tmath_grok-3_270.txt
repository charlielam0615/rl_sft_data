**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\log_2 (4^2)\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(\log_2 (4^2)\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the argument \(4^2\).  
2. Express the base and argument in a compatible form (e.g., as powers of 2).  
3. Apply logarithm properties to compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the argument \(4^2\).  
How to Achieve: Compute \(4^2\) to obtain a numerical value for the logarithm's argument.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \(4^2\):  
\(4^2 = 16\).  
Thus, \(\log_2 (4^2) = \log_2 (16)\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the argument 16 in terms of the base 2.  
How to Achieve: Rewrite 16 as a power of 2 to facilitate the use of logarithm properties.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Express 16 as a power of 2:  
\(16 = 2^4\).  
Thus, \(\log_2 (16) = \log_2 (2^4)\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply logarithm properties to compute \(\log_2 (2^4)\).  
How to Achieve: Use the logarithm power rule, \(\log_b (a^c) = c \cdot \log_b (a)\), to simplify the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Apply the logarithm power rule:  
\(\log_2 (2^4) = 4 \cdot \log_2 (2)\).  
Since \(\log_2 (2) = 1\), we have:  
\(4 \cdot 1 = 4\).  
Thus, \(\log_2 (2^4) = 4\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed result \(\log_2 (4^2) = 4\).  
How to Achieve: Check if \(2^4 = 4^2\) by computing both sides and confirming equality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify:  
Left side: \(2^4 = 16\).  
Right side: \(4^2 = 16\).  
Since \(2^4 = 4^2\), the result \(\log_2 (4^2) = 4\) is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\log_2 (4^2)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(4^2\) (Completed: \(4^2 = 16\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express 16 as a power of 2 (Completed: \(16 = 2^4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply logarithm properties to compute \(\log_2 (2^4)\) (Completed: \(\log_2 (2^4) = 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (Completed: \(2^4 = 4^2\)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \(\log_2 (4^2) = 4\).

**Final Answer**: \(\log_2 (4^2) = 4\).
