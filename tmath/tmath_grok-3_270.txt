**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\log_2 (4^2)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To evaluate \(\log_2 (4^2)\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Simplify the expression inside the logarithm, \(4^2\).
2. Rewrite the base 4 in terms of base 2, since the logarithm is base 2.
3. Apply logarithm properties to compute the final value.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm, \(4^2\).
How to Achieve: Compute \(4^2\) to obtain a numerical value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \(4^2\):
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]
So, the expression becomes \(\log_2 (16)\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the base 4 in terms of base 2 to simplify \(\log_2 (16)\).
How to Achieve: Express 16 as a power of 2, since the logarithm is base 2, and apply the logarithm power rule.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite 16 in terms of base 2:
\[ 16 = 2^4 \]
Thus, the expression is:
\[ \log_2 (16) = \log_2 (2^4) \]
Using the logarithm power rule, \(\log_b (a^c) = c \cdot \log_b (a)\):
\[ \log_2 (2^4) = 4 \cdot \log_2 (2) \]
Since \(\log_2 (2) = 1\):
\[ 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the result \(\log_2 (16) = 4\).
How to Achieve: Check if \(2^4 = 16\) to confirm the logarithm calculation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \(2^4\):
\[ 2^4 = 16 \]
Since \(\log_2 (16) = 4\) means \(2^4 = 16\), which is true, the calculation is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\log_2 (4^2)\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(4^2\) to 16 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Rewrite 16 as \(2^4\) and compute \(\log_2 (2^4)\) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed).
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved.
The final answer is 4.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\log_2 (4^2) = 4\)
