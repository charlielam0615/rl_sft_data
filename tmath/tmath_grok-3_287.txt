**Problem Statement**: We need to find the x-coordinate of the other x-intercept of a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), given that its vertex is at \( (3, 7) \) and one x-intercept is at \( (-2, 0) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the x-coordinate of the other x-intercept:  
1. Use the vertex form of the quadratic to incorporate the vertex \( (3, 7) \).  
2. Use the given x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) to form equations.  
3. Solve for the coefficients of the quadratic.  
4. Find the x-intercepts by solving the quadratic equation and identify the other x-intercept.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the quadratic in vertex form and use the given x-intercept to set up equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) with vertex \( (h, k) = (3, 7) \), substitute the x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) to find \( a \), and convert to standard form if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The vertex form of the quadratic is \( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7 \).  
Substitute the x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \):  
\[ 0 = a((-2) - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
\[ 0 = a(-5)^2 + 7 \]  
\[ 0 = 25a + 7 \]  
\[ 25a = -7 \]  
\[ a = -\frac{7}{25} \]  
So, the quadratic in vertex form is:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert the quadratic to standard form to find the x-intercepts.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the vertex form \( y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \) into standard form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), then use the quadratic formula to find the x-intercepts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand the vertex form:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
\[ (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 7 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x - \frac{63}{25} + 7 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x - \frac{63}{25} + \frac{175}{25} \]  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} \]  
So, the standard form is:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} \]  
To find x-intercepts, set \( y = 0 \):  
\[ -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} = 0 \]  
Multiply through by 25 to clear denominators:  
\[ -7x^2 + 42x + 112 = 0 \]  
\[ 7x^2 - 42x - 112 = 0 \]  
Divide by 7:  
\[ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), \( c = -16 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]  
The x-intercepts are \( x = -2 \) (given) and \( x = 8 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the quadratic has the given vertex and x-intercept, and confirm the other x-intercept.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the vertex of the quadratic is at \( (3, 7) \), confirm the x-intercept at \( (-2, 0) \), and ensure the calculations for the other x-intercept are correct.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
**Verify vertex**: For \( y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \), the vertex is at \( (3, 7) \), which matches the given vertex.  
**Verify x-intercept**: Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the vertex form:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(-2 - 3)^2 + 7 = -\frac{7}{25}(25) + 7 = -7 + 7 = 0 \]  
This confirms the x-intercept at \( (-2, 0) \).  
**Verify other x-intercept**: Substitute \( x = 8 \) into the standard form \( y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} \):  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(64) + \frac{42}{25}(8) + \frac{112}{25} \]  
\[ = -\frac{448}{25} + \frac{336}{25} + \frac{112}{25} \]  
\[ = \frac{-448 + 336 + 112}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0 \]  
This confirms the x-intercept at \( (8, 0) \).  
The calculations are consistent, and the other x-intercept is \( x = 8 \).

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the other x-intercept of the quadratic.  
  - Subgoal 1: Use the vertex form to incorporate the vertex \( (3, 7) \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) to find \( a \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Convert to standard form and solve for x-intercepts.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the vertex and x-intercepts.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all subgoals are met.  
All subgoals have been addressed: the quadratic was derived, x-intercepts were calculated, and the solution was validated. The other x-intercept is \( x = 8 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The x-coordinate of the other x-intercept is \( 8 \).
