**Problem Statement**: For a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the vertex of the parabola is at \( (3, 7) \), and one \( x \)-intercept is at \( (-2, 0) \). We need to find the \( x \)-coordinate of the other \( x \)-intercept.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the other \( x \)-intercept, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the vertex form of the quadratic to incorporate the vertex \( (3, 7) \).  
2. Use the given \( x \)-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) to determine the coefficient \( a \).  
3. Convert the quadratic to standard form to find the roots using the quadratic formula or factoring.  
4. Identify the other \( x \)-intercept from the roots.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the quadratic in vertex form using the vertex \( (3, 7) \) and find \( a \) using the \( x \)-intercept \( (-2, 0) \). This will be achieved by writing the quadratic as \( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7 \) and substituting \( x = -2, y = 0 \) to solve for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The vertex form of a quadratic with vertex \( (h, k) \) is \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \). Given the vertex \( (3, 7) \), the equation is:  
\[ y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
Using the \( x \)-intercept \( (-2, 0) \), substitute \( x = -2 \), \( y = 0 \):  
\[ 0 = a(-2 - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
\[ 0 = a(-5)^2 + 7 \]  
\[ 0 = 25a + 7 \]  
\[ 25a = -7 \]  
\[ a = -\frac{7}{25} \]  
Thus, the quadratic in vertex form is:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the quadratic to standard form and find the \( x \)-intercepts by solving for the roots. This will be achieved by expanding \( y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \) and using the quadratic formula to find the roots.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand the vertex form:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x - 3)^2 + 7 \]  
First, expand \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[ (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 \]  
So:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 7 \]  
Distribute \( -\frac{7}{25} \):  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x - \frac{63}{25} + 7 \]  
Convert 7 to a fraction with denominator 25: \( 7 = \frac{175}{25} \). Then:  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \left( -\frac{63}{25} + \frac{175}{25} \right) \]  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} \]  
To find the \( x \)-intercepts, set \( y = 0 \):  
\[ -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} = 0 \]  
Multiply through by 25 to clear denominators:  
\[ -7x^2 + 42x + 112 = 0 \]  
Multiply by -1 for simplicity:  
\[ 7x^2 - 42x - 112 = 0 \]  
Divide by 7:  
\[ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), \( c = -16 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(-16) = 36 + 64 = 100 \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 + 10}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{6 - 10}{2} = -2 \]  
The roots are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \). Since \( x = -2 \) is the given \( x \)-intercept, the other \( x \)-intercept is at \( x = 8 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the roots \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \) are correct and that the vertex is at \( (3, 7) \). This will be achieved by substituting the roots and vertex back into the quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the standard form \( y = -\frac{7}{25}x^2 + \frac{42}{25}x + \frac{112}{25} \), verify the roots:  
For \( x = -2 \):  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(-2)^2 + \frac{42}{25}(-2) + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{7}{25} \cdot 4 - \frac{84}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{28}{25} - \frac{84}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = 0 \]  
For \( x = 8 \):  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(8)^2 + \frac{42}{25}(8) + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{7}{25} \cdot 64 + \frac{336}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{448}{25} + \frac{336}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = 0 \]  
Verify the vertex at \( x = 3 \):  
\[ y = -\frac{7}{25}(3)^2 + \frac{42}{25}(3) + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{7}{25} \cdot 9 + \frac{126}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = -\frac{63}{25} + \frac{126}{25} + \frac{112}{25} = \frac{175}{25} = 7 \]  
The calculations confirm the roots at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \), and the vertex at \( (3, 7) \).
