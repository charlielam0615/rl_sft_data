### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( r \) such that \( f(2) = 0 \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x + r \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( r \), we need to ensure \( f(2) = 0 \). This suggests the following subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \).  
2. Set the resulting expression equal to zero.  
3. Solve for \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x + r \) and compute the expression. This can be achieved by evaluating each term of the polynomial at \( x = 2 \), summing them, and including \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
- First term: \( 2x^4 = 2 \cdot 2^4 = 2 \cdot 16 = 32 \).  
- Second term: \( x^3 = 2^3 = 8 \).  
- Third term: \( x^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).  
- Fourth term: \( -3x = -3 \cdot 2 = -6 \).  
- Constant term: \( r \).  

So,  
\[ f(2) = 32 + 8 + 4 - 6 + r = 38 + r. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set \( f(2) = 0 \) and solve for \( r \). Using the result from the previous step, we have \( f(2) = 38 + r \). Set this equal to zero and solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set \( f(2) = 0 \):  
\[ 38 + r = 0. \]  
Solve for \( r \):  
\[ r = -38. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = -38 \) satisfies \( f(2) = 0 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( r = -38 \) back into the polynomial, recomputing \( f(2) \), and checking if the result is zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With \( r = -38 \), the polynomial becomes:  
\[ f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x - 38. \]  
Recompute \( f(2) \):  
- \( 2 \cdot 2^4 = 32 \).  
- \( 2^3 = 8 \).  
- \( 2^2 = 4 \).  
- \( -3 \cdot 2 = -6 \).  
- Constant: \( -38 \).  

Sum:  
\[ f(2) = 32 + 8 + 4 - 6 - 38 = 38 - 38 = 0. \]  
Since \( f(2) = 0 \), the value \( r = -38 \) is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( r \) such that \( f(2) = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set \( f(2) = 0 \) and solve for \( r \) (completed, \( r = -38 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, \( r = -38 \) satisfies \( f(2) = 0 \)).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, and the solution has been validated. No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( r \) for which \( f(2) = 0 \) is \( r = -38 \).
