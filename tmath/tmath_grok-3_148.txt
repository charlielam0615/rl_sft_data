**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( r \) such that \( f(2) = 0 \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x + r \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( r \) such that \( f(2) = 0 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \).  
2. Set the resulting expression equal to zero.  
3. Solve for \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x + r \) and compute the expression. This will be achieved by evaluating each term of the polynomial at \( x = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(2) = 2(2^4) + (2^3) + (2^2) - 3(2) + r \]  
Calculate each term:  
- \( 2^4 = 16 \), so \( 2 \cdot 16 = 32 \).  
- \( 2^3 = 8 \).  
- \( 2^2 = 4 \).  
- \( -3 \cdot 2 = -6 \).  
Thus:  
\[ f(2) = 32 + 8 + 4 - 6 + r = 38 + r \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set \( f(2) = 0 \) using the expression \( 38 + r \) and solve for \( r \). This will be achieved by solving the equation \( 38 + r = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the expression equal to zero:  
\[ 38 + r = 0 \]  
Solve for \( r \):  
\[ r = -38 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = -38 \) makes \( f(2) = 0 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( r = -38 \) back into \( f(x) \) and computing \( f(2) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With \( r = -38 \), the polynomial is:  
\[ f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 - 3x - 38 \]  
Compute \( f(2) \):  
\[ f(2) = 2(2^4) + (2^3) + (2^2) - 3(2) - 38 \]  
Using previous calculations:  
\[ 2 \cdot 16 + 8 + 4 - 6 - 38 = 32 + 8 + 4 - 6 - 38 = 0 \]  
Since \( f(2) = 0 \), the value \( r = -38 \) is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( r \) such that \( f(2) = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set the resulting expression equal to zero and solve for \( r \) (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and the solution \( r = -38 \) has been validated.
