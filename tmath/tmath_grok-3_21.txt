**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \( 99 \times 99 \) mentally and provide the result.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the multiplication \( 99 \times 99 \) into simpler, manageable subgoals to compute mentally.  
- Subgoal 1: Recognize that \( 99 = 100 - 1 \), so \( 99 \times 99 = (100 - 1) \times (100 - 1) \).  
- Subgoal 2: Expand the expression using the binomial formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \).  
- Subgoal 3: Compute each term in the expanded expression.  
- Subgoal 4: Sum the terms to get the final result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to expand \( (100 - 1) \times (100 - 1) \) using the binomial formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \), where \( a = 100 \) and \( b = 1 \). This will be achieved by applying the formula and calculating each term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the binomial formula:  
\( (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 \).  
- Compute \( 100^2 = 100 \times 100 = 10,000 \).  
- Compute \( 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 = 200 \).  
- Compute \( 1^2 = 1 \).  
The expression becomes: \( 10,000 - 200 + 1 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final result by evaluating \( 10,000 - 200 + 1 \). This will be achieved by performing the subtraction and addition sequentially.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\( 10,000 - 200 = 9,800 \).  
Then, \( 9,800 + 1 = 9,801 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the result \( 9,801 \) by checking the calculation or using an alternative method to ensure accuracy. This will be achieved by recomputing \( 99 \times 99 \) using a different approach, such as the standard multiplication algorithm.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( 99 \times 99 \) directly:  
- \( 99 = 90 + 9 \), so \( 99 \times 99 = (90 + 9) \times (90 + 9) \).  
- Break it down: \( 90 \times 90 + 90 \times 9 + 9 \times 90 + 9 \times 9 \).  
- Compute each term:  
  - \( 90 \times 90 = 8,100 \).  
  - \( 90 \times 9 = 810 \).  
  - \( 9 \times 90 = 810 \).  
  - \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \).  
- Sum: \( 8,100 + 810 + 810 + 81 \).  
- First, \( 8,100 + 810 = 8,910 \).  
- Then, \( 8,910 + 810 = 9,720 \).  
- Finally, \( 9,720 + 81 = 9,801 \).  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming \( 9,801 \).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( 99 \times 99 \) mentally.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize \( 99 = 100 - 1 \) and use \( (100 - 1)^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Expand using the binomial formula.  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the terms \( 10,000 - 200 + 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result using an alternative method.  
**Current Goal**: Completed the evaluation, with the result \( 9,801 \).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the result has been validated.

**Final Answer**: \( 99 \times 99 = 9,801 \).
