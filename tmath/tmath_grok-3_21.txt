**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(99 \times 99\) mentally.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \(99 \times 99\) mentally, break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Recognize that \(99 = 100 - 1\), so \(99 \times 99 = (100 - 1) \times (100 - 1)\).  
2. Use the binomial expansion \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) to compute the product.  
3. Calculate each term of the expansion.  
4. Combine the results to get the final answer.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the binomial expansion \((100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2\).  
How to Achieve: Compute each term (\(100^2\), \(-2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1\), \(1^2\)) and sum them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the expansion \((100 - 1)^2\):  
- \(100^2 = 100 \times 100 = 10,000\).  
- \(-2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 = -200\).  
- \(1^2 = 1\).  
Now, sum the terms: \(10,000 - 200 + 1 = 9,800 + 1 = 9,801\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the result of \(9,801\) for \(99 \times 99\).  
How to Achieve: Use an alternative method, such as the standard multiplication algorithm, to confirm the answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \(99 \times 99\) using the standard algorithm:  
- \(99 = 90 + 9\).  
- \(99 \times 99 = (90 + 9) \times (90 + 9) = 90 \times 90 + 90 \times 9 + 9 \times 90 + 9 \times 9\).  
- \(90 \times 90 = 8,100\).  
- \(90 \times 9 = 810\).  
- \(9 \times 90 = 810\).  
- \(9 \times 9 = 81\).  
- Sum: \(8,100 + 810 + 810 + 81 = 8,910 + 891 = 9,801\).  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming \(99 \times 99 = 9,801\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(99 \times 99\) mentally.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize \(99 = 100 - 1\) and use binomial expansion (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute terms of the expansion and sum them (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result using an alternative method (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, and the result \(9,801\) has been validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(99 \times 99 = 9,801\).
