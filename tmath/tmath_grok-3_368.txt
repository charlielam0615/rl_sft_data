**Problem Restatement**: Given the operation \( a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + ab} \) for \( a > 0 \) and \( b > 0 \), calculate \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals. First, compute the inner operation \( 1 \nabla 2 \). Then, use the result to compute the outer operation with 3, i.e., \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 1 \nabla 2 \).  
Description: Apply the operation \( a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + ab} \) with \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \). Calculate the numerator as \( 1 + 2 \) and the denominator as \( 1 + 1 \times 2 \), then form the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the operation \( 1 \nabla 2 \):  
Numerator: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).  
Denominator: \( 1 + 1 \times 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \).  
Thus, \( 1 \nabla 2 = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the result of \( 1 \nabla 2 \).  
Description: Recalculate \( 1 \nabla 2 \) to ensure correctness by applying the operation formula again and checking if the result is consistent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute \( 1 \nabla 2 \):  
Numerator: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).  
Denominator: \( 1 + 1 \times 2 = 3 \).  
\( 1 \nabla 2 = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \). The result is consistent.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 1 \nabla 2 \) (completed, result = 1).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).  
Current Goal: Compute \( 1 \nabla 3 \), since \( 1 \nabla 2 = 1 \).

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 1 \nabla 3 \).  
Description: Apply the operation \( a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + ab} \) with \( a = 1 \) (result of \( 1 \nabla 2 \)) and \( b = 3 \). Calculate the numerator as \( 1 + 3 \) and the denominator as \( 1 + 1 \times 3 \), then form the fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the operation \( 1 \nabla 3 \):  
Numerator: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).  
Denominator: \( 1 + 1 \times 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).  
Thus, \( 1 \nabla 3 = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \).

Recompute \( 1 \nabla 3 \):  
Numerator: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).  
Denominator: \( 1 + 1 \times 3 = 4 \).  
\( 1 \nabla 3 = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \). The result is consistent.
