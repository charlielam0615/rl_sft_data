**Problem Statement**: Given the operation defined for \( a > 0 \) and \( b > 0 \) as \( a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + ab} \), calculate \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute the inner operation \( 1 \nabla 2 \).
2. Use the result from step 1 to compute the outer operation with 3, i.e., \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).
3. Ensure all calculations adhere to the operationâ€™s definition and verify the final result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( 1 \nabla 2 \). Using the operation definition \( a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + ab} \), substitute \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then perform the arithmetic to find the result.

[IMP]
Apply the operation:
\[
1 \nabla 2 = \frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1 \times 2} = \frac{3}{1 + 2} = \frac{3}{3} = 1
\]
So, \( 1 \nabla 2 = 1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \), which is \( 1 \nabla 3 \) since \( 1 \nabla 2 = 1 \). Using the operation definition, substitute \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 3 \), then perform the arithmetic to find the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the operation:
\[
1 \nabla 3 = \frac{1 + 3}{1 + 1 \times 3} = \frac{4}{1 + 3} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]
So, \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \nabla 3 = 1 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \). Recalculate each step to confirm correctness and ensure the operation was applied correctly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the calculations:
- For \( 1 \nabla 2 \):
\[
\frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1 \times 2} = \frac{3}{3} = 1
\]
- For \( 1 \nabla 3 \):
\[
\frac{1 + 3}{1 + 1 \times 3} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]
Both steps are consistent with the previous results, confirming \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Calculate \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 1 \nabla 2 \). (Completed: Result = 1)
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \nabla 3 \). (Completed: Result = 1)
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result. (Completed: Result confirmed as 1)

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final result. The calculations show \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \), and validation supports this.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( (1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3 = 1 \)
