**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\left\lceil 3 \left( 6 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right\rceil\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the evaluation of \(\left\lceil 3 \left( 6 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right\rceil\) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute the inner expression \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\).
2. Multiply the result by 3.
3. Apply the ceiling function to the product.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\).
How to Achieve: Subtract the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) from 6 using basic arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\):
- Convert 6 to a fraction: \(6 = \frac{12}{2}\).
- Subtract: \(\frac{12}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{12 - 1}{2} = \frac{11}{2}\).
- As a decimal: \(\frac{11}{2} = 5.5\).
Result: \(6 - \frac{1}{2} = 5.5\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the result \(5.5\) by 3.
How to Achieve: Perform the multiplication \(3 \times 5.5\) using basic arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \(3 \times 5.5\):
- \(5.5 = \frac{11}{2}\), so \(3 \times \frac{11}{2} = \frac{3 \times 11}{2} = \frac{33}{2}\).
- As a decimal: \(\frac{33}{2} = 16.5\).
- Alternatively: \(3 \times 5.5 = 3 \times (5 + 0.5) = 15 + 1.5 = 16.5\).
Result: \(3 \times 5.5 = 16.5\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the ceiling function to 16.5.
How to Achieve: Determine the smallest integer greater than or equal to 16.5.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The ceiling function \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) gives the smallest integer \(\geq x\).
- For \(x = 16.5\), the integers greater than or equal to 16.5 are 17, 18, etc.
- The smallest such integer is 17.
Result: \(\left\lceil 16.5 \right\rceil = 17\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\left\lceil 3 \left( 6 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right\rceil\).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\) (Completed: Result = 5.5).
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply by 3 (Completed: Result = 16.5).
  - Subgoal 3: Apply ceiling function (Completed: Result = 17).
Current Goal: Completed main goal.
The final result is 17.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(\left\lceil 3 \left( 6 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right\rceil = 17\).**Problem Restatement**: Evaluate the expression \(\left\lceil 3 \left( 6 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right\rceil\), where \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) denotes the ceiling function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the inner expression \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\).  
How to Achieve: Subtract the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) from 6 using basic arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\):  
Convert 6 to a fraction with the same denominator: \(6 = \frac{12}{2}\).  
Then, \(\frac{12}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{12 - 1}{2} = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5\).  
Result: \(6 - \frac{1}{2} = 5.5\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Multiply the result of \(6 - \frac{1}{2}\) by 3.  
How to Achieve: Take the result from the previous step (5.5) and multiply it by 3 using basic arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, \(6 - \frac{1}{2} = 5.5\).  
Now compute \(3 \times 5.5\):  
\(3 \times 5.5 = 3 \times \frac{11}{2} = \frac{33}{2} = 16.5\).  
Result: \(3 \times 5.5 = 16.5\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the ceiling function to the product.  
How to Achieve: Take the result from the previous step (16.5) and apply the ceiling function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to 16.5.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 3, the product is 16.5.  
The ceiling function \(\left\lceil x \right\rceil\) gives the smallest integer \(\geq x\).  
Since \(16.5\) is between 16 and 17, \(\left\lceil 16.5 \right\rceil = 17\).  
Result: \(\left\lceil 16.5 \right\rceil = 17\).
