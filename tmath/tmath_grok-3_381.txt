### Problem Statement
We need to solve the system of linear equations to find the value of \( q \):
1. \( 3p + 4q = 8 \)
2. \( 4p + 3q = 13 \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( q \), we can use the elimination method to eliminate \( p \) from the system of equations. This involves manipulating the equations to cancel out \( p \), allowing us to solve for \( q \). The subgoals are:
1. Adjust the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations to be equal.
2. Subtract or add the equations to eliminate \( p \).
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( q \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Adjust the coefficients of \( p \) to be equal in both equations.
To achieve this, multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 to make the coefficient of \( p \) in both equations 12.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the first equation \( 3p + 4q = 8 \) by 4:
\[ 4(3p + 4q) = 4 \cdot 8 \]
\[ 12p + 16q = 32 \]

Multiply the second equation \( 4p + 3q = 13 \) by 3:
\[ 3(4p + 3q) = 3 \cdot 13 \]
\[ 12p + 9q = 39 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Eliminate \( p \) by subtracting the modified equations.
Subtract the second modified equation from the first to eliminate \( p \) and solve for \( q \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Subtract the equations:
\[ (12p + 16q) - (12p + 9q) = 32 - 39 \]
\[ 16q - 9q = -7 \]
\[ 7q = -7 \]
\[ q = -1 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( q = -1 \) by substituting it back into one of the original equations.
Substitute \( q = -1 \) into the first equation \( 3p + 4q = 8 \) to check if it holds.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( q = -1 \) into \( 3p + 4q = 8 \):
\[ 3p + 4(-1) = 8 \]
\[ 3p - 4 = 8 \]
\[ 3p = 12 \]
\[ p = 4 \]

Now, check the second equation \( 4p + 3q = 13 \):
\[ 4(4) + 3(-1) = 16 - 3 = 13 \]
The solution satisfies both equations, confirming \( q = -1 \).
