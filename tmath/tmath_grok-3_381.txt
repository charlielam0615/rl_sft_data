**Problem Statement**: Solve the system of linear equations \(3p + 4q = 8\) and \(4p + 3q = 13\) to find the value of \(q\).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(q\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find values for both \(p\) and \(q\).  
2. Isolate \(q\) from the solution.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations \(3p + 4q = 8\) and \(4p + 3q = 13\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the elimination method to eliminate \(p\) and solve for \(q\). Multiply the equations to align the coefficients of \(p\), subtract to eliminate \(p\), and solve the resulting equation for \(q\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To eliminate \(p\), multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 to make the coefficients of \(p\) equal:  
- First equation: \(4 \cdot (3p + 4q) = 4 \cdot 8 \implies 12p + 16q = 32\)  
- Second equation: \(3 \cdot (4p + 3q) = 3 \cdot 13 \implies 12p + 9q = 39\)  

Subtract the second from the first:  
\[(12p + 16q) - (12p + 9q) = 32 - 39\]  
\[16q - 9q = -7\]  
\[7q = -7\]  
\[q = -1\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the value of \(q = -1\) by substituting into both equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(q = -1\) into both original equations, solve for \(p\), and check if the results are consistent.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(q = -1\) into the first equation:  
\[3p + 4(-1) = 8\]  
\[3p - 4 = 8\]  
\[3p = 12\]  
\[p = 4\]  

Substitute \(q = -1\) into the second equation:  
\[4p + 3(-1) = 13\]  
\[4p - 3 = 13\]  
\[4p = 16\]  
\[p = 4\]  

Both equations yield \(p = 4\), confirming the solution is consistent. Thus, \(q = -1\) is valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(q\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate \(q\) (completed, \(q = -1\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final value of \(q\). The solution \(q = -1\) has been reached and validated.
