**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate 120% of 50.  
2. Add the result to 50 to get the final number.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate 120% of 50. This can be achieved by converting 120% to a decimal (1.20) and multiplying it by 50.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To calculate 120% of 50:  
120% = 1.20  
1.20 × 50 = 60  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the result from the previous step (60) to the original number (50) to find the final number. This can be achieved by simple addition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add the result to the original number:  
50 + 60 = 110  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation by checking if increasing 50 by 120% correctly yields 110. This can be done by recomputing the percentage increase or using an alternative method, such as multiplying 50 by (1 + 1.20).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Alternative calculation:  
Increasing by 120% means multiplying by (1 + 1.20) = 2.20.  
50 × 2.20 = 110  
This matches the previous result, confirming the calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number when 50 is increased by 120%.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate 120% of 50 (completed: 60).  
  - Subgoal 2: Add the result to 50 (completed: 110).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation (completed: confirmed 110).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The final result is 110.  
[/REVIEW]
