**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the number that results when 50 is increased by 120%. This means calculating 50 plus 120% of 50.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Understand what "increased by 120%" means mathematically.  
2. Calculate 120% of 50.  
3. Add this value to the original number (50) to get the final result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate 120% of 50.  
How to Achieve: Convert 120% to a decimal (120% = 1.20), then multiply by 50 to find 120% of 50.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
120% as a decimal is 1.20.  
1.20 × 50 = 60.  
So, 120% of 50 is 60.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add 120% of 50 to the original number (50) to find the final result.  
How to Achieve: Add the result from the previous step (60) to 50.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
50 + 60 = 110.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation is correct.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate using an alternative method, such as multiplying 50 by (1 + 120%) to compute the increased value directly, and compare with the previous result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
120% increase means multiplying by 1 + 1.20 = 2.20.  
50 × 2.20 = 110.  
This matches the previous result of 110, confirming the calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the number when 50 is increased by 120%.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand "increased by 120%" (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate 120% of 50 (completed, result: 60).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add 120% of 50 to 50 (completed, result: 110).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed, confirmed 110).  
Current Goal: Completed, as all subgoals are achieved, and the result is validated.  
Final Answer: 110.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: 110
