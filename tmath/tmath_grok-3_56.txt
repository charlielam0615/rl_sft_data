### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the conditions under which an expression \( a^b = 1 \).  
2. Identify constraints on the exponent \( 25 - x^2 \) and base \( x - 2 \).  
3. Find integer values of \( x \) that satisfy these conditions.  
4. Count all valid integer solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand the conditions for \((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the equation by considering the properties of exponents. For \( a^b = 1 \), possible cases are: \( a = 1 \), \( a = -1 \) with \( b \) even, or \( a = 0 \) with \( b = 0 \) (undefined in standard arithmetic). Assume real numbers and evaluate these cases.

[IMP]  
For \((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\), consider the following cases based on the base \( x - 2 \) and exponent \( 25 - x^2 \):  
- **Case 1: Base \( x - 2 = 1 \)**  
  \( x - 2 = 1 \implies x = 3 \).  
  Exponent: \( 25 - x^2 = 25 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16 \).  
  Equation: \( 1^{16} = 1 \), which is true.  
  Solution: \( x = 3 \).  

- **Case 2: Base \( x - 2 = -1 \)**  
  \( x - 2 = -1 \implies x = 1 \).  
  Exponent: \( 25 - x^2 = 25 - 1^2 = 25 - 1 = 24 \).  
  Equation: \( (-1)^{24} = 1 \), since 24 is even, \( (-1)^{\text{even}} = 1 \).  
  Solution: \( x = 1 \).  

- **Case 3: Base \( x - 2 = 0 \)**  
  \( x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2 \).  
  Exponent: \( 25 - x^2 = 25 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21 \).  
  Equation: \( 0^{21} = 0 \neq 1 \).  
  No solution.  

- **Case 4: Exponent \( 25 - x^2 = 0 \)**  
  \( 25 - x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 25 \implies x = \pm 5 \).  
  - For \( x = 5 \): Base \( x - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \), equation: \( 3^0 = 1 \), which is true.  
  - For \( x = -5 \): Base \( x - 2 = -5 - 2 = -7 \), equation: \( (-7)^0 = 1 \), which is true (assuming \( a^0 = 1 \) for \( a \neq 0 \)).  
  Solutions: \( x = 5 \), \( x = -5 \).  

- **Other cases**: If \( |x - 2| \neq 1 \) and \( 25 - x^2 \neq 0 \), test if \( (x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1 \). Since \( 25 - x^2 \) is an integer for integer \( x \), and \( |x - 2| > 1 \), the result is typically not 1 (e.g., \( 2^4 = 16 \neq 1 \)).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions \( x = 1, 3, 5, -5 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution back into the original equation to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- \( x = 1 \): Base \( 1 - 2 = -1 \), exponent \( 25 - 1^2 = 24 \). Equation: \( (-1)^{24} = 1 \). Valid.  
- \( x = 3 \): Base \( 3 - 2 = 1 \), exponent \( 25 - 3^2 = 16 \). Equation: \( 1^{16} = 1 \). Valid.  
- \( x = 5 \): Base \( 5 - 2 = 3 \), exponent \( 25 - 5^2 = 0 \). Equation: \( 3^0 = 1 \). Valid.  
- \( x = -5 \): Base \( -5 - 2 = -7 \), exponent \( 25 - (-5)^2 = 0 \). Equation: \( (-7)^0 = 1 \). Valid.  

Test other integers (e.g., \( x = 0 \)): Base \( 0 - 2 = -2 \), exponent \( 25 - 0 = 25 \). Equation: \( (-2)^{25} = -2^{25} \neq 1 \). No additional solutions.
