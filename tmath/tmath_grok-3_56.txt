### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of integers \( x \) that satisfy the equation \((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\). This involves determining all integer values of \( x \) for which the expression, with \( x - 2 \) as the base and \( 25 - x^2 \) as the exponent, equals 1.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the equation \((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\), we need to break it down into manageable subgoals. The equation involves an exponentiation where the base is \( x - 2 \) and the exponent is \( 25 - x^2 \). For the expression to equal 1, we need to consider the properties of exponentiation. The subgoals are:
1. Identify the conditions under which \( a^b = 1 \) for a base \( a \) and exponent \( b \).
2. Determine the possible values of the exponent \( 25 - x^2 \) and base \( x - 2 \).
3. Find all integer \( x \) that satisfy these conditions.
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they are valid.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify the conditions under which \((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\).

**How to Achieve**: Analyze the mathematical properties of an expression \( a^b = 1 \). For \( a^b = 1 \), the following cases are possible:
- **Case 1**: \( a = 1 \), and \( b \) is any real number (since \( 1^b = 1 \)).
- **Case 2**: \( a = -1 \), and \( b \) is an even integer (since \( (-1)^{\text{even}} = 1 \)).
- **Case 3**: \( a = 0 \), and \( b = 0 \) (since \( 0^0 \) is undefined, but we consider limiting cases or conventions later if needed).
- **Case 4**: \( a \neq 0, \pm 1 \), and \( b = 0 \) (since \( a^0 = 1 \) for \( a \neq 0 \)).

We will set \( a = x - 2 \) and \( b = 25 - x^2 \), and find integer \( x \) that satisfy these cases.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Letâ€™s evaluate each case:

- **Case 1: \( x - 2 = 1 \)**  
  Solve for \( x \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 1 \implies x = 3
  \]
  Check the exponent:  
  \[
  25 - x^2 = 25 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16
  \]
  Verify:  
  \[
  (x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1^{16} = 1
  \]
  This satisfies the equation. So, \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

- **Case 2: \( x - 2 = -1 \), and \( 25 - x^2 \) is even**  
  Solve for \( x \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -1 \implies x = 1
  \]
  Check the exponent:  
  \[
  25 - x^2 = 25 - 1^2 = 25 - 1 = 24
  \]
  Since 24 is even, verify:  
  \[
  (x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = (-1)^{24} = 1
  \]
  This satisfies the equation. So, \( x = 1 \) is a solution.

- **Case 3: \( x - 2 = 0 \), and \( 25 - x^2 = 0 \)**  
  Solve for \( x \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2
  \]
  Check the exponent:  
  \[
  25 - x^2 = 25 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21
  \]
  Since \( 0^{21} = 0 \neq 1 \), this case does not yield a solution.  
  Note: \( 0^0 \) is undefined, and since the exponent is 21 (not 0), this case is invalid.

- **Case 4: \( 25 - x^2 = 0 \), and \( x - 2 \neq 0 \)**  
  Solve for \( x \):  
  \[
  25 - x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 25 \implies x = \pm 5
  \]
  Check for \( x = 5 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 - 5^2 = 0
  \]
  Verify:  
  \[
  3^0 = 1
  \]
  This satisfies the equation. So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution.

  Check for \( x = -5 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -5 - 2 = -7, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 - (-5)^2 = 0
  \]
  Verify:  
  \[
  (-7)^0 = 1
  \]
  This satisfies the equation. So, \( x = -5 \) is a solution.

- **Additional Consideration**: Check if other integers \( x \) make \( x - 2 \neq \pm 1, 0 \) and \( 25 - x^2 \neq 0 \). For example, test \( x = 0 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -2, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 - 0 = 25
  \]
  \[
  (-2)^{25} = -2^{25} \neq 1
  \]
  Since \( 25 \) is odd, and \( -2 \neq \pm 1 \), this does not work. Other integers yield similar results unless they fit the above cases.

Thus, the candidate solutions are \( x = -5, 1, 3, 5 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify that all candidate solutions (\( x = -5, 1, 3, 5 \)) are valid and that no other integer solutions exist.

**How to Achieve**: Recompute the equation for each candidate and check for other possible integers by considering the constraints on the exponent and base.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-verify each solution:

- For \( x = -5 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -7, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 - 25 = 0 \implies (-7)^0 = 1
  \]
  Valid.

- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -1, \quad 25 - x^2 = 24 \implies (-1)^{24} = 1
  \]
  Valid.

- For \( x = 3 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 1, \quad 25 - x^2 = 16 \implies 1^{16} = 1
  \]
  Valid.

- For \( x = 5 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 3, \quad 25 - x^2 = 0 \implies 3^0 = 1
  \]
  Valid.

To ensure completeness, consider the exponent \( 25 - x^2 \). Since \( x \) is an integer, \( x^2 \leq 25 \) for \( 25 - x^2 \geq 0 \), so \( |x| \leq 5 \). Test remaining integers:

- \( x = 0 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -2, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 \implies (-2)^{25} \neq 1
  \]
- \( x = 2 \): Already checked, yields \( 0^{21} = 0 \).
- \( x = 4 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = 2, \quad 25 - x^2 = 25 - 16 = 9 \implies 2^9 = 512 \neq 1
  \]
- \( x = -1 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -3, \quad 25 - x^2 = 24 \implies (-3)^{24} = 3^{24} \neq 1
  \]
- \( x = -2 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -4, \quad 25 - x^2 = 21 \implies (-4)^{21} = -4^{21} \neq 1
  \]
- \( x = -3 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -5, \quad 25 - x^2 = 16 \implies (-5)^{16} = 5^{16} \neq 1
  \]
- \( x = -4 \):  
  \[
  x - 2 = -6, \quad 25 - x^2 = 9 \implies (-6)^9 = -6^9 \neq 1
  \]

For \( |x| > 5 \), \( 25 - x^2 < 0 \), and the exponent becomes negative, leading to fractions (e.g., \( (x - 2)^{-k} = \frac{1}{(x - 2)^k} \)), which are unlikely to equal 1 unless \( x - 2 = \pm 1 \), already covered.

Thus, only \( x = -5, 1, 3, 5 \) are valid.

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Find the number of integers \( x \) such that \((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify conditions for \( a^b = 1 \).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine possible values of \( x - 2 \) and \( 25 - x^2 \).
  - Subgoal 3: Find integer \( x \) satisfying the conditions.
  - Subgoal 4: Verify all solutions and ensure completeness.

**Current Goal**: Conclude the number of integer solutions.

The solutions identified are \( x = -5, 1, 3, 5 \), totaling 4 integers. All subgoals have been addressed, and the verification step confirmed no additional solutions exist within the constraint \( |x| \leq 5 \).

### Final Answer
There are 4 integer solutions to the equation \((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\): \( x = -5, 1, 3, 5 \).
