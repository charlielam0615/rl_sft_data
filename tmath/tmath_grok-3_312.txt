### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of the operation $\#(a, b, c) = b^2 - 4ac$ for the inputs $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 3$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute $\#(1, 2, 3)$ using the given formula $b^2 - 4ac$. This will be achieved by substituting $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 3$ into the formula and performing the arithmetic operations.

[IMP]  
Substitute the values into the formula:  
$\#(1, 2, 3) = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3$.  
Calculate each term:  
- $2^2 = 4$  
- $4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 12$  
Now compute:  
$4 - 12 = -8$.  
Thus, $\#(1, 2, 3) = -8$.

### Final Answer
The value of $\#(1, 2, 3)$ is $-8$.
