Goal of this step: Calculate $ f(-2) $ using the function definition.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $-2 < 0$, we use the formula $n^2 - 2$. Therefore, $f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2$.

Goal of this step: Calculate $ f(2) $ using the function definition.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $2 \geq 0$, we use the formula $2n - 20$. Therefore, $f(2) = 2(2) - 20 = 4 - 20 = -16$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up the equation $ f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 $ to solve for $ a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have $ f(-2) = 2 $ and $ f(2) = -16 $. Substituting these into the equation gives:
$$
2 + (-16) + f(a) = 0
$$
Simplifying:
$$
-14 + f(a) = 0
$$
$$
f(a) = 14
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ f(a) = 14 $ for $ a $, considering both cases of the piecewise function.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We need to solve $ f(a) = 14 $ for both cases of the piecewise function:

**Case 1: $ a < 0 $**
$$
f(a) = a^2 - 2 = 14
$$
Solving:
$$
a^2 = 16
$$
$$
a = \pm 4
$$
Since $ a < 0 $, we take $ a = -4 $.

**Case 2: $ a \geq 0 $**
$$
f(a) = 2a - 20 = 14
$$
Solving:
$$
2a = 34
$$
$$
a = 17
$$

Thus, the two values of $ a $ are $ -4 $ and $ 17 $.

Goal of this step: Calculate the positive difference between the two values of $ a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The two values of $ a $ are $ -4 $ and $ 17 $. The positive difference between them is:
$$
|17 - (-4)| = |17 + 4| = 21
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Function evaluations**: 
   - f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 ✔️
   - f(2) = 2*2 - 20 = 4 - 20 = -16 ✔️

2. **Equation setup**:
   - 2 + (-16) + f(a) = 0 ⇒ f(a) = 14 ✔️

3. **Solving f(a) = 14**:
   - **Case 1 (a < 0)**: a² - 2 = 14 ⇒ a² = 16 ⇒ a = ±4. Since a < 0, a = -4 ✔️
   - **Case 2 (a ≥ 0)**: 2a - 20 = 14 ⇒ 2a = 34 ⇒ a = 17 ✔️

4. **Positive difference**: |17 - (-4)| = 21 ✔️

All calculations and logical steps are consistent and correct. The final answer is valid.
