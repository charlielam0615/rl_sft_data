**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \(a\) for the quadratic function \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), given that its graph is a parabola with vertex at \((-4, 0)\) and passes through the point \((1, -75)\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(a\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the vertex form of the quadratic to incorporate the vertex \((-4, 0)\).  
2. Use the given point \((1, -75)\) to set up an equation.  
3. Solve for the coefficient \(a\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express the quadratic in vertex form using the vertex \((-4, 0)\).  
**How to Achieve**: The vertex form of a quadratic is \(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Substitute \(h = -4\) and \(k = 0\) to get the equation, then use the point \((1, -75)\) to find \(a\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given the vertex at \((-4, 0)\), the quadratic in vertex form is:  
\[ y = a(x - (-4))^2 + 0 = a(x + 4)^2 \]  
Next, use the point \((1, -75)\) to find \(a\). Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = -75\):  
\[ -75 = a(1 + 4)^2 \]  
\[ -75 = a(5)^2 \]  
\[ -75 = 25a \]  
\[ a = \frac{-75}{25} = -3 \]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the value of \(a = -3\) by checking if the quadratic satisfies all given conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(a = -3\) back into the vertex form, convert to standard form to confirm the vertex, and check the point \((1, -75)\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using \(a = -3\), the quadratic is:  
\[ y = -3(x + 4)^2 \]  
Expand to standard form to confirm the vertex:  
\[ y = -3(x^2 + 8x + 16) = -3x^2 - 24x - 48 \]  
The vertex of \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\) is at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Here, \(a = -3\), \(b = -24\):  
\[ x = -\frac{-24}{2(-3)} = \frac{24}{-6} = -4 \]  
Substitute \(x = -4\) into the equation:  
\[ y = -3(-4 + 4)^2 = 0 \]  
Vertex is \((-4, 0)\), which matches.  
Check the point \((1, -75)\):  
\[ y = -3(1 + 4)^2 = -3(25) = -75 \]  
This satisfies the given point. The value \(a = -3\) is valid.
