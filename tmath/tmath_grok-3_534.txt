### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( a \) for the quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), given that its graph is a parabola with vertex at \((-4, 0)\) and passes through the point \((1, -75)\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( a \):  
1. Use the vertex form of the quadratic to incorporate the vertex \((-4, 0)\).  
2. Substitute the point \((1, -75)\) into the equation to create an equation involving \( a \).  
3. Solve for \( a \) using the resulting equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express the quadratic in vertex form using the vertex \((-4, 0)\).  
**How to Achieve**: The vertex form of a quadratic is \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Given the vertex \((-4, 0)\), substitute \( h = -4 \) and \( k = 0 \) to write the equation, then proceed to the next step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), substitute \( h = -4 \) and \( k = 0 \):  
\[ y = a(x - (-4))^2 + 0 = a(x + 4)^2 \]  
This is the equation of the quadratic based on the vertex information.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Use the point \((1, -75)\) to find \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -75 \) into the vertex form equation \( y = a(x + 4)^2 \) and solve for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 1 \), \( y = -75 \) into \( y = a(x + 4)^2 \):  
\[ -75 = a(1 + 4)^2 \]  
\[ -75 = a(5)^2 \]  
\[ -75 = 25a \]  
Solve for \( a \):  
\[ a = \frac{-75}{25} = -3 \]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the value of \( a = -3 \) by checking if the quadratic satisfies both given conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = -3 \) back into the vertex form, convert to standard form to confirm the vertex, and check the point \((1, -75)\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \( a = -3 \), the quadratic is:  
\[ y = -3(x + 4)^2 \]  
Expand to standard form to confirm the vertex:  
\[ y = -3(x^2 + 8x + 16) = -3x^2 - 24x - 48 \]  
The standard form is \( y = -3x^2 - 24x - 48 \).  
To find the vertex, use \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \):  
\[ a = -3, b = -24 \]  
\[ x = -\frac{-24}{2(-3)} = \frac{24}{-6} = -4 \]  
Substitute \( x = -4 \) into the equation:  
\[ y = -3(-4 + 4)^2 = -3(0)^2 = 0 \]  
Vertex is \((-4, 0)\), which matches.  
Check the point \((1, -75)\):  
\[ y = -3(1 + 4)^2 = -3(5)^2 = -3 \cdot 25 = -75 \]  
This satisfies the given point. Thus, \( a = -3 \) is correct.
