**Problem Restatement**: We are given the function \( E(a, b, c) = a \times b^c \). We need to find the positive value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \). Substituting the parameters, this becomes \( r \times r^3 = 625 \), or equivalently, \( r^4 = 625 \). We must solve for the positive \( r \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the positive \( r \) such that \( r^4 = 625 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation \( r \times r^3 = 625 \) to a form suitable for solving.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( r \).  
3. Verify that the solution is positive and satisfies the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \( r \times r^3 = 625 \). This can be achieved by combining the terms with the same base \( r \) using exponent rules to express the equation in a form like \( r^n = 625 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( r \times r^3 \):  
\[ r \times r^3 = r^{1+3} = r^4. \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ r^4 = 625. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( r^4 = 625 \) for the positive \( r \). This can be achieved by taking the fourth root of both sides, considering only the positive solution since the problem specifies a positive \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve \( r^4 = 625 \), take the fourth root:  
\[ r = 625^{1/4}. \]  
Since \( 625 = 5^4 \) (because \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625 \)), we have:  
\[ 625^{1/4} = (5^4)^{1/4} = 5^{4/4} = 5. \]  
Thus, \( r = 5 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = 5 \) is a positive solution to \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( r = 5 \) back into the original equation and checking if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = 5 \) into \( E(r, r, 3) = r \times r^3 \):  
\[ E(5, 5, 3) = 5 \times 5^3 = 5 \times 125 = 625. \]  
The equation \( 625 = 625 \) holds, and \( r = 5 \) is positive, satisfying the problemâ€™s conditions.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the positive \( r \) such that \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \( r \times r^3 = 625 \) to \( r^4 = 625 \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( r^4 = 625 \) for positive \( r \). (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed in Step 4)  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \( r = 5 \) satisfies the equation and is positive. No further subgoals are needed.

**Final Answer**: The positive value of \( r \) that satisfies \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \) is \( r = 5 \).
