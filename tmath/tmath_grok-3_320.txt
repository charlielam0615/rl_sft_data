**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the positive value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \), where \( E(a, b, c) = a \times b^c \). Substituting the given values, the equation becomes \( r \times r^3 = 625 \), or equivalently, \( r^4 = 625 \). We must solve for the positive \( r \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \( r^4 = 625 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the equation \( r \times r^3 = 625 \) to \( r^4 = 625 \).  
2. Solve for \( r \) by finding the fourth root of 625.  
3. Identify the positive solution since the problem specifies a positive \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( r^4 = 625 \) for the positive \( r \). This can be achieved by taking the fourth root of 625, i.e., computing \( r = 625^{1/4} \), and selecting the positive real solution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve \( r^4 = 625 \), take the fourth root of both sides:  
\[ r = 625^{1/4} \]  
Since 625 = \( 5^4 \) (because \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625 \)), we have:  
\[ 625^{1/4} = (5^4)^{1/4} = 5^{4/4} = 5 \]  
Thus, \( r = 5 \) is a solution. Since the problem asks for the positive value, \( r = 5 \) is appropriate. Note that \( r^4 = 625 \) also has a negative solution (\( r = -5 \)), but we discard it as the problem specifies a positive \( r \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = 5 \) satisfies \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( r = 5 \) into the original equation and checking if the result equals 625.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = 5 \) into \( E(r, r, 3) \):  
\[ E(5, 5, 3) = 5 \times 5^3 = 5 \times 125 = 625 \]  
The result is 625, which matches the given equation. Thus, \( r = 5 \) is a valid solution.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the positive \( r \) such that \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \( E(r, r, 3) = r \times r^3 = r^4 = 625 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( r^4 = 625 \) by computing \( r = 625^{1/4} \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution \( r = 5 \) and ensure all subgoals are addressed. All subgoals have been completed: the equation was simplified, solved, and verified.

**Final Answer**: The positive value of \( r \) that satisfies \( E(r, r, 3) = 625 \) is \( r = 5 \).
