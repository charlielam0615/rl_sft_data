### Problem Restatement
We need to expand the product \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\), which involves multiplying two binomials to obtain a simplified polynomial expression.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Apply the distributive property (or FOIL method) to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.  
2. Combine like terms to simplify the resulting expression.  
3. Verify the final expression for correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Multiply the binomials \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\) using the distributive property.  
- **How to Achieve:** Distribute each term of the first binomial (\(9x\) and \(2\)) to each term of the second binomial (\(4x^2\) and \(3\)), resulting in four terms: \(9x \cdot 4x^2\), \(9x \cdot 3\), \(2 \cdot 4x^2\), and \(2 \cdot 3\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Perform the multiplication:  
- \(9x \cdot 4x^2 = 36x^3\)  
- \(9x \cdot 3 = 27x\)  
- \(2 \cdot 4x^2 = 8x^2\)  
- \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\)  

The resulting expression is:  
\(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The initial subgoals included combining like terms after multiplication. Since the terms from the multiplication (\(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\)) are not in standard polynomial form (descending powers of \(x\)) and may include like terms, refine the subgoal:  
1. Reorganize and combine like terms to write the polynomial in standard form.  
2. Verify the final expression.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Combine like terms and write the polynomial \(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\) in standard form.  
- **How to Achieve:** Identify terms with the same degree, combine them, and arrange the polynomial in descending order of degree.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Identify and combine like terms:  
- \(x^3\) term: \(36x^3\)  
- \(x^2\) term: \(8x^2\)  
- \(x\) term: \(27x\)  
- Constant term: \(6\)  

Arrange in standard form (descending powers of \(x\)):  
\(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\)  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the correctness of the expanded polynomial \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute a value for \(x\) into the original expression \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\) and the expanded expression, then compare the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Choose \(x = 1\) for simplicity:  
- Original expression: \((9 \cdot 1 + 2)(4 \cdot 1^2 + 3) = (9 + 2)(4 + 3) = 11 \cdot 7 = 77\)  
- Expanded expression: \(36 \cdot 1^3 + 8 \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 + 6 = 36 + 8 + 27 + 6 = 77\)  

Since both yield 77, the expansion is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Expand \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply the binomials using the distributive property (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms and write in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the final expression (completed).  

**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The final expanded polynomial is \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The expanded product is \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).
