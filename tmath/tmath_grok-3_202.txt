**Problem Statement**: Expand the product \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of expanding the product into subgoals:  
1. Apply the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.  
2. Combine like terms to simplify the resulting expression.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the distributive property to multiply each term in \((9x + 2)\) by each term in \((4x^2 + 3)\). This involves computing \(9x \cdot 4x^2\), \(9x \cdot 3\), \(2 \cdot 4x^2\), and \(2 \cdot 3\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the multiplications:  
- \(9x \cdot 4x^2 = 36x^3\)  
- \(9x \cdot 3 = 27x\)  
- \(2 \cdot 4x^2 = 8x^2\)  
- \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\)  
The result is \(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the expansion \(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\). Verify by ensuring all terms are correctly multiplied and check for like terms that need combining.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the multiplications:  
- \(9x \cdot 4x^2 = 36x^3\) (correct)  
- \(9x \cdot 3 = 27x\) (correct)  
- \(2 \cdot 4x^2 = 8x^2\) (correct)  
- \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\) (correct)  
Check for like terms: The terms are \(36x^3\), \(8x^2\), \(27x\), and \(6\). No terms share the same degree, so no combining is needed yet. The expression is valid but not in standard form (descending powers of \(x\)).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Adjust the subgoal to include arranging the terms in standard form (descending powers of \(x\)) to complete the expansion. New subgoal: Rewrite \(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\) as \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine like terms and arrange the expression \(36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6\) in standard form. Since no like terms exist, reorder the terms in descending powers of \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reorder the terms: \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Expand \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Apply the distributive property (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms and arrange in standard form (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final expression \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final expression \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\) by substituting a value for \(x\) and comparing the product \((9x + 2)(4x^2 + 3)\) with the expanded form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test with \(x = 1\):  
- Original: \((9 \cdot 1 + 2)(4 \cdot 1^2 + 3) = (9 + 2)(4 + 3) = 11 \cdot 7 = 77\).  
- Expanded: \(36 \cdot 1^3 + 8 \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 + 6 = 36 + 8 + 27 + 6 = 77\).  
The values match, confirming the expansion is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The expanded product is \(36x^3 + 8x^2 + 27x + 6\).
