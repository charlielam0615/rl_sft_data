**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \(525^2 - 475^2\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the calculation. Recognize that the expression \(525^2 - 475^2\) resembles the difference of squares, which can be factored as \((a + b)(a - b)\). Set subgoals to identify \(a\) and \(b\), apply the formula, and compute the result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the difference of squares formula to \(525^2 - 475^2\). Identify \(a = 525\) and \(b = 475\), then use the formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\) to simplify the expression and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite \(525^2 - 475^2\) using the difference of squares formula:  
\[ 525^2 - 475^2 = (525 + 475)(525 - 475) \]  
Calculate the components:  
- \(525 + 475 = 1000\)  
- \(525 - 475 = 50\)  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[ (525 + 475)(525 - 475) = 1000 \times 50 = 50000 \]  
The result is 50,000.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the calculated result (50,000) by using an alternative method, such as direct computation or partial verification, to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, compute \(525^2\) and \(475^2\) directly (or partially) and check the difference:  
- \(525^2 = (500 + 25)^2 = 500^2 + 2 \cdot 500 \cdot 25 + 25^2 = 250000 + 25000 + 625 = 275625\)  
- \(475^2 = (500 - 25)^2 = 500^2 - 2 \cdot 500 \cdot 25 + 25^2 = 250000 - 25000 + 625 = 225625\)  
- Difference: \(275625 - 225625 = 50000\)  
The direct calculation confirms the result is 50,000, matching the difference of squares method.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(525^2 - 475^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Recognize and apply the difference of squares formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the result using the formula (completed, result: 50,000).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result using an alternative method (completed, confirmed 50,000).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(525^2 - 475^2\) is 50,000.
