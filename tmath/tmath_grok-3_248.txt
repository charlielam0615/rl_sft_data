**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( 525^2 - 475^2 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( 525^2 - 475^2 \). Recognize that this expression resembles the difference of squares, \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), where \( a = 525 \) and \( b = 475 \). Subgoals:
1. Identify the difference of squares formula.
2. Compute \( a - b = 525 - 475 \).
3. Compute \( a + b = 525 + 475 \).
4. Multiply the results to find \( (a - b)(a + b) \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the difference of squares formula \( 525^2 - 475^2 = (525 - 475)(525 + 475) \).
How to Achieve: Compute \( 525 - 475 \) and \( 525 + 475 \), then multiply the results.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \( 525 - 475 \):
\[ 525 - 475 = 50 \]

Calculate \( 525 + 475 \):
\[ 525 + 475 = 1000 \]

Multiply the results:
\[ (525 - 475)(525 + 475) = 50 \times 1000 = 50,000 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computation \( 525^2 - 475^2 = 50,000 \).
How to Achieve: Use an alternative method to compute \( 525^2 - 475^2 \), such as directly calculating each square and subtracting, or confirm intermediate steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify by checking intermediate steps:
- \( 525 - 475 = 50 \) is correct (simple subtraction).
- \( 525 + 475 = 1000 \) is correct (simple addition).
- \( 50 \times 1000 = 50,000 \) is correct (multiplication).

Alternatively, compute directly (for confirmation):
- \( 525^2 = 525 \times 525 = 275,625 \) (since \( 500 \times 525 = 262,500 \), and \( 25 \times 525 = 13,125 \), so \( 262,500 + 13,125 = 275,625 \)).
- \( 475^2 = 475 \times 475 = 225,625 \) (since \( 500 \times 475 = 237,500 \), and \( 25 \times 475 = 11,875 \), so \( 237,500 - 11,875 = 225,625 \)).
- \( 275,625 - 225,625 = 50,000 \).

Both methods yield \( 50,000 \), confirming the result.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( 525^2 - 475^2 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the difference of squares formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 525 - 475 \) (completed, result: 50).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( 525 + 475 \) (completed, result: 1000).
  - Subgoal 4: Multiply results to find \( (525 - 475)(525 + 475) \) (completed, result: 50,000).
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the result (completed, confirmed 50,000).

Current Goal: None (problem solved).
The final result is \( 50,000 \).
