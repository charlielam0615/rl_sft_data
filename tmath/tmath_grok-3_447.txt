**Problem Statement**: A rectangular room has a perimeter of 42 feet and an area of 108 square feet. We need to find the length of the shorter side in feet.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the shorter side of the rectangle.  
1. Define the variables for the rectangle’s dimensions (length and width).  
2. Set up equations using the given perimeter and area.  
3. Solve the equations to find the dimensions.  
4. Identify the shorter side.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations for the rectangle’s dimensions using the perimeter and area. Use the perimeter formula (2L + 2W = 42) and the area formula (L * W = 108), where L is length and W is width, to create a system of equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangle.  
From the perimeter:  
2L + 2W = 42  
Divide by 2:  
L + W = 21  (Equation 1)  

From the area:  
L * W = 108  (Equation 2)  

We now have the system of equations:  
1. L + W = 21  
2. L * W = 108

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations (L + W = 21, L * W = 108) to find the dimensions L and W. Use substitution or a quadratic equation to solve for the dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Equation 1: L + W = 21, express L in terms of W:  
L = 21 - W  

Substitute into Equation 2:  
(21 - W) * W = 108  
W(21 - W) = 108  
21W - W² = 108  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
W² - 21W + 108 = 0  

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, W = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -21, c = 108:  
Discriminant: b² - 4ac = (-21)² - 4 * 1 * 108 = 441 - 432 = 9  
W = [21 ± √9] / (2 * 1) = [21 ± 3] / 2  
W = (21 + 3) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12  
W = (21 - 3) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9  

For W = 12, L = 21 - 12 = 9.  
For W = 9, L = 21 - 9 = 12.  

The dimensions are L = 12 feet, W = 9 feet (or vice versa).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the length of the shorter side of the rectangle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for length and width (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations using perimeter and area (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve equations to find dimensions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the shorter side (current).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the shorter side from the dimensions L = 12 feet, W = 9 feet.  
The dimensions are 12 feet and 9 feet. The shorter side is 9 feet.

### Final Answer
The length of the shorter side is 9 feet.
