**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the length and width of the rectangle.  
2. Set up equations using the given perimeter and area.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the dimensions.  
4. Identify the shorter side.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define variables and set up equations for the perimeter and area.  
**How to Achieve**: Let the length be \( l \) and the width be \( w \). Use the perimeter formula \( 2l + 2w = 42 \) and the area formula \( l \cdot w = 108 \). Simplify the perimeter equation to form a system of equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( l \) be the length and \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.  
Given:  
- Perimeter: \( 2l + 2w = 42 \). Simplify by dividing by 2: \( l + w = 21 \).  
- Area: \( l \cdot w = 108 \).  
We now have the system of equations:  
1. \( l + w = 21 \)  
2. \( l \cdot w = 108 \)

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find the dimensions.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the first equation \( l + w = 21 \) to express \( l \) in terms of \( w \), substitute into the second equation \( l \cdot w = 108 \), and solve the resulting quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( l + w = 21 \), express \( l \) as \( l = 21 - w \).  
Substitute into the area equation:  
\[ (21 - w) \cdot w = 108 \]  
Expand:  
\[ 21w - w^2 = 108 \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[ w^2 - 21w + 108 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -21 \), \( c = 108 \):  
\[ w = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{(-21)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 108}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{441 - 432}}{2} = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{21 \pm 3}{2} \]  
\[ w = \frac{21 + 3}{2} = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{21 - 3}{2} = 9 \]  
For \( w = 12 \), \( l = 21 - 12 = 9 \).  
For \( w = 9 \), \( l = 21 - 9 = 12 \).  
The dimensions are \( l = 12 \) feet and \( w = 9 \) feet (or vice versa).

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the dimensions satisfy both the perimeter and area conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( l = 12 \) and \( w = 9 \) into the perimeter and area formulas to confirm they hold.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check perimeter: \( 2l + 2w = 2 \cdot 12 + 2 \cdot 9 = 24 + 18 = 42 \). This matches the given perimeter.  
Check area: \( l \cdot w = 12 \cdot 9 = 108 \). This matches the given area.  
The dimensions \( l = 12 \) feet and \( w = 9 \) feet are valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the length of the shorter side.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the dimensions \( l = 12 \) and \( w = 9 \) and select the smaller value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The dimensions are 12 feet and 9 feet. The shorter side is 9 feet.
