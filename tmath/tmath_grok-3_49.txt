### Problem Restatement
We need to find the tenth term in the geometric sequence given by \(9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\). A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms, and the \(n\)-th term is given by \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\), where \(a_1\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the term number.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the tenth term, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Identify the first term \(a_1\).
2. Determine the common ratio \(r\) by dividing consecutive terms.
3. Use the geometric sequence formula \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\) to find the tenth term (\(n = 10\)).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the first term \(a_1\).
Description: Examine the sequence \(9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\) and note the first term.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence starts with \(9\). Therefore, the first term is \(a_1 = 9\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the common ratio \(r\).
Description: Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms, e.g., divide the second term by the first term and verify consistency with another pair.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the ratio:
- Second term divided by first term: \(\frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}\).
- Third term divided by second term: \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\).
The common ratio is consistent, so \(r = \frac{1}{3}\).

### Step 4

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the tenth term of the geometric sequence.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the first term \(a_1\). (Completed: \(a_1 = 9\))
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the common ratio \(r\). (Completed: \(r = \frac{1}{3}\))
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the tenth term using \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\).
Current Goal: Calculate the tenth term.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the tenth term using the formula \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\).
Description: Substitute \(a_1 = 9\), \(r = \frac{1}{3}\), and \(n = 10\) into the formula and compute.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the formula \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\):
- For the tenth term, \(n = 10\).
- \(a_{10} = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{10-1} = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^9\).
- Compute \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^9 = \frac{1}{3^9} = \frac{1}{19683}\).
- So, \(a_{10} = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{19683} = \frac{9}{19683}\).
- Simplify: \(9 \div 9 = 1\), and \(19683 \div 9 = 2187\), so \(\frac{9}{19683} = \frac{1}{2187}\).
Thus, the tenth term is \(\frac{1}{2187}\).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the tenth term.
Description: Recalculate the tenth term by listing terms manually or recomputing with the formula to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute using the formula:
- \(a_{10} = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^9 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{3^9}\).
- \(3^9 = 3 \cdot 3^8 = 3 \cdot 6561 = 19683\).
- So, \(a_{10} = \frac{9}{19683} = \frac{1}{2187}\) (as \(19683 \div 9 = 2187\)).
Alternatively, list terms:
- \(a_1 = 9\),
- \(a_2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3\),
- \(a_3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1\),
- \(a_4 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\),
- \(a_5 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}\),
- \(a_6 = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{27}\),
- \(a_7 = \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{81}\),
- \(a_8 = \frac{1}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{243}\),
- \(a_9 = \frac{1}{243} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{729}\),
- \(a_{10} = \frac{1}{729} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2187}\).
Both methods confirm the tenth term is \(\frac{1}{2187}\).
