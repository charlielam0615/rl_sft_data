**Problem Statement**: Find the tenth term in the geometric sequence \(9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the tenth term of the geometric sequence, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the first term and common ratio of the sequence.  
2. Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence to compute the tenth term.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Identify the first term and common ratio.  
**How to achieve**: Examine the given sequence \(9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\). The first term is the first number. The common ratio is found by dividing each term by the previous term.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sequence is \(9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\).  
- **First term (\(a_1\))**: The first term is \(9\).  
- **Common ratio (\(r\))**: Compute the ratio between consecutive terms:  
  - \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
  - \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
  - \( \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
  The common ratio is \( r = \frac{1}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Compute the tenth term using the geometric sequence formula.  
**How to achieve**: Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence, \( a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \), where \( a_1 = 9 \), \( r = \frac{1}{3} \), and \( n = 10 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The formula for the \(n\)-th term is \( a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \).  
- Given: \( a_1 = 9 \), \( r = \frac{1}{3} \), \( n = 10 \).  
- Compute:  
  \[
  a_{10} = 9 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{10-1} = 9 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^9 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{3^9}
  \]  
- Calculate \( 3^9 \):  
  \[
  3^9 = 3^5 \cdot 3^4 = 243 \cdot 81 = 19683
  \]  
- So,  
  \[
  a_{10} = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{19683} = \frac{9}{19683}
  \]  
- Simplify \( \frac{9}{19683} \):  
  - \( 9 = 3^2 \), \( 19683 = 3^9 \).  
  - \( \frac{9}{19683} = \frac{3^2}{3^9} = 3^{2-9} = 3^{-7} = \frac{1}{3^7} \).  
  - Compute \( 3^7 = 3^5 \cdot 3^2 = 243 \cdot 9 = 2187 \).  
  - Thus, \( \frac{1}{3^7} = \frac{1}{2187} \).  
The tenth term is \( \frac{1}{2187} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Verify the correctness of the tenth term.  
**How to achieve**: Recalculate the tenth term by listing the sequence terms up to the tenth term to confirm the pattern and result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sequence is \( 9, 3, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots \), with \( a_1 = 9 \), \( r = \frac{1}{3} \). Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \( \frac{1}{3} \):  
- \( a_1 = 9 \)  
- \( a_2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3 \)  
- \( a_3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1 \)  
- \( a_4 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
- \( a_5 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9} \)  
- \( a_6 = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{27} \)  
- \( a_7 = \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{81} \)  
- \( a_8 = \frac{1}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{243} \)  
- \( a_9 = \frac{1}{243} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{729} \)  
- \( a_{10} = \frac{1}{729} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2187} \)  
The tenth term is \( \frac{1}{2187} \), which matches the formula result.
