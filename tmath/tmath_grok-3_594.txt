### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of different paths from point A (0,0) to point B (4,3) on a 5x4 grid, where each step is 1 unit right or up, and the total path length is 7 units. The grid has 5 columns (x from 0 to 4) and 4 rows (y from 0 to 3), and we must stay on the grid lines, moving only right or up.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the number of paths from A(0,0) to B(4,3) into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of steps required to reach B(4,3) from A(0,0).
2. Verify if a 7-unit path is feasible given the grid constraints.
3. Identify the mathematical approach to count all valid paths (e.g., combinatorial method).
4. Calculate the number of distinct paths.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the total number of steps required to reach B(4,3) from A(0,0) and verify if a 7-unit path is feasible.  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate the Manhattan distance from A(0,0) to B(4,3), which is the minimum number of steps needed, by summing the differences in x and y coordinates. Check if this matches the required 7-unit path length.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To move from A(0,0) to B(4,3), we need:
- x-coordinate change: 4 - 0 = 4 steps right.
- y-coordinate change: 3 - 0 = 3 steps up.

Total steps = 4 (right) + 3 (up) = 7 steps.

Since the problem specifies a 7-unit path, and the Manhattan distance is exactly 7, the path must consist of exactly 4 right moves and 3 up moves, with no additional steps allowed (e.g., no detours). This confirms that a 7-unit path is feasible and corresponds to the shortest paths on the grid.

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Since the path length matches the Manhattan distance, adjust the subgoals to focus on counting the number of valid paths:
1. Use a combinatorial approach to count the number of ways to arrange 4 right moves and 3 up moves in a sequence of 7 steps.
2. Validate the calculation to ensure correctness.
3. Present the final number of distinct paths.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Count the number of distinct paths from A(0,0) to B(4,3) using 4 right moves and 3 up moves.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the combinatorial formula for choosing positions for the moves. The number of ways to arrange 4 right moves (R) and 3 up moves (U) in a sequence of 7 steps is given by the binomial coefficient C(7, 4) or C(7, 3).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of steps is 7 (4 right + 3 up). The number of distinct paths is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 for the right moves (the remaining 3 positions are for up moves), which is the binomial coefficient:

\[ C(7, 4) = \frac{7!}{4! \cdot 3!} \]

Calculate:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( C(7, 4) = \frac{5040}{24 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{144} = 35 \)

Alternatively, since \( C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) \):
- \( C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 4!} = \frac{5040}{6 \times 24} = 35 \)

Thus, there are 35 distinct paths.

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate the calculation of the number of paths.  
- **How to Achieve**: Cross-check the combinatorial calculation using an alternative method, such as the grid path formula, and ensure the result aligns with the problem constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem is a classic grid path problem. For a grid from (0,0) to (m,n), the number of paths is given by:

\[ C(m+n, m) = \frac{(m+n)!}{m! \cdot n!} \]

Here, m = 4 (right moves), n = 3 (up moves), so:

\[ C(4+3, 4) = C(7, 4) = 35 \]

This matches the previous calculation. Additionally, consider a smaller case to build intuition, e.g., from (0,0) to (1,1) (2 steps: 1 right, 1 up):
- \( C(2, 1) = \frac{2!}{1! \cdot 1!} = 2 \), which is correct (paths: RU, UR).

The calculation \( C(7, 4) = 35 \) is consistent with the grid path formula and problem constraints (7-unit path, grid-based movement).
