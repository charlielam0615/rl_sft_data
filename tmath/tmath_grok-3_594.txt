**Problem Restatement:** We need to find the number of different paths from point A to point B on a grid where each block is 1 unit by 1 unit. The path must be exactly 7 units long, and we must stay on the grid lines without cutting across blocks. From the Asymptote code provided, the grid appears to be 5 units wide and 4 units high, with A at (0,0) and B at (4,3).

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to understand the grid structure and constraints. First, I need to confirm the grid dimensions and the positions of A and B. Then, I will determine the shortest path from A to B and compare it to the required path length of 7 units. Finally, I will calculate the number of valid paths that meet the 7-unit requirement.

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm the grid dimensions and positions of A and B.  
How to Achieve: I will interpret the Asymptote code to verify the grid size and the coordinates of points A and B.

Based on the Asymptote code, the grid is drawn with width w=5 and height h=4. The loops draw horizontal lines from y=0 to y=3 (4 lines) and vertical lines from x=0 to x=4 (5 lines), indicating a grid of 5 vertical lines and 4 horizontal lines. This forms a grid where points range from (0,0) to (4,3). Point A is labeled at (0,0) and point B at (4,3). Thus, we are moving from (0,0) to (4,3) on this grid.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the shortest path from A to B.  
How to Achieve: Determine the minimum number of moves required to go from (0,0) to (4,3) by moving only right or up along the grid lines.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To move from (0,0) to (4,3), I need to move 4 units right and 3 units up. The shortest path without any detours would be a total of 4 + 3 = 7 units. The number of such shortest paths can be calculated using combinations, as it involves choosing 3 up moves out of 7 total moves (or equivalently 4 right moves out of 7). This is given by C(7,3) = 35 paths. However, the problem specifies a 7-unit path, which matches the shortest path length, so I need to confirm if additional constraints or interpretations apply. For now, it appears the shortest path is 7 units, and there are 35 such paths.

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Confirm if the 7-unit path requirement allows only shortest paths or includes detours.  
How to Achieve: Re-evaluate the problem statement to ensure correct interpretation of the path length constraint and compute the number of paths accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The problem specifies a "7 unit path," and since the shortest path from (0,0) to (4,3) is exactly 7 units (4 right, 3 up), it seems the problem is asking for the number of shortest paths. As calculated earlier, the number of ways to arrange 4 right moves and 3 up moves in a sequence of 7 moves is C(7,3) = 35. There are no additional constraints mentioned (like obstacles or detours), and since detours would result in paths longer than 7 units, which are not allowed, the valid paths are only the shortest ones. Therefore, the number of different 7-unit paths from A to B is 35.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**  
There are 35 different 7-unit paths from A to B on the grid.
