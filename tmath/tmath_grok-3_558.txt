**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine Bob's weight given two conditions: the sum of Jim's and Bob's weights is 180 pounds, and the difference between Bob's weight and Jim's weight is half of Bob's weight.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to solve for Bob's weight. First, I will define variables for Jim's and Bob's weights. Then, I will set up equations based on the given conditions. Finally, I will solve these equations to find Bob's weight.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Set up equations based on the problem conditions.  
How to Achieve: Assign variables to Jim’s and Bob’s weights, then translate the given conditions into mathematical equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let Jim's weight be J pounds and Bob's weight be B pounds.  
From the problem:  
1. J + B = 180 (sum of their weights)  
2. B - J = (1/2)B (difference between Bob's and Jim's weight is half of Bob's weight)  
These equations represent the conditions provided in the problem.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Solve the equations to find Bob's weight.  
How to Achieve: Use the system of equations to solve for B by substituting or eliminating variables.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have the equations:  
1. J + B = 180  
2. B - J = (1/2)B  

From equation 2, rearrange to isolate terms:  
B - (1/2)B = J  
(1/2)B = J  

Substitute J = (1/2)B into equation 1:  
(1/2)B + B = 180  
(1/2)B + (2/2)B = 180  
(3/2)B = 180  
B = 180 * (2/3)  
B = 120  

So, Bob's weight is 120 pounds.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies both conditions.  
How to Achieve: Plug Bob's weight (120 pounds) back into the equations to calculate Jim's weight and confirm both conditions hold true.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
If Bob's weight (B) is 120 pounds, then:  
From equation 1: J + 120 = 180, so J = 180 - 120 = 60 pounds.  
From equation 2: B - J = 120 - 60 = 60, and half of Bob's weight is (1/2)*120 = 60.  
Since 60 = 60, the second condition holds true.  
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that Bob's weight is indeed 120 pounds.
