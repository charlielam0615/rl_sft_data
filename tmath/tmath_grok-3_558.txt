### Problem Statement
We need to determine Bob's weight given two conditions:
1. The sum of Jim's weight and Bob's weight is 180 pounds.
2. Subtracting Jim's weight from Bob's weight results in half of Bob's weight.

Let's solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution:  
- Subgoal 1: Translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations.  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find Bob's weight.  
- Subgoal 3: Verify the solution satisfies both conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the given statements to define variables and form equations based on the relationships described.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let Jim's weight be \( J \) pounds and Bob's weight be \( B \) pounds.  
From the problem:  
1. The sum of their weights is 180 pounds:  
   \( J + B = 180 \)  
2. Subtracting Jim's weight from Bob's weight gives half of Bob's weight:  
   \( B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \)  

We now have the system of equations:  
- \( J + B = 180 \)  
- \( B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find Bob's weight.  
- **How to Achieve**: Manipulate the equations algebraically to isolate \( B \), solving for Bob's weight.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
We have:  
1. \( J + B = 180 \)  
2. \( B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \)  

Simplify the second equation:  
\[ B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \]  
Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ 2(B - J) = B \]  
\[ 2B - 2J = B \]  
Subtract \( B \) from both sides:  
\[ 2B - B - 2J = 0 \]  
\[ B - 2J = 0 \]  
\[ B = 2J \]  

Substitute \( B = 2J \) into the first equation:  
\[ J + B = 180 \]  
\[ J + 2J = 180 \]  
\[ 3J = 180 \]  
\[ J = 60 \]  

Now find \( B \):  
\[ B = 2J = 2 \cdot 60 = 120 \]  

So, Bob's weight is 120 pounds.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the solution satisfies both conditions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( J = 60 \) and \( B = 120 \) into both original conditions to check if they hold true.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the conditions:  
1. Sum of weights:  
   \( J + B = 60 + 120 = 180 \)  
   This satisfies the first condition (\( J + B = 180 \)).  

2. Difference of weights:  
   \( B - J = 120 - 60 = 60 \)  
   Half of Bob's weight:  
   \( \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 120 = 60 \)  
   Since \( 60 = 60 \), the second condition (\( B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \)) is satisfied.  

The solution \( B = 120 \) pounds is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find Bob's weight.  
  - Subgoal 1: Translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find Bob's weight (completed, \( B = 120 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution satisfies both conditions (completed, solution is valid).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as Bob's weight has been determined and verified.

### Final Answer
Bob weighs **120 pounds**.
