**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of positive integers \( x \) for which the expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) yields a value strictly between 20 and 40, i.e., \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find positive integers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality. Subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) in a simplified form.  
2. Set up the inequality \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).  
3. Solve the inequality to find the range of \( x \).  
4. Identify positive integers within that range.  
5. Count the number of such integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) in a simplified form.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize the expression as a perfect square trinomial by factoring or completing the square.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) can be factored as:  
\[ x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \]  
This simplifies the expression for use in the inequality.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the inequality \( 20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the factored expression into the inequality and solve for \( x \) by taking square roots and isolating \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the simplified expression, the inequality becomes:  
\[ 20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40 \]  
Take the square root of all parts (noting that the square root function is increasing for non-negative values):  
\[ \sqrt{20} < |x + 3| < \sqrt{40} \]  
Approximate the bounds:  
- \( \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472 \) (since \( 4^2 = 16 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \))  
- \( \sqrt{40} \approx 6.325 \) (since \( 6^2 = 36 \), \( 7^2 = 49 \))  
Thus:  
\[ 4.472 < |x + 3| < 6.325 \]  
Since \( x \) is a positive integer, \( x + 3 > 0 \), so \( |x + 3| = x + 3 \). The inequality simplifies to:  
\[ 4.472 < x + 3 < 6.325 \]  
Subtract 3 from all parts:  
\[ 4.472 - 3 < x < 6.325 - 3 \]  
\[ 1.472 < x < 3.325 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify positive integers \( x \) that satisfy \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \).  
**How to Achieve**: List all positive integers within the interval \( (1.472, 3.325) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The interval \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \) includes numbers between 1.472 and 3.325. The positive integers in this range are:  
- \( x = 2 \) (since \( 1.472 < 2 < 3.325 \))  
- \( x = 3 \) (since \( 1.472 < 3 < 3.325 \))  
Check if \( x = 1 \) or \( x = 4 \) are included:  
- For \( x = 1 \): \( 1 < 1.472 \), so \( x = 1 \) is not in the interval.  
- For \( x = 4 \): \( 4 > 3.325 \), so \( x = 4 \) is not in the interval.  
Thus, the possible positive integers are \( x = 2, 3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) satisfy \( 20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40 \), and check for any missed integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( (x + 3)^2 \) for \( x = 2, 3 \) and confirm the results are between 20 and 40. Also, test boundary integers (e.g., \( x = 1, 4 \)) to ensure completeness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate \( (x + 3)^2 \) for the candidate integers:  
- For \( x = 2 \): \( (2 + 3)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \). Check: \( 20 < 25 < 40 \), which is true.  
- For \( x = 3 \): \( (3 + 3)^2 = 6^2 = 36 \). Check: \( 20 < 36 < 40 \), which is true.  
Test boundary integers:  
- For \( x = 1 \): \( (1 + 3)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \). Check: \( 16 < 20 \), so \( x = 1 \) does not satisfy.  
- For \( x = 4 \): \( (4 + 3)^2 = 7^2 = 49 \). Check: \( 49 > 40 \), so \( x = 4 \) does not satisfy.  
The solutions \( x = 2, 3 \) are valid, and no other positive integers satisfy the inequality.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of positive integers \( x \) such that \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) to \( (x + 3)^2 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the inequality \( 20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify positive integers in the solution range \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solutions and check for completeness. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Count the valid positive integers. (Current)  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of valid positive integers \( x \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of positive integers that satisfy the inequality.  
**How to Achieve**: Count the valid integers identified (\( x = 2, 3 \)) to provide the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The valid positive integers are \( x = 2, 3 \). Counting them:  
- Number of integers = 2.  
**Final Answer**: There are 2 positive integers \( x \) for which \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) is between 20 and 40.
