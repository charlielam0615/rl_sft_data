### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of positive integers \( x \) for which the expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) yields a value strictly between 20 and 40, i.e., \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Simplify the given expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \).  
2. Set up the inequality \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).  
3. Solve the inequality to find the range of \( x \).  
4. Identify the positive integers \( x \) within that range.  
5. Count the number of valid integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) and set up the inequality. This can be achieved by recognizing the expression as a perfect square and rewriting the inequality accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The expression \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2
\]
The inequality \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \) becomes:
\[
20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( 20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40 \) to find the range of \( x \). This can be achieved by taking the square root of all parts and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the inequality:
\[
20 < (x + 3)^2 < 40
\]
Take the square root of all parts, noting that the square root function is defined for non-negative numbers:
\[
\sqrt{20} < |x + 3| < \sqrt{40}
\]
Approximate the square roots:
- \( \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472 \) (since \( 4^2 = 16 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \)).
- \( \sqrt{40} \approx 6.325 \) (since \( 6^2 = 36 \), \( 7^2 = 49 \)).
Thus:
\[
4.472 < |x + 3| < 6.325
\]
This implies two cases for \( x + 3 \):
1. \( 4.472 < x + 3 < 6.325 \)
2. \( -6.325 < x + 3 < -4.472 \)

Solve each case:
- **Case 1**: \( 4.472 < x + 3 < 6.325 \)
\[
4.472 - 3 < x < 6.325 - 3
\]
\[
1.472 < x < 3.325
\]
- **Case 2**: \( -6.325 < x + 3 < -4.472 \)
\[
-6.325 - 3 < x < -4.472 - 3
\]
\[
-9.325 < x < -7.472
\]
Since we need positive integers \( x \), discard Case 2 (as \( x < 0 \)). For Case 1, the range is:
\[
1.472 < x < 3.325
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the positive integers \( x \) in the range \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \). This can be achieved by listing the integers within this interval.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The range \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \) includes values of \( x \) between 1.472 and 3.325. The positive integers in this interval are:
- \( x = 2 \) (since \( 1.472 < 2 < 3.325 \))
- \( x = 3 \) (since \( 1.472 < 3 < 3.325 \))

Values outside this range:
- \( x = 1 \): \( 1 < 1.472 \), so not included.
- \( x = 4 \): \( 4 > 3.325 \), so not included.
Thus, the candidate positive integers are \( x = 2, 3 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( x = 2, 3 \) satisfy the original inequality \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \). This can be achieved by substituting each value into the expression and checking the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \( x = 2 \):
\[
x^2 + 6x + 9 = 2^2 + 6 \cdot 2 + 9 = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25
\]
Since \( 20 < 25 < 40 \), \( x = 2 \) is valid.

Check \( x = 3 \):
\[
x^2 + 6x + 9 = 3^2 + 6 \cdot 3 + 9 = 9 + 18 + 9 = 36
\]
Since \( 20 < 36 < 40 \), \( x = 3 \) is valid.

Check boundary integers for completeness:
- \( x = 1 \):
\[
1^2 + 6 \cdot 1 + 9 = 1 + 6 + 9 = 16
\]
Since \( 16 < 20 \), \( x = 1 \) is not valid.
- \( x = 4 \):
\[
4^2 + 6 \cdot 4 + 9 = 16 + 24 + 9 = 49
\]
Since \( 49 > 40 \), \( x = 4 \) is not valid.

Thus, only \( x = 2, 3 \) satisfy the inequality.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find the number of positive integers \( x \) such that \( 20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression (completed: \( x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the inequality (completed: \( 1.472 < x < 3.325 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Identify positive integers in the range (completed: \( x = 2, 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solutions (completed: \( x = 2, 3 \) are valid).
  - Subgoal 5: Count the valid integers (pending).

**Current Goal**: Count the number of valid positive integers.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the number of valid positive integers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality. This can be achieved by counting the integers identified in the previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The valid positive integers are \( x = 2, 3 \). Counting them:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( x = 3 \)
There are 2 positive integers.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The number of positive integers \( x \) for which \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) is between 20 and 40 is **2**.
