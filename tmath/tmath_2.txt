Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Combine the constant terms in the polynomial.  
2. Combine the terms with the same variable and exponent.  
3. Identify the term with the highest degree.  
4. Determine the degree of the polynomial.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine the constant terms in the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The constant terms in the polynomial are $4$, $100$, and $9$.  

Adding them together:  
$$
4 + 100 + 9 = 113
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine the terms with the same variable and exponent.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The terms with the variable $x^4$ are $2\pi x^4$ and $\sqrt{10}x^4$.  

Combine them by adding their coefficients:  
$$
2\pi + \sqrt{10}
$$  

So, the combined $x^4$ term is $(2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4$.  

There is only one term with $x^3$, which is $5x^3$.  

Thus, the polynomial now becomes:  
$$
113 + 5x^3 + (2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the term with the highest degree.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The polynomial is now simplified to:  
$$
113 + 5x^3 + (2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4
$$  

The degrees of the terms are:  
- $113$: degree 0  
- $5x^3$: degree 3  
- $(2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4$: degree 4  

The highest degree is 4.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the degree of the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable in any term.  

From the simplified polynomial:  
$$
113 + 5x^3 + (2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4
$$  
The term with the highest degree is $(2\pi + \sqrt{10})x^4$, which has a degree of 4.  

Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 4.

1. **Combining constants**:  
   - Original constants: 4, 100, 9.  
   - Calculation: 4 + 100 + 9 = 113.  
   - Correct. No errors in arithmetic.  

2. **Combining x⁴ terms**:  
   - Terms: 2πx⁴ and √10x⁴.  
   - Coefficients added: 2π + √10.  
   - Valid operation since both terms share the same variable and exponent.  

3. **Term degrees**:  
   - 113 (degree 0): Correct.  
   - 5x³ (degree 3): Correct.  
   - (2π + √10)x⁴ (degree 4): Correct.  

4. **Final conclusion**:
