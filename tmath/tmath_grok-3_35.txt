### Problem Restatement
We need to find the ordered pair \((a, c)\) for the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + 20x + c = 0\), which has exactly one solution, given that \(a + c = 29\) and \(a < c\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
- Subgoal 2: Use the given condition \(a + c = 29\) to express one variable in terms of the other.  
- Subgoal 3: Apply the constraint \(a < c\) to filter possible solutions.  
- Subgoal 4: Solve for \(a\) and \(c\) to find the ordered pair \((a, c)\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + 20x + c = 0\) to have exactly one solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), exactly one solution occurs when the discriminant is zero (\(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0\)). Here, \(b = 20\), so compute the discriminant and set it to zero.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + 20x + c = 0\). For it to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4ac = 400 - 4ac = 0
\]  
\[
400 - 4ac = 0 \implies 4ac = 400 \implies ac = 100
\]  
Thus, the condition is \(ac = 100\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Use the condition \(a + c = 29\) to express one variable in terms of the other and combine it with \(ac = 100\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Express \(c = 29 - a\) using \(a + c = 29\), substitute into \(ac = 100\), and solve the resulting equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From \(a + c = 29\), we get \(c = 29 - a\). Substitute into \(ac = 100\):  
\[
a(29 - a) = 100
\]  
\[
29a - a^2 = 100
\]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[
-a^2 + 29a - 100 = 0
\]  
\[
a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0
\]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -29\), \(c = 100\):  
\[
\Delta = (-29)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 100 = 841 - 400 = 441
\]  
\[
\sqrt{441} = 21
\]  
\[
a = \frac{29 \pm 21}{2}
\]  
\[
a = \frac{29 + 21}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{29 - 21}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]  
For each \(a\), compute \(c = 29 - a\):  
- If \(a = 25\), then \(c = 29 - 25 = 4\).  
- If \(a = 4\), then \(c = 29 - 4 = 25\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Apply the constraint \(a < c\) to select the valid ordered pair \((a, c)\).  
- **How to Achieve**: Compare \(a\) and \(c\) for each pair \((a, c)\) and select the one where \(a < c\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have two pairs:  
- Pair 1: \((a, c) = (25, 4)\). Check: \(25 < 4\) is false.  
- Pair 2: \((a, c) = (4, 25)\). Check: \(4 < 25\) is true.  

Thus, the pair satisfying \(a < c\) is \((4, 25)\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \((a, c) = (4, 25)\) satisfies all conditions: \(ac = 100\), \(a + c = 29\), \(a < c\), and the quadratic has exactly one solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \(a = 4\), \(c = 25\) into the equations and compute the discriminant of the quadratic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check conditions for \((a, c) = (4, 4)\):  
- \(a + c = 4 + 25 = 29\), which satisfies \(a + c = 29\).  
- \(ac = 4 \cdot 25 = 100\), which satisfies \(ac = 100\).  
- \(a < c\): \(4 < 4\) is false, so discard this pair and try again with the correct pair \((a, c) = (4, 25))\):  
- \(a + c = 4 + 25 = 29\), which satisfies \(a + c = 29\).  
- \(ac = 4 \cdot 25 = 100\), which satisfies \(ac = 100\).  
- \(a < c\): \(4 < 25\), which is true.  
- Quadratic: \(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0\). Compute discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = 20^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 400 - 400 = 0
\]  
Since \(\Delta = 0\), the quadratic has exactly one solution.  

All conditions are satisfied for \((4, 25)\).
