**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution.  
2. Use the given condition \(a + c = 29\) to express one variable in terms of the other.  
3. Apply the constraint \(a < c\) to filter solutions.  
4. Solve for \(a\) and \(c\) to find the ordered pair \((a, c)\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the condition for the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + 20x + c = 0\) to have exactly one solution.  
How to Achieve: A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has exactly one solution when its discriminant is zero. For the given equation, identify coefficients and set the discriminant equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + 20x + c = 0\). The coefficients are:  
- Coefficient of \(x^2\): \(a\)  
- Coefficient of \(x\): \(b = 20\)  
- Constant term: \(c\)  

The discriminant of a quadratic \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). For exactly one solution, set the discriminant to zero:  
\[
\Delta = 20^2 - 4ac = 0
\]
\[
400 - 4ac = 0
\]
\[
4ac = 400
\]
\[
ac = 100
\]
Thus, the condition for exactly one solution is \(ac = 100\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use the condition \(a + c = 29\) to express one variable in terms of the other and combine with \(ac = 100\).  
How to Achieve: Express \(c\) as \(c = 29 - a\) using \(a + c = 29\). Substitute into \(ac = 100\) to form an equation in terms of \(a\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(a + c = 29\), express \(c\):  
\[
c = 29 - a
\]
Substitute into \(ac = 100\):  
\[
a(29 - a) = 100
\]
\[
29a - a^2 = 100
\]
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[
-a^2 + 29a - 100 = 0
\]
Multiply by \(-1\) for simplicity:  
\[
a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0
\]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \(a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0\) to find possible values of \(a\).  
How to Achieve: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or factoring, then compute corresponding \(c\) values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve \(a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0\). Try factoring:  
Find two numbers that multiply to \(100\) and add to \(-29\). Testing pairs:  
- \(-4\) and \(-25\): \((-4) \cdot (-25) = 100\), \(-4 + (-25) = -29\).  

Thus:  
\[
a^2 - 29a + 100 = (a - 4)(a - 25) = 0
\]
Solutions:  
\[
a = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 25
\]
For each \(a\), compute \(c = 29 - a\):  
- If \(a = 4\):  
\[
c = 29 - 4 = 25
\]
- If \(a = 25\):  
\[
c = 29 - 25 = 4
\]
Possible pairs \((a, c)\): \((4, 25)\) and \((25, 4)\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify which pair \((a, c)\) satisfies \(a < c\) and ensures the quadratic has exactly one solution.  
How to Achieve: Check the constraint \(a < c\) for both pairs and confirm the discriminant is zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \(a < c\):  
- For \((a, c) = (4, 25)\): \(4 < 25\), satisfies \(a < c\).  
- For \((a, c) = (25, 4)\): \(25 < 4\), does not satisfy \(a < c\).  

Verify the discriminant for \((4, 25)\):  
Equation: \(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0\).  
Discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = 20^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 25 = 400 - 400 = 0
\]
The discriminant is zero, confirming exactly one solution.  

Thus, the pair \((4, 25)\) is valid.
