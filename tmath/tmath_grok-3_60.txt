**Problem Statement**: Find positive integers \( x \) and \( y \), both less than 20, such that \( x + y + xy = 76 \), and determine the value of \( x + y \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( x \) and \( y \). The equation \( x + y + xy = 76 \) needs to be solved for positive integers \( x, y < 20 \). A logical first step is to rewrite the equation to make it easier to test possible values or derive a solution method. Then, systematically find pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy the equation and compute \( x + y \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x + y + xy = 76 \) to facilitate finding integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \). This can be achieved by transforming the equation into a form that allows us to express one variable in terms of the other or test possible values efficiently.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the equation:  
\[ x + y + xy = 76 \]  
Rearrange to isolate terms:  
\[ xy + x + y = 76 \]  
Add 1 to both sides to factorize:  
\[ xy + x + y + 1 = 77 \]  
This can be rewritten as:  
\[ (x + 1)(y + 1) = 77 \]  
Now, we need to find positive integers \( x, y < 20 \) such that \( (x + 1)(y + 1) = 77 \). Since 77 is a product of two integers, find the factor pairs of 77:  
\[ 77 = 1 \times 77, \ 7 \times 11, \ 11 \times 7, \ 77 \times 1 \]  
For each pair \( (a, b) \) where \( a = x + 1 \), \( b = y + 1 \), compute \( x = a - 1 \), \( y = b - 1 \), and check if \( x, y \) are positive integers less than 20.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find all factor pairs of 77 and compute corresponding \( x \) and \( y \) values to check which pairs satisfy the constraints \( 1 \leq x, y < 20 \). This involves testing each factor pair and verifying the solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test the factor pairs of 77:  
- Pair \( (1, 77) \):  
  \[ x + 1 = 1 \implies x = 0 \]  
  \[ y + 1 = 77 \implies y = 76 \]  
  Since \( x = 0 \) is not a positive integer and \( y = 76 \geq 20 \), discard this pair.  
- Pair \( (77, 1) \):  
  \[ x + 1 = 77 \implies x = 76 \]  
  \[ y + 1 = 1 \implies y = 0 \]  
  Since \( x = 76 \geq 20 \) and \( y = 0 \) is not positive, discard this pair.  
- Pair \( (7, 11) \):  
  \[ x + 1 = 7 \implies x = 6 \]  
  \[ y + 1 = 11 \implies y = 10 \]  
  Check: \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \), both positive and less than 20.  
  Verify: \( x + y + xy = 6 + 10 + 6 \cdot 10 = 16 + 60 = 76 \). This satisfies the equation.  
- Pair \( (11, 7) \):  
  \[ x + 1 = 11 \implies x = 10 \]  
  \[ y + 1 = 7 \implies y = 6 \]  
  Check: \( x = 10 \), \( y = 6 \), both positive and less than 20.  
  Verify: \( x + y + xy = 10 + 6 + 10 \cdot 6 = 16 + 60 = 76 \). This also satisfies the equation.  
The valid pairs are \( (x, y) = (6, 10) \) and \( (10, 6) \).  
Compute \( x + y \):  
\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]  
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]  
Both pairs yield \( x + y = 16 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( (x, y) = (6, 10) \) and \( (10, 6) \) are the only solutions by checking if other approaches (e.g., testing all possible \( x \)) yield additional solutions and confirming \( x + y = 16 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To ensure completeness, consider an alternative approach by expressing \( y \) in terms of \( x \):  
\[ x + y + xy = 76 \]  
\[ y + xy = 76 - x \]  
\[ y (x + 1) = 76 - x \]  
\[ y = \frac{76 - x}{x + 1} \]  
For \( y \) to be a positive integer, \( 76 - x \) must be divisible by \( x + 1 \). Test \( x = 1 \) to \( 19 \):  
- For \( x = 6 \):  
  \[ y = \frac{76 - 6}{6 + 1} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]  
  Integer, and \( (6, 10) \) was already found.  
- For \( x = 10 \):  
  \[ y = \frac{76 - 10}{10 + 1} = \frac{66}{11} = 6 \]  
  Integer, and \( (10, 6) \) was already found.  
- For other \( x \), compute \( \frac{76 - x}{x + 1} \):  
  - \( x = 1 \): \( \frac{75}{2} = 37.5 \), not an integer.  
  - \( x = 2 \): \( \frac{74}{3} \approx 24.67 \), not an integer.  
  - Continue similarly; for brevity, note that \( 76 - x \) must be divisible by \( x + 1 \). Testing shows no other integer solutions for \( 1 \leq x < 20 \).  
Since 77 has no other factor pairs yielding \( x, y < 20 \), and the alternative method confirms the same solutions, the pairs \( (6, 10) \) and \( (10, 6) \) are complete. Thus, \( x + y = 16 \).

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find positive integers \( x, y < 20 \) such that \( x + y + xy = 76 \), and compute \( x + y \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation to facilitate solving (completed: \( (x + 1)(y + 1) = 77 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find factor pairs of 77 and compute corresponding \( x, y \) (completed: found \( (6, 10) \), \( (10, 6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions to ensure completeness (completed: confirmed no other solutions).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( x + y \) (completed: \( x + y = 16 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the solution.  
The solution consistently yields \( x + y = 16 \) for both pairs, and validation confirms no other solutions exist.
