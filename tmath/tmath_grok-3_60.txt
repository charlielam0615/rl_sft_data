**Problem Restatement**: We need to find positive integers \( x \) and \( y \), both less than 20, such that \( x + y + xy = 76 \). Our goal is to determine the value of \( x + y \).

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
I will break down the problem into manageable steps by first understanding the equation and then identifying possible values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given condition. The plan is to rewrite the equation to make it easier to solve, set constraints based on the problem's conditions, and then test possible pairs of \( x \) and \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the given equation to simplify solving for \( x \) and \( y \).
Description: I will transform the equation \( x + y + xy = 76 \) into a more solvable form, possibly by factoring or rearranging terms, to facilitate finding integer solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let's rewrite the equation \( x + y + xy = 76 \). Notice that this can be factored by adding 1 to both sides:
\( x + y + xy + 1 = 77 \), which becomes \( (x+1)(y+1) = 77 \).
This transformation simplifies the problem to finding pairs of positive integers \( (x+1) \) and \( (y+1) \) whose product is 77. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers less than 20, \( x+1 \) and \( y+1 \) must be between 2 and 20 inclusive.

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify factor pairs of 77 within the constraints.
Description: I will list the factor pairs of 77 and check which pairs fall within the range of 2 to 20 for both factors, then convert back to \( x \) and \( y \).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Now, let's find the factor pairs of 77:
- \( 1 \times 77 \)
- \( 7 \times 11 \)

Since \( x+1 \) and \( y+1 \) must be between 2 and 20, we discard the pair \( 1 \times 77 \) because 1 is less than 2 and 77 is greater than 20. The only valid pair is \( 7 \times 11 \).

So, possible assignments are:
- \( x+1 = 7 \) and \( y+1 = 11 \), which means \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 10 \)
- \( x+1 = 11 \) and \( y+1 = 7 \), which means \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 6 \)

Both pairs are within the constraint that \( x \) and \( y \) are less than 20.

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by plugging values back into the original equation.
Description: I will substitute the values of \( x \) and \( y \) from the identified pairs into the original equation to confirm they satisfy \( x + y + xy = 76 \).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let's check both pairs:
- For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \): \( 6 + 10 + 6 \times 10 = 16 + 60 = 76 \), which matches.
- For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 6 \): \( 10 + 6 + 10 \times 6 = 16 + 60 = 76 \), which also matches.

Both pairs are correct, and in both cases, \( x + y = 6 + 10 = 16 \).

Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Find positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) less than 20 such that \( x + y + xy = 76 \), and determine \( x + y \).
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation for easier solving.
  - Subgoal 2: Identify valid factor pairs of the rewritten equation.
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions by substituting back into the original equation.

Current Goal: Conclude the solution as the value of \( x + y \) has been determined consistently across valid pairs.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: State the final answer for \( x + y \).
Description: I will provide the value of \( x + y \) based on the validated solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since both valid pairs give the same sum, the value of \( x + y \) is 16.
Therefore, the final answer is 16.
