**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of sides of a regular polygon that has exactly nine diagonals.

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R), following the specified format and guidelines. The formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \). We need to find \( n \) such that the number of diagonals equals 9.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recall the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon.  
2. Set up an equation using the formula to equal 9 diagonals.  
3. Solve the equation to find the number of sides \( n \).  
4. Verify that the solution corresponds to a regular polygon.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to recall and apply the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon. The formula is \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of sides. We will set this equal to 9 and solve for \( n \).

[IMP]  
The number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \). Given that the polygon has 9 diagonals, we set up the equation:  
\[ \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 9 \]  
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ n(n-3) = 18 \]  
Rewrite as a quadratic equation:  
\[ n^2 - 3n - 18 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -18 \):  
\[ n = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-18)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 72}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm 9}{2} \]  
\[ n = \frac{3 + 9}{2} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{3 - 9}{2} = -3 \]  
Since \( n \) must be a positive integer (as it represents the number of sides), discard \( n = -3 \). Thus, \( n = 6 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that a polygon with 6 sides (a hexagon) has exactly 9 diagonals and confirm it is a valid solution for a regular polygon.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a polygon with \( n = 6 \) sides, calculate the number of diagonals:  
\[ \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = \frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 3}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]  
This matches the given number of diagonals (9). A regular polygon with 6 sides is a hexagon, which is a valid regular polygon.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of sides of a regular polygon with 9 diagonals.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the formula for the number of diagonals (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation for 9 diagonals (completed, found \( n = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, confirmed 6 sides yields 9 diagonals).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  
The solution is consistent, and no further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The regular polygon with 9 diagonals has 6 sides (it is a hexagon).
