**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of sides of a regular polygon that has exactly nine diagonals.

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories, following the specified format and requirements.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recall the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon.  
2. Set up an equation using the given number of diagonals (9).  
3. Solve the equation to find the number of sides.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it corresponds to a valid regular polygon.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon, which is essential for setting up the equation to find the number of sides.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \). This formula accounts for the number of ways to connect any two vertices, excluding sides and self-connections, divided by 2 to avoid counting each diagonal twice.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Use the diagonal formula \( \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 9 \) to set up an equation and solve for \( n \), the number of sides.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the number of diagonals is 9, set up the equation:  
\[ \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 9 \]  
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ n(n-3) = 18 \]  
Rearrange into a quadratic equation:  
\[ n^2 - 3n - 18 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -18 \):  
\[ n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-18)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 72}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm 9}{2} \]  
\[ n = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \]  
Since \( n \) (number of sides) must be a positive integer, discard \( n = -3 \). Thus, \( n = 6 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Verify that a polygon with 6 sides (hexagon) has exactly 9 diagonals using the formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( n = 6 \):  
\[ \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot (6-3)}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 3}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]  
The number of diagonals matches the given value of 9, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the number of sides of a regular polygon with 9 diagonals.  
  - Subgoal 1: Recall the formula for diagonals (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation for \( n \) (completed, \( n = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, 6 sides yield 9 diagonals).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The regular polygon with 9 diagonals has **6 sides** (it is a hexagon).
