### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that when four 12-sided dice are rolled, the number of dice showing a two-digit number (10, 11, or 12) equals the number of dice showing a one-digit number (1 through 9). Each die has 12 sides, numbered 1 to 12 in decimal. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Determine the possible outcomes for each die (one-digit vs. two-digit numbers).
2. Identify the scenarios where the number of dice showing two-digit numbers equals the number of dice showing one-digit numbers.
3. Calculate the probability for each valid scenario.
4. Sum the probabilities and express the result as a common fraction.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to classify the outcomes of each die as either a one-digit number or a two-digit number and determine their probabilities.  
**How to achieve**: Each die has 12 sides (numbers 1 to 12). Identify which numbers are one-digit (1–9) and which are two-digit (10–12), then compute the probability of each outcome for a single die.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each die has 12 possible outcomes (numbers 1 to 12).  
- **One-digit numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 outcomes).  
- **Two-digit numbers**: 10, 11, 12 (3 outcomes).  

Probability of a one-digit number per die: \( \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \).  
Probability of a two-digit number per die: \( \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals to focus on the condition where the number of dice showing two-digit numbers equals the number of dice showing one-digit numbers:  
1. Identify valid configurations for four dice where the count of two-digit numbers equals the count of one-digit numbers (e.g., 2 one-digit and 2 two-digit).  
2. Calculate the number of ways to achieve each valid configuration.  
3. Compute the total probability using the binomial distribution and the probabilities from Step 2.  
4. Simplify the result into a common fraction.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify valid configurations where the number of dice showing two-digit numbers equals the number of dice showing one-digit numbers and compute the number of ways to achieve them.  
**How to achieve**: Since there are four dice, the number of two-digit outcomes (T) must equal the number of one-digit outcomes (O). Possible configurations are (T, O) = (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2). Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways for each configuration.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For four dice, let \( T \) be the number of dice showing two-digit numbers (10, 11, or 12), and \( O \) be the number of dice showing one-digit numbers (1–9). Since \( T + O = 4 \), we need \( T = O \). The possible configurations are:
- \( T = 0, O = 0 \): Not possible (sum must be 4).
- \( T = 1, O = 1 \): Not possible (1 + 1 = 2, not 4).
- \( T = 2, O = 2 \): Possible (2 + 2 = 4).
- \( T = 3, O = 3 \): Not possible (3 + 3 = 6, exceeds 4).
- \( T = 4, O = 4 \): Not possible.

The only valid configuration is \( T = 2, O = 2 \).

**Calculate the number of ways for \( T = 2, O = 2 \)**:  
- Choose 2 dice out of 4 to show two-digit numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \).  
- For each of the 2 dice showing two-digit numbers, there are 3 choices (10, 11, or 12): \( 3^2 = 9 \).  
- For each of the 2 dice showing one-digit numbers, there are 9 choices (1–9): \( 9^2 = 81 \).  

Number of favorable outcomes: \( \binom{4}{2} \times 3^2 \times 9^2 = 6 \times 9 \times 81 \).

Compute:  
\( 6 \times 81 = 486 \).  
\( 486 \times 9 = 4374 \).

**Total outcomes**: Each die has 12 possible outcomes, so for 4 dice: \( 12^4 = (12^2)^2 = 144^2 = 20736 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations for the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes, and compute the probability.  
**How to achieve**: Recalculate the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes, then compute the probability as a fraction and simplify it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verify favorable outcomes**:  
- \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \).  
- Two-digit numbers: \( 3^2 = 9 \).  
- One-digit numbers: \( 9^2 = 81 \).  
- Total favorable outcomes: \( 6 \times 9 \times 81 = 486 \times 9 = 4374 \).

**Verify total outcomes**:  
\( 12^4 = 12 \times 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 144 \times 144 = 20736 \).

**Probability**:  
\( \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{4374}{20736} \).

**Simplify the fraction**:  
Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4374 and 20736.  
- \( 4374 \div 6 = 729 \), \( 20736 \div 6 = 3456 \).  
- \( 729 = 3^6 \), \( 3456 = 2^7 \times 3^3 \).  
- GCD = \( 3^3 = 27 \).  

\( \frac{4374 \div 27}{20736 \div 27} = \frac{162}{768} \).  
- \( 162 \div 6 = 27 \), \( 768 \div 6 = 128 \).  
- \( 27 = 3^3 \), \( 128 = 2^7 \), GCD = 1.  

Thus, \( \frac{162}{768} = \frac{27}{128} \) is in simplest form.

**Final verification**:  
- Favorable outcomes: \( \binom{4}{2} \times 3^2 \times 9^2 = 6 \times 9 \times 81 = 4374 \).  
- Total outcomes: \( 12^4 = 20736 \).  
- Fraction: \( \frac{4374}{20736} \div 27 = \frac{162}{768} \div 6 = \frac{27}{128} \), which is in simplest form (GCD of 27 and 128 is 1).

**Final Answer**: \( \frac{27}{128} \).
