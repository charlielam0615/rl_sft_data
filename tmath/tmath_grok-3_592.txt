### Problem Restatement
We need to find the probability that, when rolling four 12-sided dice, the number of dice showing a two-digit number (10, 11, or 12) equals the number of dice showing a one-digit number (1 through 9). Each die has 12 sides, numbered 1 to 12 in decimal, and the answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

1. Identify which numbers on a 12-sided die are one-digit and two-digit.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Identify which numbers on a 12-sided die are one-digit and two-digit.
How to Achieve: Analyze the numbers 1 to 12 on each die and classify them based on their decimal representation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each die has sides numbered 1 to 12. In decimal:
- One-digit numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 outcomes).
- Two-digit numbers: 10, 11, 12 (3 outcomes).
Thus, for each die, there are 9 ways to show a one-digit number and 3 ways to show a two-digit number.

Refine Subgoal 2 by breaking it down:
1. Identify scenarios where the number of two-digit dice equals the number of one-digit dice (e.g., 0 of each, 1 of each, 2 of each).

3. Sum the probabilities of these scenarios.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Identify scenarios where the number of two-digit dice equals the number of one-digit dice.
How to Achieve: Consider the four dice and determine configurations where the count of two-digit outcomes matches the count of one-digit outcomes, accounting for remaining dice.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( k \) be the number of dice showing two-digit numbers (10, 11, or 12). We need the number of dice showing one-digit numbers (1 to 9) to also be \( k \). The remaining \( 4 - 2k \) dice must show neither (which is impossible unless \( k = 0 \), but we’ll explore all cases).

Possible values for \( k \):
- \( k = 0 \): 0 two-digit, 0 one-digit, 4 dice show something else (impossible, as 1–12 are all one- or two-digit).
- \( k = 1 \): 1 two-digit, 1 one-digit, 2 dice remain.
- \( k = 2 \): 2 two-digit, 2 one-digit, 0 dice remain.

Since each die shows either a one-digit or two-digit number:
- Total dice = (two-digit) + (one-digit).
- We need \( k + k = 2k \leq 4 \), so \( k \leq 2 \).

Thus, viable cases are:
- \( k = 1 \): 1 two-digit, 1 one-digit, 2 dice remain.
- \( k = 2 \): 2 two-digit, 2 one-digit, 0 dice remain.

For \( k = 1 \), the remaining 2 dice must be either one-digit or two-digit, but their counts don’t affect the equality condition. For \( k = 2 \), all dice are assigned.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Check the validity of identified scenarios.
How to Achieve: Ensure the scenarios account for all dice and satisfy the condition that the number of two-digit dice equals the number of one-digit dice.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-evaluate scenarios:
- \( k = 0 \): Requires 0 two-digit and 0 one-digit, but all dice must show 1–12, so this is invalid.
- \( k = 1 \): 1 die shows two-digit, 1 die shows one-digit, 2 dice remain (can be any of 1–12).
- \( k = 2 \): 2 dice show two-digit, 2 dice show one-digit, no dice remain.

Since each die’s outcome is either one-digit (9 ways) or two-digit (3 ways), the total outcomes per die = 12. The \( k = 1 \) case needs clarification: the remaining 2 dice contribute to total outcomes but not to the equality condition. Let’s proceed with \( k = 2 \), as it fully assigns dice, and revisit \( k = 1 \).

For \( k = 2 \):
- Choose 2 dice out of 4 to show two-digit numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \).
- Each of these 2 dice has 3 choices (10, 11, 12): \( 3^2 = 9 \).
- The other 2 dice show one-digit numbers, each with 9 choices: \( 9^2 = 81 \).
- Total ways: \( \binom{4}{2} \cdot 3^2 \cdot 9^2 = 6 \cdot 9 \cdot 81 \).

Total possible outcomes for 4 dice: \( 12^4 \).

Probability for \( k = 2 \): \( \frac{6 \cdot 9 \cdot 81}{12^4} \).

For \( k = 1 \), reconsider: 1 two-digit, 1 one-digit, 2 dice remain with any value (12 choices each). This may not satisfy unless we redefine the condition. Since \( k = 2 \) seems to fit perfectly, validate by computing.

Compute:
- \( 6 \cdot 9 \cdot 81 = 6 \cdot 729 = 4374 \).
- \( 12^4 = (12^2)^2 = 144^2 = 20736 \).
- Probability: \( \frac{4374}{20736} \).
- Simplify: \( \gcd(4374, 20736) \). Divide by 6: \( 4374 \div 6 = 729 \), \( 20736 \div 6 = 3456 \). Check \( \gcd(729, 3456) \). Since \( 729 = 3^6 \), and \( 3456 \div 3 = 1152 \), \( 1152 \div 3 = 384 \), \( 384 \div 3 = 128 \), \( 128 = 2^7 \), so \( \gcd = 3 \). Thus, \( \frac{729 \div 3}{3456 \div 3} = \frac{243}{1152} \). Further, \( 243 = 3^5 \), \( 1152 \div 3 = 384 \), \( 384 \div 3 = 128 \), so divide by 3: \( \frac{81}{384} \). Then, \( 384 \div 81 \approx 4.74 \), but \( \gcd(81, 384) = 3 \), so \( \frac{81 \div 3}{384 \div 3} = \frac{27}{128} \). Check: \( 27 = 3^3 \), \( 128 = 2^7 \), so \( \frac{27}{128} \) is simplified.

Probability for \( k = 2 \): \( \frac{27}{128} \).

Reconsider \( k = 1 \): Choose 1 die for two-digit: \( \binom{4}{1} = 4 \), with 3 choices. Choose 1 die for one-digit: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \), with 9 choices. Remaining 2 dice: \( 12^2 = 144 \). Total: \( 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 \cdot 144 \). But this overcomplicates, as remaining dice may disrupt equality unless we sum probabilities correctly. Since \( k = 2 \) covers the clear case, proceed with it.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the number of dice showing two-digit numbers equals the number of dice showing one-digit numbers.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify one-digit and two-digit numbers (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine possible outcomes (focused on \( k = 2 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the probability (computed as \( \frac{27}{128} \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Express as a common fraction.

Current Goal: Finalize the probability calculation and express as a common fraction.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Calculate the final probability and confirm it as a common fraction.
How to Achieve: Use the computed result for \( k = 2 \), verify calculations, and express the probability as a simplified common fraction. Recompute and cross-check the k=1 case.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( k = 2 \):
- Ways: \( \binom{4}{2} \cdot 3^2 \cdot 9^2 = 6 \cdot 9 \cdot 81 = 4374 \).
- Total outcomes: \( 12^4 = 20736 \).
- Probability: \( \frac{4374}{20736} = \frac{27}{128} \) (as simplified above).

For k=1:
- Choose 1 die for two-digit: \( \binom{4}{1} = 4 \)), 3 choices
- Choose 1 die for one-digit: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)), 9 choices
- Choose 2 dice for remaining: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)), each has 12 choices: \( 12^2 = 144 \).
- Total ways: \( \binom{4}{1} \cdot 3 \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot 9 \cdot 12^2 = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 \cdot 144 \).
- Compute: 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \), \( 3 \cdot 9 = 27 \), \( 12^2 = 144 \), so \( 12 \cdot 27 \cdot 144 = 324 \cdot 144 = 1296 \cdot 36 = 46656 \).
- Total outcomes: \( 12^4 = 20736 \).
- Probability: \( \frac{46656}{20736} \).

Simplify: \( \frac{46656}{20736} \approx 2.25 \), which is incorrect as probability must be between 0 and 1. Recompute:
- Correct approach: For k=1, the probability calculation was incorrect due to overcounting. Instead, reconsider the condition. The k=1 case requires exactly one two-digit and one one-digit, but the remaining two dice can be either, which may not maintain equality unless we sum specific configurations. This suggests k=1 may not contribute valid cases under strict equality of counts.

Since \( k = 2 \) is the only case where the number of two-digit and one-digit dice are equal and all dice are assigned:
- Final probability: \( \frac{27}{128} \).

Express as a common fraction: \( \frac{27}{128} \).

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Validate the final probability and ensure the k=1 case is correctly excluded.
How to Achieve: Recheck calculations for \( k = 2 \), confirm simplification, and verify that other \( k \) values are invalid or correctly handled.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck \( k = 2 \):
- \( \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6 \).
- Two-digit choices: \( 3^2 = 9 \).
- One-digit choices: \( 9^2 = 81 \).
- Total: \( 6 \cdot 9 \cdot 81 = 6 \cdot 729 = 4374 \).
- Mistake detected: \( 6 \cdot 729 = 6 \cdot (700 + 20 + 9) = 4200 + 120 + 54 = 4374 \).
- Total outcomes: \( 12^4 = 12^2 \cdot 12^2 = 144 \cdot 144 = 20736 \).
- Probability: \( \frac{4374}{20736} \).
- Simplify: \( 4374 \div 6 = 729 \), \( 20736 \div 6 = 3456 \). Then \( \frac{729}{3456} \). Since \( 729 = 3^6 \), \( 3456 \div 3 = 1152 \), \( 1152 \div 3 = 384 \), \( 384 \div 3 = 128 \), so \( \gcd(729, 3456) = 3 \). Thus, \( \frac{729 \div 3}{3456 \div 3} = \frac{243}{1152} \). Further, \( \gcd(243, 1152) = 3 \), so \( \frac{243 \div 3}{1152 \div 3} = \frac{81}{384} \). Then, \( \gcd(81, 384) = 3 \), so \( \frac{81 \div 3}{384 \div 3} = \frac{27}{128} \). Since \( 27 = 3^3 \), \( 128 = 2^7 \), the fraction is in simplest form.

Verify other cases:
- \( k = 0 \): Invalid, as all dice must be one- or two-digit.
- \( k = 1 \): Requires 1 two-digit, 1 one-digit, 2 remaining. The remaining dice don’t enforce equality unless they balance out, which requires redefining the condition. Test: If remaining 2 dice are both one-digit, total one-digit = 3, two-digit = 1 (not equal). If both two-digit, one-digit = 1, two-digit = 3 (not equal). No configuration satisfies equality.
- \( k > 2 \): Impossible, as \( 2k \leq 4 \).

Thus, only \( k = 2 \) is valid. Final probability: \( \frac{27}{128} \).
