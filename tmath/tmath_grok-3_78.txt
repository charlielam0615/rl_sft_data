### Problem Restatement
We need to find the largest value of \( c \) such that \( -2 \) is in the range of the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \). This means there exists some \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \), i.e., \( x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \). Additionally, we want the largest possible \( c \) that satisfies this condition.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals to solve the problem systematically.  
- Subgoal 1: Rewrite the condition \( f(x) = -2 \) as a quadratic equation.  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for this quadratic equation to have at least one real solution.  
- Subgoal 3: Maximize \( c \) while ensuring the condition holds.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Rewrite the condition \( f(x) = -2 \) as a quadratic equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Set \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \), then rearrange all terms to form a standard quadratic equation in \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given function:  
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \]  
We need \( f(x) = -2 \):  
\[ x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \]  
Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + c + 2 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \]  
This is the quadratic equation we need to solve for \( x \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the condition for the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \) to have at least one real solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the discriminant of the quadratic equation. For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + k = 0 \), the discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \) must be non-negative (\( \Delta \geq 0 \)) for real solutions to exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \):  
- Identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), \( k = c + 2 \).  
- Compute the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ak = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (c + 2) = 9 - 4(c + 2) \]  
\[ \Delta = 9 - 4c - 8 = 1 - 4c \]  
- For the equation to have at least one real solution, require:  
\[ 1 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
Solve the inequality:  
\[ 1 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
\[ -4c \geq -1 \]  
\[ c \leq \frac{1}{4} \]  
Thus, the quadratic has real solutions when \( c \leq \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find the largest value of \( c \) that satisfies \( c \leq \frac{1}{4} \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Since we need the largest \( c \), take the boundary value where the discriminant is zero (\( \Delta = 0 \)), as this gives the maximum \( c \), and verify it satisfies the condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ c \leq \frac{1}{4} \]  
The largest possible value of \( c \) is \( c = \frac{1}{4} \).  
Verify with \( c = \frac{1}{4} \):  
- Quadratic becomes:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + \left( \frac{1}{4} + 2 \right) = x^2 + 3x + \frac{9}{4} = 0 \]  
- Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{9}{4} = 9 - 9 = 0 \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), there is exactly one real solution.  
Solve the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + \frac{9}{4} = 0 \]  
Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \):  
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3}{2} = -\frac{3}{2} \]  
Check if \( f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -2 \):  
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 3x + \frac{1}{4} \]  
\[ f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 3 \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{4} \]  
\[ = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{18}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9 - 18 + 1}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2 \]  
Since \( f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -2 \), \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) satisfies the condition.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Validate that \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) is the largest possible value by checking if a larger \( c \) fails.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test a value of \( c > \frac{1}{4} \) to confirm the discriminant becomes negative, indicating no real solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test \( c = \frac{1}{2} > \frac{1}{4} \):  
- Quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + \left( \frac{1}{2} + 2 \right) = x^2 + 3x + \frac{5}{2} = 0 \]  
- Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = 9 - 10 = -1 \]  
Since \( \Delta = -1 < 0 \), there are no real solutions, so \( f(x) \neq -2 \) for any \( x \).  
This confirms that values of \( c > \frac{1}{4} \) do not work.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the largest \( c \) such that \( -2 \) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite \( f(x) = -2 \) as a quadratic equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the condition for the quadratic to have real solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Maximize \( c \) while ensuring the condition holds (completed).

The largest \( c \) is \( c = \frac{1}{4} \), as validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The largest value of \( c \) such that \( -2 \) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \) is \( c = \frac{1}{4} \).

\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}} \]
