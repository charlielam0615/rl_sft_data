**Problem Statement**: Find the largest value of \( c \) such that \(-2\) is in the range of the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \). This means we need to find the largest \( c \) for which there exists some \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Understand what it means for \(-2\) to be in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \).  
2. Set up the equation \( f(x) = -2 \) and solve for \( x \).  
3. Determine the condition on \( c \) for the equation to have real solutions.  
4. Find the largest possible value of \( c \) that satisfies this condition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation \( f(x) = -2 \) and solve for \( x \). This involves forming the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \) and finding the values of \( x \) that satisfy it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set up the equation:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \]  
Rewrite it as:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + c + 2 = 0 \]  
This is a quadratic equation in \( x \):  
\[ x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \]  
For \( x \) to have real solutions, the discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative. The quadratic is in the form \( ax^2 + bx + k = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( k = c + 2 \). The discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ak = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (c + 2) = 9 - 4(c + 2) = 9 - 4c - 8 = 1 - 4c \]  
For real solutions, require:  
\[ 1 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
\[ 1 \geq 4c \]  
\[ c \leq \frac{1}{4} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the condition \( c \leq \frac{1}{4} \) by checking if it ensures \(-2\) is in the range of \( f(x) \). This involves testing boundary cases and confirming the quadratic’s behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, test the boundary case \( c = \frac{1}{4} \):  
Substitute \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) into the quadratic equation:  
\[ x^2 + 3x + \frac{1}{4} + 2 = x^2 + 3x + \frac{9}{4} = 0 \]  
Multiply through by 4 to clear the fraction:  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0 \]  
This is a perfect square:  
\[ (2x + 3)^2 = 0 \]  
\[ 2x + 3 = 0 \]  
\[ x = -\frac{3}{2} \]  
Check if \( f(x) = -2 \) at \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \):  
\[ f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{18}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9 - 18 + 1}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2 \]  
This confirms that when \( c = \frac{1}{4} \), \( f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -2 \), so \(-2\) is in the range.  
Now test a value just above \( c = \frac{1}{4} \), say \( c = \frac{1}{2} \):  
Discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 1 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1 - 2 = -1 \]  
Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions, so \(-2\) is not in the range for \( c = \frac{1}{2} \).  
This suggests \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) may be the largest possible value.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the largest \( c \) such that \(-2\) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation \( x^2 + 3x + c = -2 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Ensure the quadratic \( x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \) has real solutions by setting the discriminant \( 1 - 4c \geq 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the boundary condition \( c = \frac{1}{4} \).  
  - **Current goal**: Confirm that \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) is the largest possible value by analyzing the function’s behavior.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that \( c = \frac{1}{4} \) is the largest possible value by analyzing the function’s range, particularly the minimum value of \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \) is a parabola opening upward, the range is \([y_{\text{min}}, \infty)\), where \( y_{\text{min}} \) is the vertex’s \( y \)-coordinate. The vertex of \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \):  
\[ x = -\frac{3}{2} \]  
Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the vertex:  
\[ f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + c = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + c = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{18}{4} + c = -\frac{9}{4} + c \]  
For \(-2\) to be in the range, the minimum value must be at most \(-2\):  
\[ -\frac{9}{4} + c \leq -2 \]  
\[ c \leq -2 + \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{8}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]  
The largest \( c \) occurs when equality holds:  
\[ c = \frac{1}{4} \]  
If \( c > \frac{1}{4} \), the minimum value exceeds \(-2\), making \(-2\) unattainable. For example, if \( c = \frac{1}{2} \):  
\[ f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) = -\frac{9}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{9}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = -\frac{7}{4} > -2 \]  
Thus, \(-2\) is not in the range for \( c > \frac{1}{4} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to summarize all findings related to the condition on \( c \) to ensure \(-2\) is in the range and confirm the largest \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
- From Step 2: The equation \( x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0 \) requires a non-negative discriminant: \( 1 - 4c \geq 0 \), leading to \( c \leq \frac{1}{4} \).  
- From Step 3: At \( c = \frac{1}{4} \), the quadratic has a real solution at \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \), where \( f(x) = -2 \). For \( c > \frac{1}{4} \), the discriminant is negative, so no real solutions exist.  
- From Step 5: The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( -\frac{9}{4} + c \), which must be \(\leq -2\), confirming \( c \leq \frac{1}{4} \).  
**Conclusion**: The largest \( c \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), as it allows the minimum value to equal \(-2\), and any larger \( c \) shifts the range above \(-2\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The largest value of \( c \) such that \(-2\) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c \) is \( c = \frac{1}{4} \).
