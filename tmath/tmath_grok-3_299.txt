**Problem Statement**: Compute the sum of the geometric series \(-1 + 2 - 4 + 8 - \cdots + 512\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the pattern and confirm the series is geometric.
2. Determine the first term, common ratio, and number of terms.
3. Apply the geometric series sum formula.
4. Compute the final sum.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the pattern and confirm the series is geometric.
How to Achieve: Examine the sequence of terms to identify the first term and common ratio, confirming if each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The series is \(-1 + 2 - 4 + 8 - \cdots + 512\). Observe the terms:
- First term: \(-1\).
- Second term: \(2 = -1 \cdot (-2)\).
- Third term: \(-4 = 2 \cdot (-2)\).
- Fourth term: \(8 = -4 \cdot (-2)\).
- Fifth term: \(-16 = 8 \cdot (-2)\).

Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \(-2\). Thus, the series is geometric with first term \(a = -1\) and common ratio \(r = -2\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the first term, common ratio, and number of terms.
How to Achieve: Use the first term and common ratio from the previous step, and find the number of terms by expressing the last term (512) in terms of the first term and common ratio.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, the first term is \(a = -1\) and the common ratio is \(r = -2\). The series is:
\[
-1, 2, -4, 8, -16, 32, -64, 128, -256, 512
\]
The \(n\)-th term of a geometric series is given by \(a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}\). Set the last term equal to 512:
\[
-1 \cdot (-2)^{n-1} = 512
\]
\[
(-2)^{n-1} = -512
\]
Since \((-2)^{n-1}\) is negative for odd \(n-1\), and \(512 = 2^9\), we have:
\[
(-2)^{n-1} = -2^9
\]
Thus:
\[
2^{n-1} = 2^9 \quad \text{and the sign is negative.}
\]
So, \(n-1 = 9\), implying \(n = 10\). The series has 10 terms.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the number of terms and series parameters.
How to Achieve: Verify the \(n\)-th term calculation and ensure the sequence matches the given terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The \(n\)-th term is \(a_n = -1 \cdot (-2)^{n-1}\). For \(n = 10\):
\[
a_{10} = -1 \cdot (-2)^{10-1} = -1 \cdot (-2)^9 = -1 \cdot (-512) = 512
\]
This matches the last term. Listing terms:
- \(n=1\): \(-1 \cdot (-2)^0 = -1\)
- \(n=2\): \(-1 \cdot (-2)^1 = 2\)
- \(n=3\): \(-1 \cdot (-2)^2 = -4\)
- ...
- \(n=9\): \(-1 \cdot (-2)^8 = -256\)
- \(n=10\): \(-1 \cdot (-2)^9 = 512\)

The sequence \(-1, 2, -4, 8, -16, 32, -64, 128, -256, 512\) matches the problem. Parameters are correct: \(a = -1\), \(r = -2\), \(n = 10\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the geometric series sum formula.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with the identified parameters.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of a geometric series is:
\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad \text{for } r \neq 1
\]
With \(a = -1\), \(r = -2\), \(n = 10\):
\[
S_{10} = -1 \cdot \frac{1 - (-2)^{10}}{1 - (-2)}
\]
Compute:
- \((-2)^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024\).
- Numerator: \(1 - 1024 = -1023\).
- Denominator: \(1 - (-2) = 3\).
\[
S_{10} = -1 \cdot \frac{-1023}{3} = \frac{1023}{3} = 341
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the computed sum.
How to Achieve: Calculate the sum manually by adding terms and compare with the formula result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the terms:
\[
-1 + 2 - 4 + 8 - 16 + 32 - 64 + 128 - 256 + 512
\]
Step-by-step:
- \(-1 + 2 = 1\)
- \(1 - 4 = -3\)
- \(-3 + 8 = 5\)
- \(5 - 16 = -11\)
- \(-11 + 32 = 21\)
- \(21 - 64 = -43\)
- \(-43 + 128 = 85\)
- \(85 - 256 = -171\)
- \(-171 + 512 = 341\)

The manual sum is 341, matching the formula result.
[/IMP]
