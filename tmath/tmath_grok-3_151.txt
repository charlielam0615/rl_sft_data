**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( k \) in the quadratic equation \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \) such that the equation has solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( k \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given roots to form the quadratic equation in factored form.  
2. Expand the factored form to match the given equation \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \).  
3. Compare coefficients to determine \( k \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use the given roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \) to form the quadratic equation.  
How to Achieve: If a quadratic equation has roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), it can be written as \( a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0 \). Here, \( r_1 = 3 \), \( r_2 = -\frac{4}{3} \), and \( a = k \). Construct the factored form and expand it.

[IMP]  
The quadratic equation with roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \) is:  
\[ k(x - 3)\left(x + \frac{4}{3}\right) = 0 \]  
To simplify, rewrite the second factor:  
\[ x + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3x + 4}{3} \]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[ k \cdot (x - 3) \cdot \frac{3x + 4}{3} = 0 \]  
Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:  
\[ k (x - 3)(3x + 4) = 0 \]  
Expand the expression \( (x - 3)(3x + 4) \):  
\[ (x - 3)(3x + 4) = x \cdot 3x + x \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 3x - 3 \cdot 4 = 3x^2 + 4x - 9x - 12 = 3x^2 - 5x - 12 \]  
Thus, the equation is:  
\[ k (3x^2 - 5x - 12) = 0 \]  
This must match \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compare the expanded equation to the given equation to find \( k \).  
How to Achieve: Equate the coefficients of the expanded form \( k (3x^2 - 5x - 12) \) to the given equation \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From Step 2, we have:  
\[ k (3x^2 - 5x - 12) = k \cdot 3x^2 - k \cdot 5x - k \cdot 12 \]  
The given equation is:  
\[ kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \]  
Equate the two:  
\[ k \cdot 3x^2 - k \cdot 5x - k \cdot 12 = kx^2 - 5x - 12 \]  
Compare coefficients:  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3k = k \). This suggests a need to adjust our approach, as this implies \( k = 0 \) (which would make the equation linear) or a scaling factor.  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( -k \cdot 5 = -5 \), so \( 5k = 5 \), thus \( k = 1 \).  
- Constant term: \( -k \cdot 12 = -12 \), so \( 12k = 12 \), thus \( k = 1 \).  
Since the \( x^2 \) coefficient comparison \( 3k = k \) is inconsistent unless \( k = 0 \), let’s try matching the entire polynomial by setting \( k = 1 \) in the expanded form and verify:  
\[ 1 \cdot (3x^2 - 5x - 12) = 3x^2 - 5x - 12 \]  
This does not match \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 \) unless we adjust \( k \). Instead, equate directly:  
\[ k (3x^2 - 5x - 12) = kx^2 - 5x - 12 \]  
Divide through by \( k \):  
\[ 3x^2 - 5x - 12 = \frac{k}{k}x^2 - \frac{5}{k}x - \frac{12}{k} \]  
This suggests a scaling issue. Let’s try substituting the roots directly into the original equation to find \( k \).  
For \( x = 3 \):  
\[ k(3)^2 - 5(3) - 12 = 9k - 15 - 12 = 9k - 27 = 0 \]  
\[ 9k = 27 \]  
\[ k = 3 \]  
For \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \):  
\[ k\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 - 5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) - 12 = k \cdot \frac{16}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - 12 = \frac{16k}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - \frac{36}{3} = \frac{16k}{9} - \frac{16}{3} = 0 \]  
\[ \frac{16k}{9} = \frac{16}{3} \]  
\[ k = \frac{16}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{16} = 3 \]  
Both roots give \( k = 3 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( k = 3 \) satisfies the equation for both roots.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( k = 3 \) into \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \) and check if \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \) are solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
With \( k = 3 \), the equation is:  
\[ 3x^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \]  
Check \( x = 3 \):  
\[ 3(3)^2 - 5(3) - 12 = 3 \cdot 9 - 15 - 12 = 27 - 15 - 12 = 0 \]  
Check \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \):  
\[ 3\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 - 5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) - 12 = 3 \cdot \frac{16}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - 12 = \frac{48}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - \frac{36}{3} = \frac{16}{3} + \frac{20}{3} - \frac{36}{3} = \frac{16 + 20 - 36}{3} = 0 \]  
Both roots satisfy the equation, confirming \( k = 3 \).
