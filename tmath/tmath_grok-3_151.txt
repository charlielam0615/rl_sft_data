**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( k \) such that the quadratic equation \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \) has solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( k \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Use the fact that \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \) are roots of the quadratic equation.  
2. Apply Vieta's formulas to relate the roots to the coefficients of the quadratic.  
3. Solve for \( k \) using the relationships derived from Vieta's formulas.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use Vieta's formulas to express \( k \) in terms of the roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \). For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), Vieta's formulas state that the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \) and the product of the roots is \( \frac{c}{a} \). Here, the equation is \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \), so \( a = k \), \( b = -5 \), \( c = -12 \). We will compute the sum and product of the roots and set up equations to solve for \( k \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \), Vieta's formulas give:  
- Sum of roots: \( x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-5}{k} = \frac{5}{k} \).  
- Product of roots: \( x_1 x_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{-12}{k} \).  

Given roots \( x_1 = 3 \), \( x_2 = -\frac{4}{3} \):  
- Sum of roots: \( 3 + \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = 3 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \).  
  Thus, \( \frac{5}{k} = \frac{5}{3} \).  
- Product of roots: \( 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = -4 \).  
  Thus, \( \frac{-12}{k} = -4 \).  

From the sum of roots:  
\[ \frac{5}{k} = \frac{5}{3} \implies k = 3. \]

From the product of roots:  
\[ \frac{-12}{k} = -4 \implies k = \frac{-12}{-4} = 3. \]

Both equations yield \( k = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( k = 3 \) satisfies the condition that \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \) are roots of the equation \( kx^2 - 5x - 12 = 0 \). Substitute \( k = 3 \) into the equation and check if both roots satisfy it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( k = 3 \) into the equation:  
\[ 3x^2 - 5x - 12 = 0. \]

Check \( x = 3 \):  
\[ 3(3)^2 - 5(3) - 12 = 3 \cdot 9 - 15 - 12 = 27 - 15 - 12 = 0. \]  
This satisfies the equation.

Check \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \):  
\[ 3\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 - 5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) - 12 = 3 \cdot \frac{16}{9} + \frac{20}{3} - 12 = \frac{48}{9} + \frac{60}{9} - \frac{108}{9} = \frac{48 + 60 - 108}{9} = \frac{0}{9} = 0. \]  
This satisfies the equation.

Since both roots satisfy the equation when \( k = 3 \), the solution is valid.
