**Problem Statement**: Max paid 10% of the dirt bike's cost upfront, amounting to $150. We need to find the total price of the bike.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the total price of the bike, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the relationship between the upfront payment, the percentage paid, and the total price.  
2. Set up an equation based on this relationship.  
3. Solve the equation to find the total price.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Establish the relationship between the upfront payment and the total price.  
How to Achieve: The upfront payment of $150 represents 10% of the total price. Let the total price be \( x \). Then, 10% of \( x \) equals $150, which can be expressed as \( 0.1x = 150 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The relationship is given by the equation \( 0.1x = 150 \), where \( x \) is the total price of the bike.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find the total price.  
How to Achieve: Solve \( 0.1x = 150 \) by dividing both sides by 0.1 to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation:  
\[ 0.1x = 150 \]  
Divide both sides by 0.1:  
\[ x = \frac{150}{0.1} = 150 \times 10 = 1500 \]  
The total price of the bike is $1500.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution is correct.  
How to Achieve: Check if 10% of $1500 equals $150. Calculate \( 0.1 \times 1500 \) and confirm it matches the upfront payment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate 10% of $1500:  
\[ 0.1 \times 1500 = 150 \]  
This matches the given upfront payment of $150, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the total price of the dirt bike.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the relationship between the upfront payment and total price (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, as the total price is calculated and verified.  
The total price of the bike is $1500.
