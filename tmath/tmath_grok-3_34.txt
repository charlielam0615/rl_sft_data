### Problem Restatement
Max bought a dirt bike and paid 10% of its cost upfront, amounting to $150. We need to determine the total price of the bike.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the total price of the bike, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Identify the relationship between the upfront payment, the percentage paid, and the total price.
2. Set up an equation based on this relationship.
3. Solve the equation to find the total price.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the upfront payment and the total price.
How to Achieve: The upfront payment of $150 is 10% of the total price. Let the total price be \( x \). Then, 10% of \( x \) equals $150, which can be written as \( 0.1x = 150 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the relationship that 10% of the total price equals $150, set up the equation:
\[ 0.1x = 150 \]
where \( x \) is the total price of the bike.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find the total price.
How to Achieve: Solve \( 0.1x = 150 \) by dividing both sides by 0.1 to isolate \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[ 0.1x = 150 \]
Divide both sides by 0.1:
\[ x = \frac{150}{0.1} = 150 \times 10 = 1500 \]
The total price of the bike is $1500.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculated total price.
How to Achieve: Check if 10% of $1500 equals $150 by calculating \( 0.1 \times 1500 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validate the solution:
\[ 0.1 \times 1500 = 150 \]
Since 10% of $1500 is $150, which matches the upfront payment, the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Determine the total price of the bike.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the relationship between the upfront payment, percentage, and total price (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation based on the relationship (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equation to find the total price (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
The total price of the bike is $1500, and the solution has been validated.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The price of the dirt bike is $1500.
