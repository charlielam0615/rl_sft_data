**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form to eliminate the logarithm.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( r \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation and is within the domain of the logarithm.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the logarithmic equation \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\) to its exponential form. This can be achieved by using the property of logarithms: if \(\log_b (a) = c\), then \(b^c = a\).

[IMP]  
Rewrite \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\) in exponential form:  
\[ 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(16^{\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16\) for \( r \). This involves isolating \( r \) by subtracting 16 from both sides and computing the value of \(16^{\frac{5}{4}}\).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
First, compute \(16^{\frac{5}{4}}\). Since \(16 = 2^4\), we can rewrite:  
\[ 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\frac{5}{4}} = 2^{4 \cdot \frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32 \]  
Now, solve for \( r \):  
\[ 32 = r + 16 \]  
\[ r = 32 - 16 = 16 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = 16 \) satisfies the original equation \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\) and is within the domain of the logarithm (i.e., \( r + 16 > 0 \)).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = 16 \) into the original equation:  
\[ \log_{16} (16 + 16) = \log_{16} (32) \]  
Compute \(\log_{16} (32)\):  
Since \(16 = 2^4\) and \(32 = 2^5\), we have:  
\[ \log_{16} (32) = \log_{2^4} (2^5) = \frac{\log_2 (2^5)}{\log_2 (2^4)} = \frac{5}{4} \]  
This matches the right-hand side of the equation, \(\frac{5}{4}\).  
Check the domain: \( r + 16 = 16 + 16 = 32 > 0 \), which is valid.  
Thus, \( r = 16 \) satisfies the equation and is within the domain.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\) for \( r \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert the logarithmic equation to exponential form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the exponential equation for \( r \) (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution and check the domain (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the solution \( r = 16 \) has been found and verified.

**Final Answer**: The value of \( r \) that satisfies \(\log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4}\) is \( r = 16 \).
