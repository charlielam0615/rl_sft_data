**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation \( \log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4} \), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form to eliminate the logarithm.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( r \).  
3. Verify the solution to ensure it satisfies the original equation and is within the domain of the logarithm.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the logarithmic equation \( \log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4} \) to its exponential form. This involves rewriting the equation using the definition of logarithms: if \( \log_b a = c \), then \( b^c = a \).

[IMP]  
Given \( \log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4} \), rewrite in exponential form:  
\[ 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16 \) for \( r \). This involves evaluating \( 16^{\frac{5}{4}} \) and isolating \( r \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
First, compute \( 16^{\frac{5}{4}} \). Since \( 16 = 2^4 \), we have:  
\[ 16^{\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\frac{5}{4}} = 2^{4 \cdot \frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32 \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 32 = r + 16 \]  
Solving for \( r \):  
\[ r = 32 - 16 = 16 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( r = 16 \) satisfies the original equation \( \log_{16} (r + 16) = \frac{5}{4} \) and check the domain of the logarithm (i.e., \( r + 16 > 0 \)).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = 16 \) into the original equation:  
\[ \log_{16} (16 + 16) = \log_{16} 32 \]  
Compute \( \log_{16} 32 \):  
Since \( 32 = 2^5 \) and \( 16 = 2^4 \), we have \( 32 = 16^{\frac{5}{4}} \), so:  
\[ \log_{16} 32 = \log_{16} (16^{\frac{5}{4}}) = \frac{5}{4} \]  
This matches the right-hand side of the equation, confirming the solution.  
Check the domain: \( r + 16 = 16 + 16 = 32 > 0 \), which is valid.
