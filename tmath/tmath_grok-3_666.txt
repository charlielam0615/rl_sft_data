**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To compute \(\dbinom{505}{505}\), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand the definition of the binomial coefficient.  
2. Apply the definition to the specific case of \(\dbinom{505}{505}\).  
3. Compute the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the definition of the binomial coefficient. This involves recalling the formula \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) and recognizing its application to the problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items without regard to order. It is defined as:  
\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]  
For \(\dbinom{505}{505}\), we have \(n = 505\) and \(k = 505\). Substituting these values:  
\[
\dbinom{505}{505} = \frac{505!}{505!(505-505)!} = \frac{505!}{505! \cdot 0!}
\]  
Since \(0! = 1\), this simplifies to:  
\[
\dbinom{505}{505} = \frac{505!}{505! \cdot 1} = \frac{505!}{505!} = 1
\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \(\dbinom{505}{505} = 1\). This involves checking the mathematical reasoning and ensuring the application of the binomial coefficient formula is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, reconsider the binomial coefficient \(\dbinom{505}{505}\). The formula \(\dbinom{n}{n} = \frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{n! \cdot 0!}\) holds for any \(n\). Since \(0! = 1\), \(\dbinom{n}{n} = 1\). For \(n = 505\), this gives \(\dbinom{505}{505} = 1\). Alternatively, interpret combinatorially: choosing all 505 items from 505 items can only be done in one way, confirming the result is 1. The computation is consistent and correct.
