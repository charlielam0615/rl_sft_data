**Problem Statement**: Ramon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $2.50, and three enchiladas and two tacos for $2.70. Assuming fixed prices for enchiladas and tacos, find the cost, in dollars, of three enchiladas and four tacos, expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos, break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the price of an enchilada (E) and a taco (T).  
2. Set up a system of equations based on the given sales data.  
3. Solve the system to find E and T.  
4. Calculate the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos using the found values.  
5. Round the result to the nearest hundredth.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a system of equations based on the given sales data. This will be achieved by translating the two sales scenarios into mathematical equations using the variables E (price of an enchilada) and T (price of a taco).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- Two enchiladas and three tacos cost $2.50:  
  \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
- Three enchiladas and two tacos cost $2.70:  
  \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
Thus, the system of equations is:  
1. \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
2. \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \) and \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \) to find the values of E and T. This will be achieved using the elimination method to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
System:  
1. \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
2. \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  

Multiply equation 1 by 3:  
\( 6E + 9T = 7.50 \)  

Multiply equation 2 by 2:  
\( 6E + 4T = 5.40 \)  

Subtract the second from the first:  
\( (6E + 9T) - (6E + 4T) = 7.50 - 5.40 \)  
\( 5T = 2.10 \)  
\( T = \frac{2.10}{5} = 0.42 \)  

Substitute \( T = 0.42 \) into equation 1:  
\( 2E + 3(0.42) = 2.50 \)  
\( 2E + 1.26 = 2.50 \)  
\( 2E = 1.24 \)  
\( E = \frac{1.24}{2} = 0.62 \)  

So, \( E = 0.62 \), \( T = 0.42 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by substituting \( E = 0.62 \) and \( T = 0.42 \) into both original equations to ensure they hold true.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check equation 1: \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
\( 2(0.62) + 3(0.42) = 1.24 + 1.26 = 2.50 \)  
Satisfied.  

Check equation 2: \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
\( 3(0.62) + 2(0.42) = 1.86 + 0.84 = 2.70 \)  
Satisfied.  

The values \( E = 0.62 \) and \( T = 0.42 \) are correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos using \( E = 0.62 \) and \( T = 0.42 \), and express the result as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Cost of three enchiladas and four tacos:  
\( 3E + 4T = 3(0.62) + 4(0.42) \)  
\( = 1.86 + 1.68 = 3.54 \)  

The cost is $3.54, which is already to the nearest hundredth.  
[/IMP]
