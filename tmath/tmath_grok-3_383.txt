**Problem Statement**: Ramon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $2.50, and three enchiladas and two tacos for $2.70. Assuming fixed prices for each item, find the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos, expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the cost of one enchilada (E) and one taco (T).  
2. Set up a system of equations based on the given sales data.  
3. Solve the system to find E and T.  
4. Calculate the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos using the values of E and T.  
5. Round the result to the nearest hundredth.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up a system of equations based on the given sales data. Use the information provided to create two equations representing the costs of the enchiladas and tacos sold.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- Two enchiladas and three tacos cost $2.50:  
  \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
- Three enchiladas and two tacos cost $2.70:  
  \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
This gives the system of equations:  
1. \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
2. \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find the values of E (cost of one enchilada) and T (cost of one taco). Use a method such as substitution or elimination to solve for E and T.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
1. \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
2. \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  

Use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 to align the coefficients of E:  
- \( 3 \times (2E + 3T = 2.50) \): \( 6E + 9T = 7.50 \)  
- \( 2 \times (3E + 2T = 2.70) \): \( 6E + 4T = 5.40 \)  

Subtract the second from the first:  
\( (6E + 9T) - (6E + 4T) = 7.50 - 5.40 \)  
\( 5T = 2.10 \)  
\( T = \frac{2.10}{5} = 0.42 \)  

Substitute \( T = 0.42 \) into the first equation:  
\( 2E + 3(0.42) = 2.50 \)  
\( 2E + 1.26 = 2.50 \)  
\( 2E = 2.50 - 1.26 = 1.24 \)  
\( E = \frac{1.24}{2} = 0.62 \)  

Thus, the cost of one enchilada is $0.62, and the cost of one taco is $0.42.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the values of E and T satisfy both original equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the first equation: \( 2E + 3T = 2.50 \)  
\( 2(0.62) + 3(0.42) = 1.24 + 1.26 = 2.50 \)  
This holds true.  

Check the second equation: \( 3E + 2T = 2.70 \)  
\( 3(0.62) + 2(0.42) = 1.86 + 0.84 = 2.70 \)  
This also holds true.  

The values \( E = 0.62 \) and \( T = 0.42 \) are valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos using the values of E and T, and round the result to the nearest hundredth.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cost of three enchiladas and four tacos:  
\( 3E + 4T = 3(0.62) + 4(0.42) \)  
\( = 1.86 + 1.68 = 3.54 \)  

The cost is $3.54, which is already rounded to the nearest hundredth.
