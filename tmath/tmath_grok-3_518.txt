### Problem Restatement
We need to find two numbers whose difference is 9 and whose squares sum to 153, then determine their product. Mathematically, if the numbers are \(x\) and \(y\), we have:
1. \(x - y = 9\)
2. \(x^2 + y^2 = 153\)
We need to find the value of \(xy\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution.  
- Subgoal 1: Use the given equations to express one variable in terms of the other.  
- Subgoal 2: Substitute into the second equation to form a solvable equation.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve for the variables and compute their product.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to express one variable in terms of the other using the first equation (\(x - y = 9\)). This can be achieved by solving for \(x\) in terms of \(y\), i.e., \(x = y + 9\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the first equation, \(x - y = 9\), we solve for \(x\):  
\(x = y + 9\).  
This expression will be used in the next step to substitute into the second equation.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to substitute \(x = y + 9\) into the second equation (\(x^2 + y^2 = 153\)) to form an equation in terms of \(y\), then solve for \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = y + 9\) into \(x^2 + y^2 = 153\):  
\(x^2 = (y + 9)^2 = y^2 + 18y + 81\).  
So, the second equation becomes:  
\(y^2 + 18y + 81 + y^2 = 153\).  
Simplify:  
\(2y^2 + 18y + 81 = 153\).  
Subtract 153 from both sides:  
\(2y^2 + 18y + 81 - 153 = 0\).  
\(2y^2 + 18y - 72 = 0\).  
Divide through by 2:  
\(y^2 + 9y - 36 = 0\).  
This is a quadratic equation in \(y\). Solve using the quadratic formula, \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 9\), \(c = -36\):  
Discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = 9^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-36) = 81 + 144 = 225\).  
\(y = \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-9 \pm 15}{2}\).  
Two solutions:  
\(y = \frac{-9 + 15}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\),  
\(y = \frac{-9 - 15}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12\).  
For each \(y\), find \(x\):  
If \(y = 3\), then \(x = y + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12\).  
If \(y = -12\), then \(x = -12 + 9 = -3\).  
So, the pairs are \((x, y) = (12, 3)\) or \((x, y) = (-3, -12)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify that the pairs \((12, 3)\) and \((-3, -12)\) satisfy both given equations (\(x - y = 9\), \(x^2 + y^2 = 153\)).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check pair \((x, y) = (12, 3)\):  
- Difference: \(12 - 3 = 9\), which satisfies \(x - y = 9\).  
- Sum of squares: \(12^2 + 3^2 = 144 + 9 = 153\), which satisfies \(x^2 + y^2 = 153\).  
Check pair \((x, y) = (-3, -12)\):  
- Difference: \(-3 - (-12) = -3 + 12 = 9\), which satisfies \(x - y = 9\).  
- Sum of squares: \((-3)^2 + (-12)^2 = 9 + 144 = 153\), which satisfies \(x^2 + y^2 = 153\).  
Both pairs are valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the product \(xy\) for both valid pairs and determine if they yield the same product.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For pair \((12, 3)\):  
\(xy = 12 \cdot 3 = 36\).  
For pair \((-3, -12)\):  
\(xy = (-3) \cdot (-12) = 36\).  
Both pairs give the same product, \(xy = 36\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the product of two numbers whose difference is 9 and whose squares sum to 153.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express one variable in terms of the other (completed: \(x = y + 9\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute into the second equation and solve (completed: found \(y = 3, -12\), then \(x = 12, -3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions (completed: both pairs \((12, 3)\) and \((-3, -12)\) are valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the product \(xy\) (completed: \(xy = 36\) for both pairs).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer by reviewing the consistency of the product.  
The product \(xy = 36\) is consistent across both solution pairs, indicating the solution is complete.

### Final Answer
The value of the product of the two numbers is **36**.
