**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the values of \( a \) for which the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \) has exactly one solution for \( x \), and then compute the sum of those values of \( a \). A quadratic equation has one solution when its discriminant is zero.

2. Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution (discriminant = 0).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Simplify the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Combine the like terms (specifically the \( x \)-terms) to rewrite the equation in the standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation is \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \). Combine the \( x \)-terms:  
\[ ax + 8x = (a + 8)x. \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0. \]  
This is now in the standard form \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), where:  
- \( A = 4 \),  
- \( B = a + 8 \),  
- \( C = 9 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the discriminant condition for the quadratic to have exactly one solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the discriminant formula \( \Delta = B^2 - 4AC \) for the quadratic \( 4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0 \), set it equal to zero, and express it in terms of \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = B^2 - 4AC. \]  
The equation has one solution when \( \Delta = 0 \). Using \( A = 4 \), \( B = a + 8 \), and \( C = 9 \), the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = (a + 8)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9. \]  
Calculate the constant term:  
\[ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144. \]  
So, the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = (a + 8)^2 - 144. \]  
Set the discriminant equal to zero:  
\[ (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the discriminant equation \( (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0 \) to find the values of \( a \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Solve the equation for \( a \) by isolating the variable and taking the square root.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0. \]  
Add 144 to both sides:  
\[ (a + 8)^2 = 144. \]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[ a + 8 = \pm \sqrt{144} = \pm 12. \]  
Solve for \( a \):  
- \( a + 8 = 12 \implies a = 12 - 8 = 4 \),  
- \( a + 8 = -12 \implies a = -12 - 8 = -20. \]  
Thus, the values of \( a \) are \( a = 4 \) and \( a = -20 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = 4 \) and \( a = -20 \) result in a quadratic with exactly one solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute each value of \( a \) back into the quadratic equation, compute the discriminant, and confirm it equals zero. Alternatively, solve the resulting quadratic to check for a single solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check for \( a = 4 \)**:  
The quadratic is \( 4x^2 + (4 + 8)x + 9 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0 \).  
Rewrite:  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x + 3)^2 = 0. \]  
Solve:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{3}{2}. \]  
This is a perfect square trinomial, confirming one solution. Alternatively, compute the discriminant:  
\[ B = 12, \Delta = 12^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144 - 144 = 0. \]  
Discriminant is zero, confirming one solution.

**Check for \( a = -20 \)**:  
The quadratic is \( 4x^2 + (-20 + 8)x + 9 = 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \).  
Rewrite:  
\[ 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = (2x - 3)^2 = 0. \]  
Solve:  
\[ 2x - 3 = 0 \implies x = \frac{3}{2}. \]  
Again, a perfect square trinomial, confirming one solution. Discriminant:  
\[ B = -12, \Delta = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144 - 144 = 0. \]  
Discriminant is zero, confirming one solution.

\[ 4 + (-20) = 4 - 20 = -16. \]  
[/IMP]
