### Problem Restatement
We need to find the values of \( a \) for which the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \) has exactly one solution for \( x \), and then compute the sum of those values of \( a \). A quadratic equation has one solution when its discriminant is zero, as this indicates a single real root (a double root).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Simplify the given quadratic equation.
2. Identify the condition for a quadratic to have exactly one solution (discriminant = 0).
3. Formulate the discriminant in terms of \( a \).
4. Solve for the values of \( a \) that make the discriminant zero.
5. Compute the sum of those values of \( a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \) by combining like terms to express it in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). This will allow us to identify the coefficients needed for the discriminant.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation is \( 4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0 \). Combine the \( x \)-terms:  
\[ ax + 8x = (a + 8)x. \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0. \]  
This is now in the standard quadratic form \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), with coefficients:  
- \( A = 4 \),  
- \( B = a + 8 \),  
- \( C = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the condition for the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution. For a quadratic \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), this occurs when the discriminant \( \Delta = B^2 - 4AC = 0 \). We will use the coefficients from the simplified equation to set up the discriminant equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \( 4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0 \), the discriminant is:  
\[ \Delta = B^2 - 4AC, \]  
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = a + 8 \), and \( C = 9 \). Substituting:  
\[ \Delta = (a + 8)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9. \]  
Calculate the constant term:  
\[ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144. \]  
Thus:  
\[ \Delta = (a + 8)^2 - 144. \]  
For exactly one solution, set the discriminant to zero:  
\[ (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0 \) to find the values of \( a \). This is a quadratic equation in \( a \), and solving it will give the two values of \( a \) that make the discriminant zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0. \]  
\[ (a + 8)^2 = 144. \]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[ a + 8 = \pm \sqrt{144} = \pm 12. \]  
This gives two equations:  
1. \( a + 8 = 12 \implies a = 12 - 8 = 4 \).  
2. \( a + 8 = -12 \implies a = -12 - 8 = -20 \).  
Thus, the values of \( a \) are \( a = 4 \) and \( a = -20 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 4 \) and \( a = -20 \) produce a quadratic with exactly one solution by substituting these values into the discriminant and checking if it equals zero.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( a = 4 \):  
The quadratic is \( 4x^2 + (4 + 8)x + 9 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0 \).  
Discriminant:  
\[ B = 12, \quad \Delta = 12^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144 - 144 = 0. \]  
This confirms one solution.  

For \( a = -20 \):  
The quadratic is \( 4x^2 + (-20 + 8)x + 9 = 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \).  
Discriminant:  
\[ B = -12, \quad \Delta = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 144 - 144 = 0. \]  
This also confirms one solution.  
Both values satisfy the condition.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the values of \( a \), which are \( a = 4 \) and \( a = -20 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sum the values:  
\[ 4 + (-20) = 4 - 20 = -16. \]  
[/IMP]
