**Problem Restatement**: Solve the equation \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}\) for \(t\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the equation by eliminating the square roots through exponentiation.
2. Solve the resulting equation for \(t\).
3. Validate the solutions by checking domain constraints and substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the equation by eliminating the square roots.
How to Achieve: Square both sides to remove the outer square root on the left and the fourth root (equivalent to a square root of a square root) on the right, then simplify further as needed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}
\]
Since \(\sqrt[4]{7 - t} = (7 - t)^{1/4}\), rewrite the right side for clarity. To eliminate the outer square root on the left, square both sides:
\[
\left( \sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} \right)^2 = \left( (7 - t)^{1/4} \right)^2
\]
Left side:
\[
\left( \sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} \right)^2 = 2\sqrt{t-2}
\]
Right side:
\[
\left( (7 - t)^{1/4} \right)^2 = (7 - t)^{2/4} = (7 - t)^{1/2} = \sqrt{7 - t}
\]
This gives:
\[
2\sqrt{t-2} = \sqrt{7 - t}
\]
To eliminate the remaining square roots, square both sides again:
\[
\left( 2\sqrt{t-2} \right)^2 = \left( \sqrt{7 - t} \right)^2
\]
Left side:
\[
4(t-2) = 4t - 8
\]
Right side:
\[
7 - t
\]
So:
\[
4t - 8 = 7 - t
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the resulting equation for \(t\).
How to Achieve: Solve the linear equation \(4t - 8 = 7 - t\) for \(t\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve:
\[
4t - 8 = 7 - t
\]
Add \(t\) to both sides:
\[
4t + t - 8 = 7
\]
\[
5t - 8 = 7
\]
Add 8 to both sides:
\[
5t = 15
\]
Divide by 5:
\[
t = 3
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the solution \(t = 3\) by checking domain constraints and substituting into the original equation.
How to Achieve: Determine the domain by ensuring the expressions under the square roots are non-negative, then substitute \(t = 3\) to verify equality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Domain Check**:
- Left side: \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}}\) requires \(\sqrt{t-2} \geq 0\), so \(t-2 \geq 0 \implies t \geq 2\). Also, the inner term \(2\sqrt{t-2} \geq 0\) is always true since \(\sqrt{t-2} \geq 0\).
- Right side: \(\sqrt[4]{7 - t} = (7 - t)^{1/4}\) requires \(7 - t \geq 0 \implies t \leq 7\). Since the fourth root of a non-negative number is defined, no additional constraints arise.
- Domain: \(2 \leq t \leq 7\).
Since \(t = 3\) satisfies \(2 \leq t \leq 7\), it is within the domain.

**Substitution**:
Substitute \(t = 3\) into the original equation:
Left side:
\[
\sqrt{t-2} = \sqrt{3-2} = \sqrt{1} = 1
\]
\[
2\sqrt{t-2} = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
\]
\[
\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{2}
\]
Right side:
\[
7 - t = 7 - 3 = 4
\]
\[
\sqrt[4]{7 - t} = \sqrt[4]{4} = 4^{1/4} = (2^2)^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}\), the solution \(t = 3\) satisfies the equation.

**Check for Extraneous Solutions**:
Since squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions, consider the equation after the first squaring:
\[
2\sqrt{t-2} = \sqrt{7 - t}
\]
This implies both sides are non-negative. For \(t = 3\):
- Left: \(2\sqrt{3-2} = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \geq 0\)
- Right: \(\sqrt{7-3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \geq 0\)
Both sides are equal and non-negative, suggesting no issues from squaring. To ensure no other solutions, solve the squared equation \(4t - 8 = 7 - t\) generally, which yielded only \(t = 3\). Testing other values in the domain (e.g., \(t = 4\)) confirms no other solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
