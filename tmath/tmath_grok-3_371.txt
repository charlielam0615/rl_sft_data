**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( t \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the equation by eliminating the roots.
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( t \).
3. Verify the solutions by checking domain constraints and substituting back into the original equation.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the equation by eliminating the roots.
How to Achieve: Square both sides of the equation twice to remove the square roots and fourth roots, ensuring to handle the domain constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}\).

First, note the fourth root can be written as a square root: \(\sqrt[4]{7 - t} = (7 - t)^{1/4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{7 - t}}\).

Square both sides to eliminate the outer square root on the left:
\[
\left( \sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} \right)^2 = \left( \sqrt[4]{7 - t} \right)^2
\]
\[
2\sqrt{t-2} = \sqrt{7 - t}
\]

Square both sides again to remove the remaining square roots:
\[
\left( 2\sqrt{t-2} \right)^2 = \left( \sqrt{7 - t} \right)^2
\]
\[
4(t-2) = 7 - t
\]
\[
4t - 8 = 7 - t
\]
\[
5t = 15
\]
\[
t = 3
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( t = 3 \) by checking domain constraints and substituting into the original equation.
How to Achieve: Determine the domain of both sides of the original equation and test \( t = 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Domain Check**:
- Left side: \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}}\)
  - Inner square root: \( t - 2 \geq 0 \implies t \geq 2 \).
  - Outer square root: \( 2\sqrt{t-2} \geq 0 \), which is always true since \(\sqrt{t-2} \geq 0\).
  - Domain: \( t \geq 2 \).
- Right side: \(\sqrt[4]{7 - t} = (7 - t)^{1/4}\)
  - Since the fourth root is defined for real numbers when the index is even, require \( 7 - t \geq 0 \implies t \leq 7 \).
  - Domain: \( t \leq 7 \).
- Combined domain: \( 2 \leq t \leq 7 \).

Since \( t = 3 \) is within \( 2 \leq t \leq 7 \), it satisfies the domain.

**Substitution Check**:
Substitute \( t = 3 \) into the original equation:
- Left side: \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{3-2}} = \sqrt{2\sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{2}\).
- Right side: \(\sqrt[4]{7 - 3} = \sqrt[4]{4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{4}} = \sqrt{2}\).

Since \(\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}\), \( t = 3 \) satisfies the equation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find \( t \) such that \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by eliminating roots (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( t \) (completed, found \( t = 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution by checking domain and substitution (completed, \( t = 3 \) is valid).

**Current Goal**: Verify if other solutions exist or conclude the solution.

Since squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions, we need to ensure no other solutions were missed.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check for other possible solutions to ensure completeness.
How to Achieve: Analyze the equation or test values within the domain to confirm \( t = 3 \) is the only solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider the function derived from the equation:
\[
f(t) = \sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} - \sqrt[4]{7 - t}
\]
We need \( f(t) = 0 \) for \( t \in [2, 7] \).

Since squaring introduced a polynomial equation \( 4(t-2) = 7 - t \), which is linear and yielded \( t = 3 \), let’s test other values or analyze the behavior of \( f(t) \).

Test boundary and intermediate points:
- At \( t = 2 \):
  \[
  \text{Left: } \sqrt{2\sqrt{2-2}} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 0} = 0, \quad \text{Right: } \sqrt[4]{7-2} = \sqrt[4]{5} > 0 \implies 0 \neq \sqrt[4]{5}
  \]
- At \( t = 7 \):
  \[
  \text{Left: } \sqrt{2\sqrt{7-2}} = \sqrt{2\sqrt{5}} > 0, \quad \text{Right: } \sqrt[4]{7-7} = 0 \implies \sqrt{2\sqrt{5}} \neq 0
  \]
- At \( t = 5 \):
  \[
  \text{Left: } \sqrt{2\sqrt{5-2}} = \sqrt{2\sqrt{3}} \approx \sqrt{2 \cdot 1.732} \approx 1.861
  \]
  \[
  \text{Right: } \sqrt[4]{7-5} = \sqrt[4]{2} \approx 1.189 \implies 1.861 > 1.189
  \]

Since \( f(2) < 0 \), \( f(3) = 0 \), and \( f(5) > 0 \), and \( f(7) > 0 \), and noting that both sides of the equation are continuous and generally increasing/decreasing appropriately in the domain, \( t = 3 \) appears to be the only root.

Alternatively, revisit the squared equation \( 2\sqrt{t-2} = \sqrt{7 - t} \). Since both sides are non-negative, solutions to the polynomial \( 4t - 8 = 7 - t \) should cover all possibilities, and it’s linear, confirming a single solution.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve information about the solution process to confirm \( t = 3 \) is the only solution, focusing on the squaring steps and domain analysis.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- **Squaring Steps**: In Step 2, squaring both sides twice transformed \(\sqrt{2\sqrt{t-2}} = \sqrt[4]{7 - t}\) into \( 4t - 8 = 7 - t \), a linear equation with solution \( t = 3 \).
- **Domain Analysis**: In Step 3, the domain was established as \( 2 \leq t \leq 7 \). The solution \( t = 3 \) was within this domain and satisfied the original equation.
- **Extraneous Solutions Check**: In Step 5, testing other values and analyzing the function \( f(t) \) suggested \( t = 3 \) is the only point where the equation holds, supported by the linear nature of the polynomial after squaring.

This confirms that no other solutions were missed, and \( t = 3 \) is the sole solution.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( t = 3 \)
