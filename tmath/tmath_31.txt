Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The quadratic formula and how the roots of a quadratic equation relate to its coefficients.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The quadratic formula for an equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ is given by $ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $. The roots of a quadratic equation are directly related to its coefficients through the discriminant $ b^2 - 4ac $. Given the roots $ \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} $, we can use this to determine the value of $ k $, which is the constant term $ c $ in the equation $ 7x^2 + 3x + k $.

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is $ 7x^2 + 3x + k = 0 $, with $ a = 7 $, $ b = 3 $, and $ c = k $.  

The quadratic formula gives the roots as:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
Substituting $ a = 7 $, $ b = 3 $, and $ c = k $, the roots become:  
$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(7)(k)}}{2(7)} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 28k}}{14}
$$  

From the problem, the roots are given as:  
$$
\frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14}
$$  

Equating the expressions under the square root:  
$$
\sqrt{9 - 28k} = i\sqrt{299}
$$  

Squaring both sides:  
$$
9 - 28k = -299
$$  

Solving for $ k $:  
$$
9 + 299 = 28k
$$  
$$
308 = 28k
$$  
$$
k = \frac{308}{28} = 11
$$

[VERIFY]
1. The quadratic formula was correctly applied with a=7, b=3, c=k. The roots derived from the quadratic formula correctly match the given structure of (-3 ± √(discriminant))/14.

2. The discriminant calculation is valid: 
   - b² = 3² = 9
   - 4ac = 4*7*k = 28k
   - Discriminant expression: 9 - 28k

3. The complex roots indicate the discriminant must be negative:
   - Given i√299 in the roots, the discriminant must be -299
   - Equation: 9 - 28k = -299 is correctly established

4. Solving the equation:
   - 9 - 28k = -299
   - -28k = -308
   - k = 11 (correct arithmetic)

5. Final value k=11 satisfies all conditions of the problem when verified by plugging back into the quadratic formula.

All logical steps and calculations are consistent and correct.
