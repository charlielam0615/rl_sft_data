Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express $ 3^a = 81^{b+2} $ in terms of the same base.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know that $ 81 = 3^4 $, so we can rewrite the equation:  
$$
3^a = (3^4)^{b+2}
$$  
Using the power of a power property $ (x^m)^n = x^{mn} $:  
$$
3^a = 3^{4(b+2)}
$$  
Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:  
$$
a = 4(b+2)
$$  
This simplifies to:  
$$
a = 4b + 8
$$

Goal of this step: Express $ 125^b = 5^{a-3} $ in terms of the same base.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know that $ 125 = 5^3 $, so we can rewrite the equation:  
$$
(5^3)^b = 5^{a-3}
$$  
Using the power of a power property $ (x^m)^n = x^{mn} $:  
$$
5^{3b} = 5^{a-3}
$$  
Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:  
$$
3b = a - 3
$$  
Rearranging to express $ a $ in terms of $ b $:  
$$
a = 3b + 3
$$

I am focusing on the second subgoal, which is to solve the resulting system of equations.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations $ a = 4b + 8 $ and $ a = 3b + 3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since both equations express $ a $ in terms of $ b $, we can set the right-hand sides equal to each other:  
$$
4b + 8 = 3b + 3
$$  
Subtract $ 3b $ from both sides:  
$$
b + 8 = 3
$$  
Subtract 8 from both sides:  
$$
b = -5
$$  
Now substitute $ b = -5 $ into $ a = 4b + 8 $:  
$$
a = 4(-5) + 8 = -20 + 8 = -12
$$  
Thus, the values are $ a = -12 $ and $ b = -5 $.

Goal of this step: Calculate the product $ ab $.

[IMP]
We have determined that $ a = -12 $ and $ b = -5 $. The product $ ab $ is:  
$$
ab = (-12)(-5) = 60
$$  
Thus, the value of $ ab $ is 60.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the entire solution process from expressing equations in same base to calculating the final product $ ab $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **First equation verification**:  
   Original equation: $ 3^a = 81^{b+2} $.  
   Substituting $ 81 = 3^4 $:  
   $ 3^a = (3^4)^{b+2} = 3^{4(b+2)} $.  
   Equating exponents: $ a = 4b + 8 $. This step is valid as the base $ 3 $ is positive and not equal to 1.  

2. **Second equation verification**:  
   Original equation: $ 125^b = 5^{a-3} $.  
   Substituting $ 125 = 5^3 $:  
   $ (5^3)^b = 5^{a-3} = 5^{3b} $.  
   Equating exponents: $ 3b = a - 3 $, leading to $ a = 3b + 3 $. This step is valid for the same reason as above.  

3. **System of equations verification**:  
   Solving $ a = 4b + 8 $ and $ a = 3b + 3 $:  
   - Substituting $ b = -5 $ into $ a = 4b + 8 $:  
     $ a = 4(-5) + 8 = -20 + 8 = -12 $.  
   - Verifying $ a = -12 $ in $ a = 3b + 3 $:  
     $ -12 = 3(-5) + 3 = -15 + 3 = -12 $.  
   Both equations are satisfied.  

4. **Final product verification**:  
   $ ab = (-12)(-5) = 60 $.  
   Substituting $ a = -12 $ and $ b = -5 $ into the original equations:  
   - $ 3^{-12} = 81^{-5 + 2} = 81^{-3} = (3^4)^{-3} = 3^{-12} $.  
   - $ 125^{-5} = 5^{-15} $ and $ 5^{-12 - 3} = 5^{-15} $.  
   Both equations hold true.  

All steps are logically consistent, and substitutions confirm the solution. No errors detected.  
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The value of $ ab $ is $ 60 $.
