**Problem Statement**: Find the largest value of \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \). This means we need to find the largest \( c \) for which there exists some \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 1 \), i.e., \( x^2 - 5x + c = 1 \).

### Step 1

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the condition for 1 to be in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \).  
2. Express this condition in terms of \( c \).  
3. Find the largest possible value of \( c \) that satisfies this condition.

### Step 2

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for 1 to be in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \). To achieve this, set \( f(x) = 1 \), i.e., \( x^2 - 5x + c = 1 \), and check for the existence of real solutions for \( x \). This involves forming a quadratic equation and analyzing its discriminant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( f(x) = 1 \) as:  
\[ x^2 - 5x + c - 1 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \]  
This is a quadratic equation in \( x \). For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (c - 1) = 25 - 4(c - 1) = 25 - 4c + 4 = 29 - 4c \]  
Thus, the condition is:  
\[ 29 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
\[ 4c \leq 29 \]  
\[ c \leq \frac{29}{4} \]

### Step 3

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the condition \( c \leq \frac{29}{4} \). Verify that when \( c = \frac{29}{4} \), 1 is in the range, and check if larger values of \( c \) make the discriminant negative, ensuring \( \frac{29}{4} \) is the largest possible value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( c = \frac{29}{4} \):  
\[ \Delta = 29 - 4 \cdot \frac{29}{4} = 29 - 29 = 0 \]  
A discriminant of 0 means exactly one real solution. Solve the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 - 5x + \left( \frac{29}{4} - 1 \right) = x^2 - 5x + \frac{29 - 4}{4} = x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} = 0 \]  
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 25}}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]  
Check \( f(x) \):  
\[ f\left( \frac{5}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - 5 \cdot \frac{5}{2} + \frac{29}{4} = \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{2} + \frac{29}{4} = \frac{25 - 50 + 29}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]  
This confirms 1 is in the range when \( c = \frac{29}{4} \).  
For \( c > \frac{29}{4} \), e.g., \( c = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{15}{2} \):  
\[ \Delta = 29 - 4 \cdot \frac{15}{2} = 29 - 30 = -1 \]  
A negative discriminant means no real solutions, so 1 is not in the range.  
Thus, \( c = \frac{29}{4} \) is the largest value.

### Step 4

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the largest \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for 1 to be in the range (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the condition in terms of \( c \) (completed: \( c \leq \frac{29}{4} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the largest \( c \) (completed: \( c = \frac{29}{4} \)).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the largest \( c \) has been identified and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The largest value of \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \) is \( c = \frac{29}{4} \).
