**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the largest value of \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \). This means there exists some \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 1 \), i.e., we need to solve \( x^2 - 5x + c = 1 \) and determine the largest \( c \) for which this equation has at least one real solution.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Express the condition for 1 to be in the range of \( f(x) \).  
2. Solve the resulting equation to find constraints on \( c \).  
3. Determine the largest possible value of \( c \) that satisfies these constraints.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the condition for 1 to be in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \). This requires solving \( f(x) = 1 \), i.e., \( x^2 - 5x + c = 1 \), or equivalently, \( x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \). We will formulate this equation and determine the conditions for it to have real solutions.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation is:  
\[ x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \]  
For this quadratic equation to have at least one real solution, its discriminant must be non-negative. The quadratic is in the form \( ax^2 + bx + k = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( k = c - 1 \). The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (c - 1) = 25 - 4(c - 1) = 25 - 4c + 4 = 29 - 4c \]  
For real solutions, we need:  
\[ 29 - 4c \geq 0 \]  
\[ 4c \leq 29 \]  
\[ c \leq \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]  
Thus, the equation has real solutions when \( c \leq 7.25 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \( c \leq 7.25 \) ensures 1 is in the range of \( f(x) \), and specifically check if \( c = 7.25 \) is the largest possible value. We will test the boundary case \( c = 7.25 \) and consider the behavior of the function to confirm.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( c = 7.25 \) into the equation \( x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \):  
\[ c - 1 = 7.25 - 1 = 6.25 \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6.25 = 0 \]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 29 - 4 \cdot 7.25 = 29 - 29 = 0 \]  
Since \( \Delta = 0 \), there is exactly one real solution. Solve using the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]  
Check if \( f(x) = 1 \) at \( x = 2.5 \):  
\[ f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 7.25 \]  
\[ f(2.5) = (2.5)^2 - 5 \cdot 2.5 + 7.25 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 7.25 = 1 \]  
This confirms that for \( c = 7.25 \), \( f(2.5) = 1 \), so 1 is in the range.  
Now test a value slightly larger than \( c = 7.25 \), say \( c = 7.26 \):  
\[ c - 1 = 7.26 - 1 = 6.26 \]  
\[ \Delta = 29 - 4 \cdot 7.26 = 29 - 29.04 = -0.04 \]  
Since \( \Delta < 0 \), there are no real solutions, so 1 is not in the range for \( c = 7.26 \).  
This suggests \( c = 7.25 \) may be the largest possible value.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the largest \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the condition for 1 to be in the range (completed: \( x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( c \) by ensuring the equation has real solutions (completed: \( c \leq 7.25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the boundary case and confirm the largest \( c \) (completed: \( c = 7.25 \) works, \( c > 7.25 \) does not).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( c = 7.25 \) is the largest possible value by considering the function’s behavior.  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that \( c = 7.25 \) is the largest possible value by analyzing the function’s range. Since \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \) is a parabola opening upward, we can use its vertex to understand the range and ensure no larger \( c \) is possible.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \) is a parabola opening upward (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive). The range is \([y_{\text{min}}, \infty)\), where \( y_{\text{min}} \) is the value at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-5}{2 \cdot 1} = 2.5 \]  
Evaluate \( f(x) \) at the vertex:  
\[ f(2.5) = (2.5)^2 - 5 \cdot 2.5 + c = 6.25 - 12.5 + c = c - 6.25 \]  
For 1 to be in the range, the minimum value must be at most 1:  
\[ c - 6.25 \leq 1 \]  
\[ c \leq 7.25 \]  
When \( c = 7.25 \), the minimum is:  
\[ f(2.5) = 7.25 - 6.25 = 1 \]  
Thus, the range is \([1, \infty)\), which includes 1. For \( c > 7.25 \), say \( c = 7.26 \), the minimum is:  
\[ f(2.5) = 7.26 - 6.25 = 1.01 \]  
The range becomes \([1.01, \infty)\), which excludes 1. This confirms that \( c = 7.25 \) is the largest value for which 1 is in the range.  

[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The largest value of \( c \) such that 1 is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \) is:  
\[ \boxed{7.25} \]
