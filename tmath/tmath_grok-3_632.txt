**Problem Statement**: Ryan has 3 red and 3 blue lava lamps, arranged randomly in a row of 6 positions. He then randomly turns on 3 of them. We need to find the probability that the leftmost lamp (position 1) is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp (position 6) is red and on.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the probability problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible arrangements of the 6 lamps.  
2. Calculate the total number of ways to turn on 3 lamps.  
3. Find the number of favorable arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible arrangements of 3 red and 3 blue lamps in 6 positions. Achieve this by calculating the number of ways to arrange 6 lamps where 3 are red and 3 are blue, accounting for identical lamps within each color.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of arrangements of 3 red and 3 blue lamps in 6 positions is given by the number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 for the red lamps (the rest are blue). Since the red lamps are identical and the blue lamps are identical, we use the combination formula:

\[
\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 6} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 possible arrangements of the lamps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of ways to turn on 3 of the 6 lamps. Achieve this by selecting 3 lamps out of 6 to be turned on, regardless of their color or position.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of ways to choose 3 lamps out of 6 to turn on is:

\[
\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 ways to select which 3 lamps are turned on.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of lamp arrangements (completed: 20 arrangements).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of ways to turn on 3 lamps (completed: 20 ways).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the number of favorable arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Find the number of favorable arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of favorable arrangements where the leftmost lamp (position 1) is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp (position 6) is red and on. Achieve this by fixing the colors and states of these positions and calculating the arrangements for the remaining positions and lamp states.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To have the leftmost lamp (position 1) blue and off, and the rightmost lamp (position 6) red and on:  

1. **Fix positions 1 and 6**:  
   - Position 1: Blue and off. There are 3 blue lamps, so we choose 1 to place in position 1 (3 choices).  
   - Position 6: Red and on. There are 3 red lamps, so we choose 1 to place in position 6 (3 choices).  
   - Number of ways to assign lamps to these positions: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).  

2. **Arrange the remaining lamps**:  
   - After placing 1 blue lamp in position 1 and 1 red lamp in position 6, we have 2 blue and 2 red lamps left to place in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
   - The number of ways to arrange 2 red and 2 blue lamps in 4 positions (accounting for identical lamps) is:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{24}{2 \cdot 2} = 6
\]

3. **Assign the on/off states for the remaining lamps**:  
   - We need 3 lamps to be on in total. Position 6 is already on (red), so we need 2 more lamps to be on among the 4 lamps in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
   - Position 1 is off, so we choose 2 of the 4 remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) to be on:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = 6
\]

4. **Total favorable outcomes**:  
   - Combine the choices:  
     - Assigning lamps to positions 1 and 6: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).  
     - Arranging remaining lamps in positions 2–5: \(6\).  
     - Choosing 2 of the 4 remaining positions to be on: \(6\).  
   - Total favorable outcomes: \(9 \times 6 \times 6 = 324\).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of favorable outcomes by ensuring the conditions (leftmost lamp blue and off, rightmost lamp red and on) are correctly accounted for in the combinatorial logic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s verify the favorable outcomes:  
- **Position 1**: Must be blue (3 choices) and off.  
- **Position 6**: Must be red (3 choices) and on.  
- **Remaining 4 positions**: 2 red, 2 blue lamps arranged in \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways.  
- **On/off states**: 3 lamps must be on, with position 6 already on, so choose 2 of the 4 remaining positions to be on (\(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)).  
- Total: \(3 \times 3 \times 6 \times 6 = 324\), which matches our calculation.  
The logic accounts for all constraints correctly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Use the total arrangements (20), total ways to turn on 3 lamps (20), and favorable outcomes (324) to calculate the probability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of lamp arrangements and the number of ways to turn on 3 lamps:  
\[
20 \times 20 = 400
\]

The number of favorable outcomes is 324 (from Step 5). The probability is:

\[
\frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{324}{400} = \frac{81}{100} = 0.81
\]

So, the probability is \(0.81\) or \(\frac{81}{100}\).
