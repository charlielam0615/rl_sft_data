### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the probability that, when Ryan arranges 3 red and 3 blue lava lamps randomly in a row and then randomly turns 3 of them on, the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:  
1. Determine the total number of possible arrangements of the 6 lamps.  
2. Calculate the number of arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and the rightmost lamp is red.  
3. For each valid arrangement, compute the number of ways to turn on 3 lamps such that the leftmost lamp is off and the rightmost lamp is on.  
4. Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total number of possible arrangements of the 6 lamps.  
**How to Achieve**: Since there are 6 lamps (3 red, 3 blue) arranged in a row, and the lamps of the same color are indistinguishable, use the formula for permutations of a multiset: \(\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2!}\), where \(n\) is the total number of lamps, and \(n_1, n_2\) are the counts of each color.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total number of lamps is 6 (3 red + 3 blue). The number of distinct arrangements is given by the number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 for the red lamps (or equivalently for the blue lamps):

\[
\frac{6!}{3! \cdot 3!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 6} = 20
\]

So, there are 20 possible arrangements of the lamps.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of arrangements where the leftmost lamp (position 1) is blue and the rightmost lamp (position 6) is red.  
**How to Achieve**: Fix the leftmost position as a blue lamp and the rightmost position as a red lamp, then arrange the remaining 4 lamps (2 red, 2 blue) in the middle 4 positions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Fix position 1 as blue: There are 3 blue lamps, so 3 choices for position 1.
- Fix position 6 as red: There are 3 red lamps, so 3 choices for position 6.
- After placing a blue lamp in position 1 and a red lamp in position 6, 2 red and 2 blue lamps remain for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- The number of ways to arrange 2 red and 2 blue lamps in these 4 positions is:

\[
\frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{24}{2 \cdot 2} = 6
\]

- Total number of favorable arrangements: \(3 \times 3 \times 6 = 54\).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the number of ways to turn on 3 lamps such that the leftmost lamp is off and the rightmost lamp is on in each valid arrangement.  
**How to Achieve**: For each arrangement where position 1 is blue and position 6 is red, select 3 lamps to turn on from the 6 lamps, ensuring position 1 is off and position 6 is on.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total lamps: 6.
- Turn on 3 lamps, with position 1 (leftmost, blue) off and position 6 (rightmost, red) on.
- Since position 6 must be on, we fix it as one of the 3 lamps turned on.
- Since position 1 must be off, we exclude it from the selection.
- This leaves positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (4 lamps), from which we need to choose 2 more lamps to turn on (since position 6 is already on).
- Number of ways to choose 2 lamps from 4 positions:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = 6
\]

- For each of the 54 favorable arrangements, there are 6 ways to select which lamps are on.
- Total favorable outcomes: \(54 \times 6 = 324\).

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Compute the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.
  - Subgoal 1: Compute total number of arrangements (completed: 20 arrangements).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute number of arrangements with leftmost lamp blue and rightmost lamp red (completed: 54 arrangements).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute number of ways to turn on 3 lamps with leftmost off and rightmost on (completed: 6 ways per arrangement, total 324 favorable outcomes).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability (pending).

**Current Goal**: Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the total number of possible outcomes for turning on 3 lamps.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 lamps out of 6 to turn on, regardless of their color or position.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total lamps: 6.
- Choose 3 lamps to turn on:

\[
\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 3!} = 20
\]

- For each of the 20 arrangements, there are 20 ways to turn on 3 lamps.
- Total number of possible outcomes: \(20 \times 20 = 400\).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the results from previous steps: 324 favorable outcomes and 400 total outcomes.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Favorable outcomes: 324 (from Step 4).
- Total outcomes: 400 (from Step 6).
- Probability:

\[
\frac{324}{400} = \frac{81}{100} = 0.81
\]

The probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on is 0.81.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on is \(\boxed{0.81}\).
