**Problem Restatement**: We have a cube with six positive integers written on its faces. Each of the cube's eight vertices is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to that vertex. The sum of the numbers on the vertices is 1001. We need to find the sum of the numbers written on the faces.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Model the cube's structure, defining the faces and their numbers, and how vertices relate to these numbers.  
2. Express the vertex products mathematically based on the face numbers.  
3. Formulate an equation for the sum of the vertex products equaling 1001.  
4. Determine the relationship between the vertex sum and the face numbers to find the sum of the face numbers.  
5. Solve for the sum of the face numbers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Model the cube's structure and define the vertex products.  
How to Achieve: Assign variables to the numbers on the six faces, identify the three faces adjacent to each vertex, and write the product for each vertex.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Consider a cube with faces labeled as follows:  
- Front: \(a\), Back: \(b\), Left: \(c\), Right: \(d\), Top: \(e\), Bottom: \(f\).  

The cube has eight vertices, each adjacent to three faces. Let’s define the vertices and their corresponding face products:  
- Vertex 1 (Front-Left-Top): \(a \cdot c \cdot e\)  
- Vertex 2 (Front-Left-Bottom): \(a \cdot c \cdot f\)  
- Vertex 3 (Front-Right-Top): \(a \cdot d \cdot e\)  
- Vertex 4 (Front-Right-Bottom): \(a \cdot d \cdot f\)  
- Vertex 5 (Back-Left-Top): \(b \cdot c \cdot e\)  
- Vertex 6 (Back-Left-Bottom): \(b \cdot c \cdot f\)  
- Vertex 7 (Back-Right-Top): \(b \cdot d \cdot e\)  
- Vertex 8 (Back-Right-Bottom): \(b \cdot d \cdot f\)  

The sum of the vertex products is given as:  
\[ (a \cdot c \cdot e) + (a \cdot c \cdot f) + (a \cdot d \cdot e) + (a \cdot d \cdot f) + (b \cdot c \cdot e) + (b \cdot c \cdot f) + (b \cdot d \cdot e) + (b \cdot d \cdot f) = 1001 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the vertex sum equation to relate it to the face numbers.  
How to Achieve: Factor the vertex sum expression to identify patterns that connect the vertex products to the sum of the face numbers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the vertex sum by grouping terms:  
\[ (a \cdot c \cdot e) + (a \cdot c \cdot f) + (a \cdot d \cdot e) + (a \cdot d \cdot f) + (b \cdot c \cdot e) + (b \cdot c \cdot f) + (b \cdot d \cdot e) + (b \cdot d \cdot f) \]  

Factor by pairing terms:  
- Terms with \(a\): \(a \cdot c \cdot e + a \cdot c \cdot f + a \cdot d \cdot e + a \cdot d \cdot f = a \cdot [c \cdot (e + f) + d \cdot (e + f)] = a \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f)\)  
- Terms with \(b\): \(b \cdot c \cdot e + b \cdot c \cdot f + b \cdot d \cdot e + b \cdot d \cdot f = b \cdot [c \cdot (e + f) + d \cdot (e + f)] = b \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f)\)  

Combine:  
\[ [a \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f)] + [b \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f)] = (a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) \]  

Thus, the vertex sum is:  
\[ (a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = 1001 \]  

Notice that the sum of the face numbers is:  
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f \]  
We need to relate this to the vertex sum.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify if the factored vertex sum equation is correct and useful for finding the face sum.  
How to Achieve: Check the factorization by recomputing the vertex sum and ensure it matches the original expression. Assess whether the equation \((a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = 1001\) can lead to the face sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the factorization:  
Expand \((a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f)\):  
- For \(a\): \(a \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = a \cdot (c \cdot e + c \cdot f + d \cdot e + d \cdot f) = (a \cdot c \cdot e) + (a \cdot c \cdot f) + (a \cdot d \cdot e) + (a \cdot d \cdot f)\)  
- For \(b\): \(b \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = (b \cdot c \cdot e) + (b \cdot c \cdot f) + (b \cdot d \cdot e) + (b \cdot d \cdot f)\)  

Summing these gives all eight vertex products, confirming the equation is correct.  

However, \((a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = 1001\) involves sums of pairs of face numbers, not directly the total sum \(a + b + c + d + e + f\). Since 1001 = \(7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), we could hypothesize that \(a + b = 7\), \(c + d = 11\), \(e + f = 13\), but this doesn’t guarantee integer solutions or directly give the total face sum. We need a method to relate the vertex sum to the face sum more directly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backtrack (Planning)  
The current equation \((a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e + f) = 1001\) is correct but doesn’t directly yield the sum of the face numbers. Return to the vertex sum expression and explore an alternative approach to relate it to the face sum, possibly by examining the structure of the products differently.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Re-analyze the vertex sum to find a direct relationship with the sum of the face numbers.  
How to Achieve: Reconsider the vertex sum expression and try to express it in terms of the face numbers by summing contributions of each face across all vertices.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-examine the vertex sum:  
\[ (a \cdot c \cdot e) + (a \cdot c \cdot f) + (a \cdot d \cdot e) + (a \cdot d \cdot f) + (b \cdot c \cdot e) + (b \cdot c \cdot f) + (b \cdot d \cdot e) + (b \cdot d \cdot f) = 1001 \]  

Count how many times each face number appears in the vertex products:  
- Face \(a\) (Front) appears in vertices 1, 2, 3, 4: 4 times.  
- Face \(b\) (Back) appears in vertices 5, 6, 7, 8: 4 times.  
- Face \(c\) (Left) appears in vertices 1, 2, 5, 6: 4 times.  
- Face \(d\) (Right) appears in vertices 3, 4, 7, 8: 4 times.  
- Face \(e\) (Top) appears in vertices 1, 3, 5, 7: 4 times.  
- Face \(f\) (Bottom) appears in vertices 2, 4, 6, 8: 4 times.  

Each face number appears in exactly 4 vertex products, corresponding to the 4 vertices adjacent to each face. Let’s try to express the vertex sum by considering the contribution of each face. Define the product of the other two faces at each vertex. However, a more insightful approach is to consider the geometric mean or a transformation of the variables.

Instead, let’s try a substitution to simplify. Assume the faces are paired as opposites (though not necessarily equal):  
- Let \(s_1 = a + b\), \(s_2 = c + d\), \(s_3 = e + f\).  
From Step 3, we have:  
\[ s_1 \cdot s_2 \cdot s_3 = 1001 \]  

The sum of the face numbers is:  
\[ (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f) = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 \]  

We need \(s_1 + s_2 + s_3\), where \(s_1 \cdot s_2 \cdot s_3 = 1001\). Since 1001 is odd, consider that \(s_1, s_2, s_3\) are positive integers whose product is 1001. Factorize 1001:  
\[ 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \]  

Test if \(s_1 = 7\), \(s_2 = 11\), \(s_3 = 13\) (or any permutation) allows positive integer solutions for \(a, b, c, d, e, f\):  
- \(a + b = 7 \implies a, b \in \{1, 6\}, \{2, 5\}, \{3, 4\}\)  
- \(c + d = 11 \implies c, d \in \{1, 10\}, \{2, 9\}, \{3, 8\}, \{4, 7\}, \{5, 6\}\)  
- \(e + f = 13 \implies e, f \in \{1, 12\}, \{2, 11\}, \{3, 10\}, \{4, 9\}, \{5, 8\}, \{6, 7\}\)  

This is feasible, as we can choose pairs ensuring all are positive integers. The face sum is:  
\[ s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \]  

Let’s verify by constructing an example:  
- \(a = 1, b = 6 \implies a + b = 7\)  
- \(c = 4, d = 7 \implies c + d = 11\)  
- \(e = 5, f = 8 \implies e + f = 13\)  

Compute vertex products:  
- \(a \cdot c \cdot e = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 20\)  
- \(a \cdot c \cdot f = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 32\)  
- \(a \cdot d \cdot e = 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 = 35\)  
- \(a \cdot d \cdot f = 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 56\)  
- \(b \cdot c \cdot e = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)  
- \(b \cdot c \cdot f = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 192\)  
- \(b \cdot d \cdot e = 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 = 210\)  
- \(b \cdot d \cdot f = 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 336\)  

Sum:  
\[ 20 + 32 + 35 + 56 + 120 + 192 + 210 + 336 = 1001 \]  

Face sum:  
\[ 1 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 31 \]  

The solution satisfies the vertex sum condition.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Confirm that the face sum is always 31 for any valid configuration.  
How to Achieve: Test another configuration with \(s_1 \cdot s_2 \cdot s_3 = 1001\) and check if the face sum remains 31. Also, consider if other factorizations of 1001 yield different sums.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Try another configuration:  
- \(a = 3, b = 4 \implies a + b = 7\)  
- \(c = 5, d = 6 \implies c + d = 11\)  
- \(e = 6, f = 7 \implies e + f = 13\)  

Vertex products:  
- \(a \cdot c \cdot e = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 90\)  
- \(a \cdot c \cdot f = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 105\)  
- \(a \cdot d \cdot e = 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 108\)  
- \(a \cdot d \cdot f = 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 126\)  
- \(b \cdot c \cdot e = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120\)  
- \(b \cdot c \cdot f = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 140\)  
- \(b \cdot d \cdot e = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 144\)  
- \(b \cdot d \cdot f = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 168\)  

Sum:  
\[ 90 + 140 + 126 + 356 = 496 \]  
\[ 496 + 108 = 604 \]  
\[ 604 + 120 = 724 \]  
\[ 724 + 144 =868 \]  
\[ 868 + 168 = 1036 \]  
This configuration is incorrect, as the sum is not 1001, suggesting we made a calculation error in the addition. Let's try to recompute carefully:  
Corrected vertex sum:  
\[ 90 + 105 + 108 + 126 + 120 + 140 + 260 + 126 = 386\]  
\[ 386 + 108 + 126 = 620 \]  
\[ 620 + 90 + 105 = 835 \]  
\[ 835 + 120 = 955 \]  
\[ 955 + 140 = 1095\]  
\[ 1095 + 144 = 1239\]  
\[ 1239 + 168 = 1407 \neq 1001\]  

This indicates the vertex sum doesn’t match, so this configuration is invalid. Let’s try adjusting the numbers to satisfy \(s_1 \cdot s_2 = \cdot s_3 = 1001\). Since the first configuration worked, reconsider other factorizations of 1001, e.g., \(s_1 = 1, s_2 = 1, s_3 = 1001\).  

- \(a + b = 1 \implies a = b = 0.5\), not integers.  
- \(s_2 = c + d = 1, s_3 = e + f = 1001\) similarly fails.  

Other factorizations like \(s_1 = 7, s_2 = 11, s_3 = 13\) (same up to permutation) suggest the pairing \(s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\) is unique for integer solutions. The consistent face sum of 31 in the first configuration and the difficulty in finding another valid integer set suggest the sum is likely fixed.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the numbers written on the faces.  
  - Subgoal 1 (Completed): Model the cube’s structure and vertex products.

  - Subgoal (Ongoing): Verify if face sum is always 31.  

Current Goal: Confirm the face sum is 31 for all valid configurations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Conclude the solution by confirming the face sum is 31.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that \((a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), and since face numbers are positive integers, the only factorization giving consistent integer solutions yields \(a + b + c + d + e + f = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \((a + b) \cdot (c + d) \cdot (e) + = f) = 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), and the face sum is \(a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f)\), the face numbers are positive integers, we conclude the sum is:  
\[ + 7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \]  

Final Answer: The sum of the numbers written on the faces is **31**.
