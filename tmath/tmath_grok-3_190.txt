### Problem Statement
We have a cube with six positive integers written on its faces. Each of the eight vertices of the cube is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to that vertex. The sum of the numbers on the vertices is given as 1001. We need to determine the sum of the numbers written on the faces.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Model the cube's structure, identifying the faces and their adjacency to vertices.  
2. Define variables for the face numbers and express vertex products based on these.  
3. Formulate the condition that the sum of vertex products equals 1001.  
4. Solve for the sum of the face numbers using the given condition.  
5. Verify the solution for consistency with the problem constraints.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the cube's structure and define variables for the face numbers, expressing the vertex products based on face adjacencies. This will be achieved by assigning variables to the six faces, identifying which faces are adjacent to each vertex, and setting up equations for the vertex products.

[IMP]  
Consider a cube with six faces. Label the faces as follows:  
- Front: \( A \), Back: \( B \), Left: \( C \), Right: \( D \), Top: \( E \), Bottom: \( F \), where \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are positive integers.  

A cube has eight vertices, and each vertex is adjacent to three faces. Define the vertices based on their coordinates in a 3D system for clarity (e.g., place the cube with vertices at \((\pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1)\)). The vertices and their adjacent faces are:  
1. \( V_1 (1, 1, 1) \): Front (\( A \)), Right (\( D \)), Top (\( E \)) → Product: \( A \cdot D \cdot E \)  
2. \( V_2 (1, 1, -1) \): Front (\( A \)), Right (\( D \)), Bottom (\( F \)) → Product: \( A \cdot D \cdot F \)  
3. \( V_3 (1, -1, 1) \): Front (\( A \)), Left (\( C \)), Top (\( E \)) → Product: \( A \cdot C \cdot E \)  
4. \( V_4 (1, -1, -1) \): Front (\( A \)), Left (\( C \)), Bottom (\( F \)) → Product: \( A \cdot C \cdot F \)  
5. \( V_5 (-1, 1, 1) \): Back (\( B \)), Right (\( D \)), Top (\( E \)) → Product: \( B \cdot D \cdot E \)  
6. \( V_6 (-1, 1, -1) \): Back (\( B \)), Right (\( D \)), Bottom (\( F \)) → Product: \( B \cdot D \cdot F \)  
7. \( V_7 (-1, -1, 1) \): Back (\( B \)), Left (\( C \)), Top (\( E \)) → Product: \( B \cdot C \cdot E \)  
8. \( V_8 (-1, -1, -1) \): Back (\( B \)), Left (\( C \)), Bottom (\( F \)) → Product: \( B \cdot C \cdot F \)  

The sum of the vertex products is given as:  
\[ A \cdot D \cdot E + A \cdot D \cdot F + A \cdot C \cdot E + A \cdot C \cdot F + B \cdot D \cdot E + B \cdot D \cdot F + B \cdot C \cdot E + B \cdot C \cdot F = 1001 \]  

We need to find the sum of the face numbers: \( A + B + C + D + E + F \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the vertex sum equation and explore a method to find the sum of the face numbers. This will be achieved by factoring the vertex sum expression and testing a symmetric case (e.g., all face numbers equal) to see if it satisfies the condition.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the vertex sum by grouping terms:  
\[ A \cdot D \cdot (E + F) + A \cdot C \cdot (E + F) + B \cdot D \cdot (E + F) + B \cdot C \cdot (E + F) = 1001 \]  
Factor out \( (E + F) \):  
\[ (E + F) \cdot (A \cdot D + A \cdot C + B \cdot D + B \cdot C) = 1001 \]  
Now, simplify the second factor:  
\[ A \cdot D + A \cdot C + B \cdot D + B \cdot C = A \cdot (D + C) + B \cdot (D + C) = (A + B) \cdot (C + D) \]  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ (E + F) \cdot (A + B) \cdot (C + D) = 1001 \]  

To find \( A + B + C + D + E + F \), test the symmetric case where all face numbers are equal, i.e., \( A = B = C = D = E = F = x \). Each vertex product becomes \( x \cdot x \cdot x = x^3 \), and with eight vertices:  
\[ 8x^3 = 1001 \]  
Solve for \( x^3 \):  
\[ x^3 = \frac{1001}{8} = 125.125 \]  
Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, \( x^3 = 125.125 \) is not an integer, so the symmetric case does not work directly. However, check if 1001 suggests a pattern. Notice that:  
\[ 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \]  
This suggests the vertex sum may involve products related to these primes, but let’s proceed by testing the factored equation.

Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the six positive integers on the faces of the cube.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the cube’s structure and define vertex products (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Formulate the vertex sum equation as \( (E + F) \cdot (A + B) \cdot (C + D) = 1001 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the sum of face numbers \( A + B + C + D + E + F \) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution for consistency (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Solve for the sum of the face numbers using the equation \( (E + F) \cdot (A + B) \cdot (C + D) = 1001 \).  

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for the sum of the face numbers using the equation \( (E + F) \cdot (A + B) \cdot (C + D) = 1001 \). This will be achieved by assigning values to the pairs \( (A + B) \), \( (C + D) \), and \( (E + F) \) based on the factors of 1001 and computing the face sum.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 1001 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \), the possible factorizations of 1001 into three positive integers (for \( A + B \), \( C + D \), \( E + F \)) are:  
- \( 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1001 = 1001 \)  
- \( 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 143 = 1001 \) (since \( 7 \cdot 143 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \))  
- \( 1 \cdot 11 \cdot 91 = 1001 \) (since \( 11 \cdot 91 = 11 \cdot 7 \cdot 13 \))  
- \( 1 \cdot 13 \cdot 77 = 1001 \) (since \( 13 \cdot 77 = 13 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \))  
- \( 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 1001 \)  

Since \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are positive integers, each pair sum (e.g., \( A + B \)) is at least 2. Thus, exclude cases where any factor is 1. The only valid case is:  
\[ (A + B) = 7, \quad (C + D) = 11, \quad (E + F) = 13 \]  
(or any permutation of these values among the pairs).  

The sum of the face numbers is:  
\[ (A + B) + (C + D) + (E + F) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \]  

Test this configuration. Assign, for example:  
- \( A + B = 7 \) (e.g., \( A = 3, B = 4 \))  
- \( C + D = 11 \) (e.g., \( C = 5, D = 6 \))  
- \( E + F = 13 \) (e.g., \( E = 6, F = 7 \))  

Compute vertex products:  
- \( V_1: A \cdot D \cdot E = 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 108 \)  
- \( V_2: A \cdot D \cdot F = 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 126 \)  
- \( V_3: A \cdot C \cdot E = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 90 \)  
- \( V_4: A \cdot C \cdot F = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 105 \)  
- \( V_5: B \cdot D \cdot E = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 144 \)  
- \( V_6: B \cdot D \cdot F = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 168 \)  
- \( V_7: B \cdot C \cdot E = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120 \)  
- \( V_8: B \cdot C \cdot F = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 140 \)  

Sum of vertex products:  
\[ 108 + 126 + 90 + 105 + 144 + 168 + 120 + 140 = 1001 \]  
This satisfies the condition. The face sum is:  
\[ A + B + C + D + E + F = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 31 \]  

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the face sum of 31 is consistent across different assignments of face numbers satisfying \( (A + B) \cdot (C + D) \cdot (E + F) = 1001 \). This will be achieved by testing another set of face numbers with the same pair sums.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Try another assignment:  
- \( A + B = 7 \) (e.g., \( A = 1, B = 6 \))  
- \( C + D = 11 \) (e.g., \( C = 4, D = 7 \))  
- \( E + F = 13 \) (e.g., \( E = 5, F = 8 \))  

Vertex products:  
- \( V_1: A \cdot D \cdot E = 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 = 35 \)  
- \( V_2: A \cdot D \cdot F = 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \)  
- \( V_3: A \cdot C \cdot E = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \)  
- \( V_4: A \cdot C \cdot F = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 32 \)  
- \( V_5: B \cdot D \cdot E = 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 = 210 \)  
- \( V_6: B \cdot D \cdot F = 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 = 336 \)  
- \( V_7: B \cdot C \cdot E = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120 \)  
- \( V_8: B \cdot C \cdot F = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 192 \)  

Sum:  
\[ 35 + 56 + 20 + 32 + 210 + 336 + 120 + 192 = 1001 \]  
Face sum:  
\[ 1 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 31 \]  

The face sum remains 31, confirming consistency.
