### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the quadratic equation and find the positive difference between the solutions.  
Subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)).  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the two solutions.  
3. Calculate the positive difference between the solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:  
\( x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41 \).  
Subtract \( x + 41 \) from both sides:  
\( x^2 - 3x + 9 - x - 41 = 0 \).  
Simplify:  
\( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \).  
The equation is now in standard form: \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the equation \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \) is correctly derived.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the solutions of the derived equation back into the original equation to check consistency, but first, ensure the derivation is algebraically correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the derivation:  
Original: \( x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41 \).  
Move terms: \( x^2 - 3x + 9 - x - 41 = 0 \).  
Combine like terms:  
- \( x^2 \)-terms: \( x^2 \).  
- \( x \)-terms: \( -3x - x = -4x \).  
- Constants: \( 9 - 41 = -32 \).  
Result: \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \), which matches.  
The derivation is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \) to find the two solutions.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -32 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the quadratic formula:  
\( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = -32 \).  
Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-32) = 16 + 128 = 144 \).  
Solutions:  
\( x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{144}}{2(1)} = \frac{4 \pm 12}{2} \).  
- \( x_1 = \frac{4 + 12}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).  
- \( x_2 = \frac{4 - 12}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \).  
The solutions are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solutions \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \) satisfy the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution into \( x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 8 \):  
Left side: \( 8^2 - 3(8) + 9 = 64 - 24 + 9 = 49 \).  
Right side: \( 8 + 41 = 49 \).  
\( 49 = 49 \), satisfied.  

For \( x = -4 \):  
Left side: \( (-4)^2 - 3(-4) + 9 = 16 + 12 + 9 = 37 \).  
Right side: \( -4 + 41 = 37 \).  
\( 37 = 37 \), satisfied.  

Both solutions are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the positive difference between the solutions \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the absolute difference \( |x_1 - x_2| \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solutions: \( x_1 = 8 \), \( x_2 = -4 \).  
Positive difference: \( |8 - (-4)| = |8 + 4| = 12 \).  
Alternatively: \( |-4 - 8| = |-12| = 12 \).  
The positive difference is 12.  
[/IMP]
