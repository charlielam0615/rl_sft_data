### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the quadratic equation by moving all terms to one side.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation to find the two solutions.  
3. Calculate the positive difference between the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the quadratic equation.  
Description: Move all terms to one side by subtracting \( x + 41 \) from both sides to form a standard quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting with \( x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41 \), subtract \( x + 41 \) from both sides:  
\( x^2 - 3x + 9 - x - 41 = 0 \)  
Combine like terms:  
\( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \)  
The simplified equation is \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \).  
Description: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -32 \), to find the two solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = -32 \).  
Apply the quadratic formula:  
\( x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-32)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 128}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 12}{2} \)  
Calculate the solutions:  
\( x_1 = \frac{4 + 12}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)  
\( x_2 = \frac{4 - 12}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \)  
The solutions are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \).  
Description: Substitute each solution back into the original equation \( x^2 - 3x + 9 = x + 41 \) to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = 8 \):  
Left side: \( 8^2 - 3 \cdot 8 + 9 = 64 - 24 + 9 = 49 \)  
Right side: \( 8 + 41 = 49 \)  
\( 49 = 49 \), so \( x = 8 \) is valid.  

For \( x = -4 \):  
Left side: \( (-4)^2 - 3 \cdot (-4) + 9 = 16 + 12 + 9 = 37 \)  
Right side: \( -4 + 41 = 37 \)  
\( 37 = 37 \), so \( x = -4 \) is valid.  

Both solutions are correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the positive difference between the solutions.  
Description: Find the absolute difference between \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -4 \), ensuring the result is positive.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x_1 = 8 \) and \( x_2 = -4 \).  
Positive difference: \( |8 - (-4)| = |8 + 4| = 12 \)  
Alternatively: \( |(-4) - 8| = |-12| = 12 \)  
The positive difference is 12.

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)
