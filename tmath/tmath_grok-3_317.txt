**Problem Restatement**: The equation \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \) represents the height (in feet) of a ball thrown upwards at 22 feet per second from an initial height of 45 feet. We need to find the time \( t \) (in seconds) when the ball hits the ground, i.e., when \( y = 0 \), and express the answer as a common fraction.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the time when the ball hits the ground, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set the height equation to zero since the ball hits the ground when \( y = 0 \).  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( t \).  
3. Select the positive root that represents the time when the ball hits the ground.  
4. Express the solution as a common fraction.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( -16t^2 + 22t + 45 = 0 \) for \( t \). This can be achieved by applying the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -16 \), \( b = 22 \), and \( c = 45 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the quadratic formula:  
- Coefficients: \( a = -16 \), \( b = 22 \), \( c = 45 \).  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 22^2 - 4(-16)(45) = 484 + 2880 = 3364 \).  
- Square root: \( \sqrt{3364} = 58 \).  
- Solutions:  
  \[
  t = \frac{-22 \pm \sqrt{3364}}{2(-16)} = \frac{-22 \pm 58}{-32}
  \]
- Case 1: \( t = \frac{-22 + 58}{-32} = \frac{36}{-32} = -\frac{9}{8} \) (discard, as time cannot be negative).  
- Case 2: \( t = \frac{-22 - 58}{-32} = \frac{-80}{-32} = \frac{5}{2} \).  
The positive root is \( t = \frac{5}{2} \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) seconds is correct by substituting it into the original equation and checking if \( y = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) into \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \):  
- \( t^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4} \).  
- \( -16t^2 = -16 \cdot \frac{25}{4} = -100 \).  
- \( 22t = 22 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = 55 \).  
- \( y = -100 + 55 + 45 = -100 + 100 = 0 \).  
Since \( y = 0 \), the solution \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) is valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the time when the ball hits the ground (\( y = 0 \)) and express it as a common fraction.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set the equation \( -16t^2 + 22t + 45 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation for \( t \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the positive root.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) as the final answer, as it satisfies the equation and is a common fraction.

**Final Answer**: The ball hits the ground at \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) seconds.  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{5}{2}} \]
