**Problem Restatement**: The equation \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \) represents the height (in feet) of a ball thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 22 feet per second from a height of 45 feet above the ground, where \( t \) is time in seconds. We need to find the time \( t \) when the ball hits the ground (i.e., when \( y = 0 \)) and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the time when the ball hits the ground, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set the height equation to zero (\( y = 0 \)) to represent the ball hitting the ground.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( t \).  
3. Select the positive solution for \( t \) (since time cannot be negative).  
4. Express the solution as a common fraction if necessary.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for when the ball hits the ground. Achieve this by substituting \( y = 0 \) into the given equation \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \), resulting in the quadratic equation \( -16t^2 + 22t + 45 = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set \( y = 0 \):  
\[ -16t^2 + 22t + 45 = 0 \]  
To simplify, multiply through by \(-1\) to make the quadratic coefficient positive:  
\[ 16t^2 - 22t - 45 = 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( 16t^2 - 22t - 45 = 0 \) for \( t \). Achieve this by applying the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 16 \), \( b = -22 \), and \( c = -45 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( 16t^2 - 22t - 45 = 0 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 16 \), \( b = -22 \), \( c = -45 \).  
- Quadratic formula: \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).  
- Compute the discriminant:  
  \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-22)^2 - 4 \cdot 16 \cdot (-45) = 484 + 2880 = 3364 \]  
  \[ \sqrt{3364} = 58 \]  
- Apply the formula:  
  \[ t = \frac{-(-22) \pm 58}{2 \cdot 16} = \frac{22 \pm 58}{32} \]  
- Solutions:  
  \[ t_1 = \frac{22 + 58}{32} = \frac{80}{32} = \frac{5}{2} \]  
  \[ t_2 = \frac{22 - 58}{32} = \frac{-36}{32} = -\frac{9}{8} \]  
Since time cannot be negative, discard \( t = -\frac{9}{8} \). Thus, \( t = \frac{5}{2} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) is correct by substituting it back into the original equation \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \) and checking if \( y = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) into \( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \):  
\[ t = \frac{5}{2}, \quad t^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4} \]  
\[ y = -16 \cdot \frac{25}{4} + 22 \cdot \frac{5}{2} + 45 \]  
\[ = -4 \cdot 25 + 11 \cdot 5 + 45 \]  
\[ = -100 + 55 + 45 \]  
\[ = -100 + 100 = 0 \]  
Since \( y = 0 \), the solution \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) is valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the solution \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) as a common fraction. Since \( \frac{5}{2} \) is already a fraction in its simplest form (5 and 2 have no common factors), this goal is achieved by confirming the format.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The solution \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) is a common fraction, as 5 and 2 are coprime. No further simplification is needed.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The ball hits the ground at \( t = \frac{5}{2} \) seconds.  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{5}{2}} \]
