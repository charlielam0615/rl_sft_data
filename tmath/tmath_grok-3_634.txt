### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to choose 6 starters from a girls' volleyball team of 14 players, where 3 specific players (the triplets Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) must be included in the starting lineup.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the total number of players and the number of starters needed.
2. Account for the constraint that all three triplets must be included in the starting lineup.
3. Determine how many additional players need to be selected.
4. Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining players from the available pool.
5. Compute the total number of combinations.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of ways to choose 6 starters, including the three triplets.

**How to Achieve**: Since Alicia, Amanda, and Anna must be included, select these 3 players first. This leaves 3 more players to be chosen from the remaining players on the team. Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) to calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining players.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The team has 14 players, and we need 6 starters. The triplets (Alicia, Amanda, Anna) must be included, so we select these 3 players automatically, which accounts for 3 of the 6 starter positions.

- Remaining players to choose: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).
- Players left to choose from: \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

We need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 players from the remaining 11 players. The number of combinations is given by:

\[
C(11, 3) = \frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = \frac{11!}{3! \cdot 8!}
\]

Simplify:

\[
C(11, 3) = \frac{11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{990}{6} = 165
\]

Thus, there are 165 ways to choose the remaining 3 players.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the number of ways to choose 6 starters with the triplets included.

**How to Achieve**: Check the logic and arithmetic of the combination calculation, ensuring the total number of players, the constraint, and the formula application are correct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Verify total players and starters**: The problem states there are 14 players, and we need 6 starters, which is consistent with volleyball (6 players on the court).
- **Verify constraint**: We included all 3 triplets, so 3 of the 6 positions are fixed.
- **Verify remaining players**: After selecting the triplets, 11 players remain (\( 14 - 3 = 11 \)), and we need 3 more players (\( 6 - 3 = 3 \)).
- **Verify combination calculation**:
  \[
  C(11, 3) = \frac{11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{990}{6} = 165
  \]
  The arithmetic is correct.
- **Check for additional constraints**: The problem does not mention restrictions like player positions or distinct roles, so the combination calculation is appropriate.

The calculation appears valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Calculate the number of ways to choose 6 starters from 14 players, including the three triplets.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify total players (14) and starters needed (6).
  - Subgoal 2: Account for the triplets (Alicia, Amanda, Anna) in the lineup.
  - Subgoal 3: Determine remaining players to choose (3 players from 11).
  - Subgoal 4: Compute combinations using \( C(11, 3) \).
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the calculation.

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all subgoals were addressed.

All subgoals have been completed, and the calculation \( C(11, 3) = 165 \) aligns with the problem's requirements.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
There are 165 ways to choose 6 starters from the 14 players, with all three triplets (Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) included in the starting lineup.
