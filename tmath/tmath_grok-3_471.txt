### Problem Restatement
When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less each second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop. The car travels 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied. We need to determine the total distance the car travels from the moment the brakes are applied until it stops.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the total distance traveled.  
1. Identify the sequence of distances traveled each second.  
2. Determine how many seconds it takes for the car to stop.  
3. Calculate the total distance by summing the distances traveled each second.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the sequence of distances traveled each second and determine when the car stops. This can be achieved by modeling the distances as an arithmetic sequence, where the first term is 28 feet, and each subsequent term decreases by 7 feet until the distance traveled in a second is 0 or negative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The distance traveled each second forms an arithmetic sequence:
- First second: 28 feet
- Second second: 28 − 7 = 21 feet
- Third second: 21 − 7 = 14 feet
- Fourth second: 14 − 7 = 7 feet
- Fifth second: 7 − 7 = 0 feet

The car stops when the distance traveled in a second is 0 feet, which occurs at the end of the fifth second. Thus, the car travels for 5 seconds, with distances: 28, 21, 14, 7, 0 feet. Since the car stops at the end of the fifth second (when the distance is 0), we include only the first four seconds (28, 21, 14, 7) in the total distance calculation, as the fifth second contributes no distance.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the arithmetic sequence and the stopping condition. Check if the sequence correctly decreases by 7 feet each second and confirm that the car stops when the distance reaches 0 feet.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is: 28, 21, 14, 7, 0.
- Differences: 28 − 21 = 7, 21 − 14 = 7, 14 − 7 = 7, 7 − 0 = 7. The common difference is consistently −7.
- The general term of the sequence is \( a_n = 28 − 7(n − 1) \), where \( n \) is the second number.
- For \( n = 5 \): \( a_5 = 28 − 7(5 − 1) = 28 − 28 = 0 \), confirming the car stops after 5 seconds.
The sequence and stopping condition are valid, as \( a_5 = 0 \) indicates no further distance is traveled.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total distance by summing the distances traveled in the first four seconds (28, 21, 14, 7). This can be achieved by adding the terms or using the arithmetic series sum formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The distances are 28, 21, 14, 7 feet (4 terms).
Using the arithmetic series sum formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \), where \( n = 4 \), \( a_1 = 28 \), \( a_4 = 7 \).
\[ S_4 = \frac{4}{2}(28 + 7) = 2 \cdot 35 = 70 \]
Alternatively, direct addition: \( 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 = 70 \).
The total distance is 70 feet.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Calculate the total distance the car travels until it stops.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the sequence of distances traveled each second (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine when the car stops (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total distance by summing the sequence (completed).
**Current Goal**: Verify the final answer and ensure all subgoals align with the main goal.
The sequence (28, 21, 14, 7) was identified, the stopping condition (0 feet at \( n = 5 \)) was confirmed, and the sum (70 feet) was calculated. All subgoals are complete and consistent with the main goal.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the total distance by rechecking the sum and considering edge cases, such as whether the stopping condition was interpreted correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate the sum: \( 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 = 70 \).
Consider the stopping condition: The problem states the car stops when it travels 0 feet in a second, which occurs at \( n = 5 \). Since no distance is traveled in the fifth second, only the first four terms contribute to the total.  
An alternative approach using the arithmetic series formula with the general term \( a_n = 28 − 7(n − 1) \):
- Sum of first 4 terms: \( S_4 = n \cdot \frac{a_1 + a_4}{2} = 4 \cdot \frac{28 + 7}{2} = 4 \cdot 17.5 = 70 \).
The calculation is consistent. The interpretation that the car stops at the end of the fifth second (when \( a_5 = 0 \)) aligns with the problem, as no additional distance is traveled. The total distance of 70 feet is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The car travels **70 feet** from the time the brakes are applied until it comes to a complete stop.
