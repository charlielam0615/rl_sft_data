**Problem Restatement**: When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less each second than the previous second until it stops. The car travels 28 feet in the first second. We need to determine the total distance the car travels from the time the brakes are applied until it stops.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Model the distance traveled each second as a sequence.  
2. Determine the number of seconds until the car stops.  
3. Calculate the total distance by summing the distances traveled each second.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Model the distance traveled each second and identify the sequence.  
How to Achieve: The car travels 28 feet in the first second, and each subsequent second it travels 7 feet less than the previous second. This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 28, and the common difference is -7.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The distances traveled each second are:  
- 1st second: 28 feet  
- 2nd second: 28 - 7 = 21 feet  
- 3rd second: 21 - 7 = 14 feet  
- 4th second: 14 - 7 = 7 feet  
- 5th second: 7 - 7 = 0 feet (car stops)  
Thus, the sequence is 28, 21, 14, 7, with the car stopping after the 4th second (since the 5th second has 0 distance).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the sequence and stopping condition.  
How to Achieve: Check if the sequence correctly follows the problem's conditions and confirm when the car stops.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence 28, 21, 14, 7 corresponds to:  
- 1st second: 28 feet  
- 2nd second: 28 - 7 = 21 feet  
- 3rd second: 21 - 7 = 14 feet  
- 4th second: 14 - 7 = 7 feet  
- 5th second: 7 - 7 = 0 feet  
This matches the problem's description (7 feet less each second). The car stops in the 5th second since the distance becomes 0, so it travels nonzero distances for 4 seconds.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total distance traveled.  
How to Achieve: Sum the distances in the arithmetic sequence (28, 21, 14, 7) using the arithmetic series formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \), where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term. Alternatively, compute the sum directly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sequence has 4 terms: 28, 21, 14, 7.  
Using the arithmetic series formula:  
- Number of terms \( n = 4 \), first term \( a_1 = 28 \), last term \( a_n = 7 \).  
- Sum \( S_4 = \frac{4}{2} (28 + 7) = 2 \cdot 35 = 70 \).  
Alternatively, direct sum: \( 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 = 70 \).  
Thus, the total distance is 70 feet.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total distance the car travels until it stops.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the distance traveled each second as a sequence (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the number of seconds until the car stops (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total distance by summing the sequence (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, as the total distance (70 feet) has been calculated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The car travels **70 feet** from the time the brakes are applied until it stops.
