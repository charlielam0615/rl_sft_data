**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( f(f(1)) \) for the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(f(1)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(1) \), the value of the function at \( x = 1 \).  
2. Use the result from \( f(1) \) as the input to compute \( f(f(1)) \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(1) \) for \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \):  
\( f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 1 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2 \).  
So, \( f(1) = -2 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(f(1)) \), which is \( f(-2) \), since \( f(1) = -2 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \) and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \):  
\( f(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \).  
So, \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(f(1)) \).  
How to Achieve: Recalculate \( f(1) \) and \( f(f(1)) \) to ensure accuracy and check for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute \( f(1) \):  
\( f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2 \).  
Recompute \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \):  
\( f(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \).  
The results are consistent with previous calculations.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(f(1)) \) for \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) \). (Completed: \( f(1) = -2 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \). (Completed: \( f(-2) = 7 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation. (Completed: Results verified)  
Current Goal: The main goal is complete, with \( f(f(1)) = 7 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(f(1)) = 7 \)
