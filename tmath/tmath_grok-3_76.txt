### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(f(1)) \) where the function is defined as \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \). This requires first computing \( f(1) \), then using that result as the input to compute \( f(f(1)) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(1) \) by substituting \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
2. Use the result of \( f(1) \) as the input to compute \( f(f(1)) \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(1) \). Achieve this by substituting \( x = 1 \) into the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \):  
\[ f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 1 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
So, \( f(1) = -2 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(1)) \), which is \( f(-2) \), since \( f(1) = -2 \). Achieve this by substituting \( x = -2 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \):  
\[ f(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]  
So, \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) = 7 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \( f(f(1)) \). Achieve this by rechecking the calculations for \( f(1) \) and \( f(f(1)) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck \( f(1) \):  
\[ f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2 \]  
Recheck \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \):  
\[ f(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]  
The calculations are consistent and correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(1)) \) where \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) \). (Completed: \( f(1) = -2 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \). (Completed: \( f(-2) = 7 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computations. (Completed: Calculations verified)  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final result, which is \( f(f(1)) = 7 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(f(1)) \) is \( 7 \).
