**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) for \(x\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator \(x + 4\).  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve the simplified equation for \(x\).  
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they are valid.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to eliminate the fraction in \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\). This can be achieved by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(x + 4\) to clear the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Multiply both sides of the equation by \(x + 4\):  
\[
(x + 4) \cdot \frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = (x + 5) \cdot (x + 4)
\]
This simplifies to:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation \(x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)\). This can be achieved by expanding the right-hand side and bringing all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
(x + 5)(x + 4) = x^2 + 4x + 5x + 20 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
So the equation becomes:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
Subtract \(x^2 + 9x + 20\) from both sides:  
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 3) - (x^2 + 9x + 20) = 0
\]
Simplify:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - x^2 - 9x - 20 = 0
\]
\[
(2x - 9x) + (3 - 20) = 0
\]
\[
-7x - 17 = 0
\]
Solve for \(x\):  
\[
-7x = 17 \implies x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal and to check for any restrictions (e.g., denominator not equal to zero).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) into the original equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\).  
First, check the denominator:  
\[
x + 4 = -\frac{17}{7} + 4 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{28}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \neq 0
\]
The denominator is non-zero, so the solution is valid with respect to the denominator.  
Now compute the left-hand side:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = \left(-\frac{17}{7}\right)^2 + 2\left(-\frac{17}{7}\right) + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{34}{7} + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{238}{49} + \frac{147}{49} = \frac{289 - 238 + 147}{49} = \frac{198}{49} = \frac{66}{7}
\]
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = \frac{\frac{66}{7}}{\frac{11}{7}} = \frac{66}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{11} = \frac{66}{11} = 6
\]
Right-hand side:  
\[
x + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{35}{7} = \frac{18}{7} \approx 2.571
\]
Since \(\frac{66}{11} = 6 \neq \frac{18}{7}\), the solution does not satisfy the equation. This suggests a need to review the steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
Return to the simplification step (Step 3) to check for errors in the algebraic manipulation, as the validation step indicated the solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) is incorrect.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to re-simplify the equation \(x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)\) correctly, ensuring accurate algebraic manipulation to form the correct quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the expansion and simplification:  
\[
(x + 5)(x + 4) = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
Equation:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
Move all terms to one side:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - x^2 - 9x - 20 = 0
\]
\[
(2x - 9x) + (3 - 20) = 0
\]
\[
-7x - 17 = 0
\]
\[
-7x = 17 \implies x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
The calculation appears consistent with Step 3, suggesting the error may be in the validation step or that the equation has no real solutions. Let’s try an alternative approach by multiplying through by \(x + 4\) again and solving differently to confirm.  
Alternative approach: Move all terms to one side in the original equation:  
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} - (x + 5) = 0
\]
Common denominator is \(x + 4\):  
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3 - (x + 5)(x + 4)}{x + 4} = 0
\]
Numerator:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - (x^2 + 9x + 20) = x^2 + 2x + 3 - x^2 - 9x - 20 = -7x - 17
\]
Equation:  
\[
\frac{-7x - 17}{x + 4} = 0
\]
Since the denominator \(x + 4 \neq 0\), the numerator must be zero:  
\[
-7x - 17 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
This matches the previous result, indicating consistency in the algebraic solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to re-validate the solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) by substituting into the original equation, computing each side carefully to identify any discrepancies.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\):  
Left-hand side:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = \left(-\frac{17}{7}\right)^2 + 2\left(-\frac{17}{7}\right) + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{34}{7} + \frac{147}{49} = \frac{289 - 238 + 147}{49} = \frac{198}{49} = \frac{66}{7}
\]
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = \frac{\frac{66}{7}}{\frac{11}{7}} = \frac{66}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{11} = 6
\]
Right-hand side:  
\[
x + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{35}{7} = \frac{18}{7} \approx 2.571
\]
Again, \(6 \neq \frac{18}{7}\). To explore further, test if the equation holds for any \(x\). Try another approach by assuming the equation has no solutions unless both sides can be made equal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
List all goals in a nested format, reflecting updates, and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Solve \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) for \(x\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the fraction by multiplying by \(x + 4\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the resulting equation.  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the simplified equation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solutions.  
  - Subgoal 5 (adjusted): Investigate if the equation has no solutions due to validation failure.  
**Current goal**: Investigate if the equation has no real solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy shows we’ve attempted to solve the equation through algebraic manipulation, consistently arriving at \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\), but validation shows this does not satisfy the original equation. This suggests the equation may have no real solutions, as the left-hand side (a rational function) and right-hand side (a linear function) do not equate at the computed \(x\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine if the equation has no real solutions by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} - (x + 5)\) and checking if it equals zero for any real \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Define:  
\[
f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} - (x + 5)
\]
Set \(f(x) = 0\):  
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3 - (x + 5)(x + 4)}{x + 4} = 0
\]
Numerator:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - (x^2 + 9x + 20) = -7x - 17
\]
So:  
\[
\frac{-7x - 17}{x + 4} = 0
\]
\[
-7x - 17 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
Since validation repeatedly fails, consider the equation graphically or analytically. Equate the original functions:  
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5
\]
Cross-multiply:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)
\]
This leads to \(-7x - 17 = 0\), which we’ve solved. Instead, analyze the function \(f(x)\):  
\[
f(x) = \frac{-7x - 17}{x + 4}
\]
For \(f(x) = 0\), the numerator must be zero, and we’ve computed \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\), but substitution fails. Test the behavior of \(f(x)\):  
- At \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\), the numerator is zero, but substitution into the original equation doesn’t hold, suggesting a possible inconsistency.  
- Check the limit as \(x \to -4\) (denominator zero): The function has a vertical asymptote, not a solution.  
Since algebraic and substitution methods consistently show no valid solutions, the equation likely has no real roots.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the equation has no real solutions by testing additional points or analyzing the function’s behavior to ensure no other roots exist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test additional points to confirm:  
- For \(x = 0\):  
\[
\text{Left: } \frac{0 + 0 + 3}{0 + 4} = \frac{3}{4}, \quad \text{Right: } 0 + 5 = 5 \quad (\neq)
\]
- For \(x = 1\):  
\[
\text{Left: } \frac{1 + 2 + 3}{1 + 4} = \frac{6}{5}, \quad \text{Right: } 1 + 5 = 6 \quad (\neq)
\]
The functions diverge. Graphically, \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4}\) is a rational function with a horizontal asymptote (since the numerator degree equals the denominator degree plus one), while \(x + 5\) is linear. Their intersection would be at most one point (since the numerator becomes linear after simplification), but validation shows no such point satisfies the original equation. Thus, there are no real solutions.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) has no real solutions.
