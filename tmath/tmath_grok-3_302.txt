**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) for \(x\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(x + 4\).
2. Simplify the resulting equation.
3. Solve the simplified equation for \(x\).
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they are valid (e.g., no division by zero).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Eliminate the denominator.
Description: Multiply both sides of the equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) by \(x + 4\) to clear the fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply both sides by \(x + 4\):
\[
(x + 4) \cdot \frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = (x + 5) \cdot (x + 4)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the resulting equation.
Description: Expand the right-hand side \((x + 5)(x + 4)\), bring all terms to one side, and combine like terms to form a quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the right-hand side:
\[
(x + 5)(x + 4) = x^2 + 4x + 5x + 20 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
Subtract \(x^2\) from both sides:
\[
2x + 3 = 9x + 20
\]
Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:
\[
3 = 7x + 20
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
-17 = 7x
\]
Divide by 7:
\[
x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution.
Description: Substitute \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) into the original equation to check if it holds and ensure the denominator \(x + 4 \neq 0\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) into the left-hand side:
\[
x + 4 = -\frac{17}{7} + 4 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{28}{7} = \frac{11}{7}
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = \left(-\frac{17}{7}\right)^2 + 2\left(-\frac{17}{7}\right) + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{34}{7} + 3 = \frac{289 - 238 + 147}{49} = \frac{198}{49} = \frac{99}{49}
\]
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = \frac{\frac{99}{49}}{\frac{11}{7}} = \frac{99}{49} \cdot \frac{7}{11} = \frac{99 \cdot 7}{49 \cdot 11} = \frac{9 \cdot 7}{7 \cdot 7} = \frac{9}{7}
\]
Right-hand side:
\[
x + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{35}{7} = \frac{18}{7}
\]
Since \(\frac{9}{7} \neq \frac{18}{7}\), the solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) does not satisfy the equation.

Check the denominator:
\[
x + 4 = \frac{11}{7} \neq 0
\]
The denominator is valid, but the solution is incorrect.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Backtrack (Planning)
Since the solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) is invalid, return to the simplification step (Step 3) and re-evaluate the equation to identify any errors or consider alternative approaches.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Re-simplify the equation correctly.
Description: Reconsider the equation \(x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20\) from Step 2, carefully simplify it again, and solve for \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]
Move all terms to one side:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - x^2 - 9x - 20 = 0
\]
Simplify:
\[
(2x - 9x) + (3 - 20) = -7x - 17 = 0
\]
\[
-7x - 17 = 0
\]
\[
7x = -17
\]
\[
x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]
This matches the previous solution, indicating a potential issue. Letâ€™s try an alternative approach to avoid errors. Multiply both sides of the original equation again and simplify differently:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)
\]
Expand and move all terms to one side:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - (x^2 + 9x + 20) = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 - x^2 - 9x - 20 = -7x - 17 = 0
\]
This confirms the previous calculation. The solution \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) persists, suggesting the need to re-verify or consider if no solutions exist.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Re-verify the solution and explore alternative possibilities.
Description: Substitute \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) again carefully, and if it fails, test other values or analyze the equation to determine if it has no solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the left-hand side with \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\):
\[
x^2 = \left(-\frac{17}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{289}{49}
\]
\[
2x = 2 \cdot -\frac{17}{7} = -\frac{34}{7}
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{34}{7} + 3 = \frac{289}{49} - \frac{238}{49} + \frac{147}{49} = \frac{289 - 238 + 147}{49} = \frac{198}{49}
\]
\[
x + 4 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{28}{7} = \frac{11}{7}
\]
\[
\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = \frac{\frac{198}{49}}{\frac{11}{7}} = \frac{198}{49} \cdot \frac{7}{11} = \frac{198 \cdot 7}{49 \cdot 11} = \frac{18}{7}
\]
Right-hand side:
\[
x + 5 = -\frac{17}{7} + \frac{35}{7} = \frac{18}{7}
\]
Now, \(\frac{18}{7} = \frac{18}{7}\), so \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) satisfies the equation. The earlier verification error in Step 4 was due to a computational mistake.

Check the denominator:
\[
x + 4 = \frac{11}{7} \neq 0
\]
The solution is valid.
