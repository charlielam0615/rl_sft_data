1. Solve the system of equations to find the point of intersection.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the expression for $ y $ from the first equation into the second equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first equation is $ y = 4x - 19 $.  

Substitute $ y = 4x - 19 $ into the second equation $ 2x + y = 95 $:  

$$
2x + (4x - 19) = 95
$$  

Simplify the left-hand side:  

$$
2x + 4x - 19 = 95
$$  

$$
6x - 19 = 95
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ x $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting from the simplified equation:  

$$
6x - 19 = 95
$$

Add 19 to both sides to isolate the term with $ x $:  

$$
6x = 95 + 19
$$

$$
6x = 114
$$

Now divide both sides by 6 to solve for $ x $:  

$$
x = \frac{114}{6}
$$

$$
x = 19
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the solution x = 19 by substituting it back into both original equations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Substitute x = 19 into the first equation y = 4x - 19:
   y = 4(19) - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57
   Resulting in the point (19, 57)

2. Verify this point satisfies the second equation 2x + y = 95:
   2(19) + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95
   LHS = RHS (95 = 95), which is valid.

3. Re-check algebraic steps:
   - Substitution: 2x + (4x - 19) = 95 → 6x - 19 = 95 (correct)
   - Solving: 6x = 95 + 19 → 6x = 114 → x = 114/6 = 19 (correct)

All checks confirm the solution is consistent across both equations and calculations are accurate. No contradictions or errors detected.
