### Problem Statement
We need to find all integer solutions to the inequality \(1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25\) and compute their sum.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the inequality and find the sum of integer solutions:  
1. Solve the inequality \(1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25\) to find all real solutions for \(x\).  
2. Identify the integer solutions within the solution set.  
3. Sum the integer solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality \(1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25\) to find all real solutions for \(x\).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the square root of all parts of the inequality, considering both positive and negative roots, and solve for \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25\):  
- The inequality implies \((x - 2)^2 > 1\) and \((x - 2)^2 < 25\).  
- For \((x - 2)^2 > 1\), take the square root: \(|x - 2| > 1\). This gives \(x - 2 > 1\) or \(x - 2 < -1\), so \(x > 3\) or \(x < 1\).  
- For \((x - 2)^2 < 25\), take the square root: \(|x - 2| < 5\). This gives \(-5 < x - 2 < 5\), so \(-3 < x < 7\).  
- Combine the inequalities:  
  - From \(x > 3\) and \(-3 < x < 7\), we get \(3 < x < 7\).  
  - From \(x < 1\) and \(-3 < x < 7\), we get \(-3 < x < 1\).  
- Thus, the solution is \(-3 < x < 1\) or \(3 < x < 7\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the integer solutions within the intervals \(-3 < x < 1\) and \(3 < x < 7\).  
**How to Achieve**: List all integers strictly between \(-3\) and \(1\), and between \(3\) and \(7\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \(-3 < x < 1\): The integers are \(-2, -1, 0\).  
- For \(3 < x < 7\): The integers are \(4, 5, 6\).  
- Combined integer solutions: \{-2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6\}.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the integers \{-2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6\} satisfy the inequality \(1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25\).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each integer into the inequality and check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check each integer:  
- For \(x = -2\): \((-2 - 2)^2 = 16\). Since \(1 < 16 < 25\), valid.  
- For \(x = -1\): \((-1 - 2)^2 = 9\). Since \(1 < 9 < 25\), valid.  
- For \(x = 0\): \((0 - 2)^2 = 4\). Since \(1 < 4 < 25\), valid.  
- For \(x = 4\): \((4 - 2)^2 = 4\). Since \(1 < 4 < 25\), valid.  
- For \(x = 5\): \((5 - 2)^2 = 9\). Since \(1 < 9 < 25\), valid.  
- For \(x = 6\): \((6 - 2)^2 = 16\). Since \(1 < 16 < 25\), valid.  
- Check boundary integers:  
  - For \(x = -3\): \((-3 - 2)^2 = 25\). Since \(25 \not< 25\), invalid.  
  - For \(x = 1\): \((1 - 2)^2 = 1\). Since \(1 \not> 1\), invalid.  
  - For \(x = 3\): \((3 - 2)^2 = 1\). Since \(1 \not> 1\), invalid.  
  - For \(x = 7\): \((7 - 2)^2 = 25\). Since \(25 \not< 25\), invalid.  
All listed integers satisfy the inequality, and boundary values do not.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the integer solutions \{-2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6\}.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the integers together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum: \(-2 + (-1) + 0 + 4 + 5 + 6 = -2 - 1 + 0 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 12\).
