### Problem Statement
We need to find all integer solutions \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \) and compute their sum.

---

### Step 1
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break the problem into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Solve the inequality \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \) to find all real solutions.  
2. Identify the integer solutions within the solution set.  
3. Sum the integer solutions.  

---

### Step 2
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \) for all real \( x \).  
To achieve this, take the square root of all parts of the inequality, considering the properties of the square root function, and solve the resulting inequalities.

**[IMP]**  
Start with \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \).  
Since \( (x - 2)^2 \) is a non-negative expression, we can take the square root:  
- For \( (x - 2)^2 > 1 \), we have \( |x - 2| > 1 \).  
- For \( (x - 2)^2 < 25 \), we have \( |x - 2| < 5 \).  

Thus, the inequality becomes:  
\[ 1 < |x - 2| < 5 \]  

Solve \( |x - 2| < 5 \):  
\[ -5 < x - 2 < 5 \]  
Add 2\):  
\[ -3 < x < 7 \]  

Solve \( |x - 2| > 1 \):  
\[ x - 2 < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 > 1 \]  
\[ x < 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 3 \]  

Combine the two conditions:  
\[ (-3 < x < 7) \cap (x < 1 \cup x > 3) \]  

Break the intersection into two cases:  
- Case 1: \( -3 < x < 7 \) and \( x < 1 \):  
  \[ -3 < x < 1 \]  
- Case 2: \( -3 < x < 7 \) and \( x > 3 \):  
  \[ 3 < x < 7 \]  

Thus, the solution set is:  
\[ x \in (-3, 1) \cup (3, 7) \]  

---

### Step 3
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all integer solutions \( x \) within the interval \( (-3, 1) \cup (3, 7) \).  
To achieve this, list all integers in the open intervals \( (-3, 1) \) and \( (3, 7) \).

**[IMP]**  
- For \( -3 < x < 1 \): The integers are \( -2, -1, 0 \).  
- For \( 3 < x < 7 \): The integers are \( 4, 5, 6 \).  

Thus, the integer solutions are: \( -2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6 \).

---

### Step 4
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the integers \( -2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6 \) satisfy \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \).  
To achieve this, compute \( (x - 2)^2 \) for each integer and check if it lies between 1 and 25.

**[IMP]**  
Compute \( (x - 2)^2 \) for each integer:  
- \( x = -2 \): \( (-2 - 2)^2 = 16 \), \( 1 < 16 < 25 \), valid.  
- \( x = -1 \): \( (-1 - 2)^2 = 9 \), \( 1 < 9 < 25 \), valid.  
- \( x = 0 \): \( (0 - 2)^2 = 4 \), \( 1 < 4 < 25 \), valid.  
- \( x = 4 \): \( (4 - 2)^2 = 4 \), \( 1 < 4 < 25 \), valid.  
- \( x = 5 \): \( (5 - 2)^2 = 9 \), \( 1 < 9 < 25 \), valid.  
- \( x = 6 \): \( (6 - 2)^2 = 16 \), \( 1 < 16 < 25 \), valid.  

All integers satisfy the inequality.

### Step 5
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the integer solutions \( -2, -1, 0, 4, 5, 6 \).  
To achieve this, add the integers together.

**[IMP]**  
Sum:  
\[ -2 + (-1) + 0 + 4 + 5 + 6 = (-2 - 1) + (4 + 5 + 6) = -3 + 15 = 12 \]

---

### Step 6
**[PLANNING]**  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.

**[REVIEW]**  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all integer solutions to \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality for real solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify integer solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the integer solutions (completed).  

**Current goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
The sum of the integer solutions is 12, which addresses the main goal.

---

### Final Answer
The sum of all integer solutions to \( 1 < (x - 2)^2 < 25 \) is \( 12 \).
