Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 1 $ into the operation $ a \oplus b = 3a + 4b $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 1 $ into the expression $ 3a + 4b $:  
$$
3a + 4b = 3(3) + 4(1).
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Perform the calculation $3(3) + 4(1)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Calculate each term:  
$$
3(3) = 9, \quad 4(1) = 4.
$$  
Add the results:  
$$
9 + 4 = 13.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the arithmetic operations and substitution in the solution.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Re-express the operation definition: By problem statement, $ a \oplus b = 3a + 4b $. This is a linear combination where the coefficient of $ a $ is 3 and the coefficient of $ b $ is 4.

2. Verify substitution: For $ 3 \oplus 1 $, $ a = 3 $ and $ b = 1 $. Substituting into $ 3a + 4b $:
   - First term: $ 3 \times 3 = 9 $
   - Second term: $ 4 \times 1 = 4 $

3. Verify arithmetic: $ 9 + 4 = 13 $. Both multiplication and addition steps align with standard arithmetic rules.

4. Cross-check against alternative interpretations:
   - If the operation were $ 3b + 4a $, the result would be $ 3(1) + 4(3) = 3 + 12 = 15 $, but this contradicts the problem's definition.
   - No parentheses or operator precedence rules affect the calculation since multiplication is explicitly defined with coefficients.

5. Conclusion: All steps adhere strictly to the problem's definition and mathematical rules. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
