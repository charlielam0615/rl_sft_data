**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of $x$-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$. The $x$-intercepts occur where $y = 0$, so we need to solve for $x$ when $y = 0$ and analyze if real solutions exist. Since the equation is given with $x$ as a function of $y$, we also need to consider whether the parabola opens horizontally and how this affects the number of $x$-intercepts.

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the number of $x$-intercepts into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation to find potential $x$-intercepts.  
2. Analyze the equation to determine if it yields real solutions.  
3. Consider the parabola’s orientation (since $x$ is expressed in terms of $y$) to confirm the nature of the intercepts.  
4. Determine the number of $x$-intercepts based on the results.

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the $x$-intercepts by substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$. This will give the $x$-values where the parabola intersects the $x$-axis.

Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation:  
$x = -2(0)^2 + 0 + 1 = 1$.  
This yields $x = 1$. Thus, there is one potential $x$-intercept at $(1, 0)$.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether $x = 1$ is the only $x$-intercept and confirm the parabola’s behavior. Since the equation expresses $x$ in terms of $y$, check if the parabola opens horizontally and whether multiple $y$-values could yield the same $x$-value, affecting the number of intercepts.

The equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$ is a parabola in the form $x = ay^2 + by + c$, which opens horizontally (leftward since $a = -2 < 0$). To find $x$-intercepts, we only need points where $y = 0$, which we computed as $x = 1$. To ensure no other $x$-intercepts exist, note that substituting $y = 0$ gives a single $x$-value, as it’s a linear evaluation at a specific point. However, let’s explore the parabola’s vertex to understand its shape and confirm the number of intercepts.  

Rewrite the equation by completing the square:  
$x = -2y^2 + y + 1 = -2\left(y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y\right) + 1$.  
Inside the parentheses: $y^2 - \frac{1}{2}y = \left(y - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{16}$.  
Thus, $x = -2\left(\left(y - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{16}\right) + 1 = -2\left(y - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \frac{2}{16} + 1 = -2\left(y - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \frac{9}{8}$.  

The vertex is at $\left(\frac{9}{8}, \frac{1}{4}\right)$. Since the parabola opens leftward (due to the negative coefficient), and the vertex has $x = \frac{9}{8} \approx 1.125$, the parabola reaches its rightmost point at $x = \frac{9}{8}$ and curves leftward. At $y = 0$, $x = 1$, which is to the left of the vertex. As $y$ moves away from $0$, the quadratic term $-2y^2$ ensures $x$ decreases, suggesting a single crossing of the $x$-axis at $x = 1$.  

To confirm, consider solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ to check the number of $y$-values for a given $x$:  
$-2y^2 + y + 1 = x \implies -2y^2 + y + (1 - x) = 0$.  
Multiply by $-1$ for simplicity: $2y^2 - y + (x - 1) = 0$.  
The discriminant for $y$ is: $\Delta = (-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (x - 1) = 1 - 8(x - 1) = 9 - 8x$.  
For real $y$, $\Delta \geq 0 \implies 9 - 8x \geq 0 \implies x \leq \frac{9}{8}$. At $x = 1$, $\Delta = 9 - 8 = 1$, so there are two real $y$-roots (but we already know $y = 0$ is one; we need to check if others yield $y = 0$). Solving the quadratic at $x = 1$:  
$2y^2 - y = 0 \implies y(2y - 1) = 0 \implies y = 0, \frac{1}{2}$.  
Check $y = \frac{1}{2}$: $x = -2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = -2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 1$.  
Both $y = 0$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}$ yield $x = 1$, indicating the parabola is tangent to the line $x = 1$ at these points, but since we’re counting distinct $x$-values, there’s still only one $x$-intercept.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude the number of $x$-intercepts based on the findings that $y = 0$ gives $x = 1$, and the parabola’s structure suggests a single distinct $x$-value at the intercept.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From previous steps, substituting $y = 0$ yields $x = 1$. The parabola, opening leftward with vertex at $x = \frac{9}{8}$, intersects the $x$-axis at $x = 1$. The discriminant analysis and verification at $x = 1$ show that both $y = 0$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}$ produce $x = 1$, but these correspond to the same $x$-coordinate. Since $x$-intercepts are counted by distinct $x$-values, there is exactly one $x$-intercept.  

**Final Answer**: The parabola has **1 $x$-intercept**.
