### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of $x$-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$. The $x$-intercepts occur where the graph crosses the x-axis, i.e., where $x$ is expressed as a function of $y$, and we need to find the values of $y$ that make $x = 0$. This requires solving the equation $-2y^2 + y + 1 = 0$ and determining the number of real solutions for $y$.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$ equal to zero and solve for $y$. This involves forming the quadratic equation $-2y^2 + y + 1 = 0$ and finding its roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Set $x = 0$ in the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$:  
\[
-2y^2 + y + 1 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in $y$ of the form $ay^2 + by + c = 0$, where $a = -2$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$. To solve, we will use the quadratic formula in the next step.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation $-2y^2 + y + 1 = 0$ for $y$ using the quadratic formula and compute the discriminant to determine the number of real roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a quadratic equation $ay^2 + by + c = 0$, the roots are given by:
\[
y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, $a = -2$, $b = 1$, $c = 1$. First, compute the discriminant:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(-2)(1) = 1 - (-8) = 1 + 8 = 9
\]
Since $\Delta = 9 > 0$, there are two distinct real roots. To find the roots:
\[
y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2(-2)} = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{-4}
\]
Calculate the two solutions:
\[
y_1 = \frac{-1 + 3}{-4} = \frac{2}{-4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
y_2 = \frac{-1 - 3}{-4} = \frac{-4}{-4} = 1
\]
The solutions are $y = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $y = 1$.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the solutions $y = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $y = 1$ are correct by substituting them back into the equation $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$ to confirm $x = 0$.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute $y = -\frac{1}{2}$:
\[
x = -2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0
\]
Substitute $y = 1$:
\[
x = -2(1)^2 + 1 + 1 = -2 + 1 + 1 = -2 + 2 = 0
\]
Both values satisfy $x = 0$, confirming the roots are correct.

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude the number of $x$-intercepts based on the two real $y$-solutions found.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the equation $-2y^2 + y + 1 = 0$ has two distinct real roots ($y = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $y = 1$), the parabola $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$ intersects the x-axis at two points. Thus, there are **two $x$-intercepts**.

### Final Answer
The parabola $x = -2y^2 + y + 1$ has **two $x$-intercepts**.
