**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the maximum area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 30 units and whole-number dimensions.  
1. Define the relationship between perimeter, length, and width.  
2. Express the area in terms of length and width.  
3. Identify all possible whole-number dimensions that satisfy the perimeter constraint.  
4. Calculate the area for each valid pair of dimensions.  
5. Determine the maximum area from the calculated areas.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the relationship between perimeter, length, and width, and express the area in terms of these variables. This will be achieved by using the perimeter formula for a rectangle and the area formula, setting up equations based on the given perimeter of 30 units.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a rectangle, the perimeter \( P \) is given by \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width. Given \( P = 30 \), we have:  
\[ 2(l + w) = 30 \]  
\[ l + w = 15 \]  
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:  
\[ A = l \cdot w \]  
Since \( l + w = 15 \), we can express \( w = 15 - l \). Substituting into the area formula:  
\[ A = l \cdot (15 - l) \]  
\[ A = 15l - l^2 \]  
This quadratic equation will help us compute the area for valid values of \( l \) and \( w \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all possible whole-number dimensions (length and width) that satisfy \( l + w = 15 \), ensuring both are positive integers. This will be achieved by solving for integer pairs \( (l, w) \) where \( l + w = 15 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( l + w = 15 \), we need whole-number pairs \( (l, w) \) where both \( l \) and \( w \) are positive integers (since a rectangle cannot have zero or negative dimensions). Possible values for \( l \) range from 1 to 14 (if \( l = 15 \), then \( w = 0 \), which is invalid). The pairs are:  
- \( l = 1 \), \( w = 15 - 1 = 14 \): \( (1, 14) \)  
- \( l = 2 \), \( w = 15 - 2 = 13 \): \( (2, 13) \)  
- \( l = 3 \), \( w = 15 - 3 = 12 \): \( (3, 12) \)  
- \( l = 4 \), \( w = 15 - 4 = 11 \): \( (4, 11) \)  
- \( l = 5 \), \( w = 15 - 5 = 10 \): \( (5, 10) \)  
- \( l = 6 \), \( w = 15 - 6 = 9 \): \( (6, 9) \)  
- \( l = 7 \), \( w = 15 - 7 = 8 \): \( (7, 8) \)  
- \( l = 8 \), \( w = 15 - 8 = 7 \): \( (8, 7) \)  
- \( l = 9 \), \( w = 15 - 9 = 6 \): \( (9, 6) \)  
- \( l = 10 \), \( w = 15 - 10 = 5 \): \( (10, 5) \)  
- \( l = 11 \), \( w = 15 - 11 = 4 \): \( (11, 4) \)  
- \( l = 12 \), \( w = 15 - 12 = 3 \): \( (12, 3) \)  
- \( l = 13 \), \( w = 15 - 13 = 2 \): \( (13, 2) \)  
- \( l = 14 \), \( w = 15 - 14 = 1 \): \( (14, 1) \)  
These pairs cover all valid whole-number dimensions, noting that pairs like \( (1, 14) \) and \( (14, 1) \) represent the same rectangle rotated.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the area for each valid pair of dimensions and identify the maximum area. This will be achieved by computing \( A = l \cdot w \) for each pair and comparing the results.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the pairs from Step 3, calculate the area \( A = l \cdot w \):  
- \( (1, 14) \): \( 1 \cdot 14 = 14 \)  
- \( (2, 13) \): \( 2 \cdot 13 = 26 \)  
- \( (3, 12) \): \( 3 \cdot 12 = 36 \)  
- \( (4, 11) \): \( 4 \cdot 11 = 44 \)  
- \( (5, 10) \): \( 5 \cdot 10 = 50 \)  
- \( (6, 9) \): \( 6 \cdot 9 = 54 \)  
- \( (7, 8) \): \( 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \)  
- \( (8, 7) \): \( 8 \cdot 7 = 56 \)  
- \( (9, 6) \): \( 9 \cdot 6 = 54 \)  
- \( (10, 5) \): \( 10 \cdot 5 = 50 \)  
- \( (11, 4) \): \( 11 \cdot 4 = 44 \)  
- \( (12, 3) \): \( 12 \cdot 3 = 36 \)  
- \( (13, 2) \): \( 13 \cdot 2 = 26 \)  
- \( (14, 1) \): \( 14 \cdot 1 = 14 \)  
The areas are: 14, 26, 36, 44, 50, 54, 56, 56, 54, 50, 44, 36, 26, 14. The maximum area is 56 square units, achieved when \( (l, w) = (7, 8) \) or \( (8, 7) \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the maximum area of 56 square units is correct by checking the calculations and considering an alternative approach to confirm the result. This will be achieved by re-evaluating the area formula and testing the dimensions analytically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, consider the area formula \( A = l \cdot (15 - l) \), which is a quadratic function:  
\[ A = 15l - l^2 \]  
\[ A = -l^2 + 15l \]  
This is a parabola opening downward, with its vertex at the maximum. The vertex of a quadratic \( A = al^2 + bl + c \) occurs at \( l = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \), \( b = 15 \), so:  
\[ l = -\frac{15}{2 \cdot (-1)} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \]  
Since \( l \) must be a whole number, test \( l = 7 \) and \( l = 8 \):  
- For \( l = 7 \): \( w = 15 - 7 = 8 \), \( A = 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \)  
- For \( l = 8 \): \( w = 15 - 8 = 7 \), \( A = 8 \cdot 7 = 56 \)  
The vertex at \( l = 7.5 \) suggests the maximum occurs between 7 and 8, and since both yield 56, this confirms the maximum area. Additionally, the perimeter for \( (7, 8) \) is \( 2(7 + 8) = 30 \), satisfying the constraint. The calculations from Step 4 align with this, confirming 56 square units as the maximum area.
