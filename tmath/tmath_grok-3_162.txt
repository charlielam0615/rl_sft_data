### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the maximum area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 30 units and whole-number dimensions, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Express the perimeter to relate length and width.  
2. Derive possible whole-number dimensions.  
3. Calculate the area for each pair of dimensions.  
4. Identify the pair that maximizes the area.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the perimeter to relate length and width.  
Description: Use the perimeter formula for a rectangle, \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width, and solve for one variable given \( P = 30 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a rectangle, the perimeter is given by \( P = 2(l + w) \). Given \( P = 30 \):  
\( 2(l + w) = 30 \)  
\( l + w = 15 \)  
Thus, \( w = 15 - l \). Since \( l \) and \( w \) are whole numbers, \( l \) must be an integer such that \( 1 \leq l \leq 14 \) (to ensure \( w \geq 1 \)).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Derive possible whole-number dimensions.  
Description: Using \( l + w = 15 \), list all pairs of whole numbers \( (l, w) \) where \( l \) and \( w \) are positive integers and \( w = 15 - l \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since \( l + w = 15 \), the possible pairs \( (l, w) \) where both are whole numbers are:  
- \( l = 1 \), \( w = 15 - 1 = 14 \) → \( (1, 14) \)  
- \( l = 2 \), \( w = 15 - 2 = 13 \) → \( (2, 13) \)  
- \( l = 3 \), \( w = 15 - 3 = 12 \) → \( (3, 12) \)  
- \( l = 4 \), \( w = 15 - 4 = 11 \) → \( (4, 11) \)  
- \( l = 5 \), \( w = 15 - 5 = 10 \) → \( (5, 10) \)  
- \( l = 6 \), \( w = 15 - 6 = 9 \) → \( (6, 9) \)  
- \( l = 7 \), \( w = 15 - 7 = 8 \) → \( (7, 8) \)  
For \( l = 8 \), \( w = 15 - 8 = 7 \), which gives \( (8, 7) \), a repeat of \( (7, 8) \). Similarly, higher \( l \) values repeat pairs (e.g., \( l = 9 \), \( w = 6 \) is \( (9, 6) \), same as \( (6, 9) \)). Thus, the unique pairs (considering area is the same for \( (l, w) \) and \( (w, l) \)) are:  
\( (1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the area for each pair of dimensions.  
Description: For each pair \( (l, w) \), compute the area using \( A = l \times w \) and list the results.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the area \( A = l \times w \) for each pair:  
- \( (1, 14) \): \( 1 \times 14 = 14 \)  
- \( (2, 13) \): \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \)  
- \( (3, 12) \): \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \)  
- \( (4, 11) \): \( 4 \times 11 = 44 \)  
- \( (5, 10) \): \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \)  
- \( (6, 9) \): \( 6 \times 9 = 54 \)  
- \( (7, 8) \): \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \)  
Areas: 14, 26, 36, 44, 50, 54, 56 square units.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 30 units and whole-number dimensions.  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the perimeter to relate length and width (completed: \( l + w = 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive possible whole-number dimensions (completed: listed pairs \( (1, 14), (2, 13), ..., (7, 8) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area for each pair of dimensions (completed: areas 14, 26, ..., 56).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the pair that maximizes the area (pending).  
Current Goal: Identify the pair that maximizes the area.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the pair that maximizes the area.  
Description: Compare the computed areas and select the pair \( (l, w) \) with the highest area value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the areas calculated: 14, 26, 36, 44, 50, 54, 56, the maximum is 56 square units, corresponding to the pair \( (7, 8) \).  
To confirm, note that for a fixed perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when the dimensions are as equal as possible. Since \( l + w = 15 \), the closest whole numbers are 7 and 8, which give \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the solution.  
Description: Verify that the dimensions \( (7, 8) \) satisfy the perimeter constraint and that no other whole-number pair yields a larger area.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check perimeter for \( (7, 8) \):  
\( P = 2(l + w) = 2(7 + 8) = 2 \times 15 = 30 \), which satisfies the given perimeter.  
Check area: \( A = 7 \times 8 = 56 \).  
Reconfirm other pairs’ areas (from Step 4): All are less than 56 (e.g., \( 6 \times 9 = 54 \), \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \)).  
Since \( l \) and \( w \) must be whole numbers and \( l + w = 15 \), all possible pairs were considered. Thus, \( (7, 8) \) gives the maximum area.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The maximum possible area of the rectangle is **56 square units**.
