### Problem Statement
We need to evaluate the expression \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To evaluate \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\), break the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Express \(\sqrt{7}\) in a form that simplifies the logarithm.
2. Apply logarithm properties to compute the value.
3. Simplify the result to its final form.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express \(\sqrt{7}\) in a form that simplifies the logarithm.
How to Achieve: Rewrite \(\sqrt{7}\) using exponents, as logarithms work well with exponential forms. Since \(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\), we can use this to transform the expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the expression:
\[
\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \log_7 (7^{1/2})
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply logarithm properties to compute \(\log_7 (7^{1/2})\).
How to Achieve: Use the logarithm power rule, \(\log_b (a^c) = c \cdot \log_b a\), to simplify the expression.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the power rule:
\[
\log_7 (7^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \log_7 7
\]
Since \(\log_7 7 = 1\) (because \(7^1 = 7\)), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the result \(\frac{1}{2}\).
How to Achieve: Verify by computing \(7^{\frac{1}{2}}\) and confirming that \(\log_7 (7^{\frac{1}{2}}) = \frac{1}{2}\), or by using an alternative method to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative method: Since \(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\), we expect \(\log_7 (7^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2}\). Check by exponentiation:
If \(\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \frac{1}{2}\), then:
\[
7^{\log_7 \sqrt{7}} = 7^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{7}
\]
This holds, as \(7^{\log_7 \sqrt{7}} = \sqrt{7}\) by definition of logarithms. The result is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(\sqrt{7}\) as \(7^{1/2}\) (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply logarithm properties to compute \(\log_7 (7^{1/2})\) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify to final form (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the final answer is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[
\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
