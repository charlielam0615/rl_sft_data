**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To evaluate \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the argument \(\sqrt{7}\).
2. Apply logarithm properties to evaluate the expression.
3. Compute the final numerical value.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the argument \(\sqrt{7}\).
How to Achieve: Rewrite \(\sqrt{7}\) using exponents to facilitate the use of logarithm properties.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\), since the square root is equivalent to raising to the power of \(1/2\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply logarithm properties to evaluate \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\).
How to Achieve: Substitute \(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\) into the expression and use the logarithm power rule, \(\log_b (x^c) = c \log_b x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \log_7 (7^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2} \log_7 7
\]
Since \(\log_7 7 = 1\) (the logarithm of the base is always 1),
\[
\frac{1}{2} \log_7 7 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the result \(\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \frac{1}{2}\).
How to Achieve: Verify by converting the logarithmic equation to its exponential form and checking consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \(\log_7 \sqrt{7} = \frac{1}{2}\), then by definition, \(7^{1/2} = \sqrt{7}\), which is true since \(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\). The result is consistent.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\log_7 \sqrt{7}\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(\sqrt{7}\) (Completed: \(\sqrt{7} = 7^{1/2}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply logarithm properties (Completed: \(\log_7 (7^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final value (Completed: Result is \(\frac{1}{2}\)).
  - Validate the result (Completed: Verified via exponential form)).
Current Goal: The main goal has been evaluated as completed, with the result \(\frac{1}{2}\).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}}
\]
