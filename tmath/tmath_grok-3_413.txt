### Problem Restatement
We are given a table of points \((x, y)\): \((1, 7)\), \((3, 13)\), \((5, 19)\), which lie on a straight line. We need to find the value of \(t\) such that the point \((28, t)\) also lies on this line.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the equation of the straight line using the given points.  
2. Use the equation to find the y-coordinate \(t\) when \(x = 28\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the equation of the straight line using the given points. This can be achieved by calculating the slope of the line using two points and then finding the y-intercept to form the equation \(y = mx + b\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the equation of the line, calculate the slope \(m\) using points \((1, 7)\) and \((3, 13)\):  
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{13 - 7}{3 - 1} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]  
Verify the slope with another pair, e.g., \((3, 13)\) and \((5, 19)\):  
\[
m = \frac{19 - 13}{5 - 3} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]  
The slope is consistent, so \(m = 3\).  

Next, find the y-intercept \(b\) using the point \((1, 7)\) and the slope \(m = 3\) in the equation \(y = mx + b\):  
\[
7 = 3(1) + b \implies 7 = 3 + b \implies b = 4
\]  
Thus, the equation of the line is:  
\[
y = 3x + 4
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the line equation \(y = 3x + 4\) by checking if all given points satisfy it. This ensures the equation is correct before using it to find \(t\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check if the points \((1, 7)\), \((3, 13)\), and \((5, 19)\) satisfy \(y = 3x + 4\):  
- For \((1, 7)\):  
\[
y = 3(1) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 \quad \text{(Matches)}
\]  
- For \((3, 13)\):  
\[
y = 3(3) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 \quad \text{(Matches)}
\]  
- For \((5, 19)\):  
\[
y = 3(5) + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \quad \text{(Matches)}
\]  
All points satisfy the equation, confirming \(y = 3x + 4\) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the value of \(t\) by substituting \(x = 28\) into the line equation \(y = 3x + 4\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the equation \(y = 3x + 4\), substitute \(x = 28\):  
\[
y = 3(28) + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88
\]  
Thus, \(t = 88\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(t\) such that \((28, t)\) lies on the line.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equation of the straight line using the given points (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the equation to find \(t\) when \(x = 28\) (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved by finding \(t = 88\). No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(t\) is \(88\).
