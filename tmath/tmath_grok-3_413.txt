### Problem Statement
We are given a table of points \((x, y)\) that lie on a straight line:
- \((1, 7)\)
- \((3, 13)\)
- \((5, 19)\)

We need to find the value of \(t\) such that the point \((28, t)\) lies on the same straight line.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \(t\):  
1. Determine the equation of the straight line using the given points.  
2. Use the equation to find the \(y\)-coordinate (\(t\)) when \(x = 28\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the equation of the straight line using the given points.  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate the slope of the line using two points, then use the point-slope form to find the lineâ€™s equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the equation of the line, we first calculate the slope \(m\) using two points, say \((1, 7)\) and \((3, 13)\):  
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{13 - 7}{3 - 1} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]
Verify the slope with another pair, \((3, 13)\) and \((5, 19)\):  
\[
m = \frac{19 - 13}{5 - 3} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]
The slope is consistent, confirming a linear relationship with \(m = 3\).

Next, use the point-slope form \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \((1, 7)\):  
\[
y - 7 = 3(x - 1)
\]
Simplify:  
\[
y - 7 = 3x - 3 \implies y = 3x - 3 + 7 \implies y = 3x + 4
\]
The equation of the line is \(y = 3x + 4\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the equation \(y = 3x + 4\) using the given points.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute each point into the equation and check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check all points:  
- For \((1, 7)\): \(y = 3(1) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\). Holds.  
- For \((3, 13)\): \(y = 3(3) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13\). Holds.  
- For \((5, 19)\): \(y = 3(5) + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\). Holds.  

The equation \(y = 3x + 4\) is valid for all given points.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find the value of \(t\) for the point \((28, t)\) using the line equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \(x = 28\) into \(y = 3x + 4\) and solve for \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the equation \(y = 3x + 4\), substitute \(x = 28\):  
\[
y = 3(28) + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88
\]
Thus, \(t = 88\).

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(t\) such that \((28, t)\) lies on the line.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equation of the straight line (completed: \(y = 3x + 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the equation (completed: validated with all points).  
  - Subgoal 3: Use the equation to find \(t\) (completed: \(t = 88\)).  

**Current Goal**: Completed (find \(t\)).  
The solution process is complete, with \(t = 88\).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(t\) is \(88\).
