### Problem Statement
We need to find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each entry in row \( n \) and position \( k \) (0-based indexing) is given by \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). A four-digit number has a value between 1000 and 9999 (inclusive). Our goal is to identify the second smallest distinct four-digit number that appears as an entry in Pascal's triangle.

To solve this, we will systematically compute binomial coefficients, identify four-digit numbers, and determine the second smallest among them, using the meta-cognitive action set provided.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the structure of Pascal's triangle and how to compute its entries.  
2. Identify rows of Pascal's triangle where four-digit numbers (1000 to 9999) are likely to appear.  
3. Compute binomial coefficients in these rows to collect all four-digit numbers.  
4. Sort the four-digit numbers to find the smallest and second smallest.  
5. Verify the results to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the structure of Pascal's triangle and how to compute its entries.  
**How to Achieve**: Pascal's triangle consists of binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} \), where row \( n \) has entries for \( k = 0 \) to \( k = n \). Each entry can be computed using the formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), or iteratively using the property \( \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} \). We will use the formula for direct computation to identify four-digit numbers.

[IMP]
Pascal's triangle starts with row \( n = 0 \):  
- Row 0: \( \binom{0}{0} = 1 \)  
- Row 1: \( \binom{1}{0} = 1, \binom{1}{1} = 1 \)  
- Row 2: \( \binom{2}{0} = 1, \binom{2}{1} = 2, \binom{2}{2} = 1 \)  
- Row 3: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1, \binom{3}{1} = 3, \binom{3}{2} = 3, \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), and so on.  

Each entry is a binomial coefficient. Since four-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999, we need to find values of \( n \) and \( k \) where \( \binom{n}{k} \geq 1000 \) and \( \binom{n}{k} \leq 9999 \). Due to the symmetry of Pascal's triangle (\( \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k} \)), we can consider \( k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \) to avoid duplicate values within a row.

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals based on the understanding of Pascal's triangle:  
1. Estimate the range of rows \( n \) where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is likely to produce four-digit numbers by testing values of \( n \) and \( k \).  
2. Compute binomial coefficients for these rows, focusing on \( k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \) to account for symmetry.  
3. Collect all distinct four-digit numbers.  
4. Sort these numbers to identify the smallest and second smallest.  
5. Validate by checking additional rows or alternative methods to ensure no smaller four-digit numbers are missed.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Estimate the range of rows \( n \) where \( \binom{n}{k} \) produces four-digit numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Since computing factorials for large \( n \) is cumbersome, use the approximation \( \binom{n}{k} \approx \frac{n^k}{k!} \) for small \( k \) to estimate when \( \binom{n}{k} \) enters the four-digit range (1000 to 9999). Test rows by computing exact values for small \( k \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find rows where \( \binom{n}{k} \geq 1000 \), start with small \( k \):  
- For \( k = 1 \), \( \binom{n}{1} = n \). We need \( n \geq 1000 \), so row \( n = 1000 \) gives \( \binom{1000}{1} = 1000 \), a four-digit number.  
- For \( k = 2 \), \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \geq 1000 \implies n(n-1) \geq 2000 \). Solving approximately, \( n^2 \geq 2000 \implies n \geq \sqrt{2000} \approx 44.72 \). Test \( n = 45 \): \( \binom{45}{2} = \frac{45 \cdot 44}{2} = 990 \) (three-digit), but \( n = 46 \): \( \binom{46}{2} = \frac{46 \cdot 45}{2} = 1035 \), a four-digit number.  
- For \( k = 3 \), \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \geq 1000 \implies n(n-1)(n-2) \geq 6000 \). Approximating, \( n^3 \geq 6000 \implies n \geq \sqrt[3]{6000} \approx 18.17 \). Test \( n = 19 \): \( \binom{19}{3} = \frac{19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17}{6} = 969 \), but \( n = 20 \): \( \binom{20}{3} = \frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18}{6} = 1140 \), a four-digit number.  

Thus, rows \( n \geq 20 \) are likely to produce four-digit numbers for appropriate \( k \). Since values peak at \( k \approx n/2 \), we should check rows up to where \( \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \) exceeds 9999.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute binomial coefficients for rows \( n \geq 20 \) to collect four-digit numbers, focusing on \( k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate \( \binom{n}{k} \) for rows \( n = 20 \) to a reasonable upper bound, collecting values between 1000 and 9999. Use symmetry to reduce computations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute binomial coefficients for rows \( n = 20 \) to \( n = 30 \) (as a starting point, since higher rows may produce larger numbers):  
- **Row 20**: \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \), \( \binom{20}{4} = \frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17}{24} = 4845 \), \( \binom{20}{5} = \frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16}{120} = 15504 \) (five-digit). Four-digit: 1140, 4845.  
- **Row 21**: \( \binom{21}{3} = \frac{21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19}{6} = 1330 \), \( \binom{21}{4} = \frac{21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18}{24} = 5985 \), \( \binom{21}{5} = 20349 \) (five-digit). Four-digit: 1330, 5985.  
- **Row 22**: \( \binom{22}{3} = 1540 \), \( \binom{22}{4} = 7315 \), \( \binom{22}{5} = 26334 \). Four-digit: 1540, 7315.  
- **Row 23**: \( \binom{23}{3} = 1771 \), \( \binom{23}{4} = 8855 \), \( \binom{23}{5} = 33649 \). Four-digit: 1771, 8855.  
- **Row 24**: \( \binom{24}{3} = 2024 \), \( \binom{24}{4} = 10626 \). Four-digit: 2024.  
- **Row 25**: \( \binom{25}{3} = 2300 \), \( \binom{25}{4} = 12650 \). Four-digit: 2300.  
- **Row 26**: \( \binom{26}{3} = 2600 \), \( \binom{26}{4} = 14950 \). Four-digit: 2600.  
- **Row 27**: \( \binom{27}{3} = 2925 \), \( \binom{27}{4} = 17550 \). Four-digit: 2925.  
- **Row 28**: \( \binom{28}{3} = 3276 \), \( \binom{28}{4} = 9828 \). Four-digit: 3276, 9828.  
- **Row 29**: \( \binom{29}{3} = 3654 \), \( \binom{29}{4} = 23751 \). Four-digit: 3654.  
- **Row 30**: \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \), \( \binom{30}{4} = 27405 \). Four-digit: 4060.  

Also, from earlier, \( \binom{46}{2} = 1035 \), and \( \binom{1000}{1} = 1000 \).  
Distinct four-digit numbers: 1000, 1035, 1140, 1330, 1540, 1771, 2024, 2300, 2600, 2925, 3276, 3654, 4060, 4845, 5985, 7315, 8855, 9828.

  - Subgoal 5: Validate results (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Sort the collected four-digit numbers to identify the smallest and second smallest.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sort the collected four-digit numbers to find the smallest and second smallest.  
**How to Achieve**: List all distinct four-digit numbers collected, sort them in ascending order, and identify the first and second elements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Collected four-digit numbers: 1000, 1035, 1140, 1330, 1540, 1771, 2024, 2300, 2600, 2925, 3276, 3654, 4060, 4845, 5985, 7315, 8855, 9828.  
Sorted: 1000, 1035, 1140, 1330, 1540, 1771, 2024, 2300, 2600, 2925, 3276, 3654, 4060, 4845, 5985, 7315, 8855, 9828.  
- Smallest: 1000 (\( \binom{1000}{1} \)).  
- Second smallest: 1035 (\( \binom{46}{2} \)).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that 1035 is the second smallest four-digit number by checking for any missed four-digit numbers smaller than 1035 but greater than 1000.  
**How to Achieve**: Check rows between \( n = 46 \) and \( n = 1000 \), and earlier rows (e.g., \( n = 19 \) to \( n = 45 \)) for any four-digit numbers between 1000 and 1035.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Check \( \binom{n}{1} = n \): For \( n = 1001 \) to \( n = 1035 \), values are 1001 to 1035. The smallest is 1001, which is greater than 1000 but less than 1035.  
- Check \( k = 2 \): From \( n = 45 \), \( \binom{45}{2} = 990 \). For \( n = 46 \), \( \binom{46}{2} = 1035 \). No values between 1000 and 1035.  
- Check \( k = 3 \): From \( n = 19 \), \( \binom{19}{3} = 969 \); \( n = 20 \), \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \). No values between 1000 and 1035.  
- Higher \( k \) in lower rows produce larger numbers (e.g., \( \binom{20}{4} = 4845 \)).  

Thus, \( \binom{1001}{1} = 1001 \) is between 1000 and 1035. This indicates 1000 is the smallest, and 1001 is the second smallest.
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Update subgoals based on validation:  
1. Recompute four-digit numbers to confirm 1001 as the second smallest.  
2. Finalize the answer by confirming no other numbers exist between 1000 and 1001.  
3. Present the final answer.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that 1001 is the second smallest four-digit number by ensuring no other numbers exist between 1000 and 1001.  
**How to Achieve**: Recheck rows and binomial coefficients to ensure no other four-digit numbers fall between 1000 and 1001.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- \( \binom{1000}{1} = 1000 \), \( \binom{1001}{1} = 1001 \).  
- For \( k = 2 \), \( \binom{46}{2} = 1035 \) is the next smallest (since \( \binom{45}{2} = 990 \)).  
- For \( k \geq 3 \), the smallest four-digit number is \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \).  
No binomial coefficients produce values between 1000 and 1001 (e.g., \( \binom{n}{k} \) jumps from 1000 to 1001 for \( k = 1 \), and higher \( k \) yield larger numbers). Thus, 1001 is the second smallest.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Present the final answer.  
**How to Achieve**: State the second smallest four-digit number based on computations and validation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 1001, corresponding to \( \binom{1001}{1} \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is **1001**.
