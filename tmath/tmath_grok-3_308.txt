**Problem Restatement**: A grocer creates a display of cans where the top row has 1 can, and each subsequent lower row has 2 more cans than the row above it. The total number of cans in the display is 100. We need to determine the number of rows in the display.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Model the number of cans in each row to understand the pattern.  
2. Express the total number of cans as a sum based on the number of rows.  
3. Set up an equation for the total number of cans equal to 100.  
4. Solve for the number of rows.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Model the number of cans in each row and express the total as a sum.  
- **How to Achieve**: Identify the pattern of cans per row, derive a formula for the nth row, and sum the cans across all rows to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The top row (row 1) has 1 can. Each lower row has 2 more cans than the row above it. Thus:  
- Row 1: 1 can  
- Row 2: 1 + 2 = 3 cans  
- Row 3: 3 + 2 = 5 cans  
- Row 4: 5 + 2 = 7 cans  

The number of cans in row \( n \) forms an arithmetic sequence: \( 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \). The formula for the number of cans in the \( n \)-th row is:  
\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 2n - 1 \]

For \( r \) rows, the total number of cans is the sum of the first \( r \) terms of this sequence:  
\[ S_r = 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2r - 1) \]  
This is the sum of the first \( r \) odd numbers, which can also be expressed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:  
\[ S_r = \frac{r}{2} \cdot (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) = \frac{r}{2} \cdot (1 + (2r - 1)) = \frac{r}{2} \cdot 2r = r^2 \]  
Thus, the total number of cans is:  
\[ S_r = r^2 \]  
Given the display has 100 cans:  
\[ r^2 = 100 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Solve the equation for the number of rows.  
- **How to Achieve**: Solve the quadratic equation \( r^2 = 100 \) for \( r \), ensuring \( r \) is a positive integer since it represents the number of rows.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ r^2 = 100 \]  
\[ r = \sqrt{100} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad r = -\sqrt{100} = -10 \]  
Since \( r \) must be a positive integer (as it represents the number of rows), discard \( r = -10 \). Thus:  
\[ r = 10 \]

Verify: If \( r = 10 \), the total number of cans is:  
\[ S_{10} = 10^2 = 100 \]  
This matches the given total of 100 cans.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Check the validity of the solution.  
- **How to Achieve**: Calculate the number of cans in each row for 10 rows and sum them to confirm the total is 100.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For 10 rows, the number of cans in each row is:  
- Row 1: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 \)  
- Row 2: \( 2 \cdot 2 - 1 = 3 \)  
- Row 3: \( 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 5 \)  
- Row 4: \( 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 7 \)  
- Row 5: \( 2 \cdot 5 - 1 = 9 \)  
- Row 6: \( 2 \cdot 6 - 1 = 11 \)  
- Row 7: \( 2 \cdot 7 - 1 = 13 \)  
- Row 8: \( 2 \cdot 8 - 1 = 15 \)  
- Row 9: \( 2 \cdot 9 - 1 = 17 \)  
- Row 10: \( 2 \cdot 10 - 1 = 19 \)  

Sum the cans:  
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 \]  
Calculate pairwise:  
\[ (1 + 19) + (3 + 17) + (5 + 15) + (7 + 13) + (9 + 11) = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 100 \]  
The sum is 100, confirming the solution is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of rows in a display of 100 cans, where the top row has 1 can, and each lower row has 2 more cans than the row above it.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the number of cans in each row (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the total number of cans as a sum (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve an equation for 100 cans (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, as the number of rows (\( r = 10 \)) has been determined and validated.

**Final Answer**: The display contains **10 rows**.
