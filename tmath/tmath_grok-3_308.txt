**Problem Statement**: A grocer creates a display of cans where the top row has 1 can, and each subsequent lower row has 2 more cans than the row above it. The total number of cans in the display is 100. We need to determine the number of rows in the display.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of rows.  
1. Model the number of cans in each row based on the given pattern.  
2. Express the total number of cans as a sum based on the number of rows.  
3. Set up an equation to represent the total of 100 cans.  
4. Solve for the number of rows.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the number of cans in each row and express the total number of cans as a sum. The top row has 1 can, and each lower row has 2 more cans than the row above it. This suggests an arithmetic sequence. We will define the number of cans in each row and sum them to represent the total of 100 cans.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number of cans in each row forms an arithmetic sequence:  
- Row 1: 1 can  
- Row 2: 1 + 2 = 3 cans  
- Row 3: 3 + 2 = 5 cans  
- Row 4: 5 + 2 = 7 cans  
- And so on.  

For row \( k \), the number of cans is \( 1 + 2(k - 1) = 2k - 1 \).  
If there are \( n \) rows, the total number of cans is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the arithmetic sequence \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).  
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \]  
Here, the first term is 1, the last term is \( 2n - 1 \), so:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \cdot 2n = n^2 \]  
Thus, the total number of cans is \( n^2 \). Since the display has 100 cans, we set up the equation:  
\[ n^2 = 100 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( n^2 = 100 \) to find the number of rows \( n \). This involves taking the square root of both sides and checking if the solution is a positive integer, as the number of rows must be a whole number.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ n^2 = 100 \]  
\[ n = \sqrt{100} = 10 \]  
Since \( n = 10 \) is a positive integer, it is a valid solution for the number of rows.  
To verify, if \( n = 10 \), the total number of cans is:  
\[ S_{10} = 10^2 = 100 \]  
This matches the given total of 100 cans.  
Additionally, check the pattern:  
- Row 1: 1 can  
- Row 2: 3 cans  
- Row 3: 5 cans  
- ...  
- Row 10: \( 2 \cdot 10 - 1 = 19 \) cans  
Sum: \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 19 \). The number of terms is 10, and the sum is:  
\[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \cdot (1 + 19) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \]  
The solution is consistent.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current goal.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of rows in a display of 100 cans.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the number of cans in each row (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the total number of cans as a sum (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Set up and solve an equation for the number of rows (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align.  
The solution \( n = 10 \) satisfies the equation \( n^2 = 100 \), and the arithmetic sequence sum confirms the total of 100 cans. No further subgoals are needed.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if 10 rows produce exactly 100 cans and ensuring the pattern aligns with the problem's description.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the sum for \( n = 10 \):  
The sequence of cans is \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, 19 \).  
Using the sum formula:  
\[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \cdot (1 + 19) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \]  
Alternatively, since the sum is \( n^2 \), for \( n = 10 \):  
\[ 10^2 = 100 \]  
The pattern matches: each row has 2 more cans than the previous, starting with 1 can in the first row.  
Check if \( n = 11 \) is possible:  
\[ 11^2 = 121 \] (too many cans).  
Check if \( n = 9 \):  
\[ 9^2 = 81 \] (too few cans).  
Thus, \( n = 10 \) is the only integer solution that yields exactly 100 cans.

**Final Answer**: The display contains **10 rows**.
