Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The multiplication process for polynomials and the standard form $ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
To multiply the two polynomials, we use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, though it generalizes here). Each term in the first polynomial must be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then we combine like terms. This will result in the standard cubic form $ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d $, where $ a, b, c, d $ are the coefficients of the resulting polynomial. This is the key information needed to proceed.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply the polynomials $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$ to determine the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We will multiply the polynomials step by step:  
$$
(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)
$$  
Using the distributive property:  
$$
= 3x^2(7 - 2x) - 5x(7 - 2x) + 4(7 - 2x)
$$  
Now expand each term:  
1. $3x^2(7 - 2x) = 21x^2 - 6x^3$  
2. $-5x(7 - 2x) = -35x + 10x^2$  
3. $4(7 - 2x) = 28 - 8x$  

Now combine like terms:  
- $x^3$ term: $-6x^3$  
- $x^2$ terms: $21x^2 + 10x^2 = 31x^2$  
- $x$ terms: $-35x - 8x = -43x$  
- Constant term: $28$  

So the polynomial is:  
$$
-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28
$$  
Thus, the coefficients are:  
- $a = -6$  
- $b = 31$  
- $c = -43$  
- $d = 28$

1. **Polynomial Multiplication Verification**:
   - Original expression: $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$
   - Expanded terms:
     - $3x^2 \cdot 7 = 21x^2$
     - $3x^2 \cdot (-2x) = -6x^3$
     - $-5x \cdot 7 = -35x$
     - $-5x \cdot (-2x) = +10x^2$
     - $4 \cdot 7 = 28$
     - $4 \cdot (-2x) = -8x$
   - Combined terms:
     - $x^3$: $-6x^3$
     - $x^2$: $21x^2 + 10x^2 = 31x^2$
     - $x$: $-35x - 8x = -43x$
     - Constant: $28$
   - Final polynomial: $-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28$
   - Coefficients: $a = -6$, $b = 31$, $c = -43$, $d = 28$

2. **Calculation of $8a + 4b + 2c + d$**:
   - Substituting the coefficients:
     - $8a = 8 \cdot (-6) = -48$
     - $4b = 4 \cdot 31 = 124$
     - $2c = 2 \cdot (-43) = -86$
     - $d = 28$
   - Summing the values: $-48 + 124 - 86 + 28 = 18$

3. **Alternative Verification via Polynomial Evaluation**:
   - The expression $8a + 4b + 2c + d$ is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial at $x = 2$.
   - Substituting $x = 2$ into the original polynomials:
     - $3(2)^2 - 5(2) + 4 = 6$
     - $7 - 2(2) = 3$
   - Product: $6 \cdot 3 = 18$, matching the earlier result.

Both methods confirm the result is consistent and correct. No discrepancies identified.
