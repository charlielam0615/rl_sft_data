### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that the product of the numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) obtained from tossing three standard six-sided dice equals 180. Each die has faces numbered 1 through 6, and each outcome is equally likely. The total number of possible outcomes is \(6^3 = 216\). We must determine how many of these outcomes satisfy \(abc = 180\) and compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Identify all possible combinations of three numbers \((a, b, c)\) from 1 to 6 such that their product \(abc = 180\).  
2. Account for the fact that \((a, b, c)\) represents outcomes on distinct dice, considering permutations if numbers are repeated.  
3. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for three dice.  
4. Compute the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all combinations \((a, b, c)\) where \(a, b, c \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and \(abc = 180\). This will be achieved by finding integer solutions within the given constraints and considering their permutations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find combinations where \(a \times b \times c = 180\), factorize 180 into primes:  
\[ 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]  
We need \(a, b, c \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) such that their product is 180. Test possible values systematically:  

- **Case 1: All numbers \(\leq 6\)**  
  Try combinations where each number is a factor of 180. List numbers from 1 to 6 that divide 180:  
  - \(180 \div 1 = 180\) (too large unless other numbers are small).  
  - \(180 \div 2 = 90\).  
  - \(180 \div 3 = 60\).  
  - \(180 \div 4 = 45\).  
  - \(180 \div 5 = 36\).  
  - \(180 \div 6 = 30\).  

  Now, for each factor, find pairs of numbers from 1 to 6 whose product gives the remaining value:  
  - If \(a = 5\), then \(b \times c = 36\). Possible pairs \((b, c)\):  
    - \(6 \times 6 = 36\). So, \((5, 6, 6)\).  
    - Check others: \(1 \times 36\), \(2 \times 18\), \(3 \times 12\), \(4 \times 9\) are not possible since 36, 18, 12, 9 exceed 6.  
  - If \(a = 6\), then \(b \times c = 30\). Possible pairs:  
    - \(5 \times 6 = 30\). So, \((6, 5, 6)\).  
    - Others like \(1 \times 30\), \(2 \times 15\), \(3 \times 10\) are not possible.  
  - If \(a = 4\), then \(b \times c = 45\). No pairs work since \(45 \div 1 = 45\), \(45 \div 2 = 22.5\), etc.  
  - If \(a = 3\), then \(b \times c = 60\). No pairs work.  
  - If \(a = 2\), then \(b \times c = 90\). No pairs work.  
  - If \(a = 1\), then \(b \times c = 180\). No pairs work.  

  Only \((5, 6, 6)\) and \((6, 5, 6)\) are valid ordered triplets, but they represent the same set of numbers on distinct dice.

- **Permutations**: For \((5, 6, 6)\), the numbers are 5 (once), 6 (twice). The number of distinct permutations is:  
  \[\frac{3!}{1! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\]  
  The ordered triplets are: \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), \((6, 6, 5)\).  

Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that all combinations \((a, b, c)\) with \(abc = 180\) and \(a, b, c \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) have been correctly identified and their permutations counted. This will be achieved by rechecking the factorization and permutation calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the factorization of 180:  
\[ 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]  
Confirm combinations:  
- Only \((5, 6, 6)\) works, as other combinations (e.g., including 1, 2, 3, or 4) lead to products exceeding 6 for the remaining factors.  
- Verify permutations: For one 5 and two 6â€™s, the number of distinct ordered triplets is:  
  \[\frac{3!}{1! \cdot 2!} = 3\]  
  Triplets: \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), \((6, 6, 5)\).  

No other combinations satisfy the constraints (e.g., \((6, 6, 5)\) is the same set, and numbers like 7 or higher are not possible). The count of 3 favorable outcomes is valid.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the probability that \(abc = 180\) when three dice are tossed.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify combinations \((a, b, c)\) where \(abc = 180\) and \(a, b, c \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Account for permutations of valid combinations. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate total possible outcomes. (Pending)  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the probability. (Pending)  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for three dice.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when tossing three six-sided dice. This will be achieved by computing the number of possible outcomes for each die and combining them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are distinct. The total number of outcomes is:  
\[ 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 6^3 = 216 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability that \(abc = 180\) by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the number of favorable outcomes is 3 (the ordered triplets \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), \((6, 6, 5)\)).  
From Step 5, the total number of outcomes is 216.  
The probability is:  
\[ P(abc = 180) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{216} = \frac{1}{72} \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final probability by ensuring all steps (favorable outcomes, total outcomes, and probability calculation) are correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Favorable outcomes**: Confirmed 3 triplets \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), \((6, 6, 5)\). No other combinations work, as verified in Step 3.  
- **Total outcomes**: \(6^3 = 216\), which is standard for three six-sided dice.  
- **Probability**: \(\frac{3}{216} = \frac{1}{72} \approx 0.01389\). The fraction is simplified correctly (\(\gcd(3, 216) = 3\)).  
The calculations are consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that the product of the numbers on three standard six-sided dice is 180 is:  
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{72}} \]
