### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Determine all possible outcomes when three dice are rolled.  
2. Identify all combinations of numbers \((a, b, c)\) where \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\).  
3. Ensure each number \(a, b, c\) is between 1 and 6 (since they are outcomes of standard dice).  
4. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid combinations by the total number of possible outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when three dice are rolled.  
**How to Achieve**: Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent. Thus, the total number of outcomes is \(6 \times 6 \times 6\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Each die can show one of 6 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Since there are three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
\[ 6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216. \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find all combinations of numbers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\), where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6\).  
**How to Achieve**: Find all ordered triplets \((a, b, c)\) of integers from 1 to 6 whose product is 180. This involves finding the factor triples and checking their validity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the triplets \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\) and \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6\), we start by factoring 180 into three factors. First, compute the prime factorization of 180:  
\[ 180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1. \]  

We need to distribute these prime factors into three numbers \(a, b, c\), each between 1 and 6. Since \(a, b, c\) are die outcomes, they must be integers from 1 to 6. Letâ€™s systematically find all ordered triplets by considering possible values for \(a\) and \(b\), then solving for \(c = \frac{180}{a \cdot b}\), ensuring \(c\) is an integer between 1 and 6.

**Possible triplets**:  
- Let \(a = 1\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{1} = 180\). Since \(b, c \leq 6\), their product \(b \cdot c \leq 6 \cdot 6 = 36\). No pairs \((b, c)\) satisfy \(b \cdot c = 180\).  
- Let \(a = 2\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{2} = 90\). Check pairs \((b, c)\) with \(b \cdot c = 90\), \(b, c \leq 6\):  
  - \(90 = 1 \cdot 90\) (90 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(90 = 2 \cdot 45\) (45 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(90 = 3 \cdot 30\) (30 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(90 = 5 \cdot 18\) (18 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(90 = 6 \cdot 15\) (15 > 6, invalid).  
  No valid pairs.  
- Let \(a = 3\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{3} = 60\). Check pairs:  
  - \(60 = 1 \cdot 60\) (60 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(60 = 2 \cdot 30\) (30 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(60 = 3 \cdot 20\) (20 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(60 = 4 \cdot 15\) (15 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(60 = 5 \cdot 12\) (12 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(60 = 6 \cdot 10\) (10 > 6, invalid).  
  No valid pairs.  
- Let \(a = 4\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{4} = 45\). Check pairs:  
  - \(45 = 1 \cdot 45\) (45 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(45 = 3 \cdot 15\) (15 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(45 = 5 \cdot 9\) (9 > 6, invalid).  
  No valid pairs.  
- Let \(a = 5\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{5} = 36\). Check pairs:  
  - \(36 = 1 \cdot 36\) (36 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(36 = 2 \cdot 18\) (18 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(36 = 3 \cdot 12\) (12 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(36 = 4 \cdot 9\) (9 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(36 = 6 \cdot 6\). Valid pair: \((b, c) = (6, 6)\).  
  Triplet: \((a, b, c) = (5, 6, 6)\).  
- Let \(a = 6\): Then \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{6} = 30\). Check pairs:  
  - \(30 = 1 \cdot 30\) (30 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(30 = 2 \cdot 15\) (15 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(30 = 3 \cdot 10\) (10 > 6, invalid).  
  - \(30 = 5 \cdot 6\). Valid pair: \((b, c) = (5, 6)\).  
  Triplets: \((a, b, c) = (6, 5, 6)\) and \((6, 6, 5)\) (since \((b, c) = (6, 5)\) is also valid).  

**Valid triplets**:  
- \((5, 6, 6)\)  
- \((6, 5, 6)\)  
- \((6, 6, 5)\)  

Each triplet corresponds to a unique ordered outcome of the three dice. Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all valid triplets have been identified and ensure no other combinations satisfy \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\).  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the factorizations and confirm that all possible triplets with \(a, b, c \leq 6\) have been considered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, reconsider the prime factorization \(180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1\). We need three numbers whose product matches this factorization, and each number must be at most 6. Since \(7 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 > 6\), any number greater than 6 would require additional factors not present in 180 or would exceed the constraint.  

Recompute possible triplets by testing other combinations:  
- Check if we missed any \(a\). Since \(a = 1\) to \(a = 4\) yielded no valid pairs for \(b \cdot c\), and \(a \geq 7\) gives \(b \cdot c = \frac{180}{a} < 6 \cdot 6 = 36\), which we already checked, no new solutions arise.  
- Confirm the triplet \((5, 6, 6)\): \(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 180\).  
- Confirm \((6, 5, 6)\): \(6 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 180\).  
- Confirm \((6, 6, 5)\): \(6 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 180\).  

No other combinations work, as higher values of \(a\) (e.g., \(a \geq 7\)) make \(b \cdot c\) too small to factor into integers \(\leq 6\). The triplets are correct.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\) when three dice are rolled.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total possible outcomes (completed: 216 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify all triplets \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\) and \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6\) (completed: 3 triplets).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the triplets (completed: triplets verified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the probability (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability using the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From previous steps:  
- Total outcomes: 216 (from Step 2).  
- Favorable outcomes: 3 (from Step 3, validated in Step 4).  

The probability is:  
\[ P(a \cdot b \cdot c = 180) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{216} = \frac{1}{72}. \]  

**Final Answer**: The probability that the product of the numbers on three dice is 180 is \(\frac{1}{72}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the probability calculation is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify the number of favorable outcomes, total outcomes, and the division.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Total outcomes**: \(6^3 = 216\), which is correct.  
- **Favorable outcomes**: The triplets \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), \((6, 6, 5)\) are distinct ordered outcomes, giving 3 favorable cases.  
- **Probability**: \(\frac{3}{216} = \frac{1}{72}\), and \(216 \div 3 = 72\), confirming the simplification.  

The calculation is consistent and correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice is 180 is \(\frac{1}{72}\).
