**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine the number of ways to select 4 books from a shelf of 6 books, where the order of selection does not matter. This is a combination problem, as we are choosing a subset of items without regard to arrangement.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Identify the mathematical approach for selecting items without order (combinations).  
2. Determine the formula for combinations.  
3. Apply the formula with n=6 (total books) and k=4 (books to select).  
4. Compute the result.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the mathematical approach for selecting items without order.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize that selecting items without regard to order corresponds to combinations, where we use the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The problem involves choosing 4 books from 6, where the order does not matter. This is a classic combinations problem, as combinations count the number of ways to choose k items from n items without considering the order of selection. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the formula for combinations and apply it with n=6 and k=4.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the combinations formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), substitute n=6 and k=4, and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The combinations formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). Here, n=6 (total books) and k=4 (books to select). So, we need to calculate:  
C(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!) = 6! / (4! * 2!).  

Compute the factorials:  
- 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720  
- 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24  
- 2! = 2 × 1 = 2  

Thus:  
C(6, 4) = 720 / (24 × 2) = 720 / 48 = 15.

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculation for C(6, 4).  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate C(6, 4) using an alternative method, such as the property C(n, k) = C(n, n-k), and confirm the result matches.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, use the property of combinations: C(n, k) = C(n, n-k). Here, C(6, 4) = C(6, 6-4) = C(6, 2).  
Calculate C(6, 2):  
C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 720 / (2 × 24) = 720 / 48 = 15.  
This matches the previous result of C(6, 4) = 15, confirming the calculation is correct.
