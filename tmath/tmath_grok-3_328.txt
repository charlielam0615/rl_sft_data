### Problem Statement
We need to determine the current ages of James and Louise based on the given conditions:
1. James is six years older than Louise.
2. Eight years from now, James's age will be four times Louise's age four years ago.
Then, we calculate the sum of their current ages.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define variables for James's and Louise's current ages.
2. Translate the given conditions into mathematical equations.
3. Solve the equations to find their current ages.
4. Calculate the sum of their current ages.
5. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to define variables for James's and Louise's current ages and set up equations based on the problem conditions. This will be achieved by assigning variables, using the relationship "James is six years older than Louise," and translating the condition about their ages eight years from now and four years ago into equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let Louise's current age be \( L \).
Since James is six years older than Louise, James's current age is \( L + 6 \).

Now, translate the second condition:
- Eight years from now, James's age will be \( (L + 6) + 8 = L + 14 \).
- Four years ago, Louise's age was \( L - 4 \).
- The condition states that eight years from now, James's age will be four times Louise's age four years ago: \( L + 14 = 4 \cdot (L - 4) \).

Thus, the equations are:
1. \( J = L + 6 \)
2. \( L + 14 = 4 \cdot (L - 4) \)
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the equations to find Louise's and James's current ages. This will be achieved by solving the second equation for \( L \), then using the first equation to find \( J \), and checking for consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the second equation:
\[
L + 14 = 4 \cdot (L - 4)
\]
\[
L + 14 = 4L - 16
\]
\[
14 + 16 = 4L - L
\]
\[
30 = 3L
\]
\[
L = 10
\]

Now, use the first equation to find James's age:
\[
J = L + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
\]

So, Louise is 10 years old, and James is 16 years old.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the solution by checking if the ages satisfy both conditions. This will be achieved by substituting \( L = 10 \) and \( J = 16 \) into the problem's conditions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the first condition: James is six years older than Louise.
\[
J = 16, \quad L = 10
\]
\[
16 - 10 = 6
\]
This satisfies the first condition.

Check the second condition: Eight years from now, James's age will be four times Louise's age four years ago.
- Eight years from now, James's age: \( 16 + 8 = 24 \).
- Four years ago, Louise's age: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \).
- Four times Louise's age four years ago: \( 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \).
\[
24 = 24
\]
This satisfies the second condition.

The solution is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the sum of James's and Louise's current ages. This will be achieved by adding their ages, \( J = 16 \) and \( L = 10 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum of their current ages:
\[
J + L = 16 + 10 = 26
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
