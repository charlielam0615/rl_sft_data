### Problem Statement
We need to determine the current ages of James and Louise given that James is six years older than Louise, and eight years from now, James's age will be four times Louise's age four years ago. We then need to find the sum of their current ages. I will solve this step-by-step using the provided meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the set M (Planning, Implementation, Review) and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for James's and Louise's current ages.  
2. Translate the given conditions into mathematical equations.  
3. Solve the equations to find their current ages.  
4. Calculate the sum of their current ages.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables for James's and Louise's current ages and set up equations based on the problem's conditions. This will be achieved by assigning variables, translating the statement "James is six years older than Louise" and the condition about their ages in eight years, and forming equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let Louise's current age be \( L \) years. Since James is six years older than Louise, James's current age is \( L + 6 \).  
The second condition states that eight years from now, James's age will be four times Louise's age four years ago.  
- In eight years, James's age will be \( (L + 6) + 8 = L + 14 \).  
- Four years ago, Louise's age was \( L - 4 \).  
- Thus, the condition translates to: \( L + 14 = 4 \cdot (L - 4) \).  
This gives us the equation:  
\[ L + 14 = 4(L - 4) \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( L + 14 = 4(L - 4) \) to find Louise's current age, then determine James's age using the relationship \( J = L + 6 \). This will be achieved by algebraic manipulation to isolate \( L \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ L + 14 = 4(L - 4) \]  
Distribute on the right:  
\[ L + 14 = 4L - 16 \]  
Rearrange to isolate terms involving \( L \):  
\[ 14 + 16 = 4L - L \]  
\[ 30 = 3L \]  
\[ L = 10 \]  
So, Louise's current age is 10 years. Since James is six years older:  
\[ J = L + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]  
James's current age is 16 years.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the ages \( L = 10 \) and \( J = 16 \) satisfy both conditions of the problem. This will be achieved by substituting these values into the conditions and checking for consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the first condition: James is six years older than Louise.  
\[ J = 16, L = 10 \]  
\[ 16 = 10 + 6 \] (True)  

Check the second condition: Eight years from now, James's age equals four times Louise's age four years ago.  
- In eight years, James's age: \( 16 + 8 = 24 \).  
- Four years ago, Louise's age: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \).  
- Four times Louise's age four years ago: \( 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \).  
\[ 24 = 24 \] (True)  

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the sum of James's and Louise's current ages.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for their ages (Completed: \( L = 10 \), \( J = 16 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations based on the problem's conditions (Completed: \( L + 14 = 4(L - 4) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the equations (Completed: \( L = 10 \), \( J = 16 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (Completed: Both conditions satisfied).  
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate the sum of their current ages (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the sum of James's and Louise's current ages.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of James's and Louise's current ages using the values \( L = 10 \) and \( J = 16 \). This will be achieved by adding the ages together.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sum of their current ages:  
\[ L + J = 10 + 16 = 26 \]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of James's and Louise's current ages is **26**.
