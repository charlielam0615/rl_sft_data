**Problem Restatement**: We need to factor the quadratic expression \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into the form \((3y + a)(y + b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, and then find the value of \(a - b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Factor the quadratic \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into the form \((3y + a)(y + b)\).  
2. Identify the integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the factored form.  
3. Compute \(a - b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into \((3y + a)(y + b)\). To achieve this, expand the target form \((3y + a)(y + b)\), compare coefficients with the given expression, and solve for \(a\) and \(b\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \((3y + a)(y + b)\):  
\[
(3y + a)(y + b) = 3y^2 + 3by + ay + ab = 3y^2 + (3b + a)y + ab
\]  
Compare with \(3y^2 - y - 24\):  
- Coefficient of \(y^2\): 3 (matches).  
- Coefficient of \(y\): \(3b + a = -1\).  
- Constant term: \(ab = -24\).  

We now have the system:  
1. \(3b + a = -1\)  
2. \(ab = -24\)  

Solve for \(a\) and \(b\). From equation 1, express \(a\):  
\[
a = -1 - 3b
\]  
Substitute into equation 2:  
\[
b(-1 - 3b) = -24
\]  
\[
- b - 3b^2 = -24
\]  
\[
3b^2 + b - 24 = 0
\]  
Solve the quadratic equation \(3b^2 + b - 24 = 0\). Use the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 3\), \(B = 1\), \(C = -24\):  
\[
\text{Discriminant} = 1^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-24) = 1 + 288 = 289
\]  
\[
b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{289}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-1 \pm 17}{6}
\]  
\[
b = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}, \quad b = \frac{-18}{6} = -3
\]  
Since \(a\) and \(b\) must be integers, take \(b = -3\). Then:  
\[
a = -1 - 3(-3) = -1 + 9 = 8
\]  
Check if \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\) satisfies \(ab = -24\):  
\[
8 \cdot (-3) = -24 \quad (\text{correct})
\]  
Thus, the factored form is \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the factored form \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\). Expand the factored expression and confirm it equals \(3y^2 - y - 24\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\):  
\[
(3y + 8)(y - 3) = 3y^2 - 9y + 8y - 24 = 3y^2 - y - 24
\]  
This matches the original expression, confirming the factorization is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \(a - b\). From the factored form \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\), identify \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\), and compute \(a - b\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\), we have \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\). Compute:  
\[
a - b = 8 - (-3) = 8 + 3 = 11
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(a - b\) for the factored form of \(3y^2 - y - 24\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Factor \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into \((3y + a)(y + b)\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify integers \(a\) and \(b\). (Completed: \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a - b\). (Completed: \(a - b = 11\))  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed. The solution is \(a - b = 11\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(a - b = 11\)
