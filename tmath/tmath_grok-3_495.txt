**Problem Restatement**: We need to factor the quadratic expression \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into the form \((3y + a)(y + b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, and then find the value of \(a - b\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Factor the quadratic \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into the form \((3y + a)(y + b)\).  
2. Identify the integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the factored form.  
3. Compute \(a - b\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Factor the quadratic \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into \((3y + a)(y + b)\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the AC method for factoring, where the quadratic is in the form \(ay^2 + by + c\). Here, \(a = 3\), \(b = -1\), \(c = -24\). Find two numbers whose product is \(a \cdot c = 3 \cdot (-24) = -72\) and whose sum is \(b = -1\). Then, rewrite the middle term, group, and factor.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic is \(3y^2 - y - 24\). We need numbers whose product is \(-72\) and sum is \(-1\). Testing pairs:  
- \(8 \cdot (-9) = -72\), and \(8 + (-9) = -1\).  
Rewrite the quadratic:  
\[ 3y^2 + 8y - 9y - 24 \]  
Group:  
\[ (3y^2 + 8y) + (-9y - 24) \]  
Factor each group:  
\[ y(3y + 8) - 3(3y + 8) \]  
Factor out \((3y + 8)\):  
\[ (3y + 8)(y - 3) \]  
This matches the form \((3y + a)(y + b)\), so \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the factored form \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the factored expression and check if it equals \(3y^2 - y - 24\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \((3y + 8)(y - 3)\):  
\[ 3y \cdot y + 3y \cdot (-3) + 8 \cdot y + 8 \cdot (-3) = 3y^2 - 9y + 8y - 24 = 3y^2 - y - 24 \]  
The expansion matches the original expression, confirming the factors are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(a - b\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values \(a = 8\) and \(b = -3\) from the factored form and calculate \(a - b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \(a = 8\) and \(b = -3\), compute:  
\[ a - b = 8 - (-3) = 8 + 3 = 11 \]  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a - b\) for the factored form of \(3y^2 - y - 24\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Factor \(3y^2 - y - 24\) into \((3y + a)(y + b)\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\) and \(b\). (Completed: \(a = 8\), \(b = -3\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a - b\). (Completed: \(a - b = 11\))  
**Current Goal**: Completed, as all subgoals are achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(a - b = 11\)
