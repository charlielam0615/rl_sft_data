Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Verify if the backward subgoaling process aligns with the original problem.  
    1.1 Confirm the expression $361+2(19)(6)+36$ is correctly interpreted.  
2. Perform the necessary calculations for $2(19)(6)$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Compute $2(19)(6)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To compute $2(19)(6)$, first calculate $19 \times 6 = 114$, then multiply the result by 2:  
$114 \times 2 = 228$.  
Thus, $2(19)(6) = 228$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Add $361$, $228$, and $36$ to compute $x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Start by adding $361 + 228 = 589$. Then add $589 + 36 = 625$.  
Therefore, $x = 625$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of multiplication step $2(19)(6)$:**  
   - $19 \times 6 = 114$ is correct.  
   - $114 \times 2 = 228$ is correct.  
   - No issues detected in this step.  

2. **Verification of addition steps:**  
   - $361 + 228 = 589$:  
     - $360 + 228 = 588$, then $588 + 1 = 589$. Correct.  
   - $589 + 36 = 625$:  
     - $589 + 30 = 619$, then $619 + 6 = 625$. Correct.  

3. **Final result alignment with original equation:**  
   - Substituting all values: $361 + 228 + 36 = 625$.  
   - All operations follow the order of operations (multiplication before addition).  
   - No arithmetic errors or logical inconsistencies detected.  

Conclusion: All steps are valid and consistent. The solution is correct.
