**Problem Statement**: Given the equation \(2^{3x} = 7\), we need to evaluate \(8^{x+1}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(8^{x+1}\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(2^{3x} = 7\).  
2. Express \(8^{x+1}\) in terms of a base related to the given equation (e.g., base 2, since \(8 = 2^3\)).  
3. Substitute the value of \(x\) into \(8^{x+1}\) and compute the result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \(x\) in \(2^{3x} = 7\). This can be achieved by taking the logarithm of both sides to isolate \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2^{3x} = 7 \]  
Take the natural logarithm (or any logarithm) of both sides:  
\[ \ln(2^{3x}) = \ln(7) \]  
Using the power rule of logarithms (\(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\)):  
\[ 3x \ln(2) = \ln(7) \]  
Solve for \(x\):  
\[ x = \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} \]  
This is the exact expression for \(x\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(8^{x+1}\) in terms of base 2 and substitute \(x = \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)}\) to evaluate it. Since \(8 = 2^3\), rewrite \(8^{x+1}\) using base 2, then compute the exponent.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \(8^{x+1}\):  
\[ 8 = 2^3 \]  
\[ 8^{x+1} = (2^3)^{x+1} = 2^{3(x+1)} \]  
Expand the exponent:  
\[ 2^{3(x+1)} = 2^{3x + 3} = 2^{3x} \cdot 2^3 \]  
From the given equation, \(2^{3x} = 7\), and \(2^3 = 8\), so:  
\[ 2^{3x} \cdot 2^3 = 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \]  
Thus:  
\[ 8^{x+1} = 56 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \(8^{x+1} = 56\) by substituting \(x = \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)}\) into \(8^{x+1}\) and checking consistency with the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)}\) into \(8^{x+1}\):  
\[ 8^{x+1} = 8^{\frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1} \]  
Rewrite \(8 = 2^3\):  
\[ 8^{\frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1} = (2^3)^{\frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1} = 2^{3 \left( \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1 \right)} \]  
Simplify the exponent:  
\[ 3 \left( \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1 \right) = \frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(2)} + 3 \]  
Thus:  
\[ 2^{3 \left( \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)} + 1 \right)} = 2^{\frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(2)} + 3} = 2^{\frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(2)}} \cdot 2^3 \]  
Since \(2^{\frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(2)}} = 2^{\ln(7) / \ln(2)} = 7\) (because \(a^{\log_b(c)} = c^{\log_b(a)}\)), and \(2^3 = 8\):  
\[ 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \]  
This confirms:  
\[ 8^{x+1} = 56 \]  
The result is consistent with the previous step.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(8^{x+1}\) given \(2^{3x} = 7\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \(x\) in \(2^{3x} = 7\). (Completed: \(x = \frac{\ln(7)}{3 \ln(2)}\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Express \(8^{x+1}\) in terms of base 2. (Completed: \(8^{x+1} = 2^{3(x+1)} = 2^{3x} \cdot 2^3\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Substitute \(x\) and compute \(8^{x+1}\). (Completed: \(8^{x+1} = 56\))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result. (Completed: Confirmed \(8^{x+1} = 56\))  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.
