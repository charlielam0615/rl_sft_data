### Problem Statement
We need to find the coordinates of point \( B \), which lies on the line \( y = 4 \), such that the slope of segment \( AB \) (where point \( A \) is at \( (0, 0) \)) is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Then, we compute the sum of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of point \( B \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the coordinates of point \( B \) given it lies on \( y = 4 \).
2. Use the slope formula for segment \( AB \) to find the \( x \)-coordinate of \( B \).
3. Calculate the sum of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of point \( B \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of point \( B \).
How to Achieve: Since point \( B \) lies on the line \( y = 4 \), its coordinates are \( (x, 4) \). Use the slope formula for segment \( AB \), where \( A \) is \( (0, 0) \), and the slope is \( \frac{2}{3} \), to find the \( x \)-coordinate.

[IMP]
The slope of segment \( AB \) is given by:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \frac{4 - 0}{x - 0} = \frac{4}{x}
\]
Since the slope is \( \frac{2}{3} \), set up the equation:
\[
\frac{4}{x} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
4 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot x \implies 12 = 2x \implies x = 6
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \( B \) are \( (6, 4) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the coordinates of point \( B \).
How to Achieve: Check if the slope of segment \( AB \) with \( B \) at \( (6, 4) \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the slope of segment \( AB \) with \( A = (0, 0) \) and \( B = (6, 4) \):
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 0}{6 - 0} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
The slope matches the given value, confirming that \( B = (6, 4) \) is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of point \( B \).
How to Achieve: Add the \( x \)-coordinate (\( 6 \)) and \( y \)-coordinate (\( 4 \)) of point \( B \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the coordinates:
\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of point \( B \).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the coordinates of point \( B \) (completed: \( B = (6, 4) \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the coordinates (completed: slope validated).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the sum of the coordinates (completed: sum = 10).
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The solution is complete with the sum of the coordinates being 10.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The sum of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of point \( B \) is \( 10 \).
