### Problem Statement
We are given a function \( f(x) \) defined on the domain \( \{x_1, x_2, x_3\} \), so its graph \( y = f(x) \) consists of three points, forming a triangle with an area of 32. We need to find the area of the triangle formed by the three points of the graph of the transformed function \( y = 2f(2x) \).

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the area of the triangle formed by the graph of \( y = 2f(2x) \):
1. Understand the effect of the transformation \( y = 2f(2x) \) on the points of the graph of \( y = f(x) \).
2. Determine how the coordinates of the three points are transformed.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the effect of the transformation \( y = 2f(2x) \) on the points of the graph.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the transformation by applying it to the coordinates of the points. The graph of \( y = f(x) \) consists of three points \( (x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), (x_3, f(x_3)) \). We need to find the coordinates of the points for \( y = 2f(2x) \) and determine how the transformation affects them.

[IMP]
The function \( y = 2f(2x) \) transforms the input and output of \( f(x) \):
- The input transformation \( 2x \) means that for an input \( x_i \), the new input is \( 2x \). Thus, we evaluate \( f \) at \( 2x \).
- The output transformation \( 2f(2x) \) means the y-coordinate is scaled by 2.

For a point \( (x_i, f(x_i)) \) on the graph of \( y = f(x) \), we compute the corresponding point on \( y = 2f(2x) \):
- Substitute \( x = x_i / 2 \) into \( y = 2f(2x) \):
  - The input to \( f \) is \( 2 \cdot (x_i / 2) = x_i \).
  - The output is \( y = 2f(x_i) \).
- Thus, the point \( (x_i, f(x_i)) \) transforms to \( (x_i / 2, 2f(x_i)) \).

So, the three points \( (x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), (x_3, f(x_3)) \) become:
- \( (x_1 / 2, 2f(x_1)) \)
- \( (x_2 / 2, 2f(x_2)) \)
- \( (x_3 / 2, 2f(x_3)) \)

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the transformed points.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the area formula for a triangle given three points in the plane and determine how the transformation scales the area.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The area of a triangle formed by three points \( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3) \) is given by the shoelace formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
For the original points \( (x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), (x_3, f(x_3)) \), let’s denote \( y_i = f(x_i) \). The area is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right| = 32
\]
For the transformed points \( (x_1 / 2, 2f(x_1)), (x_2 / 2, 2f(x_2)), (x_3 / 2, 2f(x_3)) \), the new coordinates are:
- \( x_i' = x_i / 2 \)
- \( y_i' = 2f(x_i) = 2y_i \)

Substitute into the shoelace formula:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{x_1}{2} (2y_2 - 2y_3) + \frac{x_2}{2} (2y_3 - 2y_1) + \frac{x_3}{2} (2y_1 - 2y_2) \right|
\]
Factor out the constants:
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \left[ x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right] \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
Since \( \left| x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2) \right| = 2 \cdot 32 = 64 \), we have:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 64 = 32
\]
Alternatively, consider the geometric effect of the transformation:
- The x-coordinates are scaled by \( 1/2 \).
- The y-coordinates are scaled by 2.
- The area of a triangle under a linear transformation with scaling factors \( a \) (x-direction) and \( b \) (y-direction) is scaled by \( |a \cdot b| \). Here, \( a = 1/2 \), \( b = 2 \), so the area scaling factor is:
\[
\left| \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \right| = 1
\]
Thus, the area remains \( 32 \cdot 1 = 32 \).

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculated area of the new triangle.  
**How to Achieve**: Test the transformation with a specific example to confirm the area calculation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider a specific triangle with points \( (0, 0), (4, 0), (0, 8) \):
- Area using the shoelace formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 (0 - 8) + 4 (8 - 0) + 0 (0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 32 + 0 \right| = 16
\]
Scale this area to match the problem’s area of 32 by doubling the coordinates to \( (0, 0), (8, 0), (0, 16) \):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 (0 - 16) + 8 (16 - 0) + 0 (0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 128 = 64 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 32
\]
Apply the transformation \( y = 2f(2x) \):
- Point \( (0, 0) \): \( x = 0 / 2 = 0 \), \( y = 2f(0) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \rightarrow (0, 0) \)
- Point \( (8, 0) \): \( x = 8 / 2 = 4 \), \( y = 2f(8) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \rightarrow (4, 0) \)
- Point \( (0, 16) \): \( x = 0 / 2 = 0 \), \( y = 2f(0) = 2 \cdot 16 = 32 \rightarrow (0, 32) \)
New points: \( (0, 0), (4, 0), (0, 32) \).
- New area:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 (0 - 32) + 4 (32 - 0) + 0 (0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 128 = 64 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 32
\]
The area matches, confirming the calculation.
