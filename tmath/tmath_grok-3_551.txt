### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the interest earned by Lisa after investing $1000 in a Bank of Springfield Super High Yield savings account, which compounds annually at a 1% interest rate, over a period of 5 years. The final answer should be rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Identify the formula for compound interest to calculate the total amount after 5 years.  
2. Calculate the total amount in the account after 5 years using the given principal, interest rate, and time.  
3. Subtract the initial principal from the total amount to find the interest earned.  
4. Round the interest to the nearest dollar as requested.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total amount in the account after 5 years. This will be achieved by applying the compound interest formula, using the principal of $1000, an annual interest rate of 1% (0.01), and a time period of 5 years, with annual compounding.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The compound interest formula is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  
where:  
- \( A \) = the final amount  
- \( P \) = principal ($1000)  
- \( r \) = annual interest rate (0.01)  
- \( n \) = number of times interest is compounded per year (1, since itâ€™s annual compounding)  
- \( t \) = number of years (5)  

Plugging in the values:  
\[ A = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{0.01}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 5} = 1000 \left(1.01\right)^5 \]  

Calculate \( (1.01)^5 \):  
\[ 1.01^5 = 1.01 \times 1.01 \times 1.01 \times 1.01 \times 1.01 \approx 1.0510100501 \]  

So:  
\[ A = 1000 \times 1.0510100501 \approx 1051.0100501 \]  

The total amount after 5 years is approximately $1051.01.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the interest earned by subtracting the initial principal from the total amount. The principal is $1000, and the total amount from the previous step is approximately $1051.01.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Interest earned = Total amount - Principal  
\[ \text{Interest} = 1051.01 - 1000 = 51.01 \]  

The interest earned is $51.01.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to round the interest earned ($51.01) to the nearest dollar as requested in the problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The interest earned is $51.01. Since the decimal part (0.01) is less than 0.5, rounding to the nearest dollar gives:  
\[ \text{Rounded interest} = 51 \]  

The final interest earned, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $51.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the interest earned after 5 years, rounded to the nearest dollar.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the compound interest formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total amount after 5 years (completed, result: $1051.01).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the interest by subtracting the principal (completed, result: $51.01).  
  - Subgoal 4: Round the interest to the nearest dollar (completed, result: $51).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, which has been calculated as $51.

### Final Answer
The interest earned by Lisa after 5 years, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $51.
