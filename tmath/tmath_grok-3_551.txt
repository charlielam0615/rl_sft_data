**Problem Statement**: Lisa invests $1,000 in a Bank of Springfield Super High Yield savings account with a 1% annual interest rate, compounded annually. We need to determine the interest earned after 5 years, rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the formula for compound interest.  
2. Identify the given values (principal, rate, time, compounding frequency).  
3. Apply the compound interest formula to calculate the final amount.  
4. Subtract the principal from the final amount to find the interest.  
5. Round the interest to the nearest dollar.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the compound interest formula and the given values. This can be achieved by recalling the standard compound interest formula and extracting the relevant information from the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The compound interest formula is:  
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  
where:  
- \( A \) = final amount  
- \( P \) = principal (initial investment)  
- \( r \) = annual interest rate (as a decimal)  
- \( n \) = number of times interest is compounded per year  
- \( t \) = number of years  

From the problem:  
- \( P = 1000 \) dollars  
- \( r = 1\% = 0.01 \)  
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually)  
- \( t = 5 \) years

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the formula and values are correct for calculating the final amount. This can be achieved by ensuring the formula aligns with annual compounding and the values match the problem's conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \) is correct for compound interest. Since the problem specifies annual compounding (\( n = 1 \)), the formula simplifies to:  
\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]  
The values are:  
- \( P = 1000 \)  
- \( r = 0.01 \)  
- \( t = 5 \)  
- \( n = 1 \) (confirmed as annual compounding)  
These values align with the problem statement, so the setup is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the final amount using the compound interest formula with the identified values. This can be achieved by substituting the values into the simplified formula and computing the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the simplified formula \( A = P (1 + r)^t \):  
- \( P = 1000 \)  
- \( r = 0.01 \)  
- \( t = 5 \)  

\[ A = 1000 (1 + 0.01)^5 = 1000 (1.01)^5 \]  

Calculate \( (1.01)^5 \):  
\[ 1.01^2 = 1.0201 \]  
\[ 1.01^3 = 1.0201 \times 1.01 = 1.030301 \]  
\[ 1.01^4 = 1.030301 \times 1.01 = 1.04060401 \]  
\[ 1.01^5 = 1.04060401 \times 1.01 \approx 1.0510100501 \]  

\[ A = 1000 \times 1.0510100501 \approx 1051.0100501 \]  

The final amount is approximately $1051.01.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the interest earned by subtracting the principal from the final amount. This can be achieved by performing the subtraction and rounding to the nearest dollar as requested.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Interest earned = Final amount - Principal  
\[ \text{Interest} = 1051.01 - 1000 = 51.01 \]  

Rounding $51.01 to the nearest dollar gives $51.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
