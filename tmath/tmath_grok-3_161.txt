**Problem Restatement**: A scale drawing of a park uses a scale where 1 inch represents 800 feet. We need to determine how many feet are represented by a line segment in the drawing that measures 4.75 inches.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Understand the scale relationship (1 inch = 800 feet).  
2. Identify the length of the line segment (4.75 inches).  
3. Calculate the real-world length by multiplying the drawing length by the scale factor.  
4. Verify the calculation to ensure accuracy.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the real-world length represented by the 4.75-inch line segment.  
How to Achieve: Multiply the length of the line segment (4.75 inches) by the scale factor (800 feet per inch) to find the corresponding distance in feet.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the real-world length, multiply the drawing length by the scale factor:  
4.75 inches × 800 feet/inch = 4.75 × 800 = 3800 feet.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the accuracy of the calculation.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate the multiplication and check for errors in the setup or arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate: 4.75 × 800 = 3800 feet.  
Break down the multiplication:  
- 4 × 800 = 3200 feet.  
- 0.75 × 800 = 600 feet (since 0.75 = 3/4, and 3/4 × 800 = 600).  
- Total: 3200 + 600 = 3800 feet.  
The calculation is consistent, confirming the result is correct.

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the real-world length represented by a 4.75-inch line segment in the scale drawing.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the scale (1 inch = 800 feet). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the line segment length (4.75 inches). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the real-world length (4.75 × 800 = 3800 feet). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation. [Completed]  
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The final answer is 3800 feet.
