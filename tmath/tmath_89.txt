I am focusing on correcting the formula for connectors to ensure it aligns with the base case (Row 1). The previous formula was $ 2n - 1 $, but this fails for $ n = 1 $. The correct formula must reflect the actual connector count for Row 1, which is 3. For $ n \geq 2 $, the formula $ 2n - 1 $ holds, as connectors in row $ n $ equal the number of unit rods in row $ n - 1 $, which is $ 2(n - 1) + 1 = 2n - 1 $.

Goal of this step: Derive the correct general formula for the number of connectors in an $ n $-row triangle.

[IMP]
We now define the number of connectors as follows:  
- For $ n = 1 $, the number of connectors is 3.  
- For $ n \geq 2 $, the number of connectors in row $ n $ is $ 2n - 1 $.  

To find the total number of connectors in an $ n $-row triangle, we sum the number of connectors in each row:  
$$
\text{Total connectors} = 3 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

We simplify the summation:  
$$
\sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1) = \sum_{k=2}^{n} 2k - \sum_{k=2}^{n} 1 = 2 \sum_{k=2}^{n} k - (n - 1)
$$

Using the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ natural numbers:  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

We compute:  
$$
\sum_{k=2}^{n} k = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k - 1 = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1
$$

Thus:  
$$
\sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1) = 2\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1\right) - (n - 1) = n(n + 1) - 2 - (n - 1) = n(n + 1) - n - 1
$$

Simplifying further:  
$$
n(n + 1) - n - 1 = n^2 + n - n - 1 = n^2 - 1
$$

Adding the base case of 3 connectors for $ n = 1 $:  
$$
\text{Total connectors} = 3 + (n^2 - 1) = n^2 + 2
$$

The total number of connectors in an $ n $-row triangle is given by the formula $ n^2 + 2 $. This accounts for the base case where $ n = 1 $ has 3 connectors and the general case where the connectors in each row correspond to the unit rods in the previous row.

[IMP]
We previously derived the formula for the number of unit rods in the $ n $th row as $ 2n + 1 $. To find the total number of unit rods in an $ n $-row triangle, we sum the unit rods across all rows:  
$$
\text{Total unit rods} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k + 1)
$$  

Simplify the summation:  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k + 1) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
$$  

We use the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ natural numbers:  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n
$$  

Substitute into the equation:  
$$
2 \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + n = n(n + 1) + n = n^2 + n + n = n^2 + 2n
$$  

Thus, the total number of unit rods in an $ n $-row triangle is $ n^2 + 2n $.

[REVIEW]
We derived the total number of pieces in an eight-row triangle as 146, based on the following calculations:  
- Total unit rods = $ 8^2 + 2 \cdot 8 = 64 + 16 = 80 $  
- Total connectors = $ 8^2 + 2 = 64 + 2 = 66 $  
- Total pieces = $ 80 + 66 = 146 $  

To verify, we can recheck the formulas:  
1. **Unit rods** in the $ n $th row are $ 2n + 1 $, so the total unit rods for $ n $ rows is:  
   $$
   \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k + 1) = n^2 + 2n
   $$  
   Substituting $ n = 8 $:  
   $$
   8^2 + 2 \cdot 8 = 64 + 16 = 80
   $$  
   ✅ Correct.  

2. **Connectors** in the $ n $th row are $ 2n - 1 $ for $ n \geq 2 $, with a base case of 3 for $ n = 1 $. The total connectors for $ n $ rows is:  
   $$
   3 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1) = n^2 + 2
   $$  
   Substituting $ n = 8 $:  
   $$
   8^2 + 2 = 64 + 2 = 66
   $$  
   ✅ Correct.  

3. Total pieces = unit rods + connectors = $ 80 + 66 = 146 $  
   ✅ Correct.  

All calculations align with the derived formulas and the base cases. The final answer is verified.

To verify the correctness of the total number of pieces (146) for an eight-row triangle, we must re-examine the derivation of both unit rods and connectors.  

1. **Unit rods calculation**:  
   The formula for total unit rods is $ n^2 + 2n $. For $ n = 8 $:  
   - $ 8^2 = 64 $, $ 2 \cdot 8 = 16 $, so $ 64 + 16 = 80 $.  
   - Alternatively, summing $ 2k + 1 $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ 8 $:  
     $$
     \sum_{k=1}^{8} (2k + 1) = 2 \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{8} k + \sum_{k=1}^{8} 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} + 8 = 72 + 8 = 80.
     $$  
     This aligns with the formula.  

2. **Connectors calculation**:  
   The formula for total connectors is $ n^2 + 2 $. For $ n = 8 $:  
   - $ 8^2 + 2 = 64 + 2 = 66 $.  
   - Manually summing connectors:  
     - Row 1: 3.  
     - Rows 2–8: $ \sum_{k=2}^{8} (2k - 1) = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 63 $.  
     - Total connectors: $ 3 + 63 = 66 $.  
     This matches the formula.  

3. **Total pieces**:  
   $ 80 $ (unit rods) $ + 66 $ (connectors) $ = 146 $.  

All formulas are correctly applied, and arithmetic checks out. No inconsistencies are found.
