### Problem Statement
We need to find the largest number of band members \( n \) (where \( n < 100 \)) such that when arranged in a rectangular formation with \( m \) members per row and \( r \) rows, there are 2 members left over. Additionally, when the number of members per row is increased by 1 (to \( m+1 \)) and the number of rows is decreased by 2 (to \( r-2 \)), the new formation exactly accommodates all \( n \) members. Thus:
- First condition: \( n = m \cdot r + 2 \)
- Second condition: \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \)
- Constraints: \( m \) and \( r \) are positive integers, \( n < 100 \), and \( r \geq 3 \) (since \( r-2 \geq 1 \)).

We aim to maximize \( n \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the largest \( n \).  
1. Derive equations from the given conditions.  
2. Solve the equations to find possible values of \( m \), \( r \), and \( n \).  
3. Ensure all constraints are satisfied (\( n < 100 \), \( m \), \( r \geq 1 \), \( r-2 \geq 1 \)).  
4. Identify the largest possible \( n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive and equate the two conditions to form a system of equations. This will be achieved by setting up the equations \( n = m \cdot r + 2 \) and \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \), then solving for relationships between \( m \), \( r \), and \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- \( n = m \cdot r + 2 \)  
- \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \)  

Equate the two expressions for \( n \):  
\[ m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \]  

Expand and simplify:  
\[ m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1)(r-2) = m \cdot r - 2m + r - 2 \]  
\[ m \cdot r + 2 = m \cdot r - 2m + r - 2 \]  
Subtract \( m \cdot r \) from both sides:  
\[ 2 = -2m + r - 2 \]  
Add 2 to both sides:  
\[ 4 = -2m + r \]  
Rearrange:  
\[ r = 2m + 4 \]  

This gives a relationship between \( r \) and \( m \). Since \( r \) and \( m \) are positive integers and \( r-2 \geq 1 \), we have \( r \geq 3 \).  
Check: \( r = 2m + 4 \geq 3 \). Since \( m \geq 1 \), \( 2m \geq 2 \), so \( r \geq 4 \), which satisfies \( r \geq 3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( r = 2m + 4 \) into one of the equations to express \( n \) in terms of \( m \), then find possible integer solutions for \( m \) and compute \( n \), ensuring \( n < 100 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = 2m + 4 \) into the first equation \( n = m \cdot r + 2 \):  
\[ n = m \cdot (2m + 4) + 2 = 2m^2 + 4m + 2 \]  

Alternatively, use the second equation \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \):  
\[ r-2 = (2m + 4) - 2 = 2m + 2 \]  
\[ n = (m+1) \cdot (2m + 2) = (m+1) \cdot 2 \cdot (m+1) = 2 (m+1)^2 \]  

Verify equivalence:  
\[ 2 (m+1)^2 = 2 (m^2 + 2m + 1) = 2m^2 + 4m + 2 \]  
Both expressions for \( n \) match, confirming consistency.  

Now, compute \( n \) for integer values of \( m \geq 1 \), ensuring \( n < 100 \):  
- For \( m = 1 \): \( n = 2 (1+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \)  
- For \( m = 2 \): \( n = 2 (2+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \)  
- For \( m = 3 \): \( n = 2 (3+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 16 = 32 \)  
- For \( m = 4 \): \( n = 2 (4+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 25 = 50 \)  
- For \( m = 5 \): \( n = 2 (5+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 36 = 72 \)  
- For \( m = 6 \): \( n = 2 (6+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 49 = 98 \)  
- For \( m = 7 \): \( n = 2 (7+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 64 = 128 \), which exceeds 100.  

Possible \( n \): 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98. All are less than 100 except for \( m = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solutions by checking if they satisfy both conditions and constraints, particularly for \( m = 6 \), which gives the largest \( n = 98 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( m = 6 \):  
- Compute \( r \): \( r = 2 \cdot 6 + 4 = 16 \)  
- First condition: \( n = m \cdot r + 2 = 6 \cdot 16 + 2 = 96 + 2 = 98 \)  
- Second condition: \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) = (6+1) \cdot (16-2) = 7 \cdot 14 = 98 \)  
- Constraints: \( n = 98 < 100 \), \( r = 16 \geq 3 \), \( m = 6 \geq 1 \).  

Both conditions are satisfied, and constraints hold.  
Check smaller \( n \), e.g., \( m = 5 \):  
- \( r = 2 \cdot 5 + 4 = 14 \)  
- \( n = 5 \cdot 14 + 2 = 70 + 2 = 72 \)  
- \( n = (5+1) \cdot (14-2) = 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \)  
- Constraints: \( n = 72 < 100 \), \( r = 14 \geq 3 \), \( m = 5 \geq 1 \).  

All computed \( n \) (8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98) satisfy both equations and constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the largest number of band members \( n < 100 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Derive equations from the conditions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( m \), \( r \), and \( n \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify the largest \( n \) (current).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the largest \( n \) from the valid solutions: 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98.  
The largest \( n \) is 98, corresponding to \( m = 6 \), \( r = 16 \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that no larger \( n < 100 \) exists by checking if other approaches (e.g., different \( r \) or \( m \)) yield a larger valid \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 3, \( n = 2 (m+1)^2 \), and \( n < 100 \). We tested \( m = 7 \), which gave \( n = 128 > 100 \).  
Consider if other \( r \) values yield valid solutions. From \( r = 2m + 4 \), \( r \) is even. Test odd \( r \geq 3 \):  
Use the equation \( m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \). Solve for \( m \):  
\[ m \cdot r + 2 = m \cdot r - 2m + r - 2 \]  
\[ 2m = r - 4 \]  
\[ m = \frac{r-4}{2} \]  
For \( m \) to be an integer, \( r-4 \) must be even, so \( r \) must be even, consistent with \( r = 2m + 4 \).  

Test other possible \( n \). Since \( n = m \cdot r + 2 \), and \( n = (m+1) \cdot (r-2) \), try large \( n < 100 \), e.g., \( n = 99 \):  
- \( m \cdot r + 2 = 99 \implies m \cdot r = 97 \). Since 97 is prime, \( m = 1 \), \( r = 97 \).  
- Check: \( n = (1+1) \cdot (97-2) = 2 \cdot 95 = 190 \neq 99 \). Inconsistent.  

Try \( n = 97 \):  
- \( m \cdot r = 95 = 5 \cdot 19 \). Test \( m = 5 \), \( r = 19 \):  
- \( n = (5+1) \cdot (19-2) = 6 \cdot 17 = 102 \neq 97 \).  

No other solutions yield \( n < 100 \). The formula \( n = 2 (m+1)^2 \) covers all valid cases.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The largest number of band members the band could have is **98**.**Problem Statement**: A band with fewer than 100 members is arranged in a rectangular formation with \( m \) members per row and \( r \) rows, leaving 2 members unplaced. When the formation is adjusted to have \( m+1 \) members per row and \( r-2 \) rows, all members fit exactly. We need to find the largest possible number of band members.

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  

1. Translate the problem into mathematical equations based on the given conditions.  
2. Solve the system of equations to find possible values of \( m \), \( r \), and the total number of members \( n \).  
3. Ensure the number of members is less than 100 and identify the largest possible value.  
4. Verify the solution satisfies all conditions.  

[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to translate the problem into mathematical equations. This will be achieved by defining variables for the number of members, rows, and members per row, and setting up equations based on the two formation conditions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( n \) be the total number of band members, \( m \) be the number of members per row, and \( r \) be the number of rows in the initial formation.  

1. In the initial formation, there are \( m \) members in each of \( r \) rows, with 2 members left over. Thus:  
   \[
   n = m \cdot r + 2
   \]  
2. In the adjusted formation, there are \( m+1 \) members per row and \( r-2 \) rows, with all members fitting exactly:  
   \[
   n = (m+1)(r-2)
   \]  
Since \( n \) is the same in both cases, equate the two expressions:  
\[
m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1)(r-2)
\]  
Additionally, \( n < 100 \), so:  
\[
m \cdot r + 2 < 100 \quad \text{or} \quad m \cdot r < 98
\]  
Also, \( m \) and \( r \) are positive integers (since they represent numbers of people and rows), and \( r \geq 3 \) (because reducing by 2 rows must result in a non-negative number of rows, i.e., \( r-2 \geq 1 \)).  

[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations to find possible values of \( m \), \( r \), and \( n \). This will be achieved by manipulating the equation \( m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1)(r-2) \) to express one variable in terms of the other and find integer solutions.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[
m \cdot r + 2 = (m+1)(r-2)
\]  
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
m \cdot r + 2 = m \cdot r - 2m + r - 2
\]  
Subtract \( m \cdot r \) from both sides:  
\[
2 = -2m + r - 2
\]  
Add 2 to both sides:  
\[
4 = -2m + r
\]  
Solve for \( r \):  
\[
r = 2m + 4
\]  
Since \( r \) must be an integer, \( 2m + 4 \) is an integer if \( m \) is an integer. Now, substitute \( r = 2m + 4 \) into the expression for \( n \):  
\[
n = m \cdot r + 2 = m \cdot (2m + 4) + 2 = 2m^2 + 4m + 2
\]  
Ensure \( n < 100 \):  
\[
2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100
\]  
\[
2m^2 + 4m + 2 - 100 < 0
\]  
\[
2m^2 + 4m - 98 < 0
\]  
\[
m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0
\]  
Solve the quadratic equation \( m^2 + 2m - 49 = 0 \) to find the boundary:  
\[
m = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 196}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{200}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm 5\sqrt{2}
\]  
Approximate \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), so:  
\[
5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.07 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m \approx -1 \pm 7.07
\]  
\[
m \approx 6.07 \quad \text{or} \quad m \approx -8.07
\]  
Since \( m \) is a positive integer, test \( m \leq 6 \) (since \( m \approx 6.07 \)). Also, ensure \( r \geq 3 \):  
\[
r = 2m + 4 \geq 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2m \geq -1
\]  
This is always true for positive \( m \). Now compute \( n \) for integer values of \( m \):  
- For \( m = 1 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 1 + 4 = 6 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 1^2 + 4 \cdot 1 + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 \)  
- For \( m = 2 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 2^2 + 4 \cdot 2 + 2 = 8 + 8 + 2 = 18 \)  
- For \( m = 3 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 3 + 4 = 10 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 3^2 + 4 \cdot 3 + 2 = 18 + 12 + 2 = 32 \)  
- For \( m = 4 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 4 + 4 = 12 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 4^2 + 4 \cdot 4 + 2 = 32 + 16 + 2 = 50 \)  
- For \( m = 5 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 5 + 4 = 14 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5 + 2 = 50 + 20 + 2 = 72 \)  
- For \( m = 6 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 6 + 4 = 16 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6 + 2 = 72 + 24 + 2 = 98 \)  
- For \( m = 7 \): \( r = 2 \cdot 7 + 4 = 18 \), \( n = 2 \cdot 7^2 + 4 \cdot 7 + 2 = 98 + 28 + 2 = 128 \) (exceeds 100)  

Possible values of \( n \) are 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, all less than 100 except 128.
