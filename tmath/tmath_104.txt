Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the operation $\spadesuit$ defined as $a\,\spadesuit\,b = |a- b|$.
2. Calculate the inner expression $4\,\spadesuit\,7$.
3. Use the result from step 2 to compute $2\,\spadesuit\,(\text{result from step 2})$.
4. Self-verify the final result for correctness.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the inner expression $4\,\spadesuit\,7$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given the operation $\spadesuit$ as $a\,\spadesuit\,b = |a - b|$, we calculate $4\,\spadesuit\,7$:

$$
4\,\spadesuit\,7 = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the result from step 2 to compute $2\,\spadesuit\,3$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now substitute the result from the previous step into the outer expression:  

$$
2\,\spadesuit\,3 = |2 - 3| = |-1| = 1
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of both arithmetic operations and absolute value calculations in the full expression $2\,\spadesuit\,(4\,\spadesuit\,7)$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Verify inner operation $4\,\spadesuit\,7$:
   - Definition: $a\,\spadesuit\,b = |a - b|$
   - Calculation: $|4 - 7| = |-3|$
   - Absolute value property: $|-3| = 3$ ✔️

2. Verify outer operation $2\,\spadesuit\,3$:
   - Substituted value from first step: 3
   - Calculation: $|2 - 3| = |-1|$
   - Absolute value property: $|-1| = 1$ ✔️

3. Final result $1$ matches both:
   - Sequential application of the operation definition
   - All intermediate steps maintain mathematical consistency
   - No sign errors or absolute value misapplications detected
