**Problem Restatement**: We need to evaluate the expression \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4}\) and express the result as a positive integer.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify each root expression individually: \(\sqrt[4]{16}\), \(\sqrt[3]{8}\), and \(\sqrt{4}\).
2. Multiply the simplified values.
3. Verify the result is a positive integer.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify each root expression.
How to Achieve: Express each root as a fractional exponent, compute the values, and simplify.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \(\sqrt[4]{16}\):
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4}
  \]
  Since \(16 = 2^4\), we have:
  \[
  16^{1/4} = (2^4)^{1/4} = 2^{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = 2^1 = 2
  \]

- For \(\sqrt[3]{8}\):
  \[
  \sqrt[3]{8} = 8^{1/3}
  \]
  Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:
  \[
  8^{1/3} = (2^3)^{1/3} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = 2^1 = 2
  \]

- For \(\sqrt{4}\):
  \[
  \sqrt{4} = 4^{1/2}
  \]
  Since \(4 = 2^2\), we have:
  \[
  4^{1/2} = (2^2)^{1/2} = 2^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^1 = 2
  \]

Simplified values: \(\sqrt[4]{16} = 2\), \(\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\), \(\sqrt{4]{16} = 2\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the simplified values.
How to Achieve: Compute \(2 \times 2 \times 2\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
2 \times 2 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8
\]
The product is 8.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the result is a positive integer.
How to Achieve: Check if 8 is positive and an integer and confirm the original computation by an alternative method.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- 8 is a positive integer (since \(8 > 0\)).
- Alternative method: Compute the expression using exponents:
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4} = 16^{1/4} \times 8^{1/3} \times 4^{1/2}
  \]
  Rewrite in terms of base 2:
  \[
  16 = 2^4, \quad 8 = 2^3, \quad 4 = 2^2
  \]
  So:
  \[
  (2^4)^{1/4} \times (2^3)^{1/3} \times (2^2)^{1/2} = 2^{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} \times 2^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} \times 2^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^1 \times 2^1 \times 2^1 = 2^{1+1+1} = 2^3 =  = 8
  \]
The result matches, confirming 8 is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4]\) and express as a positive integer.
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify each root expression (completed: \(\sqrt[4]{16} = 2\), \(\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\), \(\sqrt{4}\ = 2\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply the simplified values (completed: \(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result is a positive integer (completed: 8 is positive integer, confirmed via exponent method).

Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, with the result 8.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4}\) expressed as a positive integer is **8**.
