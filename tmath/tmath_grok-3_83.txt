**Problem Statement**: We need to evaluate the expression \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4}\) and express the result as a positive integer.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify each root expression individually: \(\sqrt[4]{16}\), \(\sqrt[3]{8}\), and \(\sqrt{4}\).
2. Multiply the simplified values together.
3. Verify that the result is a positive integer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify each root expression (\(\sqrt[4]{16}\), \(\sqrt[3]{8}\), \(\sqrt{4}\)).
How to Achieve: Rewrite each root as a fractional exponent, compute the value, and express it in its simplest form.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For \(\sqrt[4]{16}\):
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4} = (2^4)^{1/4} = 2^{4 \cdot 1/4} = 2^1 = 2
  \]
- For \(\sqrt[3]{8}\):
  \[
  \sqrt[3]{8} = 8^{1/3} = (2^3)^{1/3} = 2^{3 \cdot 1/3} = 2^1 = 2
  \]
- For \(\sqrt{4}\):
  \[
  \sqrt{4} = 4^{1/2} = (2^2)^{1/2} = 2^{2 \cdot 1/2} = 2^1 = 2
  \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Multiply the simplified values together.
How to Achieve: Take the results from the previous step (\(2\), \(2\), \(2\)) and compute their product.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the result is a positive integer.
How to Achieve: Check if the computed product is a positive integer and confirm the calculations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- The result is \(8\), which is a positive integer.
- To confirm, recompute the expression using exponents:
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4}, \quad \sqrt[3]{8} = 8^{1/3}, \quad \sqrt{4} = 4^{1/2}
  \]
  \[
  16 = 2^4, \quad 8 = 2^3, \quad 4 = 2^2
  \]
  \[
  16^{1/4} \cdot 8^{1/3} \cdot 4^{1/2} = (2^4)^{1/4} \cdot (2^3)^{1/3} \cdot (2^2)^{1/2} = 2^{4 \cdot 1/4} \cdot 2^{3 \cdot 1/3} \cdot 2^{2 \cdot 1/2} = 2^1 \cdot 2^1 \cdot 2^1 = 2^{1+1+1} = 2^3 = 8
  \]
- The calculation is consistent, and \(8\) is a positive integer.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4}\) and express as a positive integer.
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify each root expression (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Multiply the simplified values (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result is a positive integer (Completed).
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The result \(8\) satisfies the main goal.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(\sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt{4}\) expressed as a positive integer is \(8\).
