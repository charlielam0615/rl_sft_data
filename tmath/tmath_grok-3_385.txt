**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( g(x) = 3x + 7 \) and \( f(x) = 5x - 9 \), find the value of \( f(g(8)) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(g(8)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(8) \) using the function \( g(x) = 3x + 7 \).  
2. Use the result from \( g(8) \) as the input to the function \( f(x) = 5x - 9 \) to find \( f(g(8)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(8) \) using the function \( g(x) = 3x + 7 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 8 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 8 \) into \( g(x) = 3x + 7 \):  
\[ g(8) = 3(8) + 7 = 24 + 7 = 31 \]  
So, \( g(8) = 31 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(8)) \), which is \( f(31) \), using the function \( f(x) = 5x - 9 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 31 \) into the expression for \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 31 \) into \( f(x) = 5x - 9 \):  
\[ f(31) = 5(31) - 9 = 155 - 9 = 146 \]  
So, \( f(g(8)) = 146 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(g(8)) = 146 \) by rechecking the steps for accuracy. This will be achieved by recomputing \( g(8) \) and \( f(31) \) to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute \( g(8) \):  
\[ g(8) = 3(8) + 7 = 24 + 7 = 31 \]  
Recompute \( f(31) \):  
\[ f(31) = 5(31) - 9 = 155 - 9 = 146 \]  
The calculations are consistent, confirming \( f(g(8)) = 146 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(8)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(8) \) → Completed, result: \( g(8) = 31 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(g(8)) = f(31) \) → Completed, result: \( f(31) = 146 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result → Completed, result confirmed: \( f(g(8)) = 146 \).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(8)) = 146 \)
