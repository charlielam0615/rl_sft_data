**Problem Restatement**: We need to solve the equation \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) for \(r\) and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) for \(r\), break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Express both sides of the equation with the same base.
2. Equate the exponents since the bases are equal.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(r\).
4. Verify the solution and express \(r\) as a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Since \(4 = 2^2\), rewrite the left-hand side as a power of 2, which allows comparison with the right-hand side.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite \(4\) as \(2^2\). The equation becomes:
\[
2^2 = 2^{5r + 1}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to equate the exponents since both sides have the same base (2). This will give a linear equation in \(r\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the bases are equal, equate the exponents:
\[
2 = 5r + 1
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to solve the linear equation \(2 = 5r + 1\) for \(r\). Subtract 1 from both sides and divide by 5 to isolate \(r\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:
\[
2 = 5r + 1
\]
\[
2 - 1 = 5r
\]
\[
1 = 5r
\]
\[
r = \frac{1}{5}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the solution \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) into the exponent:
\[
5r + 1 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
\]
So, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{5r + 1} = 2^2 = 4
\]
This matches the left-hand side (\(4\)), confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Solve \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) for \(r\) and express as a common fraction.
  - Subgoal 1: Express both sides with the same base (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Equate exponents (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \(r\) (completed, \(r = \frac{1}{5}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solution (completed).
Current goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
The solution \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) is a common fraction, satisfying the problemâ€™s requirement.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(r = \frac{1}{5}\)
