**Problem Statement**: We need to solve the equation \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) for \(r\) and express the answer as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) for \(r\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express 4 as a power of 2 to equate the bases.  
2. Set the exponents equal to each other.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(r\).  
4. Verify the solution and ensure it is a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express 4 as a power of 2 and equate the bases. Since \(4 = 2^2\), rewrite the equation \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\) as \(2^2 = 2^{5r + 1}\), then set the exponents equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite \(4\) as \(2^2\). The equation becomes:  
\[ 2^2 = 2^{5r + 1} \]  
Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:  
\[ 2 = 5r + 1 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(2 = 5r + 1\) for \(r\). Subtract 1 from both sides and divide by 5 to isolate \(r\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[ 2 = 5r + 1 \]  
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
\[ 2 - 1 = 5r \]  
\[ 1 = 5r \]  
Divide both sides by 5:  
\[ r = \frac{1}{5} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) into the original equation \(4 = 2^{5r + 1}\):  
Calculate the exponent:  
\[ 5r + 1 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \]  
So:  
\[ 2^{5r + 1} = 2^2 = 4 \]  
The equation holds:  
\[ 4 = 4 \]  
The solution \(r = \frac{1}{5}\) is correct and is already a common fraction.
