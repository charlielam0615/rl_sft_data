**Problem Restatement**: Find the smallest three-digit number that appears in Pascal's triangle, where Pascal's triangle is constructed such that each entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it, starting with row 0 as [1], row 1 as [1, 1], row 2 as [1, 2, 1], and so on.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle, break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand how numbers are generated in Pascal's triangle.  
2. Identify the range of three-digit numbers (100 to 999).  
3. Determine a method to find numbers in Pascal's triangle efficiently.  
4. Search for the smallest three-digit number by examining relevant rows.  
5. Verify the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Understand how numbers are generated in Pascal's triangle.  
How to Achieve: Define Pascal's triangle entries using binomial coefficients, where the entry in row \( n \), position \( k \) (0-based indexing) is given by \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This will allow calculation of entries without generating the entire triangle.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pascal's triangle starts with row 0: [1]. Each subsequent row is formed by summing adjacent entries from the row above:  
- Row 1: [1, 1]  
- Row 2: [1, 2, 1]  
- Row 3: [1, 3, 3, 1]  
- Row 4: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]  
Mathematically, the entry at row \( n \), position \( k \) is the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \). For example, in row 4, position 2, the entry is \( C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \). This formula enables computing specific entries directly.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the range of three-digit numbers and estimate where they first appear in Pascal's triangle.  
How to Achieve: Since three-digit numbers are from 100 to 999, estimate the smallest row \( n \) where \( C(n, k) \geq 100 \) for some \( k \). Use the fact that binomial coefficients peak around \( k \approx n/2 \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999. To find where they first appear, consider the central binomial coefficient, as it is the largest in each row. For row \( n \), the central term is approximately \( C(n, \lfloor n/2 \rfloor) \). Test rows around where \( C(n, k) \approx 100 \):  
- For \( n = 10 \), central term \( C(10, 5) = \frac{10!}{5!5!} = 252 \).  
- For \( n = 9 \), central term \( C(9, 4) = \frac{9!}{4!5!} = 126 \).  
- For \( n = 8 \), central term \( C(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70 \).  
Since \( C(8, 4) = 70 < 100 \) and \( C(9, 4) = 126 \geq 100 \), three-digit numbers likely start around row 9 or later.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Search for the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.  
How to Achieve: Compute binomial coefficients \( C(n, k) \) starting from row 9, focusing on \( k \) values where \( C(n, k) \geq 100 \), and identify the smallest such number. Check rows systematically.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with row 9:  
- \( C(9, 0) = 1 \), \( C(9, 1) = 9 \), \( C(9, 2) = 36 \), \( C(9, 3) = 84 \), \( C(9, 4) = 126 \).  
- Smallest three-digit number: 126.  
Check row 10:  
- \( C(10, 0) = 1 \), \( C(10, 1) = 10 \), \( C(10, 2) = 45 \), \( C(10, 3) = 120 \), \( C(10, 4) = 210 \), \( C(10, 5) = 252 \).  
- Three-digit numbers: 120, 210, 252.  
- Smallest: 120.  
Check row 11:  
- \( C(11, 3) = \frac{11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 165 \), \( C(11, 4) = \frac{11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 330 \).  
- Three-digit numbers: 165, 330, etc.  
- Smallest: 165.  
Compare: 120 (row 10), 126 (row 9), 165 (row 11). The smallest is 120.  
Check earlier rows (e.g., row 8):  
- \( C(8, 3) = 56 \), \( C(8, 4) = 70 \). No three-digit numbers.  
Thus, 120 appears to be the smallest.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that 120 is the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.  
How to Achieve: Confirm calculations for rows 8 to 10, ensure no smaller three-digit numbers exist in earlier rows, and check if 120 appears elsewhere.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute key values:  
- Row 8: \( C(8, 3) = 56 \), \( C(8, 4) = 70 \). All < 100.  
- Row 9: \( C(9, 3) = 84 \), \( C(9, 4) = 126 \). Only 126 is three-digit.  
- Row 10: \( C(10, 3) = 120 \), \( C(10, 4) = 210 \). Smallest is 120.  
Check if 120 appears in later rows with smaller \( k \):  
- Row 11: \( C(11, 3) = 165 \). No 120.  
Since binomial coefficients increase as \( n \) increases for fixed \( k \), and \( C(n, k) \) must be at least 100, no smaller number than 120 is found in earlier or later rows. Thus, 120 is confirmed as the smallest.

**Final Answer**: The smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 120.
