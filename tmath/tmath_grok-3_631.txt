**Problem Statement**: I need to find the smallest three-digit number that appears in Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, starting with a 1 at the top.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)
I will break down the problem into manageable steps to identify the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle. First, I need to understand the structure of Pascal's triangle and how numbers grow within it. Then, I will determine the range of rows where three-digit numbers (100 to 999) are likely to appear. Finally, I will search systematically through those rows to find the smallest such number by calculating or estimating the values of the binomial coefficients.

Current Goal: Understand the structure and growth of numbers in Pascal's triangle.
Relevant Information:
- Pascal's triangle starts with row 0 containing a single 1.
- Each subsequent row has one more element than the previous row, and each element is a binomial coefficient calculated as C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!), where n is the row number and k is the position in the row.
- Numbers grow largest in the middle of each row for even n, and near the middle for odd n, due to the symmetry of binomial coefficients.
- The numbers increase as row numbers increase, so three-digit numbers will appear in higher rows.

[PLANNING]
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning Category)
I will work backward from the concept of three-digit numbers (100 to 999) to determine which rows of Pascal's triangle are likely to contain such numbers. I need to estimate the smallest row number n where C(n, k) ≥ 100 for some k. This will help narrow down the search area before calculating specific values.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)
Meta-data: Current Goal - Estimate the row in Pascal's triangle where three-digit numbers first appear. I will achieve this by using approximations of binomial coefficients or known values to find the smallest n where C(n, k) is at least 100.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I start by considering the growth of binomial coefficients. For a given row n, the largest number is typically near the middle, around k = n/2. I can use Stirling's approximation or trial and error with smaller rows to estimate when C(n, k) reaches 100.

Let's try calculating C(n, n/2) for increasing values of n (assuming n is even for simplicity):
- For n=6, C(6,3) = 20 (less than 100)
- For n=8, C(8,4) = 70 (less than 100)
- For n=9, C(9,4) = 126 (this is a three-digit number)

Since C(9,4) = 126, which is greater than 100, row 9 already contains a three-digit number. I should check row 8 and row 9 to confirm where three-digit numbers start appearing. Let me list the values in row 9:
- Row 9: 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1
Here, 126 is a three-digit number. Now, checking row 8:
- Row 8: 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1
All numbers are below 100. So, three-digit numbers start in row 9.

[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)
Since I have identified that three-digit numbers start appearing in row 9, I will adjust my subgoals to focus on searching rows starting from row 9 to find the smallest three-digit number. Initially, it seems 126 is a candidate, but I need to ensure there isn't a smaller number in row 9 or subsequent rows near the edges or middle.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)
Meta-data: Current Goal - Identify the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle starting from row 9. I will calculate the binomial coefficients in row 9 and subsequent rows to list all three-digit numbers and find the smallest among them.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I have row 9 values as 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1. The three-digit number here is 126.
Now, I will check row 10 to see if any smaller three-digit numbers appear:
- Row 10: 1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1
Here, 120 is a three-digit number and smaller than 126.

Next, row 11:
- Row 11: 1, 11, 55, 165, 330, 462, 462, 330, 165, 55, 11, 1
Here, 165 is larger than 120.

I notice that as rows increase, the numbers generally get larger, especially in the middle. However, near the edges, they grow slower. Let me check row 14 to see if C(14,2) or C(14,3) could be smaller than 120:
- C(14,2) = 91 (less than 100)
- C(14,3) = 364 (larger than 120)

Row 12:
- C(12,3) = 220 (larger than 120)

Row 13:
- C(13,3) = 286 (larger than 120)

It seems 120 from row 10 is smaller than numbers in subsequent rows for k=3 or higher. I should also check if there is any row where C(n,2) becomes a three-digit number smaller than 120.
- C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2
Set this ≥ 100: n*(n-1)/2 ≥ 100 → n*(n-1) ≥ 200
Solving n^2 - n - 200 ≈ 0, n ≈ (1 + sqrt(801))/2 ≈ 14.6, so n=15
- C(15,2) = 15*14/2 = 105

105 is a three-digit number smaller than 120. Checking further:
- Row 15: C(15,2)=105
- Row 16: C(16,2)=120 (larger than 105)
- Row 17: C(17,2)=136 (larger than 105)

So, 105 appears in row 15 and is smaller than 120. I need to confirm if any row before 15 has a smaller three-digit number, but since C(14,2)=91 is less than 100, row 15 is the first where C(n,2) becomes three-digit, and 105 is the value.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)
Meta-data: Current Goal - Validate if 105 is indeed the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle. I will double-check rows around 15 and earlier rows to ensure no smaller three-digit numbers exist.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I have identified 105 as C(15,2) in row 15. Let's confirm by checking rows just before and after:
- Row 14: Largest numbers are C(14,7)=3432, but edges are C(14,2)=91 (less than 100), C(14,3)=364 (larger than 105).
- Row 15: C(15,2)=105, C(15,3)=455 (larger).
- Earlier rows like row 10 have 120, row 9 have 126, both larger than 105.

Since C(n,2) for n<15 is less than 100 (e.g., C(14,2)=91), and for higher n, C(n,2) increases (e.g., C(16,2)=120), 105 seems to be the smallest three-digit number appearing as C(15,2) and C(15,13) due to symmetry. No smaller three-digit numbers appear in earlier rows or other positions. Thus, 105 is the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.
