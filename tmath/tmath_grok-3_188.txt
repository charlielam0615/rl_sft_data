### Problem Statement
We need to determine the fractional part of a square that is shaded. The square is initially divided into nine equal smaller squares, and the center square is further divided into nine equal smaller squares, with this pattern continuing indefinitely. The Asymptote code provided draws squares of side lengths 162, 54, 18, 6, and 2 (derived from the input values 81, 27, 9, 3, 1, which represent half the side lengths), and shades four specific regions in each square drawn.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Understand the geometric pattern of the square divisions.
2. Interpret the Asymptote code to identify which regions are shaded at each level.
3. Calculate the area of the shaded regions for each iteration.
4. Sum the shaded areas, accounting for the infinite repetition.
5. Compute the fraction of the total area that is shaded.

### Step 2

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the geometric pattern. Analyze the division process and the Asymptote code to describe how the squares are divided and shaded.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The initial square is divided into a 3x3 grid, creating nine smaller squares of equal area. The center square of this grid is further divided into a 3x3 grid, and this process repeats indefinitely. The Asymptote code uses `drawSquares(n)` with `n = 81, 27, 9, 3, 1`, where `n` represents half the side length of the square (since the square is drawn from `(-n,-n)` to `(n,n)`, total side length is `2n`). Thus, the side lengths of the squares are `162, 54, 18, 6, 2`.

For each square, the `drawSquares(n)` function:
- Draws a square from `(-n,-n)` to `(n,n)`.
- Shades four rectangular regions:
  - Top-left: From `(-n,n)` to `(-n/3, n/3)`.
  - Bottom-left: From `(-n,-n)` to `(-n/3, -n/3)`.
  - Bottom-right: From `(n,-n)` to `(n/3, -n/3)`.
  - Top-right: From `(n,n)` to `(n/3, n/3)`.

These regions correspond to four corner squares in the 3x3 grid of each square, as the coordinates `(-n/3, n/3)`, etc., align with the boundaries of the outer four squares in a 3x3 division.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the shaded area at each level. For each square drawn by `drawSquares(n)`, compute the area of the four shaded corner squares and relate it to the division pattern.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Assume the initial square has side length \( S = 162 \) (since `n = 81` gives a side length of `2n = 162`). Its area is \( S^2 = 162^2 \).

- **Level 1 (n = 81, side length = 162)**:
  - The square is divided into a 3x3 grid, so each smaller square has side length \( 162 / 3 = 54 \), area \( 54^2 \).
  - The four corner squares are shaded (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
  - Shaded area: \( 4 \times 54^2 = 4 \times 2916 = 11664 \).

- **Level 2 (n = 27, side length = 54)**:
  - This corresponds to the center square of the previous level, divided into a 3x3 grid.
  - Each smaller square has side length \( 54 / 3 = 18 \), area \( 18^2 = 324 \).
  - Four corner squares are shaded.
  - Shaded area: \( 4 \times 324 = 1296 \).

- **Level 3 (n = 9, side length = 18)**:
  - Center square of the previous level, side length 18.
  - Each smaller square: side length \( 18 / 3 = 6 \), area \( 6^2 = 36 \).
  - Shaded area: \( 4 \times 36 = 144 \).

- **Level 4 (n = 3, side length = 6)**:
  - Side length 6, smaller squares have side length \( 6 / 3 = 2 \), area \( 2^2 = 4 \).
  - Shaded area: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).

- **Level 5 (n = 1, side length = 2)**:
  - Side length 2, smaller squares have side length \( 2 / 3 \approx 0.6667 \), area \( (2/3)^2 = 4/9 \).
  - Shaded area: \( 4 \times 4/9 = 16/9 \approx 1.7778 \).

The pattern suggests that at each level \( k \), the side length of the square is \( S / 3^{k-1} \), and the four corner squares of its 3x3 grid are shaded.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**
Since the pattern continues indefinitely, adjust the subgoals to focus on deriving a general formula for the shaded area at each level and summing the infinite series.
New subgoals:
1. Derive the general formula for the shaded area at level \( k \).
2. Sum the infinite series of shaded areas.
3. Compute the fraction relative to the total area.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the general formula for the shaded area at level \( k \). Use the pattern observed to express the shaded area at each level.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For level \( k \):
- The squareâ€™s side length is \( S / 3^{k-1} \), where \( S = 162 \).
- It is divided into a 3x3 grid, so each smaller square has side length \( (S / 3^{k-1}) / 3 = S / 3^k \).
- Area of each smaller square: \( (S / 3^k)^2 = S^2 / 3^{2k} \).
- Four corner squares are shaded.
- Shaded area at level \( k \): \( 4 \times (S^2 / 3^{2k}) = 4 S^2 / 3^{2k} \).

Verify with previous calculations:
- Level 1 (\( k = 1 \)): \( 4 \times 162^2 / 3^2 = 4 \times 26244 / 9 = 11664 \).
- Level 2 (\( k = 2 \)): \( 4 \times 162^2 / 3^4 = 4 \times 26244 / 81 = 1296 \).
- Level 3 (\( k = 3 \)): \( 4 \times 162^2 / 3^6 = 4 \times 26244 / 729 = 144 \).

The formula \( 4 S^2 / 3^{2k} \) holds.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the infinite series of shaded areas. Use the general formula to compute the total shaded area.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total shaded area is the sum from \( k = 1 \) to infinity:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{4 S^2}{3^{2k}} = 4 S^2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(3^2)^k} = 4 S^2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{9^k}.
\]
This is a geometric series with first term \( 1/9 \) and common ratio \( 1/9 \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^k = \frac{1/9}{1 - 1/9} = \frac{1/9}{8/9} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]
Thus, total shaded area:
\[
4 S^2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4 S^2}{8} = \frac{S^2}{2}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the shaded fraction. Divide the total shaded area by the total area of the square.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total area of the square: \( S^2 \).
Fraction shaded:
\[
\frac{\text{Shaded area}}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{S^2 / 2}{S^2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution. Check the calculations and ensure the shading pattern aligns with the Asymptote code and problem description.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Pattern Check**: The Asymptote code shades four corner squares at each level, consistent with the 3x3 grid division. The infinite repetition is modeled correctly by the geometric series.
- **Calculation Verification**:
  - Level 1 shaded area: \( 4 \times (162/3)^2 = 11664 \).
  - Level 2: \( 4 \times (54/3)^2 = 1296 \), and so on, matching earlier computations.
  - Series sum: \( 4 S^2 \times \frac{1/9}{8/9} = S^2 / 2 \).
- **Alternative Approach**: Consider the unshaded region (center square at each level). Each center square has area \( (S / 3^k)^2 \), and their sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{S}{3^k}\right)^2 = S^2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{9^k} = S^2 \times \frac{1}{8}.
  \]
  Shaded area: \( S^2 - S^2 / 8 = S^2 \times 7/8 \), which suggests a possible error. Recompute the shaded pattern:
  - The code shades four corners, leaving five squares (center and four non-corners) potentially unshaded or further divided. Since only corners are shaded, sum only the corner areas.
  - Correct series: \( 4 S^2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/9^k = S^2 / 2 \), confirming earlier result.
The fraction \( 1/2 \) is consistent with the shading of four corners at each level.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The fractional part of the figure that is shaded is \( \boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}} \).
