Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply both sides of the equation by $x - 2$ to eliminate the denominator.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Multiplying both sides of the equation $\frac{x+4}{x-2}=3$ by $x - 2$ to eliminate the denominator, we get:
$$
x + 4 = 3(x - 2)
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the resulting linear equation $x + 4 = 3(x - 2)$ for $x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation $x + 4 = 3(x - 2)$:  
$$
x + 4 = 3x - 6
$$  
Next, subtract $x$ from both sides to simplify:  
$$
4 = 2x - 6
$$  
Then, add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with $x$:  
$$
10 = 2x
$$  
Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for $x$:  
$$
x = 5
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Verify that the solution $x = 5$ does not make the original denominator zero.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The original equation is $\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3$. The denominator is $x - 2$. Substituting $x = 5$ into the denominator:  
$$
5 - 2 = 3
$$  
Since the denominator is not zero, $x = 5$ is a valid solution.

[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the solution process of the equation $\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3$ here:  
1. The equation was first transformed into a linear equation by multiplying both sides by $x - 2$, resulting in $x + 4 = 3(x - 2)$.  
2. Solving the linear equation step-by-step gave the solution $x = 5$.  
3. The solution $x = 5$ was verified by substituting it into the denominator $x - 2$, which was confirmed to be non-zero.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of solving $\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3$, including algebraic manipulations, validity of solution, and domain restrictions.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Initial Equation Validity**: The original equation $\frac{x+4}{x-2} = 3$ is undefined when $x = 2$. The solution process correctly avoids this value.

2. **Multiplication Step**: Multiplying both sides by $x - 2$ yields $x + 4 = 3(x - 2)$. This step is valid as long as $x \ne 2$, which is enforced by the domain restriction. The transformation is algebraically correct.

3. **Algebraic Expansion**: Expanding $3(x - 2)$ to $3x - 6$ is correct. Subsequent simplifications:
   - $x + 4 = 3x - 6$
   - Subtracting $x$: $4 = 2x - 6$
   - Adding 6: $10 = 2x$
   - Dividing by 2: $x = 5$
   Each step follows standard linear equation solving techniques and is logically sound.

4. **Denominator Check**: Substituting $x = 5$ into $x - 2$ gives $3 \ne 0$, confirming the solution is in the domain. This critical check was performed.

5. **Final Solution Verification**: While not explicitly shown, substituting $x = 5$ into the original equation gives $\frac{5+4}{5-2} = \frac{9}{3} = 3$, which matches the right-hand side. This confirms the solution satisfies the original equation.

All steps are mathematically valid, domain restrictions were respected, and the solution satisfies the original equation. No errors detected in reasoning or computation.
