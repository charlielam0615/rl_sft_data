### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(1 + g(2)) \), where \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \) and \( g(x) = x + 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve \( f(1 + g(2)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute \( g(2) \).
2. Add 1 to the result of \( g(2) \).
3. Evaluate \( f \) at the result of \( 1 + g(2) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( g(2) \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( g(x) = x + 1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( g(x) \):
\[ g(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( 1 + g(2) \).
How to Achieve: Use the result \( g(2) = 3 \) and add 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Add 1 to \( g(2) \):
\[ 1 + g(2) = 1 + 3 = 4 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( f(1 + g(2)) \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 4 \) (from \( 1 + g(2) \)) into \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[ f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(1 + g(2)) \).
How to Achieve: Recompute each step to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
1. \( g(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).
2. \( 1 + g(2) = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
3. \( f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \).
The calculations are consistent.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(1 + g(2)) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(2) \) (Completed: \( g(2) = 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 1 + g(2) \) (Completed: \( 1 + g(2) = 4 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(4) \) (Completed: \( f(4) = 5 \)).
Current Goal: None (main goal achieved).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(1 + g(2)) \) is \( 5 \).
