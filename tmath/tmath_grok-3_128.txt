**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \) and \( g(x) = x + 1 \), find the value of \( f(1 + g(2)) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( g(2) \).  
2. Add 1 to the result to get \( 1 + g(2) \).  
3. Evaluate \( f \) at the result from step 2, i.e., \( f(1 + g(2)) \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(2) \).  
Description: Use the function \( g(x) = x + 1 \), substitute \( x = 2 \), and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( g(x) = x + 1 \), substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ g(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 1 + g(2) \).  
Description: Add 1 to the result of \( g(2) \), which was computed as 3.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the result from the previous step, \( g(2) = 3 \):  
\[ 1 + g(2) = 1 + 3 = 4 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(1 + g(2)) \).  
Description: Use the function \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \), substitute \( x = 1 + g(2) = 4 \), and calculate the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \), substitute \( x = 4 \):  
\[ f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of \( f(1 + g(2)) \).  
Description: Recalculate each step to ensure correctness: recompute \( g(2) \), \( 1 + g(2) \), and \( f(1 + g(2)) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Recompute \( g(2) \): \( g(x) = x + 1 \), so \( g(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).  
- Recompute \( 1 + g(2) \): \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).  
- Recompute \( f(4) \): \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \), so \( f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 5 \).  
All steps match the previous calculations, confirming the result is correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(1 + g(2)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( g(2) \) (completed: \( g(2) = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 1 + g(2) \) (completed: \( 1 + g(2) = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(1 + g(2)) \) (completed: \( f(4) = 5 \)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \( f(1 + g(2)) = 5 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(1 + g(2)) = 5 \)
