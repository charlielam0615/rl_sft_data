### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the expression \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\):  
1. Compute \(109^2\).  
2. Compute \(100^2\).  
3. Subtract the results: \(109^2 - 100^2\).  
4. Divide the difference by 9 to obtain the final result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(109^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the square of 109 using multiplication.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \(109^2\):  
\(109 \times 109 = 11881\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(100^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the square of 100 using multiplication.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \(100^2\):  
\(100 \times 100 = 10000\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(109^2 - 100^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the result of \(100^2\) from \(109^2\). Alternatively, recognize that \(109^2 - 100^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((109 - 100)(109 + 100)\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the results from previous steps:  
\(109^2 = 11881\), \(100^2 = 10000\).  
\(11881 - 10000 = 1881\).  

Alternatively, using the difference of squares formula:  
\(109^2 - 100^2 = (109 - 100)(109 + 100) = 9 \times 209 = 1881\).  
Both methods confirm the result is 1881.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of \(109^2 - 100^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the difference of squares calculation and ensure consistency with the direct subtraction method.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The difference of squares gave:  
\((109 - 100)(109 + 100) = 9 \times 209 = 1881\).  
Direct subtraction gave:  
\(11881 - 10000 = 1881\).  
Both results match, confirming the calculation is correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Divide the difference by 9 to compute \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the result from the previous step (\(1881\)) and divide it by 9.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\(1881 \div 9 = 209\).  
To verify: \(9 \times 209 = 1881\), which is correct.  
Thus, \(\frac{1881}{9} = 209\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(109^2\) (completed: \(11881\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(100^2\) (completed: \(10000\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(109^2 - 100^2\) (completed: \(1881\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the difference by 9 (completed: \(209\)).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the result.  
The calculations are complete, and the result is \(209\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\) is \(209\).
