**Problem Statement**: Calculate the value of the expression \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the expression.  
1. Compute \(109^2\).  
2. Compute \(100^2\).  
3. Subtract the results: \(109^2 - 100^2\).  
4. Divide the difference by 9 to obtain the final result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(109^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the square of 109.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\(109^2 = 109 \times 109 = 11881\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(100^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the square of 100.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\(100^2 = 100 \times 100 = 10000\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(109^2 - 100^2\).  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract the result of \(100^2\) from \(109^2\). Alternatively, recognize that \(109^2 - 100^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((109 - 100)(109 + 100)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the difference of squares:  
\(109^2 - 100^2 = (109 - 100)(109 + 100) = 9 \times 209 = 1881\).  
Alternatively, using the results from previous steps:  
\(11881 - 10000 = 1881\).  
Both methods confirm the result is 1881.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Divide the difference by 9 to find \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the result from the previous step and divide by 9.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\(\frac{1881}{9} = 209\).  
To verify, \(9 \times 209 = 1881\), so the division is exact.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(109^2\) (completed: 11881).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(100^2\) (completed: 10000).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(109^2 - 100^2\) (completed: 1881).  
  - Subgoal 4: Divide the difference by 9 (completed: 209).  
**Current Goal**: Completed the main goal, as all subgoals have been addressed.  
The final result is 209.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\) is 209.
