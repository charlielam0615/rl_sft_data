A geometric sequence is defined by a constant ratio $ r $ between consecutive terms. Given the first term $ a = 6 $ and the second term $ ar = -6 $, we can solve for the common ratio $ r $ as follows:

$$
r = \frac{\text{second term}}{\text{first term}} = \frac{-6}{6} = -1
$$

Thus, the common ratio $ r $ is $ -1 $.

The general formula for the $ n^{th} $ term of a geometric sequence is:  

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
$$

where:  
- $ a $ is the first term,  
- $ r $ is the common ratio, and  
- $ n $ is the term number.  

Substituting the known values $ a = 6 $ and $ r = -1 $, we get:  

$$
a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1}
$$

This formula gives the $ n^{th} $ term of the sequence.

1. Use the formula $ a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} $ to calculate the 205th term.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the formula $ a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} $ to calculate the 205th term.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the 205th term, substitute $ n = 205 $ into the formula:  

$$
a_{205} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{205-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{204}
$$

Since $ (-1)^{204} = 1 $ (because 204 is even), the 205th term is:  

$$
a_{205} = 6 \cdot 1 = 6
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the 205th term calculation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The calculation for the 205th term involved evaluating (-1)^{204}. Since 204 is even, (-1)^{even} = 1. Multiplying this by 6 gives 6. 

To verify the pattern, observe the sequence:
- 1st term (n=1): 6 * (-1)^{0} = 6 * 1 = 6
- 2nd term (n=2): 6 * (-1)^{1} = 6 * (-1) = -6
- 3rd term (n=3): 6 * (-1)^{2} = 6 * 1 = 6
- 4th term (n=4): 6 * (-1)^{3} = 6 * (-1) = -6
...
This alternating pattern confirms that odd-numbered terms are 6 and even-numbered terms are -6. Since 205 is odd, the term must be 6. The calculation aligns with this pattern and the mathematical properties of exponents. No errors detected.
