### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( c \) in the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \), given that it passes through the points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( c \), we need to determine the coefficients \( b \) and \( c \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \). Since the parabola passes through the points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\), we can substitute these points into the equation to form a system of linear equations. The subgoals are:
1. Substitute the points into the equation to create two equations.
2. Solve the system of equations for \( b \) and \( c \).
3. Extract the value of \( c \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Substitute the given points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\) into the parabola equation to form two linear equations.
How to Achieve: Plug the x- and y-coordinates of each point into \( y = x^2 + bx + c \). For \((-1, -11)\), set \( x = -1 \), \( y = -11 \). For \((3, 17)\), set \( x = 3 \), \( y = 17 \). This will yield two equations in terms of \( b \) and \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \((-1, -11)\):
\[
-11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c
\]
\[
-11 = 1 - b + c
\]
\[
-b + c = -12 \quad (1)
\]

Substitute \((3, 17)\):
\[
17 = (3)^2 + b(3) + c
\]
\[
17 = 9 + 3b + c
\]
\[
3b + c = 8 \quad (2)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of linear equations \(-b + c = -12\) and \(3b + c = 8\) to find \( b \) and \( c \).
How to Achieve: Use the elimination method to eliminate one variable (e.g., \( c \)) by subtracting the equations, then solve for \( b \). Substitute \( b \) back into one of the equations to find \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have:
\[
-b + c = -12 \quad (1)
\]
\[
3b + c = 8 \quad (2)
\]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \( c \):
\[
(3b + c) - (-b + c) = 8 - (-12)
\]
\[
3b + c + b - c = 8 + 12
\]
\[
4b = 20
\]
\[
b = 5
\]

Substitute \( b = 5 \) into equation (1):
\[
-(5) + c = -12
\]
\[
c - 5 = -12
\]
\[
c = -7
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the values \( b = 5 \) and \( c = -7 \) satisfy the original conditions by checking if the parabola \( y = x^2 + 5x - 7 \) passes through both points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\).
How to Achieve: Substitute \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\) into \( y = x^2 + 5x - 7 \) and check if the equation holds for both points.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \((-1, -11)\):
\[
y = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 7 = 1 - 5 - 7 = -11
\]
This matches \( y = -11 \).

Check \((3, 17)\):
\[
y = (3)^2 + 5(3) - 7 = 9 + 15 - 7 = 17
\]
This matches \( y = 17 \).

Both points satisfy the equation, confirming \( b = 5 \) and \( c = -7 \).

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( c \) in \( y = x^2 + bx + c \).
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\) to form equations (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations for \( b \) and \( c \) (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed in Step 4).
  - Subgoal 4: Extract the value of \( c \) (to be confirmed).

Current Goal: Confirm the value of \( c \).
The solution from Step 3 gives \( c = -7 \), and Step 4 validated that this value is correct.

### Final Answer
The value of \( c \) is \(-7\).
