**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( c \), we need to determine the coefficients \( b \) and \( c \) in the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \). Since the parabola passes through the points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\), we can substitute these points into the equation to form a system of linear equations. The subgoals are:  
1. Substitute the given points into the parabola equation to create equations.  
2. Solve the system of equations to find \( b \) and \( c \).  
3. Extract the value of \( c \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute the given points \((-1, -11)\) and \((3, 17)\) into the parabola equation to form a system of equations.  
How to Achieve: Plug \( x = -1, y = -11 \) and \( x = 3, y = 17 \) into \( y = x^2 + bx + c \) to generate two equations in terms of \( b \) and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For point \((-1, -11)\):  
\( y = x^2 + bx + c \)  
\( -11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \)  
\( -11 = 1 - b + c \)  
\( -b + c = -12 \quad (1) \)

For point \((3, 17)\):  
\( y = x^2 + bx + c \)  
\( 17 = 3^2 + b(3) + c \)  
\( 17 = 9 + 3b + c \)  
\( 3b + c = 8 \quad (2) \)

We now have the system of equations:  
1. \( -b + c = -12 \)  
2. \( 3b + c = 8 \)

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find \( b \) and \( c \).  
How to Achieve: Use elimination or substitution to solve the system of equations from Step 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
System of equations:  
1. \( -b + c = -12 \)  
2. \( 3b + c = 8 \)

Eliminate \( c \) by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):  
\( (3b + c) - (-b + c) = 8 - (-12) \)  
\( 3b + c + b - c = 8 + 12 \)  
\( 4b = 20 \)  
\( b = 5 \)

Substitute \( b = 5 \) into equation (1):  
\( -5 + c = -12 \)  
\( c = -12 + 5 \)  
\( c = -7 \)  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the parabola \( y = x^2 + 5x - 7 \) passes through the given points.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 3 \) into the equation and confirm the corresponding \( y \)-values match \(-11\) and \(17\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For point \((-1, -11)\):  
\( y = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 7 = 1 - 5 - 7 = -11 \)  
This matches \( y = -11 \).

For point \((3, 17)\):  
\( y = 3^2 + 5(3) - 7 = 9 + 15 - 7 = 17 \)  
This matches \( y = 17 \).

The values satisfy both points, confirming the solution is correct.
