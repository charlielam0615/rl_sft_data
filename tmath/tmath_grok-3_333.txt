**Problem Restatement**: Find the length of the line segment with endpoints at coordinates (2, 3) and (7, 15).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the length of the segment, break the problem into subgoals:
1. Identify the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
2. Extract the coordinates of the given points.
3. Apply the formula using the coordinates to compute the length.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, which is foundational for computing the segment length.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a coordinate plane is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
This formula is relevant to the current goal of finding the segment length.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to extract the coordinates of the given points and apply the distance formula. Achieve this by identifying the coordinates (2, 3) and (7, 15) from the problem and substituting them into the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given points: (2, 3) and (7, 15).
Assign:
- \(x_1 = 2\), \(y_1 = 3\)
- \(x_2 = 7\), \(y_2 = 15\)

Using the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(7 - 2)^2 + (15 - 3)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{25 + 144}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{169}
\]
\[
= 13
\]
The length of the segment is 13 units.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computed distance. Achieve this by rechecking the coordinate substitution and calculations in the distance formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute to validate:
- Points: (2, 3) and (7, 15)
- Differences: \(x_2 - x_1 = 7 - 2 = 5\), \(y_2 - y_1 = 15 - 3 = 12\)
- Squares: \(5^2 = 25\), \(12^2 = 144\)
- Sum: \(25 + 144 = 169\)
- Square root: \(\sqrt{169} = 13\)

The calculations are consistent, confirming the length is 13 units.

### Final Answer
The length of the segment with endpoints (2, 3) and (7, 15) is 13 units.
