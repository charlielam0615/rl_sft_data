**Problem Statement**: Find the length of the line segment with endpoints at (2,3) and (7,15).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the length of the segment, break down the goal into subgoals:
1. Identify the formula for the distance between two points.
2. Extract the coordinates of the endpoints.
3. Apply the formula to calculate the length.
4. Simplify the result to find the final length.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve the distance formula for two points in a coordinate plane, as it is essential for calculating the segment length.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
This formula is relevant to the current goal of calculating the length of the segment with endpoints (2,3) and (7,15).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to apply the distance formula using the coordinates (2,3) and (7,15). Substitute the coordinates into the formula and compute the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given the endpoints (2,3) and (7,15):
- Let \((x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (7, 15)\).
- Substitute into the distance formula:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(7 - 2)^2 + (15 - 3)^2}
  \]
- Calculate:
  \[
  = \sqrt{(5)^2 + (12)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13
  \]
The length of the segment is 13 units.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: Verify the calculation by rechecking the coordinate differences and the application of the distance formula to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the differences:
- \(x_2 - x_1 = 7 - 2 = 5\)
- \(y_2 - y_1 = 15 - 3 = 12\)
Square and sum:
- \(5^2 = 25\), \(12^2 = 144\), so \(25 + 144 = 169\)
Take the square root:
- \(\sqrt{169} = 13\)
The calculation is correct, confirming the length is 13 units.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Calculate the length of the segment with endpoints (2,3) and (7,15).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the distance formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Extract coordinates (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed).
