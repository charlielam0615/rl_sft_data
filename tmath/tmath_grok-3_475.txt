### Problem Restatement
We need to determine how many ounces of pure water must be added to 30 ounces of a 30% acid solution to create a solution that is 20% acid.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the amount of water to add:  
1. Define the initial amount of acid in the 30% solution.  
2. Set up an equation based on the final solution being 20% acid.  
3. Solve for the amount of water to be added.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the initial amount of acid in the 30-ounce solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the given concentration (30%) and total volume (30 ounces) to find the amount of acid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The initial solution is 30 ounces with a 30% acid concentration.  
Amount of acid = 30 Ã— 0.30 = 9 ounces.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Refine the subgoals based on progress:  
1. Use the calculated 9 ounces of acid to set up an equation for the final 20% acid solution.  
2. Solve for the amount of water to be added.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up an equation to represent the final solution being 20% acid.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( x \) be the ounces of water added. The total volume of the new solution is \( 30 + x \), and the amount of acid remains 9 ounces. The final concentration is 20%, so set up the equation: \( \frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.20 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The amount of acid remains 9 ounces since pure water contains no acid. The total volume after adding \( x \) ounces of water is \( 30 + x \). For the final solution to be 20% acid:  
\[ \frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.20 \]  
Multiply both sides by \( 30 + x \):  
\[ 9 = 0.20 \times (30 + x) \]  
Divide by 0.20:  
\[ 30 + x = \frac{9}{0.20} = 45 \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = 45 - 30 = 15 \]  
So, 15 ounces of water must be added.

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if adding 15 ounces of water results in a 20% acid solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the concentration of the new solution using the total volume and acid amount.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total volume after adding 15 ounces of water: \( 30 + 15 = 45 \) ounces.  
Amount of acid: 9 ounces (unchanged).  
Concentration = \( \frac{9}{45} = 0.20 = 20\% \).  
The calculation confirms that adding 15 ounces of water yields a 20% acid solution.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine how many ounces of water to add to 30 ounces of a 30% acid solution to get a 20% acid solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the initial amount of acid (completed: 9 ounces).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up an equation for the final 20% acid solution (completed: \( \frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the amount of water (completed: 15 ounces).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed: confirmed 20% concentration).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  
The final answer is 15 ounces of water.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
Add 15 ounces of pure water to the 30 ounces of 30% acid solution to yield a 20% acid solution.
