### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many ounces of pure water must be added to 30 ounces of a 30% acid solution to create a solution that is 20% acid.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the amount of water to add:  
1. Calculate the initial amount of acid in the 30% solution.  
2. Define the total volume and acid amount in the final 20% solution.  
3. Set up an equation to balance the acid amounts before and after adding water.  
4. Solve for the unknown amount of water.  
5. Validate the solution.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the initial amount of acid in the 30% solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the volume of the initial solution (30 ounces) by the acid concentration (30% or 0.3) to find the ounces of acid.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The initial solution is 30 ounces with a 30% acid concentration.  
Amount of acid = 30 Ã— 0.3 = 9 ounces.  
So, the initial solution contains 9 ounces of acid.

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Define the total volume and acid amount in the final 20% solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( x \) be the ounces of pure water added. The total volume of the new solution is \( 30 + x \) ounces, and it must be 20% acid. The amount of acid remains 9 ounces (since water contains no acid). Set up the equation for the final concentration: the acid amount (9 ounces) divided by the total volume (\( 30 + x \)) equals 20% (0.2).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( x \) be the ounces of water added.  
- Total volume of the new solution = \( 30 + x \) ounces.  
- Amount of acid = 9 ounces (unchanged, as water has 0% acid).  
- The final solution is 20% acid, so:  
  \[
  \frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.2
  \]  
This equation represents the concentration of acid in the final solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation to find the amount of water (\( x \)).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the equation \(\frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.2\) for \( x \). Multiply both sides by \( 30 + x \), then isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation:  
\[
\frac{9}{30 + x} = 0.2
\]  
Multiply both sides by \( 30 + x \):  
\[
9 = 0.2 \times (30 + x)
\]  
Divide by 0.2 (or multiply by 5):  
\[
9 \times 5 = 30 + x
\]  
\[
45 = 30 + x
\]  
\[
x = 45 - 30 = 15
\]  
So, 15 ounces of water must be added.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Check if adding 15 ounces of water results in a 20% acid solution.  
**How to Achieve**: Calculate the total volume and acid concentration of the new solution and verify it equals 20%.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Initial solution: 30 ounces with 9 ounces of acid.  
- Add 15 ounces of water (0% acid).  
- New total volume = \( 30 + 15 = 45 \) ounces.  
- Acid amount = 9 ounces (unchanged).  
- New concentration = \(\frac{9}{45} = 0.2 = 20\%\).  
The concentration matches the target of 20%, so the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the ounces of water to add to 30 ounces of 30% acid solution to get a 20% acid solution.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate initial acid amount (completed: 9 ounces).  
  - Subgoal 2: Define total volume and acid amount in final solution (completed: set up equation).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for water amount (completed: \( x = 15 \) ounces).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate solution (completed: confirmed 20% concentration).  
**Current Goal**: None (problem solved).  
The solution process is complete, and all subgoals have been addressed.

### Final Answer
15 ounces of pure water must be added to 30 ounces of a 30% acid solution to yield a 20% acid solution.
