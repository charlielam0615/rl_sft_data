**Problem Restatement**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 8^{4x-6} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{x+5} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Rewrite both sides with the same base to simplify the equation.
2. Equate the exponents since the bases will be equal.
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite both sides with the same base.
How to Achieve: Express 8 and \( \frac{1}{2} \) as powers of 2, since \( 8 = 2^3 \) and \( \frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1} \). Rewrite the equation accordingly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the left side: \( 8^{4x-6} = (2^3)^{4x-6} = 2^{3(4x-6)} = 2^{12x-18} \).
Rewrite the right side: \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{x+5} = (2^{-1})^{x+5} = 2^{-(x+5)} = 2^{-x-5} \).
The equation becomes: \( 2^{12x-18} = 2^{-x-5} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Equate the exponents since the bases are the same.
How to Achieve: Since both sides are powers of 2, set the exponents equal to each other: \( 12x - 18 = -x - 5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Set the exponents equal: \( 12x - 18 = -x - 5 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the linear equation for \( x \).
How to Achieve: Simplify the equation \( 12x - 18 = -x - 5 \) by isolating \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Add \( x \) to both sides: \( 12x + x - 18 = -5 \), so \( 13x - 18 = -5 \).
Add 18 to both sides: \( 13x = -5 + 18 = 13 \).
Divide by 13: \( x = \frac{13}{13} = 1 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 1 \).
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Left side: \( 8^{4(1)-6} = 8^{4-6} = 8^{-2} = \frac{1}{8^2} = \frac{1}{64} \).
Right side: \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{1+5} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64} \).
Since \( \frac{1}{64} = \frac{1}{64} \), the solution \( x = 1 \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
