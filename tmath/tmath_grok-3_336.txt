### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the equation \( 8^{4x-6} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5} \), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express both sides of the equation with the same base to simplify comparison.  
2. Equate the exponents, as equal bases imply equal exponents.  
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Since \( 8 = 2^3 \) and \( \frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1} \), rewrite both sides in terms of base 2 to simplify the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \( 8^{4x-6} \):  
Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we have \( 8^{4x-6} = (2^3)^{4x-6} = 2^{3(4x-6)} = 2^{12x-18} \).  

Rewrite \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5} \):  
Since \( \frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1} \), we have \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5} = (2^{-1})^{x+5} = 2^{-(x+5)} = 2^{-x-5} \).  

The equation becomes:  
\( 2^{12x-18} = 2^{-x-5} \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to equate the exponents, as both sides of the equation \( 2^{12x-18} = 2^{-x-5} \) have the same base. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since the bases are equal, equate the exponents:  
\( 12x - 18 = -x - 5 \).  

Solve for \( x \):  
\( 12x + x = -5 + 18 \)  
\( 13x = 13 \)  
\( x = 1 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = 1 \) by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the original equation \( 8^{4x-6} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5} \):  

Left side:  
\( 8^{4(1)-6} = 8^{-2} = \frac{1}{8^2} = \frac{1}{64} \).  

Right side:  
\( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1+5} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64} \).  

Since \( \frac{1}{64} = \frac{1}{64} \), the solution is valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( 8^{4x-6} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5} \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express both sides with the same base (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate the exponents (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the linear equation (completed, \( x = 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and the solution \( x = 1 \) is verified. No further steps are needed.
