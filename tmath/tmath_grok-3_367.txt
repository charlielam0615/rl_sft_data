### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the positive integer \( x \), break the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation to understand its structure.  
2. Test small positive integer values for \( x \) to find a solution, as the equation involves exponential terms and a specific sum (1170).  
3. Verify the solution by substituting back into the equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the equation to facilitate testing values for \( x \).  
Description: Rewrite \( 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \) by simplifying the term \( 1^{x+2} \) and expressing \( 4^x \) in terms of base 2 to explore patterns.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify the equation:  
- \( 1^{x+2} = 1 \) for any \( x \), since any positive power of 1 is 1.  
- \( 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} \).  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ 1 + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 2^{2x} = 1170. \]  
This form is still complex, but it confirms \( 1^{x+2} \) contributes a constant 1. Next, test small positive integers for \( x \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Test small positive integer values for \( x \) to find a solution.  
Description: Substitute \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) into the original equation \( 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \), compute the sum, and check if it equals 1170.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test values:  
- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ 1^{1+2} + 2^{1+1} + 3^{1-1} + 4^1 = 1^3 + 2^2 + 3^0 + 4 = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 \neq 1170. \]  
- For \( x = 2 \):  
  \[ 1^{2+2} + 2^{2+1} + 3^{2-1} + 4^2 = 1^4 + 2^3 + 3^1 + 16 = 1 + 8 + 3 + 16 = 28 \neq 1170. \]  
- For \( x = 3 \):  
  \[ 1^{3+2} + 2^{3+1} + 3^{3-1} + 4^3 = 1^5 + 2^4 + 3^2 + 64 = 1 + 16 + 9 + 64 = 90 \neq 1170. \]  
- For \( x = 4 \):  
  \[ 1^{4+2} + 2^{4+1} + 3^{4-1} + 4^4 = 1^6 + 2^5 + 3^3 + 256 = 1 + 32 + 27 + 256 = 316 \neq 1170. \]  
- For \( x = 5 \):  
  \[ 1^{5+2} + 2^{5+1} + 3^{5-1} + 4^5 = 1^7 + 2^6 + 3^4 + 1024 = 1 + 64 + 81 + 1024 = 1170. \]  
The sum equals 1170 when \( x = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 5 \).  
Description: Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and confirm the sum is 1170. Check if other values (e.g., \( x = 6 \)) yield the same sum to ensure uniqueness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify \( x = 5 \):  
\[ 1^{5+2} + 2^{5+1} + 3^{5-1} + 4^5 = 1^7 + 2^6 + 3^4 + 4^5 = 1 + 64 + 81 + 1024 = 1170. \]  
This matches the target sum.  
Test \( x = 6 \):  
\[ 1^{6+2} + 2^{6+1} + 3^{6-1} + 4^6 = 1^8 + 2^7 + 3^5 + 4^6 = 1 + 128 + 243 + 4096 = 4468 \neq 1170. \]  
Since the sum for \( x = 6 \) is much larger and the function \( f(x) = 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x \) is increasing (as higher powers grow rapidly), no larger \( x \) is likely to yield 1170. Smaller values were tested in Step 3 and failed. Thus, \( x = 5 \) is the solution.
