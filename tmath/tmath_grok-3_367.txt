**Problem Statement**: Find the positive integer \( x \) such that \( 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( x \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation where possible.  
2. Test positive integer values for \( x \) since the equation involves exponential terms and the sum must equal 1170.  
3. Evaluate the equation for each integer to find the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the equation and test positive integer values for \( x \). Since \( 1^{x+2} = 1 \) for any \( x \), simplify the equation to \( 1 + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \). Test small positive integers (e.g., \( x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \)) by computing the sum and comparing it to 1170.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify the equation:  
\[ 1^{x+2} = 1 \] for any positive integer \( x \), so the equation becomes:  
\[ 1 + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \]  

Test small positive integer values for \( x \):  

- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ 1 + 2^{1+1} + 3^{1-1} + 4^1 = 1 + 2^2 + 3^0 + 4^1 = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 \]  
  \( 10 \neq 1170 \).  

- For \( x = 2 \):  
  \[ 1 + 2^{2+1} + 3^{2-1} + 4^2 = 1 + 2^3 + 3^1 + 4^2 = 1 + 8 + 3 + 16 = 28 \]  
  \( 28 \neq 1170 \).  

- For \( x = 3 \):  
  \[ 1 + 2^{3+1} + 3^{3-1} + 4^3 = 1 + 2^4 + 3^2 + 4^3 = 1 + 16 + 9 + 64 = 90 \]  
  \( 90 \neq 1170 \).  

- For \( x = 4 \):  
  \[ 1 + 2^{4+1} + 3^{4-1} + 4^4 = 1 + 2^5 + 3^3 + 4^4 = 1 + 32 + 27 + 256 = 316 \]  
  \( 316 \neq 1170 \).  

- For \( x = 5 \):  
  \[ 1 + 2^{5+1} + 3^{5-1} + 4^5 = 1 + 2^6 + 3^4 + 4^5 = 1 + 64 + 81 + 1024 = 1170 \]  
  \( 1170 = 1170 \).  

The value \( x = 5 \) satisfies the equation.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 5 \) by rechecking the calculation and ensuring no other positive integers satisfy the equation. Recalculate for \( x = 5 \) and test \( x = 6 \) to confirm the uniqueness of the solution.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recheck for \( x = 5 \):  
\[ 1^{5+2} + 2^{5+1} + 3^{5-1} + 4^5 = 1^7 + 2^6 + 3^4 + 4^5 = 1 + 64 + 81 + 1024 = 1170 \]  
This confirms \( x = 5 \) is correct.  

Test \( x = 6 \):  
\[ 1^{6+2} + 2^{6+1} + 3^{6-1} + 4^6 = 1 + 2^7 + 3^5 + 4^6 = 1 + 128 + 125 + 4096 = 4350 \]  
\( 4350 \neq 1170 \), and 4350 is much larger than 1170, suggesting that higher values of \( x \) will yield even larger sums due to the exponential growth of \( 2^{x+1} \), \( 3^{x-1} \), and \( 4^x \).  

Since the sum increases rapidly and \( x = 5 \) matches exactly, it is likely the only solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the positive integer \( x \) such that \( 1^{x+2} + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation (completed: \( 1^{x+2} = 1 \), so equation is \( 1 + 2^{x+1} + 3^{x-1} + 4^x = 1170 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Test positive integer values for \( x \) (completed: tested \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 5 \), found \( x = 5 \) works).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: rechecked \( x = 5 \), tested \( x = 6 \)).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution \( x = 5 \) is unique and complete the problem.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
