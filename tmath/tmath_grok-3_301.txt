**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) with \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \), find the value of \( f(3) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(3) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the given conditions \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \) to form equations involving \( a \) and \( b \).  
2. Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
3. Substitute \( a \) and \( b \) into the function \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) to compute \( f(3) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to form equations using \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \). Achieve this by substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) to create two equations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \):  
\( f(1) = a(1) + b(1) + 2 = a + b + 2 = 5 \)  
\( a + b = 3 \) (Equation 1)  

Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\( f(2) = a(2) + b(2) + 2 = 2a + 2b + 2 = 8 \)  
\( 2a + 2b = 6 \)  
Divide by 2: \( a + b = 3 \) (Equation 2)  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the equations formed. Verify if the equations are consistent and sufficient to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Equations 1 and 2 are identical: \( a + b = 3 \). This indicates a dependency, meaning there are infinitely many solutions for \( a \) and \( b \) where \( a + b = 3 \). However, we need to check if this affects computing \( f(3) \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the equations are dependent, adjust the approach. Instead of solving for unique \( a \) and \( b \), express \( f(x) \) in terms of the constraint \( a + b = 3 \) and compute \( f(3) \) directly.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(3) \) using the function \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) and the constraint \( a + b = 3 \). Substitute \( x = 3 \) and simplify using \( a + b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The function is \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 = (a + b)x + 2 \).  
Since \( a + b = 3 \), we have:  
\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \).  
Compute \( f(3) \):  
\( f(3) = 3(3) + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \( f(3) = 11 \). Check if \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \) satisfies the given conditions \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check \( f(1) \):  
\( f(1) = 3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which matches.  

Check \( f(2) \):  
\( f(2) = 3(2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \), which matches.  

The function \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \) is consistent with the given conditions, so \( f(3) = 11 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Form equations using \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) (adjusted due to dependency).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(3) \) using \( a + b = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved with \( f(3) = 11 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = 11 \).
