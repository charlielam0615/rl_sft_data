**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) with \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \), find the value of \( f(3) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( f(3) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the given points \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \) to set up equations for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).  
2. Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
3. Substitute \( a \) and \( b \) into \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) to define the function.  
4. Compute \( f(3) \) using the defined function.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations using \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \) to find \( a \) and \( b \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) and forming a system of linear equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \):  
\[ f(1) = a(1) + b(1) + 2 = a + b + 2 = 5 \]  
\[ a + b = 3 \quad (1) \]

Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
\[ f(2) = a(2) + b(2) + 2 = 2a + 2b + 2 = 8 \]  
\[ 2a + 2b = 6 \]  
\[ a + b = 3 \quad (2) \]  

Notice that equations (1) and (2) are identical (\( a + b = 3 \)), indicating that the system may not provide unique values for \( a \) and \( b \). This suggests a potential issue with the function definition or problem constraints.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the system of equations. Check if the identical equations indicate a mistake in the problem setup or if the function \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \) can be simplified, and assess whether we can proceed to find \( f(3) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The function is given as \( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \). Notice that \( ax + bx = (a + b)x \), so:  
\[ f(x) = (a + b)x + 2 \]  
Let \( c = a + b \). Then the function simplifies to:  
\[ f(x) = cx + 2 \]  

Using \( f(1) = 5 \):  
\[ c(1) + 2 = 5 \]  
\[ c = 3 \]  

Using \( f(2) = 8 \):  
\[ c(2) + 2 = 3(2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]  
This satisfies the condition, confirming the function \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \). The identical equations (\( a + b = 3 \)) suggest that \( a \) and \( b \) are not uniquely determined, but their sum \( c = a + b = 3 \) is sufficient to define \( f(x) \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(3) \) using the function \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 3 \) into the function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \):  
\[ f(3) = 3(3) + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(3) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations using \( f(1) = 5 \) and \( f(2) = 8 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for coefficients to define \( f(x) \) (completed; function is \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(3) \) (completed; result is 11).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution for \( f(3) \). The computation in Step 4 yields \( f(3) = 11 \), and all prior steps align with this result.

**Final Answer**: \( f(3) = 11 \)
