**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression \( 3(x^2 - x^3) + 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) - (4x^3 - x^2) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the coefficients in each term of the expression.  
2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.  
3. Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Distribute the coefficients in each term of the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the distributive property to each term: multiply the coefficients \( 3 \), \( 2 \), and \( -1 \) (from the subtraction) by each term inside their respective parentheses.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For \( 3(x^2 - x^3) \):  
  \( 3 \cdot x^2 = 3x^2 \), \( 3 \cdot (-x^3) = -3x^3 \).  
  Result: \( 3x^2 - 3x^3 \).  
- For \( 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) \):  
  \( 2 \cdot x = 2x \), \( 2 \cdot (-2x^2) = -4x^2 \), \( 2 \cdot 3x^5 = 6x^5 \).  
  Result: \( 2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5 \).  
- For \( -(4x^3 - x^2) \):  
  \( -1 \cdot 4x^3 = -4x^3 \), \( -1 \cdot (-x^2) = x^2 \).  
  Result: \( -4x^3 + x^2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine like terms to simplify the expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Collect all terms from the distributed expression, group them by powers of \( x \), and sum the coefficients for each power.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The distributed expression is:  
\( (3x^2 - 3x^3) + (2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5) + (-4x^3 + x^2) \).  
Group by powers:  
- \( x^5 \): \( 6x^5 \).  
- \( x^3 \): \( -3x^3 - 4x^3 = -7x^3 \).  
- \( x^2 \): \( 3x^2 - 4x^2 + x^2 = (3 - 4 + 1)x^2 = 0x^2 \).  
- \( x \): \( 2x \).  
Simplified expression: \( 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression.  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the simplified expression and extract the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The simplified expression is \( 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \).  
The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the simplification to ensure the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Redo the distribution and combination of like terms, focusing on the \( x^2 \) terms, to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute \( x^2 \) terms:  
- From \( 3(x^2 - x^3) \): \( 3x^2 \).  
- From \( 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) \): \( -4x^2 \).  
- From \( -(4x^3 - x^2) \): \( x^2 \).  
Sum of \( x^2 \) coefficients: \( 3 - 4 + 1 = 0 \).  
This confirms the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
