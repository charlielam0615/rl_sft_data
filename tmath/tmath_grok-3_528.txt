**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified expression \( 3(x^2 - x^3) + 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) - (4x^3 - x^2) \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^2 \), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Distribute the constants and simplify each term in the expression.
2. Combine like terms to obtain the simplified polynomial.
3. Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the resulting polynomial.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Distribute the constants and simplify each term in the expression.
**How to Achieve**: Apply the distributive property to each term: multiply \( 3 \) by \( (x^2 - x^3) \), multiply \( 2 \) by \( (x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) \), and distribute the negative sign to \( (4x^3 - x^2) \). Then, write out all resulting terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute each part:
- First term: \( 3(x^2 - x^3) = 3x^2 - 3x^3 \).
- Second term: \( 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) = 2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5 \).
- Third term: \( -(4x^3 - x^2) = -4x^3 + x^2 \).

The expression becomes:
\[ (3x^2 - 3x^3) + (2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5) + (-4x^3 + x^2) \]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Combine like terms in the expression \( (3x^2 - 3x^3) + (2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5) + (-4x^3 + x^2) \).
**How to Achieve**: Group terms by their degree (i.e., terms with \( x^5 \), \( x^3 \), \( x^2 \), \( x \)), add the coefficients for each degree, and write the simplified polynomial.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Group like terms:
- \( x^5 \): \( 6x^5 \) (from the second term).
- \( x^3 \): \( -3x^3 + (-4x^3) = -7x^3 \).
- \( x^2 \): \( 3x^2 + (-4x^2) + x^2 = (3 - 4 + 1)x^2 = 0x^2 \).
- \( x \): \( 2x \).

The simplified expression is:
\[ 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the simplified polynomial \( 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \).
**How to Achieve**: Examine the simplified polynomial and extract the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In the simplified polynomial \( 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \), the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 0 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the simplified polynomial and the coefficient of \( x^2 \).
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the distribution and combination of like terms to ensure no errors were made, then confirm the coefficient of \( x^2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute:
- Distribute: \( 3(x^2 - x^3) = 3x^2 - 3x^3 \), \( 2(x - 2x^2 + 3x^5) = 2x - 4x^2 + 6x^5 \), \( -(4x^3 - x^2) = -4x^3 + x^2 \).
- Combine: \( 6x^5 + (-3x^3 - 4x^3) + (3x^2 - 4x^2 + x^2) + 2x = 6x^5 - 7x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x \).
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3 - 4 + 1 = 0 \).

The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is confirmed to be \( 0 \).
[/IMP]
