**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( y \) in the equation \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the terms involving \( y \) on one side of the equation.  
2. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.  
3. Solve for \( y \) by isolating it.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Isolate the terms involving \( y \) on one side of the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract \( 1.7y \) from both sides to move all \( y \)-terms to the left side, and subtract 4 from both sides to move constants to the right side.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \]  

Subtract \( 1.7y \) from both sides:  
\[ 4 + 2.3y - 1.7y = 1.7y - 1.7y - 20 \]  
\[ 4 + 0.6y = -20 \]  

Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 4 - 4 + 0.6y = -20 - 4 \]  
\[ 0.6y = -24 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve for \( y \) by isolating it.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide both sides of the equation \( 0.6y = -24 \) by 0.6.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ 0.6y = -24 \]  

Divide both sides by 0.6:  
\[ y = \frac{-24}{0.6} \]  
\[ y = -40 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \( y = -40 \) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = -40 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Original equation: \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \)  

Substitute \( y = -40 \):  
Left side: \( 4 + 2.3(-40) = 4 - 92 = -88 \)  
Right side: \( 1.7(-40) - 20 = -68 - 20 = -88 \)  

Since \(-88 = -88\), the solution is valid.
