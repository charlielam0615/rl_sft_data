### Problem Statement
Solve for \( y \): \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving the equation into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the terms involving \( y \) on one side of the equation.  
2. Simplify the equation to solve for \( y \).  
3. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Isolate the terms involving \( y \) on one side of the equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Subtract \( 1.7y \) from both sides to move all \( y \)-terms to the left, then subtract 4 from both sides to move constants to the right.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \]

Subtract \( 1.7y \) from both sides:  
\[ 4 + 2.3y - 1.7y = 1.7y - 1.7y - 20 \]  
\[ 4 + 0.6y = -20 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 4 - 4 + 0.6y = -20 - 4 \]  
\[ 0.6y = -24 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Simplify the equation to solve for \( y \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Divide both sides of the equation \( 0.6y = -24 \) by 0.6 to isolate \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the previous step:  
\[ 0.6y = -24 \]

Divide both sides by 0.6:  
\[ y = \frac{-24}{0.6} \]  
\[ y = -40 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the solution by substituting \( y = -40 \) back into the original equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = -40 \) into both sides of \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \) and check if they are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = -40 \) into the original equation:  
Left side:  
\[ 4 + 2.3(-40) = 4 + (-92) = -88 \]

Right side:  
\[ 1.7(-40) - 20 = -68 - 20 = -88 \]

Since \(-88 = -88\), the solution \( y = -40 \) is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal-Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Solve for \( y \) in \( 4 + 2.3y = 1.7y - 20 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Isolate the terms involving \( y \) on one side (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the equation to solve for \( y \) (completed, \( y = -40 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution \( y = -40 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
\[ y = -40 \]
