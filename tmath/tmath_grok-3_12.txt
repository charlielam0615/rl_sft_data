**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\) and express the result in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are numbers.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the negative sign across the terms in the parentheses.  
2. Combine like terms (i.e., \(x^2\) terms, \(x\) terms, and constants).  
3. Express the simplified expression in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to distribute the negative sign across the terms in the parentheses \((4 - 2x - 8x^2)\). This will be achieved by applying the distributive property, multiplying each term inside the parentheses by \(-1\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given expression:  
\[2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\]  
Distribute the negative sign:  
\[- (4 - 2x - 8x^2) = -4 + 2x + 8x^2\]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\[8x^2 + 2x + 9 + (-4 + 2x + 8x^2)\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine like terms in the expression \(8x^2 + 2x + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x^2\). This will be achieved by grouping and summing the coefficients of \(x^2\), \(x\), and constant terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Group like terms:  
- \(x^2\) terms: \(8x^2 + 8x^2 = 16x^2\)  
- \(x\) terms: \(2x + 2x = 4x\)  
- Constant terms: \(9 - 4 = 5\)  
The simplified expression is:  
\[16x^2 + 4x + 5\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the simplified expression \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\) is correct. This will be achieved by substituting a value for \(x\) into both the original and simplified expressions to check for equality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Choose \(x = 1\) for simplicity:  
- Original expression:  
  \[2(1) + 8(1)^2 + 9 - (4 - 2(1) - 8(1)^2) = 2 + 8 + 9 - (4 - 2 - 8) = 19 - (-6) = 19 + 6 = 25\]  
- Simplified expression:  
  \[16(1)^2 + 4(1) + 5 = 16 + 4 + 5 = 25\]  
The values match, confirming the simplification is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify the expression and express it in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Distribute the negative sign across the parentheses (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine like terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the result in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the simplification (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as the expression has been simplified to \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\), which is in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The simplified expression is \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 5\).
