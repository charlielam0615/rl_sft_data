**Problem Restatement**: I need to simplify the expression \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\) and express the final answer in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are numbers.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to simplify the expression step by step. The subgoals are:  
1. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.  
2. Distribute the negative sign through the parentheses.  
3. Combine like terms.  
4. Write the final expression in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.  
How to Achieve: Focus on the terms inside the parentheses, \(4 - 2x - 8x^2\), and rewrite them clearly before proceeding.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The expression inside the parentheses is \(4 - 2x - 8x^2\). There are no like terms to combine here, so it remains as is for now. I will move to the next step of distributing the negative sign.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Distribute the negative sign through the parentheses.  
How to Achieve: Rewrite the expression by distributing the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses, changing the signs of \(4\), \(-2x\), and \(-8x^2\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The original expression is \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\). Distributing the negative sign, it becomes:  
\(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x^2\).  
This is the simplified form after removing the parentheses.

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Combine like terms.  
How to Achieve: Group the terms with the same powers of \(x\) (i.e., \(x^2\) terms, \(x\) terms, and constants) and add or subtract them accordingly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Grouping the terms from the expression \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x^2\):  
- \(x^2\) terms: \(8x^2 + 8x^2 = 16x^2\)  
- \(x\) terms: \(2x + 2x = 4x\)  
- Constants: \(9 - 4 = 5\)  
So, the expression simplifies to \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\).

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Simplify the expression \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\) into the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Distribute the negative sign through the parentheses (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine like terms (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Write the final expression in the required form (current focus).  
Current Goal: Write the final expression in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Write the final expression in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
How to Achieve: Identify the coefficients of \(x^2\), \(x\), and the constant term from the simplified expression and present them as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The simplified expression is \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\). Comparing this to the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), I find:  
- \(a = 16\)  
- \(b = 4\)  
- \(c = 5\)  
Thus, the final answer is \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the simplified expression.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the simplification steps briefly to ensure no errors were made in combining terms or distributing signs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let me verify the steps:  
Original expression: \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - (4 - 2x - 8x^2)\)  
Distribute negative: \(2x + 8x^2 + 9 - 4 + 2x + 8x^2\)  
Combine like terms:  
- \(x^2\): \(8 + 8 = 16\)  
- \(x\): \(2 + 2 = 4\)  
- Constants: \(9 - 4 = 5\)  
Result: \(16x^2 + 4x + 5\), which matches my earlier result. The simplification appears correct.
