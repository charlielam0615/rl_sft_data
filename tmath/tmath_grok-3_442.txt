**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( y = -x^2 + 5 \), where \( x \) is a real number, find the maximum possible value of \( y \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To find the maximum value of \( y \), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Identify the type of function and its properties.
2. Determine the vertex of the function, as it represents the maximum or minimum for a parabola.
3. Calculate the value of \( y \) at the vertex to find the maximum.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify the type of function and its properties.

**How to Achieve**: Analyze the given function \( y = -x^2 + 5 \) to determine its shape and key characteristics, such as whether it opens upward or downward, to confirm if it has a maximum value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The function \( y = -x^2 + 5 \) is a quadratic function in the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 5 \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (\( a = -1 \)) is negative, the parabola opens downward, indicating that the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the vertex of the function.

**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Compute this and then find the corresponding \( y \)-value by substituting \( x \) back into the function.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( y = -x^2 + 5 \), we have \( a = -1 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 5 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:

\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{0}{2(-1)} = 0 \]

Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the function to find the y-coordinate:

\[ y = - (0)^2 + 5 = 5 \]

Thus, the vertex is at \( (0, 5) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Calculate the value of \( y \) at the vertex to find the maximum.

**How to Achieve**: Since the vertex has been identified as \( (0, 5) \), confirm that this \( y \)-value is the maximum by considering the parabola’s downward-opening nature and evaluating the function’s behavior.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the parabola opens downward (as \( a = -1 < 0 \)), the y-coordinate of the vertex, \( y = 5 \), is the maximum value of the function. For any \( x \neq 0 \), the term \( -x^2 \) is negative, reducing \( y \) below 5. For example:
- At \( x = 1 \), \( y = -(1)^2 + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 \).
- At \( x = 2 \), \( y = -(2)^2 + 5 = -4 + 5 = 1 \).

This confirms that \( y = 5 \) at \( x = 0 \) is the highest value.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the maximum value.

**How to Achieve**: Verify the calculation by re-evaluating the vertex and considering alternative methods, such as calculus, to confirm the maximum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the vertex: \( x = -\frac{0}{2(-1)} = 0 \), and \( y = -(0)^2 + 5 = 5 \). Alternatively, using calculus, take the derivative of \( y = -x^2 + 5 \):

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x \]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\[ -2x = 0 \implies x = 0 \]

Evaluate the second derivative to confirm a maximum:

\[ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -2 \]

Since \( -2 < 0 \), the function has a local maximum at \( x = 0 \). Substitute \( x = 0 \):

\[ y = -(0)^2 + 5 = 5 \]

Both methods agree that the maximum value of \( y \) is 5.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the maximum value of \( y \) for \( y = -x^2 + 5 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of function and its properties (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the vertex of the function (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the value of \( y \) at the vertex to find the maximum (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the maximum value (completed).

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution, as all subgoals have been addressed.

The maximum value of \( y \) has been determined to be 5, achieved at \( x = 0 \), and validated through both algebraic and calculus-based methods.

**Final Answer**: The maximum possible value for \( y \) is 5.
