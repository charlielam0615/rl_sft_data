**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the maximum value of y for the equation y = -x² + 5, where x is a real number.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to find the maximum value of y. First, I recognize that the given equation represents a parabola. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-1), the parabola opens downward, indicating that it has a maximum point at its vertex. My subgoals are:  
1. Identify the vertex of the parabola to find the x-coordinate where the maximum occurs.  
2. Calculate the corresponding y-value at that x-coordinate to determine the maximum value of y.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola y = -x² + 5.  
How to Achieve: Use the vertex formula for a parabola in the form y = ax² + bx + c, where the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b/(2a). In this equation, a = -1, b = 0, and c = 5.

Applying the vertex formula: x = -b/(2a) = -0/(2*(-1)) = 0.  
So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 0.

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the y-value at x = 0 to find the maximum value of y.  
How to Achieve: Substitute x = 0 into the equation y = -x² + 5 and compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substituting x = 0 into the equation: y = -(0)² + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5.  
Therefore, the y-value at the vertex is 5.

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the maximum value of y for the equation y = -x² + 5.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola (Completed: x = 0).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the y-value at the vertex (Completed: y = 5).  
Current Goal: Confirm that y = 5 is the maximum value based on the nature of the parabola.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify that y = 5 is indeed the maximum value of the function.  
How to Achieve: Confirm the shape of the parabola and test values of x around the vertex to ensure y does not exceed 5.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-1), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex represents the maximum point. Testing x = 1: y = -(1)² + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4, which is less than 5. Testing x = -1: y = -(-1)² + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4, again less than 5. Testing x = 2: y = -(2)² + 5 = -4 + 5 = 1, still less than 5. These values confirm that y = 5 is the highest value achieved at x = 0.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The maximum value possible for y is 5.
