**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( t \) such that the point \( (t, 5) \) lies on the line passing through the points \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( t \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the equation of the line passing through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).  
2. Use the point \( (t, 5) \) to set up an equation based on the line’s equation.  
3. Solve for \( t \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the equation of the line through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \). This can be achieved by calculating the slope of the line and using the point-slope form to derive the line’s equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the slope \( m \) of the line through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \):  
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 3}{-8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-8} = \frac{3}{8} \]

Use the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \( (0, 3) \):  
\[ y - 3 = \frac{3}{8}(x - 0) \]  
\[ y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]

The equation of the line is \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the point \( (t, 5) \) and the line’s equation \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \) to set up an equation and solve for \( t \). This can be achieved by substituting \( x = t \) and \( y = 5 \) into the line’s equation and solving for \( t \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( (t, 5) \) into the line’s equation \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \):  
\[ 5 = \frac{3}{8}t + 3 \]

Solve for \( t \):  
\[ 5 - 3 = \frac{3}{8}t \]  
\[ 2 = \frac{3}{8}t \]  
\[ t = 2 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]

Thus, \( t = \frac{16}{3} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the point \( \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \) lies on the line \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \). This can be achieved by substituting \( x = \frac{16}{3} \) into the line’s equation and checking if \( y = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{16}{3} \) into \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \):  
\[ y = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{16}{3} + 3 = \frac{3 \cdot 16}{8 \cdot 3} + 3 = \frac{48}{24} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

The result is \( y = 5 \), which matches the y-coordinate of the point \( \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \). Thus, the solution is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( t \) such that \( (t, 5) \) lies on the line through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equation of the line through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \) (completed: \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the point \( (t, 5) \) to set up an equation and solve for \( t \) (completed: \( t = \frac{16}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking if \( \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \) lies on the line (completed: validated).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as \( t = \frac{16}{3} \) has been found and validated.

**Final Answer**: \( t = \frac{16}{3} \)
