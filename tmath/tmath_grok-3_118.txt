**Problem Statement**: Find the value of \( t \) such that the point \( (t, 5) \) lies on the line passing through the points \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the equation of the line passing through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).  
2. Use the point \( (t, 5) \) to find \( t \) by substituting \( y = 5 \) into the line equation and solving for \( x = t \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the equation of the line passing through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).  
How to Achieve: Calculate the slope of the line using the two points, then use the point-slope form to derive the line equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the slope \( m \):  
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 3}{-8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-8} = \frac{3}{8} \]  
Use the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with point \( (0, 3) \):  
\[ y - 3 = \frac{3}{8}(x - 0) \]  
\[ y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]  
The equation of the line is \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find \( t \) such that \( (t, 5) \) lies on the line \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( y = 5 \) into the line equation and solve for \( x = t \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 5 \) into \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \):  
\[ 5 = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \]  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
\[ 5 - 3 = \frac{3}{8}x \]  
\[ 2 = \frac{3}{8}x \]  
Multiply both sides by \( \frac{8}{3} \):  
\[ x = 2 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]  
Thus, \( t = \frac{16}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( (t, 5) = \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \) lies on the line \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = \frac{16}{3} \) and \( y = 5 \) into the line equation and check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{16}{3} \) into \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \):  
\[ y = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{16}{3} + 3 = \frac{3 \cdot 16}{8 \cdot 3} + 3 = \frac{48}{24} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]  
The equation holds since \( y = 5 \), confirming that \( \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \) lies on the line.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( t \) such that \( (t, 5) \) lies on the line through \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the equation of the line (completed: \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( t \) using \( y = 5 \) (completed: \( t = \frac{16}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: \( \left( \frac{16}{3}, 5 \right) \) lies on the line).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution \( t = \frac{16}{3} \) has been validated.
