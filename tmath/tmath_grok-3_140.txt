**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the total value of the dimes.  
2. Calculate the total value of the quarters.  
3. Calculate the total value of all the money.  
4. Determine the percentage of the total value that comes from the quarters.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total value of the dimes.  
How to Achieve: A dime is worth $0.10. Multiply the number of dimes (50) by the value of one dime ($0.10).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total value of dimes = 50 × $0.10 = $5.00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total value of the quarters.  
How to Achieve: A quarter is worth $0.25. Multiply the number of quarters (20) by the value of one quarter ($0.25).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total value of quarters = 20 × $0.25 = $5.00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total value of all the money.  
How to Achieve: Add the total value of the dimes and the total value of the quarters.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total value of all money = $5.00 (dimes) + $5.00 (quarters) = $10.00.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the percentage of the total value that comes from the quarters.  
How to Achieve: Divide the value of the quarters by the total value of all money and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Percentage from quarters = ($5.00 / $10.00) × 100 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine what percentage of the total value of the money is in quarters.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total value of the dimes (Completed: $5.00).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total value of the quarters (Completed: $5.00).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total value of all the money (Completed: $10.00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the percentage of the total value from quarters (Completed: 50%).  
Current Goal: The final goal has been achieved, with the percentage calculated as 50%.  
[/REVIEW]
