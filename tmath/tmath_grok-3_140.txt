**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Calculate the value of the dimes.  
2. Calculate the value of the quarters.  
3. Calculate the total value of all coins.  
4. Determine the percentage of the total value that comes from quarters.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the value of the dimes.  
How to Achieve: A dime is worth $0.10. Multiply the number of dimes (50) by $0.10 to find the total value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Value of dimes = 50 × $0.10 = $5.00  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the value of the quarters.  
How to Achieve: A quarter is worth $0.25. Multiply the number of quarters (20) by $0.25 to find the total value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Value of quarters = 20 × $0.25 = $5.00  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the total value of all coins.  
How to Achieve: Add the value of the dimes ($5.00) and the value of the quarters ($5.00) to find the total value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Total value = $5.00 (dimes) + $5.00 (quarters) = $10.00  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the percentage of the total value that comes from quarters.  
How to Achieve: Divide the value of the quarters ($5.00) by the total value ($10.00) and multiply by 100 to express as a percentage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Percentage from quarters = ($5.00 ÷ $10.00) × 100 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Calculate what percentage of the total value is in quarters.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the value of the dimes (completed: $5.00).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the value of the quarters (completed: $5.00).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the total value of all coins (completed: $10.00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Determine the percentage of the total value from quarters (completed: 50%).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final answer is that 50% of the value of the money is in quarters.
