### Problem Statement
We need to compute the value of \( x \) such that the product of two infinite series equals another infinite series:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots
\]

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify and express each series in closed form (sum each infinite series).  
- Subgoal 2: Compute the product of the two series on the left-hand side.  
- Subgoal 3: Express the right-hand side series in closed form.  
- Subgoal 4: Set up an equation by equating the product to the right-hand side.  
- Subgoal 5: Solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the first infinite series: \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize this as a geometric series and apply the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, \( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r} \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio, provided \( |r| < 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The series is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).  
This is a geometric series where:  
- First term \( a = 1 \),  
- Common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).  

Since \( |r| = \frac{1}{2} < 1 \), the sum is:  
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2.
\]  
So, the first series sums to 2.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the second infinite series: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize this as a geometric series with alternating signs, which can be handled by identifying the first term and common ratio, then applying the geometric series sum formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The series is \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).  
Rewrite the terms:  
\[
1 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^n.
\]  
This is a geometric series with:  
- First term \( a = 1 \),  
- Common ratio \( r = -\frac{1}{2} \).  

Since \( |r| = \frac{1}{2} < 1 \), the sum is:  
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]  
So, the second series sums to \( \frac{2}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the product of the two seriesâ€™ sums.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the sums obtained from the first and second series to find the left-hand side of the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, the first series sums to 2.  
From Step 3, the second series sums to \( \frac{2}{3} \).  
The product is:  
\[
2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]  
So, the left-hand side of the equation is \( \frac{4}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express the right-hand side series \( 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots \) in closed form.  
**How to Achieve**: Recognize this as a geometric series, identify the first term and common ratio, and apply the sum formula, ensuring the series converges.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The series is \( 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots \).  
Rewrite as:  
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^n.
\]  
This is a geometric series with:  
- First term \( a = 1 \),  
- Common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{x} \).  

The series converges if \( |r| = \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| < 1 \), i.e., \( |x| > 1 \).  
Assuming convergence, the sum is:  
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x-1}{x}} = \frac{x}{x-1}.
\]  
So, the right-hand side is \( \frac{x}{x-1} \), provided \( |x| > 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the equation by equating the product of the left-hand side to the right-hand side.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the results from Steps 4 and 5 to form the equation \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{x}{x-1} \), and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 4, the left-hand side is \( \frac{4}{3} \).  
From Step 5, the right-hand side is \( \frac{x}{x-1} \).  
Set up the equation:  
\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{x}{x-1}.
\]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[
4(x-1) = 3x \implies 4x - 4 = 3x \implies 4x - 3x = 4 \implies x = 4.
\]  
Check convergence: The right-hand side series requires \( |x| > 1 \). Since \( x = 4 \), \( |4| = 4 > 1 \), so the series converges.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 4 \) satisfies the original equation by substituting back and checking consistency.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the right-hand side, compute its sum, and confirm it equals the left-hand side product.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the right-hand side:  
\[
1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n.
\]  
First term \( a = 1 \), common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{4} \).  
Sum:  
\[
\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]  
This matches the left-hand side from Step 4: \( \frac{4}{3} \).  
Thus, \( x = 4 \) is consistent with the equation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal to provide context.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( x \) such that the product of two infinite series equals the given series.  
  - Subgoal 1: Sum the first series (Completed: Sum = 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum the second series (Completed: Sum = \( \frac{2}{3} \)).

  - Subgoal 5: Solve for \( x \) (Completed: \( x = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the solution (Completed: Verified \( x = 4 \)).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
[/REVIEW]
