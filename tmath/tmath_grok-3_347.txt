### Problem Statement
We need to compute the value of \( x \) such that the product of two infinite series equals another infinite series:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots
\]

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the closed-form expressions for the two series on the left-hand side.
2. Compute their product.
3. Express the right-hand side series in closed form.
4. Equate both sides to solve for \( x \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the closed-form expression for the first series \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).
How to Achieve: Recognize the series as a geometric series and apply the formula for its sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The series \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \) can be written as:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n
\]

This is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). The sum of an infinite geometric series \( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r} \) (for \( |r| < 1 \)) gives:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2
\]

Thus, the first series sums to 2.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the closed-form expression for the second series \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \).
How to Achieve: Recognize the series as a geometric series with alternating signs and apply the sum formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The series \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \cdots \) can be written as:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^n
\]

This is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \) and common ratio \( r = -\frac{1}{2} \). The sum is:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the second series sums to \( \frac{2}{3} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the product of the two seriesâ€™ sums.
How to Achieve: Multiply the closed-form sums obtained in previous steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The product of the two series is:

\[
2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

So, the left-hand side evaluates to \( \frac{4}{3} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express the right-hand side series \( 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots \) in closed form.
How to Achieve: Recognize it as a geometric series and derive its sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The right-hand side series is:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^n
\]

This is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{x} \). The sum is:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x-1}{x}} = \frac{x}{x-1}
\]

The series converges for \( \left| \frac{1}{x} \right| < 1 \), i.e., \( |x| > 1 \). Thus, the right-hand side sums to \( \frac{x}{x-1} \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Equate both sides and solve for \( x \).
How to Achieve: Set the product of the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side and solve the resulting equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Equate the two sides:

\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{x}{x-1}
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
4(x-1) = 3x
\]

\[
4x - 4 = 3x
\]

\[
4x - 3x = 4
\]

\[
x = 4
\]

Check the convergence condition: Since \( x = 4 \), \( \left| \frac{1}{x} \right| = \frac{1}{4} < 1 \), so the right-hand side series converges.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution by substituting \( x = 4 \) into the right-hand side and checking consistency.
How to Achieve: Compute the right-hand side with \( x = 4 \) and confirm it equals \( \frac{4}{3} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 4 \), the right-hand side is:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^n
\]

Sum the series:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This matches the left-hand side product \( \frac{4}{3} \), confirming the solution is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
