### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the greatest \( a \) that satisfies the given equation, we can break down the problem into the following subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation to isolate terms involving \( a \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation to make it easier to solve for \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to eliminate it, and simplify the expression step-by-step.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:

\[
\frac{7\sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3} = 2
\]

Simplify the terms inside the square roots:  
- \((2a)^2 + 1 = 4a^2 + 1\), so \(\sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1} = \sqrt{4a^2 + 1}\).  
- The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3\).  

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3} = 2
\]

Multiply both sides by the denominator \(\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3\) to eliminate it:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1 = 2 (\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3)
\]

Distribute on the right-hand side:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1 = 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 6
\]

Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1 - 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} - 6 = 0
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} - 4a^2 - 7 = 0
\]

This simplified equation will be solved in the next step.

  - Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest \( a \) among all solutions (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solutions (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Solve the simplified equation for \( a \).

[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the simplified equation \( 7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} - 4a^2 - 7 = 0 \) for \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Isolate the square root terms, square both sides if necessary to eliminate square roots, and solve the resulting equation.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the simplified equation:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} - 4a^2 - 7 = 0
\]

Isolate the square root terms:

\[
7\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} - 2\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} = 4a^2 + 7
\]

To handle the square roots, letâ€™s substitute to simplify:  
- Let \( x = \sqrt{4a^2 + 1} \). Since \( 4a^2 + 1 \geq 1 \), we have \( x \geq 1 \).  
- Then, \( 4a^2 = x^2 - 1 \), so \( a^2 = \frac{x^2 - 1}{4} \).  
- Also, \( \sqrt{1 + 4a^2} = \sqrt{1 + (x^2 - 1)} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x| \). Since \( x \geq 1 \), \( |x| = x \).

Substitute into the equation:

\[
7x - 2x - 4 \cdot \frac{x^2 - 1}{4} - 7 = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
5x - \frac{4x^2 - 4}{4} - 7 = 0
\]

\[
5x - (x^2 - 1) - 7 = 0
\]

\[
5x - x^2 + 1 - 7 = 0
\]

\[
-x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0
\]

Multiply by \(-1\) to simplify:

\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
\]

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), \( c = 6 \):

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Since \( x = \sqrt{4a^2 + 1} \), solve for \( a \):  
- For \( x = 3 \):

\[
\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} = 3 \implies 4a^2 + 1 = 9 \implies 4a^2 = 8 \implies a^2 = 2 \implies a = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

- For \( x = 2 \):

\[
\sqrt{4a^2 + 1} = 2 \implies 4a^2 + 1 = 4 \implies 4a^2 = 3 \implies a^2 = \frac{3}{4} \implies a = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Possible values of \( a \): \( \sqrt{2} \), \( -\sqrt{2} \), \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

### Step 5: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
The solutions \( a = \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) have been identified. Adjust the remaining subgoals to focus on:  
1. Verify which of these solutions satisfy the original equation.  
2. Determine the greatest \( a \) among the valid solutions.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest \( a \) that satisfies the given equation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equation (completed).

  - Subgoal 4: Determine the greatest \( a \) among valid solutions (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Verify which solutions satisfy the original equation.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify which of the solutions \( a = \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) satisfy the original equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each value of \( a \) into the original equation and check if the left-hand side equals 2.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute each value into the original equation:

\[
\frac{7\sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1} - 4a^2 - 1}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2} + 3} = 2
\]

1. **For \( a = \sqrt{2} \)**:  
   - \( (2a)^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 \), so \( \sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1} = \sqrt{8 + 1} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \).  
   - \( 4a^2 = 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \).  
   - Numerator: \( 7 \cdot 3 - 8 - 1 = 21 - 8 - 1 = 12 \).  
   - Denominator: \( \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 2} + 3 = \sqrt{1 + 8} + 3 = \sqrt{9} + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).  
   - \( \frac{12}{6} = 2 \).  
   **Satisfies the equation.**

2. **For \( a = -\sqrt{2} \)**:  
   - Since the equation involves \( a^2 \), the values are the same as for \( a = \sqrt{2} \):  
     - \( (2a)^2 = 8 \), \( \sqrt{8 + 1} = 3 \).  
     - \( 4a^2 = 8 \).  
     - Numerator: \( 12 \).  
     - Denominator: \( \sqrt{9} + 3 = 6 \).  
     - \( \frac{12}{6} = 2 \).  
   **Satisfies the equation.**

3. **For \( a = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)**:  
   - \( (2a)^2 = \left(2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \), so \( \sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1} = \sqrt{3 + 1} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).  
   - \( 4a^2 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 3 \).  
   - Numerator: \( 7 \cdot 2 - 3 - 1 = 14 - 3 - 1 = 10 \).  
   - Denominator: \( \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot \frac{3}{4}} + 3 = \sqrt{1 + 3} + 3 = \sqrt{4} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \).  
   - \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \).  
   **Satisfies the equation.**

4. **For \( a = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)**:  
   - Same as \( a = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), since \( a^2 \) terms are identical:  
     - \( (2a)^2 = 3 \), \( \sqrt{3 + 1} = 2 \).  
     - \( 4a^2 = 3 \).  
     - Numerator: \( 10 \).  
     - Denominator: \( \sqrt{4} + 3 = 5 \).  
     - \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \).  
   **Satisfies the equation.**

All solutions \( a = \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) satisfy the original equation.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the greatest \( a \) among the valid solutions \( \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the numerical values of the solutions and identify the largest one.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the solutions:  
- \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \).  
- \( -\sqrt{2} \approx -1.414 \).  
- \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866 \).  
- \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx -0.866 \).  

The greatest value is \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \).
