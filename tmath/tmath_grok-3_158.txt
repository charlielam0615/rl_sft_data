### Step 2: Reach Goal

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Simplify the expression \((2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2\).  
- **How to Achieve:** Expand and factor the expression to reveal its structure, then check if it resembles a form that can be analyzed modulo 47.

Start with the expression:  
\((2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2 = 4x^2 + 148x + 1369\).  

Notice that the expression resembles a quadratic. Let’s try to factor or rewrite it:  
\[ 4x^2 + 148x + 1369 = (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot (2x) + 37^2. \]  
This looks like a perfect square:  
\[ (2x + 37)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 37 + 37^2 = 4x^2 + 148x + 1369. \]  

Thus, the expression is:  
\[ (2x + 37)^2. \]  

The condition for divisibility by 47 becomes:  
\[ (2x + 37)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}. \]  
Since 47 is a prime, this implies:  
\[ 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}. \]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the condition \( 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47} \) correctly represents the requirement for the expression to be divisible by 47.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check if satisfying \( 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47} \) ensures \((2x + 37)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}\), and confirm the expression’s form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the expression is \((2x + 37)^2\), if:  
\[ 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}, \]  
then:  
\[ (2x + 37)^2 \equiv 0^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}. \]  

This satisfies the divisibility condition. The simplification to \((2x + 37)^2\) is correct, as:  
\[ (2x + 37)^2 = 4x^2 + 148x + 1369, \]  
which matches the original expression. The condition \( 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47} \) is valid for ensuring divisibility by 47.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the congruence \( 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47} \) for the smallest positive integer \( x \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 37 and multiplying by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 47.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve:  
\[ 2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}. \]  
Subtract 37:  
\[ 2x \equiv -37 \pmod{47}. \]  
Since \(-37 \equiv -37 + 47 = 10 \pmod{47}\), we have:  
\[ 2x \equiv 10 \pmod{47}. \]  

Divide by 2 by multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 47. First, find the inverse:  
The inverse \( a \) satisfies \( 2a \equiv 1 \pmod{47} \). Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:  
\[ 47 = 23 \cdot 2 + 1 \implies 1 = 47 - 23 \cdot 2. \]  
Thus:  
\[ 1 \equiv -23 \cdot 2 \pmod{47}. \]  
Since \(-23 \equiv -23 + 47 = 24 \pmod{47}\), the inverse is 24, as:  
\[ 2 \cdot 24 = 48 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}. \]  

Multiply both sides of \( 2x \equiv 10 \pmod{47} \) by 24:  
\[ x \equiv 10 \cdot 24 \pmod{47}. \]  
Compute:  
\[ 10 \cdot 24 = 240. \]  
Reduce modulo 47:  
\[ 240 \div 47 \approx 5 \text{ remainder } 5 \implies 240 = 47 \cdot 5 + 5 \implies 240 \equiv 5 \pmod{47}. \]  
Thus:  
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{47}. \]  

The smallest positive integer \( x \) is 5.

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm that \( x = 5 \) makes the original expression divisible by 47.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the expression and check if the result is divisible by 47.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the simplified form \((2x + 37)^2\):  
For \( x = 5 \):  
\[ 2x + 37 = 2 \cdot 5 + 37 = 10 + 37 = 47. \]  
\[ (2x + 37)^2 = 47^2 = 47 \cdot 47. \]  
Since 47 divides \( 47^2 \), the expression is divisible by 47.  

Alternatively, compute the original expression:  
\[ (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2 = 4x^2 + 148x + 1369. \]  
For \( x = 5 \):  
\[ 4 \cdot 5^2 + 148 \cdot 5 + 1369 = 4 \cdot 25 + 740 + 1369 = 100 + 740 + 1369 = 2209. \]  
Check divisibility:  
\[ 2209 \div 47 \approx 47 \text{ (exact), as } 47 \cdot 47 = 2209. \]  
Since \( 2209 = 47^2 \), it is divisible by 47.  

The solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.
