### Problem Restatement
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that the expression \((2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2\) is divisible by 47, i.e., the expression evaluates to a multiple of 47.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \((2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2\) and express it in a form that facilitates checking divisibility by 47. This can be achieved by recognizing the expression as a quadratic and possibly factoring it or rewriting it to reveal its structure.

The expression is:  
\[
(2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 37 \cdot 2x + 37^2 = 4x^2 + 148x + 1369
\]
Notice that this resembles a perfect square. Rewrite it:  
\[
4x^2 + 148x + 1369 = (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 37 + 37^2
\]
This is a perfect square trinomial:  
\[
(2x + 37)^2
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to \((2x + 37)^2\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the condition for \((2x + 37)^2\) to be divisible by 47. Since 47 is a prime number, we need \((2x + 37)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}\), which implies \(2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}\). Solve this congruence for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The condition is:  
\[
(2x + 37)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}
\]
Since 47 is prime, this holds if:  
\[
2x + 37 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}
\]
Solve the congruence:  
\[
2x \equiv -37 \pmod{47}
\]
Since \(-37 \equiv 10 \pmod{47}\) (because \(-37 + 47 = 10\)), we have:  
\[
2x \equiv 10 \pmod{47}
\]
To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 47. The inverse \( a \) satisfies \( 2a \equiv 1 \pmod{47} \). Testing values, try \( a = 24 \):  
\[
2 \cdot 24 = 48 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}
\]
Thus, the inverse is 24. Multiply both sides of \( 2x \equiv 10 \pmod{47} \) by 24:  
\[
x \equiv 10 \cdot 24 \pmod{47}
\]
Calculate:  
\[
10 \cdot 24 = 240
\]
\[
240 \div 47 \approx 5 \text{ remainder } 5 \quad (47 \cdot 5 = 235, 240 - 235 = 5)
\]
So:  
\[
x \equiv 5 \pmod{47}
\]
Thus, solutions are:  
\[
x = 5 + 47k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{47} \) satisfies the original condition by substituting back into the expression and checking divisibility by 47.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Take \( x = 5 \):  
\[
2x + 37 = 2 \cdot 5 + 37 = 10 + 37 = 47
\]
\[
(2x + 37)^2 = 47^2
\]
Since \( 47^2 \) is clearly divisible by 47, the condition holds for \( x = 5 \).  
For generality, consider \( x = 5 + 47k \):  
\[
2x = 2(5 + 47k) = 10 + 94k
\]
\[
2x + 37 = 10 + 94k + 37 = 47 + 94k
\]
\[
(2x + 37)^2 = (47 + 94k)^2 = (47(1 + 2k))^2 = 47^2 (1 + 2k)^2
\]
This is divisible by 47 for any integer \( k \), confirming all solutions of the form \( x = 5 + 47k \).
