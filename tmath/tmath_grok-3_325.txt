**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the geometric series:  
1. Identify the sequence as a geometric series and determine its parameters (first term, common ratio, number of terms).  
2. Verify the series matches the given terms.  
3. Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
4. Compute the final sum.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the sequence as a geometric series and determine its parameters (first term, common ratio, number of terms). This will be achieved by analyzing the given terms to find the pattern and confirm the sequence structure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The given series is \(-1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729\).  
- **First term (a)**: The first term is \(-1\).  
- **Common ratio (r)**: To find the common ratio, divide consecutive terms:  
  - \(-3 / -1 = 3\)  
  - \(-9 / -3 = 3\)  
  - \(-27 / -9 = 3\)  
  - \(-81 / -27 = 3\)  
  - \(-243 / -81 = 3\)  
  - \(-729 / -243 = 3\)  
  The common ratio is \(r = 3\).  
- **Number of terms (n)**: The series has the terms \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\), which totals \(n = 7\) terms.  
Thus, the series is geometric with \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the series matches the identified geometric series parameters. This will be achieved by generating the terms of the geometric series using the parameters \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\) and comparing them to the given series.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The general form of a geometric series term is \(a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}\). Using \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), compute the terms:  
- For \(n=1\): \(a_1 = -1 \cdot 3^{1-1} = -1 \cdot 3^0 = -1\)  
- For \(n=2\): \(a_2 = -1 \cdot 3^{2-1} = -1 \cdot 3^1 = -3\)  
- For \(n=3\): \(a_3 = -1 \cdot 3^{3-1} = -1 \cdot 3^2 = -9\)  
- For \(n=4\): \(a_4 = -1 \cdot 3^{4-1} = -1 \cdot 3^3 = -27\)  
- For \(n=5\): \(a_5 = -1 \cdot 3^{5-1} = -1 \cdot 3^4 = -81\)  
- For \(n=6\): \(a_6 = -1 \cdot 3^{6-1} = -1 \cdot 3^5 = -243\)  
- For \(n=7\): \(a_7 = -1 \cdot 3^{7-1} = -1 \cdot 3^6 = -729\)  
The generated terms \(-1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729\) match the given series exactly. The parameters are correct.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the geometric series sum formula using the parameters \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), and \(n = 7\) to compute the sum. This will be achieved by substituting the values into the formula \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\) for \(r \neq 1\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of a geometric series is given by:  
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]  
Substitute \(a = -1\), \(r = 3\), \(n = 7\):  
\[ S_7 = -1 \cdot \frac{1 - 3^7}{1 - 3} \]  
- Compute \(3^7\):  
  - \(3^1 = 3\)  
  - \(3^2 = 9\)  
  - \(3^3 = 27\)  
  - \(3^4 = 81\)  
  - \(3^5 = 243\)  
  - \(3^6 = 729\)  
  - \(3^7 = 729 \cdot 3 = 2187\)  
- So, \(1 - 3^7 = 1 - 2187 = -2186\).  
- Denominator: \(1 - 3 = -2\).  
- Thus:  
  \[ S_7 = -1 \cdot \frac{-2186}{-2} = \frac{2186}{2} = 1093 \]  
The sum is \(1093\).
