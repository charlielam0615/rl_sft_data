**Problem Statement**: Compute the sum of the geometric series -1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the sum of the given geometric series.  
1. Identify if the series is geometric by checking for a common ratio.  
2. Determine the first term, common ratio, and number of terms.  
3. Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
4. Compute the final sum.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify if the series is geometric and determine its parameters (first term, common ratio, number of terms).  
**How to Achieve**: Examine the sequence -1, -3, -9, -27, -81, -243, -729 by calculating the ratio between consecutive terms and counting the terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To confirm the series is geometric, compute the ratio between consecutive terms:  
-3 / -1 = 3, -9 / -3 = 3, -27 / -9 = 3, -81 / -27 = 3, -243 / -81 = 3, -729 / -243 = 3.  
The common ratio is 3. The first term is -1. The series has 7 terms (from -1 to -729).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute the sum of the geometric series.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify if the series is geometric (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the first term, common ratio, and number of terms (completed: first term = -1, common ratio = 3, number of terms = 7).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final sum.  
**Current Goal**: Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, \( S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \), where \( a \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the number of terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given: first term \( a = -1 \), common ratio \( r = 3 \), number of terms \( n = 7 \).  
The sum formula is:  
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} = (-1) \frac{1 - 3^7}{1 - 3} \]  
Calculate \( 3^7 \):  
\[ 3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187 \]  
Numerator: \( 1 - 2187 = -2186 \).  
Denominator: \( 1 - 3 = -2 \).  
So:  
\[ S_7 = (-1) \frac{-2186}{-2} = (-1) \times 1093 = -1093 \]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate the computed sum.  
**How to Achieve**: Manually sum the terms to confirm the result matches the formulaâ€™s output.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sum the terms directly:  
-1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729 = -(1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729).  
Calculate step-by-step:  
1 + 3 = 4,  
4 + 9 = 13,  
13 + 27 = 40,  
40 + 81 = 121,  
121 + 243 = 364,  
364 + 729 = 1093.  
Thus, the sum is:  
\[ -1093 \]  
This matches the result from the formula, confirming the sum is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of the geometric series -1 - 3 - 9 - 27 - 81 - 243 - 729 is **-1093**.
