Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $ A - M $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given $ A = 4 - 3i $ and $ M = -4 + i $, we calculate:
$$
A - M = (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i) = 4 - 3i + 4 - i = 8 - 4i.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Add $ S $ to the result of $ A - M $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know $ A - M = 8 - 4i $ and $ S = i $. So, we add $ S $ as follows:  
$$
(8 - 4i) + i = 8 - 3i.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Subtract $ P = 2 $ from $ (A - M) + S = 8 - 3i $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We subtract $ P = 2 $ from $ 8 - 3i $:  
$$
(8 - 3i) - 2 = 6 - 3i.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: The entire solution process from calculating $ A - M $ to the final result $ A - M + S - P $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Step 1: $ A - M $**  
   Given $ A = 4 - 3i $, $ M = -4 + i $.  
   Calculation:  
   $$
   (4 - 3i) - (-4 + i) = 4 - 3i + 4 - i = 8 - 4i.
   $$  
   This is correct because subtracting a complex number $ (-4 + i) $ flips the signs of its real and imaginary parts.

2. **Step 2: Adding $ S = i $**  
   Starting with $ 8 - 4i $, adding $ i $:  
   $$
   8 - 4i + i = 8 - 3i.
   $$  
   The imaginary parts combine correctly ($-4i + i = -3i$).

3. **Step 3: Subtracting $ P = 2 $**  
   Starting with $ 8 - 3i $, subtracting $ 2 $:  
   $$
   8 - 3i - 2 = 6 - 3i.
   $$  
   The real parts combine correctly ($8 - 2 = 6$).

4. **Final Result**  
   All intermediate steps are consistent and error-free. The final result $ 6 - 3i $ is valid.  
   $\boxed{correct}$

[ANSWER]
$ 6 - 3i $
