### Problem Statement
We need to compute the value of the composite function \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \) for the piecewise function defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases} 
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
x + 8 & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
This involves applying the function \( f \) five times, starting with the input \( x = 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \), break down the problem into intermediate steps by applying the function \( f \) iteratively, starting with \( x = 1 \). The subgoals are:
1. Compute \( f(1) \).
2. Compute \( f(f(1)) \).
3. Compute \( f(f(f(1))) \).
4. Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \).
5. Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \).
Each step involves evaluating the function based on the input value and the piecewise definition.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(1) \), the first application of the function. To achieve this, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) using the piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate case based on whether \( x \geq 0 \) or \( x < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( x = 1 \geq 0 \), use the first case of the function:  
\[ f(x) = -x^2. \]  
Thus,  
\[ f(1) = -(1)^2 = -1. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-1) \). To achieve this, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -1 \) using the piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate case based on whether \( x \geq 0 \) or \( x < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( x = -1 < 0 \), use the second case of the function:  
\[ f(x) = x + 8. \]  
Thus,  
\[ f(-1) = -1 + 8 = 7. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(7) \). To achieve this, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 7 \) using the piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate case based on whether \( x \geq 0 \) or \( x < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( x = 7 \geq 0 \), use the first case of the function:  
\[ f(x) = -x^2. \]  
Thus,  
\[ f(7) = -(7)^2 = -49. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-49) \). To achieve this, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -49 \) using the piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate case based on whether \( x \geq 0 \) or \( x < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( x = -49 < 0 \), use the second case of the function:  
\[ f(x) = x + 8. \]  
Thus,  
\[ f(-49) = -49 + 8 = -41. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(-41) \). To achieve this, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = -41 \) using the piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate case based on whether \( x \geq 0 \) or \( x < 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( x = -41 < 0 \), use the second case of the function:  
\[ f(x) = x + 8. \]  
Thus,  
\[ f(-41) = -41 + 8 = -33. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to confirm progress and highlight the current state.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) = -1 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-1) = 7 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(7) = -49 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-49) = -41 \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(-41) = -33 \).  
**Current Goal**: The final goal has been computed as \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = -33 \).  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = -33 \). To achieve this, retrace the steps to ensure each function application used the correct piecewise case and calculations were accurate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s validate each step:  
1. **\( f(1) \)**: Input \( x = 1 \geq 0 \), so \( f(1) = -(1)^2 = -1 \). Correct.  
2. **\( f(f(1)) = f(-1) \)**: Input \( x = -1 < 0 \), so \( f(-1) = -1 + 8 = 7 \). Correct.  
3. **\( f(f(f(1))) = f(7) \)**: Input \( x = 7 \geq 0 \), so \( f(7) = -(7)^2 = -49 \). Correct.  
4. **\( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-49) \)**: Input \( x = -49 < 0 \), so \( f(-49) = -49 + 8 = -41 \). Correct.  
5. **\( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(-41) \)**: Input \( x = -41 < 0 \), so \( f(-41) = -41 + 8 = -33 \). Correct.  
All calculations align with the piecewise function’s definition, and the sequence is consistent.

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \) is \(-33\).
