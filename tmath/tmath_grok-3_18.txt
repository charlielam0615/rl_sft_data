**Problem Statement**: We need to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \) for the piecewise function defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
x + 8 & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals. The goal is to apply the function \( f \) five times, starting with \( x = 1 \). Each application of \( f \) produces a value that becomes the input for the next application. The subgoals are:
1. Compute \( f(1) \).
2. Compute \( f(f(1)) \).
3. Compute \( f(f(f(1))) \).
4. Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \).
5. Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \).  
Start by evaluating the first application, \( f(1) \), and proceed iteratively.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(1) \). Since \( 1 \geq 0 \), use the first case of the function, \( f(x) = -x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = 1 \), apply the function:  
\[
f(1) = -(1)^2 = -1.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-1) \). Since \( -1 < 0 \), use the second case of the function, \( f(x) = x + 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = -1 \):  
\[
f(-1) = -1 + 8 = 7.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(7) \). Since \( 7 \geq 0 \), use the first case of the function, \( f(x) = -x^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = 7 \):  
\[
f(7) = -(7)^2 = -49.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-49) \). Since \( -49 < 0 \), use the second case of the function, \( f(x) = x + 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = -49 \):  
\[
f(-49) = -49 + 8 = -41.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(-41) \). Since \( -41 < 0 \), use the second case of the function, \( f(x) = x + 8 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = -41 \):  
\[
f(-41) = -41 + 8 = -33.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current state.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) = -1 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(-1) = 7 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(7) = -49 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-49) = -41 \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(-41) = -33 \).  
**Current Goal**: Completed computation of \( f(f(f(f(f(1))))) \), which is \( -33 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation by retracing the steps to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Retrace the computations:  
- Start with \( x = 1 \): \( 1 \geq 0 \), so \( f(1) = -(1)^2 = -1 \).  
- Next, \( x = -1 \): \( -1 < 0 \), so \( f(-1) = -1 + 8 = 7 \).  
- Next, \( x = 7 \): \( 7 \geq 0 \), so \( f(7) = -(7)^2 = -49 \).  
- Next, \( x = -49 \): \( -49 < 0 \), so \( f(-49) = -49 + 8 = -41 \).  
- Next, \( x = -41 \): \( -41 < 0 \), so \( f(-41) = -41 + 8 = -33 \).  
All steps are consistent with the function definition and calculations.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[
f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = -33.
\]
