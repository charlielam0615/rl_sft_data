### Problem Statement
Find the domain of the real-valued function \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \). The domain consists of all \( x \)-values for which the function is defined, which requires the expression inside the square root, \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\), to be non-negative (i.e., \(\geq 0\)). The endpoints of the domain should be expressed as common fractions, not mixed numbers or decimals.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find the domain.  

1. **Determine the condition for the function to be defined**: Since \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \), the expression inside the square root must be non-negative: \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\).  
2. **Solve the inequality**: Find the values of \( x \) that satisfy \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\).  
3. **Express the domain**: Identify the interval(s) where the inequality holds and express the endpoints as common fractions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\). To achieve this, solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\) to find the roots, then analyze the sign of the quadratic expression to determine where it is non-negative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\). Multiply through by \(-1\) to simplify:  
\[ 10x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 \]  

Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 10 \), \( b = 11 \), \( c = -6 \).  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 11^2 - 4 \cdot 10 \cdot (-6) = 121 + 240 = 361 \).  
- Roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2 \cdot 10} = \frac{-11 \pm 19}{20} \]  
- First root:  
\[ x = \frac{-11 + 19}{20} = \frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} \]  
- Second root:  
\[ x = \frac{-11 - 19}{20} = \frac{-30}{20} = \frac{-3}{2} \]  

The roots are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{2}{5} \). Since the quadratic \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\) has a negative leading coefficient (\(-10\)), the parabola opens downward, and the expression is non-negative between the roots (including the roots where it equals zero).  

Test the sign of \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\) in the intervals defined by the roots \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{2}{5} \):  
- **Interval \( (-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}) \)**: Test \( x = -2 \):  
  \[-10(-2)^2 - 11(-2) + 6 = -10 \cdot 4 + 22 + 6 = -40 + 28 = -12 < 0\]  
- **Interval \( (-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}) \)**: Test \( x = 0 \):  
  \[-10(0)^2 - 11(0) + 6 = 6 > 0\]  
- **Interval \( (\frac{2}{5}, \infty) \)**: Test \( x = 1 \):  
  \[-10(1)^2 - 11(1) + 6 = -10 - 11 + 6 = -15 < 0\]  

The expression \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) holds for \( x \in \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution to the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\). Check the boundary points and confirm the interval \(\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right]\) ensures the expression inside the square root is non-negative.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the boundary points:  
- At \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \):  
  \[-10\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 11\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{9}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + 6 = -\frac{90}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = -22.5 + 16.5 + 6 = 0\]  
- At \( x = \frac{2}{5} \):  
  \[-10\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 - 11\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{4}{25} - \frac{22}{5} + 6 = -\frac{40}{25} - \frac{110}{25} + \frac{150}{25} = \frac{-40 - 110 + 150}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0\]  

Both boundary points yield zero, which is non-negative, so they are included in the domain. The test points from Step 2 confirm the expression is positive between the roots and negative outside, validating the interval \(\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right]\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the condition for the function to be defined (\(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution.  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the domain with endpoints as common fractions.  

**Current Goal**: Express the domain with endpoints as common fractions.  

The inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) was solved, and the solution validated as \( x \in \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \). The endpoints \(-\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\) are already common fractions, satisfying the requirement.

### Final Answer
The domain of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \) is \(\left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right]\).
