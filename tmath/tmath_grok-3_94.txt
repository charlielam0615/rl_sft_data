### Problem Restatement
We need to find the domain of the real-valued function \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \). Since the function involves a square root, the expression inside the square root, \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\), must be non-negative for \( f(x) \) to be defined in the real numbers. Thus, we need to solve the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) and express the endpoints of the solution set as common fractions.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the domain, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set up the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\).  
2. Solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\) to find the boundary points.  
3. Determine the intervals where the inequality holds by analyzing the sign of the quadratic expression.  
4. Express the domain with endpoints as common fractions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\) to find the boundary points of the inequality. This will be achieved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\). Multiply through by \(-1\) to simplify:  
\[ 10x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 \]  

Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 10 \), \( b = 11 \), \( c = -6 \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 11^2 - 4 \cdot 10 \cdot (-6) = 121 + 240 = 361 \).  
- Roots: \( x = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2 \cdot 10} = \frac{-11 \pm 19}{20} \).  

Calculate the roots:  
- \( x = \frac{-11 + 19}{20} = \frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} \).  
- \( x = \frac{-11 - 19}{20} = \frac{-30}{20} = \frac{-3}{2} \).  

Thus, the boundary points are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{2}{5} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the intervals where \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) by testing the sign of the quadratic in the intervals defined by the roots \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{2}{5} \). This will be achieved by analyzing the parabolaâ€™s behavior and testing points in each interval.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\) has a negative leading coefficient (\(-10\)), so the parabola opens downward. The inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) holds where the quadratic is non-negative, i.e., above or on the x-axis. The roots divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}) \), \( (-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}) \), and \( (\frac{2}{5}, \infty) \).  

Test points in each interval:  
- For \( x = -2 \) (in \( (-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}) \)):  
  \[-10(-2)^2 - 11(-2) + 6 = -10 \cdot 4 + 22 + 6 = -40 + 28 = -12 < 0.\]  
- For \( x = 0 \) (in \( (-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}) \)):  
  \[-10(0)^2 - 11(0) + 6 = 6 > 0.\]  
- For \( x = 1 \) (in \( (\frac{2}{5}, \infty) \)):  
  \[-10(1)^2 - 11(1) + 6 = -10 - 11 + 6 = -15 < 0.\]  

Since the parabola opens downward, the quadratic is non-negative between the roots, including the endpoints where it equals zero. Thus, the solution to \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) is \( x \in \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the interval \( \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \) is correct by checking the boundary points and ensuring the quadratic is non-negative within this interval. This will be achieved by substituting the endpoints and a point within the interval into the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the boundary points and a point inside:  
- At \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \):  
  \[-10\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 11\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{9}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + 6 = -\frac{90}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = -22.5 + 16.5 + 6 = 0.\]  
- At \( x = \frac{2}{5} \):  
  \[-10\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 - 11\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{4}{25} - \frac{22}{5} + 6 = -\frac{40}{25} - \frac{110}{25} + \frac{150}{25} = \frac{-40 - 110 + 150}{25} = \stru\]

System: It looks like your response was cut off. Let me complete the solution by continuing from the last step, ensuring all requirements are met, and providing a clear and concise answer with the domain's endpoints as common fractions.

### Step 4 (Continued)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the interval \( \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \) is correct by checking the boundary points and ensuring the quadratic is non-negative within this interval. This will be achieved by substituting the endpoints and a point within the interval into the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the boundary points and a point inside:  
- At \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \):  
  \[-10\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 11\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{9}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + 6 = -\frac{90}{4} + \frac{33}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = -22.5 + 16.5 + 6 = 0.\]  
- At \( x = \frac{2}{5} \):  
  \[-10\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 - 11\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) + 6 = -10 \cdot \frac{4}{25} - \frac{22}{5} + 6 = -\frac{40}{25} - \frac{110}{25} + \frac{150}{25} = \frac{-40 - 110 + 150}{25} = \frac{0}{25} = 0.\]  
- At \( x = 0 \) (inside \( \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \)):  
  \[-10(0)^2 - 11(0) + 6 = 6 > 0.\]  

The quadratic equals zero at the boundary points \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{2}{5} \), and is positive within the interval, confirming that \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\) holds for \( x \in \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the inequality \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\). (Completed: Roots are \( x = -\frac{3}{2} \), \( x = \frac{2}{5} \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine intervals where the inequality holds. (Completed: Interval is \( \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution. (Completed: Boundary points and interior point satisfy the inequality)  
  - Subgoal 5: Express the domain with endpoints as common fractions.  

**Current Goal**: Express the domain with endpoints as common fractions.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the domain of the function, which is the interval where \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\), with endpoints as common fractions. This will be achieved by stating the interval using the roots found earlier.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \) is the set of \( x \) where \(-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \geq 0\). From previous steps, this is satisfied for \( x \in \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \). The endpoints are already common fractions: \(-\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\).  

Thus, the domain is:  
\[ \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The domain of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \) is \( \left[-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{5}\right] \).
