Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify and factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms $2x^2$ and $8$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The terms in the expression $2x^2 - 8$ are $2x^2$ and $-8$.  

The coefficients are $2$ and $8$. The GCF of $2$ and $8$ is $2$. There is no common variable factor, so the overall GCF is $2$.  

Factoring out $2$ from both terms:  
$$
2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4)
$$

I am focusing on the second subgoal: fully factoring the quadratic expression $x^2 - 4$.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Fully factor the quadratic expression $x^2 - 4$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expression $x^2 - 4$ is a difference of squares, as $x^2 = (x)^2$ and $4 = (2)^2$.  

Using the difference of squares formula:  
$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
$$  
we can factor $x^2 - 4$ as:  
$$
x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
$$  

Substituting back into the full expression from earlier:  
$$
2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2)
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: The entire solution process, including GCF identification, factoring, and application of the difference of squares.

[VERIFY]
1. **GCF Extraction**: The original expression is $2x^2 - 8$. The GCF of $2x^2$ and $8$ is $2$, which was factored out correctly:  
   $$
   2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4)
   $$  
   This step is valid because $2 \cdot x^2 = 2x^2$ and $2 \cdot (-4) = -8$.  

2. **Difference of Squares**: The expression $x^2 - 4$ is a difference of squares ($a^2 - b^2$) where $a = x$ and $b = 2$. Applying the identity:  
   $$
   x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
   $$  
   Verification: Multiplying $(x - 2)(x + 2)$ yields $x^2 + 2x - 2x - 4 = x^2 - 4$, confirming correctness.  

3. **Final Result**: Substituting back, the fully factored form is $2(x - 2)(x + 2)$. Expanding this:  
   $$
   2(x - 2)(x + 2) = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8,
   $$  
   which matches the original expression.  

All steps are logically consistent and algebraically valid. No errors detected.
