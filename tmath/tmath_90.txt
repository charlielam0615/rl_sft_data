Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Formulate a mathematical expression for the product of two integers given their sum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998 - x$, since their sum is 1998. The product of these two integers is given by the expression:
$$ P(x) = x(1998 - x) $$
This simplifies to:
$$ P(x) = 1998x - x^2 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use calculus or algebraic reasoning to find the maximum product.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expression $ P(x) = 1998x - x^2 $ is a quadratic function that opens downward (since the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is negative). The maximum value of a quadratic function $ ax^2 + bx + c $ occurs at $ x = \frac{-b}{2a} $. In this case, $ a = -1 $ and $ b = 1998 $, so the maximum occurs at:  
$$ x = \frac{-1998}{2(-1)} = \frac{1998}{2} = 999 $$  
Thus, the two integers are $ x = 999 $ and $ 1998 - x = 999 $. The maximum product is therefore:  
$$ P(999) = 999 \times 999 $$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Validate the mathematical derivation, the application of the vertex formula, and the final product calculation.

[VERIFY]
1. **Quadratic Model Validity**: The product $ P(x) = x(1998 - x) $ is correctly formulated, as the sum constraint $ x + y = 1998 $ implies $ y = 1998 - x $. This is algebraically sound.  

2. **Vertex Calculation**: The vertex of a quadratic $ ax^2 + bx + c $ is at $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. Here, $ a = -1 $, $ b = 1998 $, so $ x = -1998/(2 \cdot -1) = 999 $. This step is mathematically correct.  

3. **Integer Constraints**: The problem specifies integers, and $ x = 999 $ is an integer. Thus, the pair $ (999, 999) $ is valid.  

4. **Product Calculation**:  
   - $ 999 \times 999 $ is computed as $ (1000 - 1)^2 = 1000^2 - 2 \cdot 1000 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1,000,000 - 2000 + 1 = 998,001 $.  
   - Manual verification with adjacent integers (e.g., $ 998 \times 1000 = 998,000 $) confirms $ 998,001 $ is indeed greater.  

5. **Edge Case Consideration**: If the problem required distinct integers, the maximum would shift to $ 998 \times 1000 = 998,000 $, but the problem does not impose such a constraint.  

All steps are logically consistent and free of errors.  
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is $\boxed{998001}$.
