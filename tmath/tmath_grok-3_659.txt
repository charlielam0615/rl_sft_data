**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of possible seating arrangements for Mr. and Mrs. Lopez and their two children in a family car, where two people sit in the front (one in the driver's seat, one in the passenger seat) and two in the back. Either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must sit in the driver's seat.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to systematically calculate the number of seating arrangements.  
1. Determine who can sit in the driver's seat.  
2. Assign a person to the front passenger seat from the remaining family members.  
3. Assign the remaining two family members to the back seats.  
4. Calculate the total number of arrangements by considering all choices.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine who can sit in the driver's seat. Since either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must drive, we identify the possible choices for the driver's seat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
There are 2 choices for the driver's seat: Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assign a person to the front passenger seat from the remaining family members after the driver is chosen. With one person in the driver's seat, three family members remain for the passenger seat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After choosing the driver (1 person), there are 3 remaining family members (the non-driving parent and the two children). Any one of these 3 can sit in the front passenger seat. Thus, there are 3 choices for the passenger seat.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assign the remaining two family members to the back seats. After assigning the driver and the front passenger, two people remain to occupy the two back seats. Determine how many ways these seats can be filled.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
After assigning the driver (1 person) and the front passenger (1 person), 2 family members remain. These 2 people will occupy the 2 back seats. If the back seats are indistinguishable, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 people for the back seats, which is a combination since the order of seating in the back does not matter unless specified. Thus, the number of ways to assign the 2 remaining people to the 2 back seats is C(2,2) = 1 (since choosing both remaining people is one outcome). However, if the back seats are distinct (e.g., left and right), we calculate the permutations of the 2 people in the 2 seats: 2! = 2. Given the problem's context of "seating arrangements," we assume the seats are distinct (as is typical in car seating problems).  
Thus, there are 2 ways to arrange the 2 remaining people in the 2 back seats.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal to ensure all steps are aligned.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the total number of seating arrangements.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine choices for the driver's seat (completed: 2 choices).  
  - Subgoal 2: Assign the front passenger seat (completed: 3 choices).  
  - Subgoal 3: Assign the back seats (completed: 2 ways).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Combine the results from previous subgoals to compute the total number of seating arrangements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of seating arrangements by multiplying the number of choices for each step: driver's seat, front passenger seat, and back seats.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the total number of seating arrangements:  
- Driver's seat: 2 choices (Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez).  
- Front passenger seat: 3 choices (from the remaining 3 family members).  
- Back seats: 2 ways (arranging the remaining 2 people in 2 distinct seats).  
Total arrangements = 2 × 3 × 2 = 12.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculated total number of seating arrangements by checking the logic and considering alternative approaches to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the result:  
- **Recompute using an alternative approach**: Consider all 4 seats as distinct and assign people step-by-step. First, choose the driver (2 choices: Mr. or Mrs. Lopez). Then, assign the remaining 3 people to the 3 remaining seats (front passenger, back left, back right), which can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Total = 2 × 6 = 12 arrangements, matching the previous result.  
- **Check assumptions**: The problem specifies that either Mr. or Mrs. Lopez must drive, and the car has two front seats (driver and passenger) and two back seats. Assuming distinct seats is reasonable for a car seating arrangement problem, as seats are typically fixed positions. If the back seats were indistinguishable, the number of arrangements for the back seats would be 1 instead of 2, yielding 2 × 3 × 1 = 6 arrangements, but this is less consistent with typical car seating problems.  
The calculation of 12 arrangements is consistent and appears correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The total number of possible seating arrangements is 12.
