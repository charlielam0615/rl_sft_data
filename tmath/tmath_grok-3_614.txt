**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes to take.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the mathematical concept needed to solve the problem of choosing 3 classes from 8.  
2. Apply the appropriate formula or method to calculate the number of ways.  
3. Verify the calculation to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the mathematical concept needed to choose 3 classes from 8.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that choosing a subset of items without regard to order is a combination problem, which uses the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
This is a combination problem because the order in which Michael chooses the classes does not matter. The formula for combinations is \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items (8 classes), and \( k \) is the number of items to choose (3 classes). Thus, we need to calculate \( C(8, 3) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate \( C(8, 3) \) using the combination formula.  
How to Achieve: Compute \( C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3!5!} \), simplifying the factorials and performing the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \( C(8, 3) \):  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 5!} \]  
The \( 5! \) terms cancel out, leaving:  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \]  
So, there are 56 ways to choose 3 classes from 8.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculation \( C(8, 3) = 56 \).  
How to Achieve: Recalculate using an alternative method, such as the binomial coefficient or listing a few combinations to confirm, and check for arithmetic errors.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, recompute \( C(8, 3) \) using the binomial coefficient:  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \]  
Alternatively, note that \( C(8, 3) = C(8, 5) \) because \( C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) \). Calculate:  
\[ C(8, 5) = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{6720}{120} = 56 \]  
Both methods yield 56, confirming the calculation. Additionally, the result is reasonable since combinations produce whole numbers, and 56 is a plausible number of ways to choose 3 items from 8.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the mathematical concept (completed: combination formula).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate \( C(8, 3) \) (completed: result is 56).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation (completed: validated using alternative method).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The calculation is complete, and the solution has been verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes in 56 ways.
