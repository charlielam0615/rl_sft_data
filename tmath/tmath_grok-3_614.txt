**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes to take.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
- Subgoal 1: Identify the type of problem (e.g., combination, permutation, or other).  
- Subgoal 2: Determine the appropriate mathematical formula or method.  
- Subgoal 3: Apply the formula with the given values (n=8, r=3).  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of problem. This involves analyzing whether the problem involves combinations (where order does not matter) or permutations (where order matters), based on the problem's wording.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The problem asks for the number of ways to "choose" 3 out of 8 math classes. Since the word "choose" is used and there is no indication that the order of selection matters (e.g., no mention of scheduling or sequence), this is a combination problem, where order is irrelevant.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the appropriate mathematical formula for the combination problem. This involves selecting the formula for choosing r items from n items without regard to order.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a combination problem, the number of ways to choose r items from n items is given by the binomial coefficient formula:  
\[ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]  
Here, n = 8 (total math classes) and r = 3 (classes to choose). Thus, the formula is:  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3!5!} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the combination formula \( C(8, 3) \) by calculating the factorials and simplifying the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate \( C(8, 3) \):  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{3! \times 5!} \]  
Since \( 5! \) cancels out in the numerator and denominator:  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3!} \]  
Compute the numerator: \( 8 \times 7 = 56 \), \( 56 \times 6 = 336 \).  
Compute the denominator: \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \).  
Thus:  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \]  
So, there are 56 ways to choose 3 classes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation of \( C(8, 3) \) to ensure accuracy, possibly by using an alternative method or rechecking the computation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate, recompute \( C(8, 3) \) using the combination formula directly with factorials:  
\[ 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320 \]  
\[ 3! = 6 \]  
\[ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \]  
\[ C(8, 3) = \frac{40320}{6 \times 120} = \frac{40320}{720} = 56 \]  
Alternatively, use the combination symmetry property: \( C(n, r) = C(n, n-r) \). So, \( C(8, 3) = C(8, 5) \):  
\[ C(8, 5) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4}{5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{6720}{120} = 56 \]  
Both methods confirm the result is 56.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of problem (Completed: Combination problem).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the appropriate mathematical formula (Completed: \( C(n, r) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula with n=8, r=3 (Completed: Calculated 56).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (Completed: Validated using direct calculation and symmetry).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.

### Final Answer
Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes in 56 ways.
