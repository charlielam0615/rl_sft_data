**Problem Restatement:** I need to find the coefficient of \( x^8 \) in the expansion of \( (x - 1)^9 \).

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to reach the solution. First, I need to recall the binomial theorem, which is used for expanding expressions like \( (x + y)^n \). Then, I will apply it to \( (x - 1)^9 \) to identify the term containing \( x^8 \). Finally, I will extract the coefficient of that term.

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Understand and apply the binomial theorem to expand \( (x - 1)^9 \).  
How to Achieve: I will use the binomial theorem formula \( (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k \), adapting it to \( (x - 1)^9 \) where \( y = -1 \), and identify the term where the power of \( x \) is 8.

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \( (x - 1)^9 \) can be written as:  
\[ (x - 1)^9 = \sum_{k=0}^{9} \binom{9}{k} x^{9-k} (-1)^k \]  
I need the term where the power of \( x \) is 8, so I solve for \( k \) in the exponent of \( x \):  
\[ 9 - k = 8 \]  
\[ k = 1 \]  
The term corresponding to \( k = 1 \) is:  
\[ \binom{9}{1} x^{9-1} (-1)^1 = \binom{9}{1} x^8 (-1) = 9 \cdot x^8 \cdot (-1) = -9 x^8 \]  
Thus, the coefficient of \( x^8 \) is \(-9\).

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the identified term and coefficient.  
How to Achieve: I will double-check the calculation of \( k \) and the application of the binomial theorem formula to ensure no errors in the exponent or the coefficient computation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let me verify the calculation. The general term in the expansion is \( \binom{9}{k} x^{9-k} (-1)^k \). For \( x^8 \), \( 9 - k = 8 \), so \( k = 1 \). Then, the coefficient is \( \binom{9}{1} \cdot (-1)^1 = 9 \cdot (-1) = -9 \). This matches my earlier result. To further confirm, I can check another term, say for \( k = 0 \), the term is \( \binom{9}{0} x^9 (-1)^0 = 1 \cdot x^9 \cdot 1 = x^9 \), which is correct. For \( k = 2 \), the term is \( \binom{9}{2} x^7 (-1)^2 = 36 x^7 \), which also aligns with the pattern. The calculation for \( k = 1 \) seems consistent.
