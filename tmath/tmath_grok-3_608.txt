### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the coefficient of \( x^8 \) in \( (x - 1)^9 \), we need to:
1. Identify the appropriate mathematical tool for polynomial expansion (e.g., the Binomial Theorem).
2. Apply the tool to find the term containing \( x^8 \).
3. Extract the coefficient of that term.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the term containing \( x^8 \) in the expansion of \( (x - 1)^9 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the Binomial Theorem, which states that for \( (a + b)^n \), the general term is given by \( \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \). Here, \( a = x \), \( b = -1 \), and \( n = 9 \). We need the term where the exponent of \( x \) is 8, and then compute its coefficient.

[IMP]
The Binomial Theorem gives the expansion of \( (x - 1)^9 \) as:
\[
(x - 1)^9 = \sum_{k=0}^9 \binom{9}{k} x^{9-k} (-1)^k
\]
We need the term where the exponent of \( x \) is 8, i.e., \( 9 - k = 8 \). Solving for \( k \):
\[
k = 9 - 8 = 1
\]
The general term is:
\[
\binom{9}{k} x^{9-k} (-1)^k
\]
For \( k = 1 \):
\[
\binom{9}{1} x^{9-1} (-1)^1 = \binom{9}{1} x^8 (-1) = 9 \cdot x^8 \cdot (-1) = -9 x^8
\]
Thus, the coefficient of \( x^8 \) is \(-9\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the coefficient of \( x^8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculation by recomputing the term for \( k = 1 \) and confirm using an alternative method, such as computing the coefficient for a nearby term (e.g., \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 2 \)) to ensure consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute for \( k = 1 \):
\[
\binom{9}{1} = \frac{9!}{1! \cdot 8!} = 9
\]
\[
(-1)^1 = -1
\]
\[
x^{9-1} = x^8
\]
\[
\binom{9}{1} x^8 (-1)^1 = 9 \cdot x^8 \cdot (-1) = -9 x^8
\]
The coefficient is \(-9\), which matches our previous result.

To further validate, compute the coefficient for \( k = 0 \) (term with \( x^9 \)):
\[
\binom{9}{0} x^{9-0} (-1)^0 = 1 \cdot x^9 \cdot 1 = x^9
\]
For \( k = 2 \) (term with \( x^7 \)):
\[
\binom{9}{2} x^{9-2} (-1)^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2 \cdot 1} x^7 \cdot 1 = 36 x^7
\]
These calculations align with the Binomial Theorem, confirming the correctness of our approach. The coefficient of \( x^8 \) remains \(-9\).
