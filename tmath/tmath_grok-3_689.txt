### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes. The balls are distinct (e.g., labeled B1, B2, B3, B4), and the boxes are distinct (e.g., labeled Box A and Box B). Each ball must be placed in one of the two boxes, and the boxes can contain any number of balls (including zero).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the number of ways to distribute the balls.  
- Subgoal 1: Determine the possible choices for each ball.  
- Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of ways to assign all balls to the boxes.  
- Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation method to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Compute the total number of ways to assign 4 distinguishable balls to 2 distinguishable boxes.  
- **How to Achieve**: Since each ball is distinguishable and each box is distinguishable, each of the 4 balls can independently be placed in either Box A or Box B (2 choices per ball). The total number of ways is the product of the choices for each ball.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each of the 4 distinguishable balls can be placed in one of 2 distinguishable boxes. For each ball, there are 2 choices (Box A or Box B). Since the balls are independent, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is:  
\[ 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^4 = 16. \]  
Thus, there are 16 possible ways to assign the 4 balls to the 2 boxes.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculation (16 ways).  
- **How to Achieve**: Use an alternative method, such as considering the number of balls in each box, to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, consider the distribution of balls by the number in Box A:  
- Box A can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls, with Box B having the remaining balls (4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, respectively).  
- For each case, choose the balls for Box A:  
  - 0 balls in Box A: \(\binom{4}{0} = 1\) way (all 4 in Box B).  
  - 1 ball in Box A: \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\) ways (1 in Box A, 3 in Box B).  
  - 2 balls in Box A: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways (2 in Box A, 2 in Box B).  
  - 3 balls in Box A: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) ways (3 in Box A, 1 in Box B).  
  - 4 balls in Box A: \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\) way (all 4 in Box A).  
- Total ways: \(1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16\).  
This matches the earlier calculation (\(2^4 = 16\)), confirming the result.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the possible choices for each ball (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the total number of ways to assign all balls (computed as 16).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the calculation method (validated using an alternative approach).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, with the answer confirmed as 16 ways. No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
There are 16 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.
