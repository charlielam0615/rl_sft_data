Goal of this step: Identify the initial rectangular band formation equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $ m $ be the number of members in each row and $ r $ be the number of rows in the initial formation. The total number of band members is less than 100 and there are 2 members left over when arranged in the initial formation. Therefore, we can write the equation:
$$ m \cdot r + 2 < 100 $$

Goal of this step: Identify the new rectangular band formation equation after the adjustments.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
When the director increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, the total number of members fits exactly into the new formation. This gives the equation:  
$$ (m + 1) \cdot (r - 2) = \text{total members} $$  
From the problem, we know the total number of members is the same in both cases, and it is equal to $ m \cdot r + 2 $. Substituting this, we get:  
$$ (m + 1)(r - 2) = m \cdot r + 2 $$

Goal of this step: Set up a system of equations based on the given conditions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous steps, we have the following equations:  
1. $ m \cdot r + 2 < 100 $  
2. $ (m + 1)(r - 2) = m \cdot r + 2 $  

Letâ€™s simplify the second equation to create a relationship between $ m $ and $ r $:  
$$ (m + 1)(r - 2) = m \cdot r + 2 $$  
Expanding the left-hand side:  
$$ m \cdot r - 2m + r - 2 = m \cdot r + 2 $$  
Now subtract $ m \cdot r $ from both sides:  
$$ -2m + r - 2 = 2 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ r - 2m = 4 $$  
Rewriting, we get:  
$$ r = 2m + 4 $$

Goal of this step: Substitute $ r = 2m + 4 $ into $ m \cdot r + 2 < 100 $ to find valid integer values for $ m $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We substitute $ r = 2m + 4 $ into $ m \cdot r + 2 < 100 $:  
$$ m \cdot (2m + 4) + 2 < 100 $$  
Simplify the left-hand side:  
$$ 2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100 $$  
Subtract 100 from both sides:  
$$ 2m^2 + 4m - 98 < 0 $$  
Divide the entire inequality by 2:  
$$ m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0 $$  
Now solve the quadratic inequality $ m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0 $.

The roots of the quadratic equation $ m^2 + 2m - 49 = 0 $ are:  
$$ m = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 196}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{200}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{2} $$  
$$ m = -1 \pm 5\sqrt{2} $$  
Approximating $ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 $, we get:  
$$ m = -1 \pm 7.07 $$  
So the roots are approximately $ m \approx -8.07 $ and $ m \approx 6.07 $.

The inequality $ m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0 $ holds for values between these roots:  
$$ -8.07 < m < 6.07 $$  

Since $ m $ must be a positive integer, we consider integer values from 1 to 6 for $ m $.

For each integer $ m $ from 1 to 6, calculate $ r = 2m + 4 $:

- For $ m = 3 $, $ r = 2(3) + 4 = 10 $

Goal of this step: Calculate the total number of band members for each valid pair $ (m, r) $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total number of band members for each pair $ (m, r) $ is given by $ m \cdot r + 2 $. Let's compute this for each $ m $ and $ r $:  

- For $ m = 1, r = 6 $: $ 1 \cdot 6 + 2 = 8 $  
- For $ m = 2, r = 8 $: $ 2 \cdot 8 + 2 = 18 $  
- For $ m = 3, r = 10 $: $ 3 \cdot 10 + 2 = 32 $  
- For $ m = 4, r = 12 $: $ 4 \cdot 12 + 2 = 50 $  
- For $ m = 5, r = 14 $: $ 5 \cdot 14 + 2 = 72 $  
- For $ m = 6, r = 16 $: $ 6 \cdot 16 + 2 = 98 $  

All these values are less than 100, satisfying the constraint.  

Now, let's verify that each calculated total number of band members fits into the new formation $ (m + 1)(r - 2) $ exactly.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Verify that each calculated total number of band members fits into the new formation $ (m + 1)(r - 2) $ exactly.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We need to check whether $ (m + 1)(r - 2) = m \cdot r + 2 $ holds for all the calculated pairs $ (m, r) $. Let's compute the left-hand side for each pair:

- For $ m = 1, r = 6 $: $ (1 + 1)(6 - 2) = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 $  
- For $ m = 2, r = 8 $: $ (2 + 1)(8 - 2) = 3 \cdot 6 = 18 $  
- For $ m = 3, r = 10 $: $ (3 + 1)(10 - 2) = 4 \cdot 8 = 32 $  
- For $ m = 4, r = 12 $: $ (4 + 1)(12 - 2) = 5 \cdot 10 = 50 $  
- For $ m = 5, r = 14 $: $ (5 + 1)(14 - 2) = 6 \cdot 12 = 72 $  
- For $ m = 6, r = 16 $: $ (6 + 1)(16 - 2) = 7 \cdot 14 = 98 $  

Each value matches $ m \cdot r + 2 $, confirming the validity of these pairs.

Scope of verification: Ensure that the derived solution (98 members) is the correct maximum under the problem's constraints and that all steps leading to this conclusion are logically sound and free of errors.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The solution process followed these key steps:
1. **Equation derivation**: The problem's conditions were translated into equations. The initial formation is $ m \cdot r + 2 $, and the new formation is $ (m + 1)(r - 2) $. Equating these gives $ (m + 1)(r - 2) = m \cdot r + 2 $. This was expanded and simplified to $ r = 2m + 4 $, which is correct.
   
2. **Constraint application**: Substituting $ r = 2m + 4 $ into the inequality $ m \cdot r + 2 < 100 $ led to $ 2m^2 + 4m - 98 < 0 $. Solving this quadratic inequality yielded valid integer values for $ m $ (1 to 6). This step is valid and the quadratic solution is accurate.

3. **Calculation of totals**: For each valid $ m $, the corresponding $ r $ was computed and used to calculate the total members $ m \cdot r + 2 $. All resulting totals (8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98) are verified to be less than 100 and satisfy the formation condition $ (m + 1)(r - 2) $. This confirms the validity of each pair.

4. **Selection of maximum**: Among the valid totals, 98 is the largest. The problem explicitly states that the band has **less than 100** members, and 98 satisfies this constraint.

No inconsistencies or errors were found in the derivation, calculations, or validations. The logic and arithmetic are consistent throughout, and all conditions of the problem are satisfied.
