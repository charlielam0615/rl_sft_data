**Problem Statement**: Bill is tasked with calculating \( a - b - c \), but he mistakenly calculates \( a - (b - c) \) and gets 11. The correct answer for \( a - b - c \) is 3. We need to find the value of \( a - b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Set up equations based on the given information about Bill's incorrect calculation and the correct answer.  
2. Solve the equations to find the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
3. Determine the value of \( a - b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations using the given information. This involves expressing Bill's incorrect calculation \( a - (b - c) = 11 \) and the correct calculation \( a - b - c = 3 \), then simplifying to find relationships between the variables.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the problem:  
- Bill's incorrect calculation: \( a - (b - c) = 11 \).  
- Correct calculation: \( a - b - c = 3 \).  

Rewrite the incorrect calculation:  
\[ a - (b - c) = a - b + c = 11 \]  

We now have two equations:  
1. \( a - b + c = 11 \)  
2. \( a - b - c = 3 \)  

Add the two equations to eliminate \( c \):  
\[ (a - b + c) + (a - b - c) = 11 + 3 \]  
\[ (a - b) + (a - b) = 14 \]  
\[ 2(a - b) = 14 \]  
\[ a - b = 7 \]  

The value of \( a - b \) is 7.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by substituting \( a - b = 7 \) back into the equations to ensure consistency with the given conditions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using \( a - b = 7 \), check if the equations hold:  
- From equation 1: \( a - b + c = 7 + c = 11 \implies c = 4 \).  
- Substitute \( c = 4 \) into equation 2: \( a - b - c = 7 - 4 = 3 \), which matches the correct answer.  
- For Bill's calculation: \( a - (b - c) = a - b + c = 7 + 4 = 11 \), which matches the incorrect answer.  

The solution is consistent with both conditions.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( a - b \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations based on Bill's incorrect calculation and the correct answer (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find \( a - b \) (completed, found \( a - b = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, solution is consistent).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer for \( a - b \).  

The calculations show \( a - b = 7 \), and validation confirms this satisfies both the incorrect and correct calculations.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( a - b \) is 7.
