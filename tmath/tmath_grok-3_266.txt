**Problem Restatement**: The teacher asked Bill to calculate \( a - b - c \), but Bill mistakenly calculated \( a - (b - c) \) and got an answer of 11. The correct answer for \( a - b - c \) is 3. We need to find the value of \( a - b \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( a - b \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given information to set up equations based on Bill's mistake and the correct answer.  
2. Solve the equations to find relationships between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).  
3. Isolate \( a - b \) as required.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up equations using the given information.  
**How to Achieve**: Use Bill's incorrect calculation \( a - (b - c) = 11 \) and the correct calculation \( a - b - c = 3 \) to form a system of equations, then simplify to find relationships.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Bill's incorrect calculation is \( a - (b - c) = 11 \). Simplify this:  
\[ a - (b - c) = a - b + c = 11 \quad (1) \]  

The correct calculation is:  
\[ a - b - c = 3 \quad (2) \]  

To proceed, we need to find \( a - b \). Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):  
\[ (a - b + c) - (a - b - c) = 11 - 3 \]  
\[ (a - a) + (-b + b) + (c - (-c)) = 8 \]  
\[ 0 + 0 + 2c = 8 \]  
\[ 2c = 8 \]  
\[ c = 4 \]  

Now substitute \( c = 4 \) into equation (2):  
\[ a - b - 4 = 3 \]  
\[ a - b = 7 \]  

Thus, \( a - b = 7 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if \( a - b = 7 \) is consistent with both given conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( c = 4 \) and \( a - b = 7 \) back into both equations to ensure they hold.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( c = 4 \) and \( a - b = 7 \):  
- For the correct calculation (\( a - b - c = 3 \)):  
  \[ a - b - c = 7 - 4 = 3 \]  
  This satisfies the correct answer.  

- For Bill's incorrect calculation (\( a - (b - c) = 11 \)):  
  \[ a - (b - c) = a - b + c = 7 + 4 = 11 \]  
  This satisfies Bill's answer.  

The solution \( a - b = 7 \) is consistent with both conditions.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( a - b \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations using Bill's mistake (\( a - (b - c) = 11 \)) and the correct answer (\( a - b - c = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( c \) by subtracting the equations.  
  - Subgoal 3: Use \( c \) to find \( a - b \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution by checking both equations.  

**Current Goal**: Completedâ€”\( a - b = 7 \) has been found and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \( a - b \) is 7.
