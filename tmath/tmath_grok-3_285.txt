**Problem Statement**: Factor the expression \( 36 - 9x^2 \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of factoring \( 36 - 9x^2 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the structure of the expression.  
2. Simplify the expression by factoring out common terms.  
3. Recognize and apply any relevant algebraic identities (e.g., difference of squares).  
4. Write the final factored form.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \( 36 - 9x^2 \) by factoring out common terms. This will be achieved by identifying and extracting the greatest common factor (GCF) from both terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression is \( 36 - 9x^2 \). Both terms, 36 and \( 9x^2 \), are divisible by 9. Factoring out the GCF:  
\[ 36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2) \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the expression \( 4 - x^2 \) further, if possible, by recognizing any algebraic patterns, such as the difference of squares.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expression \( 4 - x^2 \) is a difference of squares, since \( 4 = 2^2 \) and \( x^2 = x^2 \). The difference of squares formula is \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). Here, \( a = 2 \) and \( b = x \):  
\[ 4 - x^2 = 2^2 - x^2 = (2 - x)(2 + x) \]  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[ 36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the factored form \( 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \) is correct by expanding it back to the original expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \):  
First, compute \( (2 - x)(2 + x) \):  
\[ (2 - x)(2 + x) = 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot x - x \cdot 2 - x \cdot x = 4 + 2x - 2x - x^2 = 4 - x^2 \]  
Then multiply by 9:  
\[ 9(4 - x^2) = 9 \cdot 4 - 9 \cdot x^2 = 36 - 9x^2 \]  
The result matches the original expression, confirming the factorization is correct.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Factor \( 36 - 9x^2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the structure of the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify by factoring out common terms (completed: factored out 9 to get \( 9(4 - x^2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply algebraic identities to factor further (completed: recognized \( 4 - x^2 \) as a difference of squares, factored to \( (2 - x)(2 + x) \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Write the final factored form (completed: \( 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the factorization (completed: expanded to confirm correctness).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
The final factored form is \( 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ 36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x) \]
