**Problem Statement**: Factor the expression \(36 - 9x^2\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of factoring \(36 - 9x^2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the structure of the expression.  
2. Simplify the expression by factoring out common terms.  
3. Recognize and apply the appropriate factoring technique (e.g., difference of squares).  
4. Verify the factored form.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression by factoring out common terms. This involves checking for a greatest common factor (GCF) in the terms 36 and \(-9x^2\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is \(36 - 9x^2\). Both terms are divisible by 9:  
- \(36 = 9 \cdot 4\)  
- \(-9x^2 = 9 \cdot (-x^2)\)  
Factor out the GCF, which is 9:  
\(36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2)\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the expression \(4 - x^2\) further, if possible, by recognizing it as a difference of squares.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression inside the parentheses, \(4 - x^2\), can be rewritten as \(2^2 - (x)^2\), which is a difference of squares. Using the formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\), where \(a = 2\) and \(b = x\):  
\(4 - x^2 = 2^2 - x^2 = (2 - x)(2 + x)\)  
Thus, the full expression becomes:  
\(36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the factored form \(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\) is equivalent to the original expression \(36 - 9x^2\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand the factored expression to confirm:  
\(9(2 - x)(2 + x) = 9(4 - x^2) = 9 \cdot 4 - 9 \cdot x^2 = 36 - 9x^2\)  
The result matches the original expression, confirming the factoring is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Factor \(36 - 9x^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the structure of the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify by factoring out common terms (completed: factored out 9).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the difference of squares formula (completed: factored \(4 - x^2\) as \((2 - x)(2 + x)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the factored form (completed: expansion confirmed correctness).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The final factored form is \(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The factored form of \(36 - 9x^2\) is \(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\).
