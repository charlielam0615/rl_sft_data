**Problem Restatement:** We have four standard six-sided dice, and we are rolling them. We need to find the probability that the sum of the values on the dice is odd, given that the product of their values is even. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to understand the conditions and compute the required conditional probability. First, I need to define the sample space for rolling four dice. Then, I will identify the outcomes where the product is even. Next, among those outcomes, I will determine the outcomes where the sum is odd. Finally, I will compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes where the product is even.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four six-sided dice.  
Description: Calculate the total sample space by considering each die has 6 faces, and the rolls are independent.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die can show a value from 1 to 6, so for four dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^4.  
6^4 = 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 1296.  
So, there are 1296 possible outcomes in the sample space.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify the condition for the product of the dice values to be even.  
Description: Analyze when the product of four numbers is even, which occurs if at least one of the numbers is even.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The product of the values on the four dice is even if at least one of the dice shows an even number (2, 4, or 6). Equivalently, the product is odd only if all four dice show odd numbers (1, 3, or 5). I will use this to find the number of outcomes where the product is even by subtracting the outcomes where the product is odd from the total outcomes.  
- Number of odd values per die: 3 (1, 3, 5).  
- Outcomes where all dice are odd: 3^4 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.  
- Therefore, outcomes where the product is even (at least one die is even): 1296 - 81 = 1215.  
So, there are 1215 outcomes where the product is even.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Determine the condition for the sum of the dice values to be odd.  
Description: Analyze when the sum of four numbers is odd, which depends on the number of odd values among them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The sum of the values on the four dice is odd if the number of dice showing odd values is odd (i.e., 1 or 3 dice show odd numbers). This is because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even (when combined with any number of even numbers). I will calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is odd within the outcomes where the product is even in the next steps.

**Step 5:**

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Compute the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the total number of outcomes (completed: 1296 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine outcomes where the product is even (completed: 1215 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine outcomes where the sum is odd among those with an even product (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the conditional probability.  
Current Goal: Subgoal 3 - Determine the number of outcomes where the sum is odd among those with an even product.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is odd and the product is even.  
Description: Count outcomes with an odd number of odd dice (1 or 3 odd dice) since the sum is odd in these cases, and ensure the product is even (which is automatic if there are 1 or 3 odd dice, as there will be at least one even die).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since the product is even as long as there is at least one even die, I need to count outcomes where the number of odd dice is 1 or 3 (sum is odd), as these will automatically have at least one even die.  
- Case 1: Exactly 1 die is odd (3 even dice).  
  - Choose which die is odd: 4 ways.  
  - Odd die can be 1, 3, or 5: 3 choices.  
  - Each even die can be 2, 4, or 6: 3 choices per die.  
  - Total for this case: 4 * 3 * (3^3) = 4 * 3 * 27 = 324 outcomes.  
- Case 2: Exactly 3 dice are odd (1 even die).  
  - Choose which die is even: 4 ways.  
  - Even die can be 2, 4, or 6: 3 choices.  
  - Each odd die can be 1, 3, or 5: 3 choices per die.  
  - Total for this case: 4 * 3 * (3^3) = 4 * 3 * 27 = 324 outcomes.  
- Total outcomes where sum is odd and product is even: 324 + 324 = 648.  
So, there are 648 favorable outcomes where the sum is odd and the product is even.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculations for outcomes with odd sum and even product.  
Description: Double-check the counting for each case to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let me verify the calculations:  
- For 1 odd die: 4 choices for which die is odd, 3 choices for its value, and 3 choices for each of the 3 even dice: 4 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 4 * 3^4 = 4 * 81 = 324 (correct).  
- For 3 odd dice: 4 choices for which die is even, 3 choices for its value, and 3 choices for each of the 3 odd dice: 4 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 4 * 3^4 = 4 * 81 = 324 (correct).  
- Total: 324 + 324 = 648 (correct).  
The total outcomes with even product are 1215, and since 648 is less than 1215, it seems plausible. Also, note that outcomes with 2 or 4 odd dice would have an even sum, and outcomes with 0 odd dice (all even) have an even sum, so they are correctly excluded. This confirms the count of 648 favorable outcomes.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute the conditional probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even.  
Description: Use the formula for conditional probability, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes in the condition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The conditional probability is the number of outcomes where the sum is odd and the product is even, divided by the total number of outcomes where the product is even.  
- Favorable outcomes (sum odd and product even): 648.  
- Total outcomes (product even): 1215.  
- Probability = 648 / 1215.  
Now, simplify this fraction:  
- Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 648 รท 9 = 72, 1215 รท 9 = 135.  
- Divide by 9 again: 72 รท 9 = 8, 135 รท 9 = 15.  
- So, 8 / 15.  
Therefore, the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is 8/15.  
[/IMP]

**Step 9:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Recall Info (Review Category)  
Meta-data: Retrieve information related to the calculation of probabilities and simplification of fractions to confirm the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Current Goal: Confirm the final probability calculation.  
Summarized Information:  
- Total outcomes for four dice: 1296 (from Step 2).  
- Outcomes with even product: 1215 (from Step 3).  
- Outcomes with odd sum and even product: 648 (from Step 6).  
- Probability computed as 648/1215, simplified to 8/15 (from Step 8).  
This summary serves as a pointer to the detailed calculations in previous steps for verification.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 10:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Final validation of the solution.  
Description: Ensure the answer makes sense and matches the problem's requirement of expressing the probability as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The calculated probability is 8/15, which is already a simplified common fraction. To double-check the simplification:  
- Greatest common divisor of 648 and 1215: Divide by 9 twice (648/9=72, 1215/9=135; 72/9=8, 135/9=15), so 8/15 is correct.  
Additionally, the result seems reasonable since roughly half of the outcomes with even product should have an odd sum (as the parity of the sum depends on the number of odd dice), and 8/15 is close to 1/2, which aligns with intuition. Thus, the final answer is 8/15.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:** The probability that the sum of the values on the four dice is odd, given that their product is even, is 8/15.
