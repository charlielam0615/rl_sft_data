### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that the sum of the values on four standard six-sided dice is odd, given that the product of their values is even. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling four six-sided dice.  
2. Identify the outcomes where the product is even.  
3. Among those, count the outcomes where the sum is odd.  
4. Compute the conditional probability as the ratio of outcomes with an odd sum to outcomes with an even product.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of outcomes for rolling four six-sided dice. This can be achieved by computing the number of possible results for each die and combining them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 6 faces, so for four dice, the total number of outcomes is:  
\[ 6^4 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 1296. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the number of outcomes where the product of the four dice values is even. A product is even if at least one die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6). We can compute this by subtracting the number of outcomes where all dice show odd numbers (1, 3, or 5) from the total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 3 odd faces (1, 3, 5). If all four dice show odd numbers, the number of such outcomes is:  
\[ 3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81. \]  
The product is even if at least one die is even, so the number of outcomes with an even product is:  
\[ 6^4 - 3^4 = 1296 - 81 = 1215. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the outcomes where the product is even and the sum is odd. We need to analyze the parity of the sum (odd or even) among the outcomes with at least one even die value. Consider the sum’s parity based on the number of odd and even dice.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The sum of four dice is odd if the number of odd-valued dice is odd (1 or 3), since odd + odd = even, odd + even = odd, and even + even = even. We calculate outcomes with an even product (at least one even die) and an odd sum:  

- **Case 1: Exactly 1 odd die (3 even dice)**  
  - Choose 1 die to be odd: \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\).  
  - Odd die has 3 choices (1, 3, 5): \(3^1 = 3\).  
  - Each even die has 3 choices (2, 4, 6): \(3^3 = 27\).  
  - Outcomes: \(4 \times 3 \times 27 = 324\).  
  - Sum parity: 1 odd + 3 even = odd (odd sum).  
  - Product: At least 3 even dice ensure an even product.  

- **Case 2: Exactly 3 odd dice (1 even die)**  
  - Choose 3 dice to be odd: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).  
  - Each odd die has 3 choices: \(3^3 = 27\).  
  - Even die has 3 choices: \(3^1 = 3\).  
  - Outcomes: \(4 \times 27 \times 3 = 324\).  
  - Sum parity: 3 odd + 1 even = odd (odd sum).  
  - Product: 1 even die ensures an even product.  

- **Other cases**:  
  - 0 odd dice (4 even): Sum is even (even + even = even).  
  - 2 odd dice (2 even): Sum is even (odd + odd = even).  
  - 4 odd dice: Product is odd, so excluded.  

Total outcomes with even product and odd sum:  
\[ 324 + 324 = 648. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculations for outcomes with an even product and odd sum. Cross-check by considering the parity of sums and products, and ensure no cases are missed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute outcomes with even product:  
- All odd: \(3^4 = 81\).  
- Even product: \(6^4 - 3^4 = 1296 - 81 = 1215\).  
For odd sum with even product, only cases with 1 or 3 odd dice contribute (648 outcomes).  
Alternatively, note that for even product (at least one even die), sums are equally likely to be odd or even due to symmetry in dice values. Thus, the number of odd-sum outcomes should be half of 1215:  
\[ \frac{1215}{2} = 607.5 \text{ (not integer, indicating a need to recheck)}. \]  
The case-by-case count (648) is consistent, so proceed with 648.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Track Goals**:  
- Main goal: Compute the probability that the sum is odd given an even product.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total outcomes (completed: 1296).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate outcomes with even product (completed: 1215).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate outcomes with even product and odd sum (completed: 648).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute conditional probability (pending).  
**Current goal**: Compute the conditional probability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy reflects progress: total outcomes (1296), even-product outcomes (1215), and even-product odd-sum outcomes (648). The next step is to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the number of even-product outcomes.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the conditional probability as the ratio of outcomes with an even product and odd sum to outcomes with an even product.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The probability is:  
\[ P(\text{odd sum} \mid \text{even product}) = \frac{\text{Outcomes with even product and odd sum}}{\text{Outcomes with even product}} = \frac{648}{1215}. \]  
Simplify the fraction:  
- Divide numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.  
- Check divisibility: Both are divisible by 3.  
\[ \frac{648 \div 3}{1215 \div 3} = \frac{216}{405}. \]  
- Divide by 3 again:  
\[ \frac{216 \div 3}{405 \div 3} = \frac{72}{135}. \]  
- Divide by 9:  
\[ \frac{72 \div 9}{135 \div 9} = \frac{8}{15}. \]  
- Check if \(\frac{8}{15}\) is in simplest form: GCD(8, 15) = 1, so it is simplified.  
Thus, the probability is \(\frac{8}{15}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final probability by rechecking the fraction simplification and considering an alternative approach to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reverify simplification:  
\[ \frac{648}{1215} \div \frac{3}{3} = \frac{216}{405} \div \frac{3}{3} = \frac{72}{135} \div \frac{9}{9} = \frac{8}{15}. \]  
Alternative approach: For outcomes with at least one even die, the sum’s parity depends on the number of odd dice. Since odd and even sums are symmetric (each die value can be paired, e.g., 1 vs. 2), the probability of an odd sum given an even product is often \(\frac{1}{2}\). However, our count (648/1215 = 8/15) suggests a deviation. Recheck case counts:  
- 1 odd die: 324 outcomes.  
- 3 odd dice: 324 outcomes.  
- Total: 648, which is correct per earlier steps.  
The fraction \(\frac{8}{15}\) is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that the sum of the values on four six-sided dice is odd, given that their product is even, is \(\frac{8}{15}\).  
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{8}{15}} \]
