**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Distribute the subtraction across the complex numbers.  
2. Combine the real parts.  
3. Combine the imaginary parts.  
4. Present the simplified result in standard form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Distribute the subtraction across the complex numbers.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the expression \((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\) by distributing the negative sign to the second complex number, resulting in \(-3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distribute the subtraction:  
\((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine the real parts and the imaginary parts.  
**How to Achieve**: Group the real parts (\(-3 - 1\)) and the imaginary parts (\(-2i - 4i\)) from the expression \(-3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Combine the real parts: \(-3 - 1 = -4\).  
Combine the imaginary parts: \(-2i - 4i = -6i\).  
The expression becomes: \(-4 - 6i\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the simplified expression \(-4 - 6i\).  
**How to Achieve**: Verify the calculation by re-computing the subtraction and ensuring the real and imaginary parts are correctly combined.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-compute:  
\((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
Real parts: \(-3 - 1 = -4\).  
Imaginary parts: \(-2i - 4i = -6i\).  
Result: \(-4 - 6i\), which matches the previous step.  
The expression is in standard form \(a + bi\), with \(a = -4\) and \(b = -6\).
