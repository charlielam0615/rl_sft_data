**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the complex number expression:  
1. Remove the parentheses by distributing the subtraction.  
2. Combine real and imaginary parts separately.  
3. Present the simplified result in standard complex number form (a + bi).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Remove the parentheses by distributing the subtraction.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the subtraction operation by distributing the negative sign to the second complex number, i.e., \((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Distribute the negative sign:  
\((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine real and imaginary parts separately.  
**How to Achieve**: Group the real parts (-3 and -1) and the imaginary parts (-2i and -4i), then perform the arithmetic operations.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Group and simplify:  
Real parts: \(-3 - 1 = -4\)  
Imaginary parts: \(-2i - 4i = -6i\)  
Result: \(-4 - 6i\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Remove parentheses by distributing subtraction (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Combine real and imaginary parts (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Present the result in standard form (in progress).  
**Current Goal**: Present the simplified result in standard complex number form.  
The result from the previous step is \(-4 - 6i\), which is already in the form \(a + bi\) (where \(a = -4\), \(b = -6\)).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the simplified result.  
**How to Achieve**: Recompute the subtraction step-by-step to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i = (-3 - 1) + (-2i - 4i) = -4 - 6i\).  
The result matches the previous computation, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The simplified expression is \(-4 - 6i\).
