**Problem Restatement**: Given two real numbers \( p > 1 \) and \( q > 1 \) satisfying the conditions \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) and \( pq = 4 \), find the value of \( q \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( q \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Use the given condition \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) to express one variable in terms of the other.
2. Use the second condition \( pq = 4 \) to form a system of equations.
3. Solve the system to find \( q \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( p \) in terms of \( q \) using \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\). This can be achieved by manipulating the equation to isolate \(\frac{1}{p}\), then taking the reciprocal to find \( p \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\). Rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{1}{p} = 1 - \frac{1}{q} = \frac{q - 1}{q}.
\]
Take the reciprocal to find \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{q}{q - 1}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the second condition \( pq = 4 \) and the expression \( p = \frac{q}{q - 1} \) to form an equation in terms of \( q \), then solve for \( q \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( p = \frac{q}{q - 1} \) into \( pq = 4 \):
\[
\left( \frac{q}{q - 1} \right) \cdot q = 4.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{q^2}{q - 1} = 4.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( q - 1 \):
\[
q^2 = 4(q - 1).
\]
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:
\[
q^2 - 4q + 4 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
(q - 2)^2 = 0.
\]
Solve:
\[
q = 2.
\]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( q = 2 \) satisfies both given conditions and the constraints \( p > 1 \) and \( q > 1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \( q = 2 \):
- From \( p = \frac{q}{q - 1} \), substitute \( q = 2 \):
\[
p = \frac{2}{2 - 1} = 2.
\]
- Verify \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]
- Verify \( pq = 4 \):
\[
p \cdot q = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
\]
- Check constraints: \( p = 2 > 1 \), \( q = 2 > 1 \).
Both conditions and constraints are satisfied.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find \( q \) given \( p > 1 \), \( q > 1 \), \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\), and \( pq = 4 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Express \( p \) in terms of \( q \) using \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\). (Completed in Step 2)
  - Subgoal 2: Use \( pq = 4 \) to form and solve an equation for \( q \). (Completed in Step 3)
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution satisfies all conditions. (Completed in Step 4)
**Current Goal**: Completed verification; solution is \( q = 2 \).
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( q = 2 \)
