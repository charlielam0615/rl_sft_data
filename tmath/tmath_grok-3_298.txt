### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( q \), given two real numbers \( p > 1 \) and \( q > 1 \) that satisfy the conditions \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) and \( pq = 4 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( q \):  
1. Use the given conditions \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) and \( pq = 4\) to form a system of equations.  
2. Express one variable in terms of the other using \( pq = 4 \).  
3. Substitute into the first equation to solve for \( q \).  
4. Verify that the solution satisfies \( q > 1 \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express \( p \) in terms of \( q \) and substitute into the first equation to form a solvable equation for \( q \).  
**How to Achieve**: From \( pq = 4 \), express \( p = \frac{4}{q} \). Substitute \( p = \frac{4}{q} \) into \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) to create a single equation in \( q \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \( pq = 4 \), we get \( p = \frac{4}{q} \).  
Substitute \( p = \frac{4}{q} \) into \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\):  
\[
\frac{1}{\frac{4}{q}} + \frac{1}{q} = 1
\]
Simplify \(\frac{1}{\frac{4}{q}}\):  
\[
\frac{1}{\frac{4}{q}} = \frac{q}{4}
\]
So the equation becomes:  
\[
\frac{q}{4} + \frac{1}{q} = 1
\]
Multiply through by 4 to clear the denominator:  
\[
q + \frac{4}{q} = 4
\]
Multiply through by \( q \) to eliminate the fraction:  
\[
q^2 + 4 = 4q
\]
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[
q^2 - 4q + 4 = 0
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( q^2 - 4q + 4 = 0 \) to find \( q \).  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula, then select the solution where \( q > 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve \( q^2 - 4q + 4 = 0 \).  
Notice that the equation is a perfect square:  
\[
q^2 - 4q + 4 = (q - 2)^2 = 0
\]
Thus:  
\[
q - 2 = 0 \implies q = 2
\]
Alternatively, use the quadratic formula \( q = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = 4 \):  
\[
q = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 16}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
So, \( q = 2 \). Since \( q = 2 > 1 \), this satisfies the condition \( q > 1 \).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( q = 2 \) satisfies both given conditions and that the corresponding \( p \) satisfies \( p > 1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( p \) using \( pq = 4 \), then check if \( p \) and \( q \) satisfy \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) and \( p > 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
If \( q = 2 \), then from \( pq = 4 \):  
\[
p = \frac{4}{q} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
Check \( p > 1 \): Since \( p = 2 > 1 \), this is satisfied.  
Now verify \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\):  
\[
\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]
This satisfies the first condition.  
Both conditions (\(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\) and \( pq = 4\)) are satisfied with \( p = 2 \), \( q = 2 \).
