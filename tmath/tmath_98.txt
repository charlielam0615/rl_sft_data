Goal of this step: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The original equation is $x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36$. To set it equal to zero, we add 36 to both sides:
$$x^2 + 30x + 180 + 36 = 0$$
Simplifying the left side gives:
$$x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0$ using the quadratic formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 30$, and $c = 216$. Substituting these values into the formula:
$$x = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{30^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 216}}{2 \cdot 1}$$
$$x = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{900 - 864}}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{-30 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{-30 \pm 6}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{-30 + 6}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12$$
$$x = \frac{-30 - 6}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18$$
The roots of the equation are $x = -12$ and $x = -18$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the nonnegative difference between the roots $x = -12$ and $x = -18$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The roots are $x = -12$ and $x = -18$. The difference between the roots is calculated as:
$$|-12 - (-18)| = |-12 + 18| = |6| = 6$$
The nonnegative difference between the roots is $6$.

[VERIFY]
1. Equation rearrangement: Original equation is $x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36$. Adding 36 to both sides yields $x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0$. This is correct as $180 + 36 = 216$.

2. Quadratic formula application:
   - Coefficients: $a = 1$, $b = 30$, $c = 216$ ✓
   - Discriminant calculation: $30^2 - 4(1)(216) = 900 - 864 = 36$ ✓
   - Square root of discriminant: $\sqrt{36} = 6$ ✓
   - Root calculations:
     - $\frac{-30 + 6}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12$ ✓
     - $\frac{-30 - 6}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18$ ✓

3. Difference calculation:
   - Roots at $x = -12$ and $x = -18$
   - Nonnegative difference: $|-12 - (-18)| = |-12 + 18| = |6| = 6$ ✓

All mathematical operations follow algebraic rules correctly. No arithmetic errors or logical inconsistencies detected.
