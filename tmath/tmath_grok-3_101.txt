**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( t \), where each letter (\( c, o, u, n, t, s \)) represents a unique non-zero digit (1 through 9), given the following system of equations:
- \( c + o = u \)
- \( u + n = t \)
- \( t + c = s \)
- \( o + n + s = 12 \)

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( t \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Express variables in terms of others using the given equations.  
2. Use the constraint \( o + n + s = 12 \) to limit possible values.  
3. Ensure all letters represent unique non-zero digits (1–9).  
4. Solve for \( t \) by substituting and testing values.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the variables in terms of each other using the given equations to simplify the system. We will derive relationships from the first three equations and use them in the fourth equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the equations:  
- \( c + o = u \) (1)  
- \( u + n = t \) (2)  
- \( t + c = s \) (3)  
- \( o + n + s = 12 \) (4)  

Substitute \( u = c + o \) from (1) into (2):  
\( t = (c + o) + n = c + o + n \).  

Substitute \( t = c + o + n \) into (3):  
\( s = t + c = (c + o + n) + c = 2c + o + n \).  

Now, use (4): \( o + n + s = 12 \). Substitute \( s = 2c + o + n \):  
\( o + n + (2c + o + n) = 2c + 2o + 2n = 12 \).  
Simplify:  
\( 2(c + o + n) = 12 \implies c + o + n = 6 \).  

Since \( t = c + o + n \), we have:  
\( t = 6 \).  

All letters are non-zero digits, so we need to verify if \( t = 6 \) is consistent with unique digits and the given equations.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether \( t = 6 \) is consistent with the equations and the constraint that all letters represent unique non-zero digits. We will test possible values for \( c, o, n, u, s \) that satisfy \( c + o + n = 6 \), \( c + o = u \), \( u + n = t \), \( t + c = s \), and \( o + n + s = 12 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assume \( t = 6 \). From Step 2, we have:  
- \( c + o + n = t = 6 \).  
- \( c + o = u \).  
- \( u + n = t = 6 \).  
- \( t + c = s \).  
- \( o + n + s = 12 \).  

Since \( u + n = 6 \), and \( c + o = u \), substitute \( u = c + o \):  
\( c + o + n = 6 \), which is consistent with \( t = 6 \).  

Now, for \( s \):  
\( s = t + c = 6 + c \).  

Substitute \( s = 6 + c \) into \( o + n + s = 12 \):  
\( o + n + (6 + c) = 12 \implies o + n + c = 6 \), which is consistent.  

Since \( c + o + n = 6 \), and all are non-zero digits, possible values for \( c, o, n \) are positive integers (1–9) with distinct values. Test possible combinations:  
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( o + n = 5 \). Possible pairs for \( (o, n) \): (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1). Since \( c = 1 \), exclude \( o = 1 \) or \( n = 1 \). Try \( (o, n) = (2, 3) \):  
  - \( u = c + o = 1 + 2 = 3 \).  
  - \( t = u + n = 3 + 3 = 6 \).  
  - \( s = t + c = 6 + 1 = 7 \).  
  - Check: \( o + n + s = 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 \).  
  - Digits: \( c = 1, o = 2, n = 3, u = 3, t = 6, s = 7 \).  
  - Problem: \( n = 3 \) and \( u = 3 \), so digits are not unique.  

Try another combination, e.g., \( c = 2 \), so \( o + n = 4 \):  
- Pairs for \( (o, n) \): (1, 3), (3, 1). Try \( (o, n) = (1, 3) \):  
  - \( u = c + o = 2 + 1 = 3 \).  
  - \( t = u + n = 3 + 3 = 6 \).  
  - \( s = t + c = 6 + 2 = 8 \).  
  - Check: \( o + n + s = 1 + 3 + 8 = 12 \).  
  - Digits: \( c = 2, o = 1, n = 3, u = 3, t = 6, s = 8 \).  
  - Problem: \( n = 3 \) and \( u = 3 \), not unique.  

Try \( c = 3 \), so \( o + n = 3 \):  
- Pairs: (1, 2), (2, 1). Try \( (o, n) = (1, 2) \):  
  - \( u = c + o = 3 + 1 = 4 \).  
  - \( t = u + n = 4 + 2 = 6 \).  
  - \( s = t + c = 6 + 3 = 9 \).  
  - Check: \( o + n + s = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12 \).  
  - Digits: \( c = 3, o = 1, n = 2, u = 4, t = 6, s = 9 \).  
  - All distinct: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9.  

This satisfies all equations and constraints. Thus, \( t = 6 \) is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( t \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express variables using the given equations (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate \( t = 6 \) with unique non-zero digits (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Confirm the solution satisfies all constraints (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( t = 6 \) is the final solution by ensuring all equations and constraints are satisfied with the values from Step 3.  

The values \( c = 3, o = 1, n = 2, u = 4, t = 6, s = 9 \) satisfy:  
- \( c + o = 3 + 1 = 4 = u \).  
- \( u + n = 4 + 2 = 6 = t \).  
- \( t + c = 6 + 3 = 9 = s \).  
- \( o + n + s = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12 \).  
- Digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 are distinct and non-zero.  

The solution \( t = 6 \) is consistent.

The value of \( t \) is \( \boxed{6} \).
