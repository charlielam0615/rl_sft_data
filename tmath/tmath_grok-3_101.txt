### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( t \), where each letter (\( c, o, u, n, t, s \)) represents a unique non-zero digit (1 through 9), and the following equations hold:
1. \( c + o = u \)
2. \( u + n = t \)
3. \( t + c = s \)
4. \( o + n + s = 12 \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( t \).  
1. Express variables in terms of others using the equations to reduce unknowns.  
2. Use the constraint \( o + n + s = 12 \) to limit possible values.  
3. Assign unique non-zero digits to satisfy all equations.  
4. Solve for \( t \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to express variables in terms of others and use the equations to derive relationships. Achieve this by substituting equations to eliminate variables and combine with the sum constraint \( o + n + s = 12 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From equation 1: \( u = c + o \).  
From equation 2: \( t = u + n = (c + o) + n \).  
From equation 3: \( s = t + c = (c + o + n) + c = 2c + o + n \).  
From equation 4: \( o + n + s = 12 \).  
Substitute \( s = 2c + o + n \) into equation 4:  
\( o + n + (2c + o + n) = 2c + 2o + 2n = 12 \).  
Simplify: \( c + o + n = 6 \).  
Now we have:  
- \( u = c + o \)  
- \( t = c + o + n = 6 \) (since \( c + o + n = 6 \))  
- \( s = 2c + o + n \)  
- \( o + n + s = 12 \)  
Since \( t = c + o + n = 6 \), we have \( t = 6 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate that \( t = 6 \) satisfies all equations by finding consistent digit assignments for \( c, o, n, u, s \). Achieve this by testing values for \( c, o, n \) such that \( c + o + n = 6 \), ensuring all letters are unique non-zero digits and satisfy the original equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( c + o + n = 6 \), and each is a unique non-zero digit, possible sets for \( \{c, o, n\} \) (summing to 6) are limited. Try combinations:  
- \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \) (\( c=1, o=2, n=3 \)):  
  - \( u = c + o = 1 + 2 = 3 \) (but \( u = 3 = n \), not unique).  
- Try permuting: \( c=1, o=3, n=2 \):  
  - \( u = 1 + 3 = 4 \)  
  - \( t = u + n = 4 + 2 = 6 \)  
  - \( s = t + c = 6 + 1 = 7 \)  
  - Check: \( o + n + s = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 \).  
  - Digits: \( c=1, o=3, n=2, u=4, t=6, s=7 \). All unique and non-zero.  
Verify equations:  
1. \( c + o = 1 + 3 = 4 = u \).  
2. \( u + n = 4 + 2 = 6 = t \).  
3. \( t + c = 6 + 1 = 7 = s \).  
4. \( o + n + s = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 \).  
All equations hold, so \( t = 6 \) is valid.

  - Subgoal 2: Derive \( t \) using relationships (completed, \( t = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solution with digit assignments (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm \( t = 6 \) is the only solution by checking other combinations.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to ensure \( t = 6 \) is the only solution by testing other possible values for \( t \) or digit combinations. Achieve this by checking if other assignments for \( c, o, n \) summing to 6 yield consistent results, or if other \( t \) values are possible.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( c + o + n = 6 \), and \( t = c + o + n \), we have \( t = 6 \). To confirm uniqueness, test other combinations for \( c, o, n \):  
- Try \( c=2, o=1, n=3 \):  
  - \( u = c + o = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (but \( u = 3 = n \), not unique).  
- Try \( c=2, o=3, n=1 \):  
  - \( u = 2 + 3 = 5 \)  
  - \( t = u + n = 5 + 1 = 6 \)  
  - \( s = t + c = 6 + 2 = 8 \)  
  - Check: \( o + n + s = 3 + 1 + 8 = 12 \).  
  - Digits: \( c=2, o=3, n=1, u=5, t=6, s=8 \). All unique.  
Verify:  
1. \( c + o = 2 + 3 = 5 = u \).  
2. \( u + n = 5 + 1 = 6 = t \).  
3. \( t + c = 6 + 2 = 8 = s \).  
4. \( o + n + s = 3 + 1 + 8 = 12 \).  
This also gives \( t = 6 \).  
Other sums for \( c + o + n \neq 6 \) make \( t \neq 6 \), violating \( c + o + n = 6 \). Thus, \( t = 6 \) consistently.

The value of \( t \) is **6**.
