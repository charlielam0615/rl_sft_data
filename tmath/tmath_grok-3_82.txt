**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of $y$-intercepts for the parabola defined by the equation $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$. A $y$-intercept occurs where the graph intersects the $y$-axis, i.e., when $x = 0$. We need to find the number of real solutions for $y$ when $x = 0$.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the number of $y$-intercepts, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation for the $y$-intercept by substituting $x = 0$ into the given equation.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation in $y$ to find the number of real solutions.  
3. Determine the number of real solutions using the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the quadratic equation obtained by setting $x = 0$.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute $x = 0$ into $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$, rearrange into standard quadratic form, and solve for $y$ using the quadratic formula or discriminant to determine the number of real solutions.

[IMP]  
Set $x = 0$ in the equation $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$:  
$0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$  
Rearrange into standard form:  
$2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$  
This is a quadratic equation in $y$ with coefficients $a = 2$, $b = -3$, and $c = 7$. To find the number of real solutions, compute the discriminant:  
$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 9 - 56 = -47$  
Since the discriminant is negative ($\Delta = -47 < 0$), there are no real solutions for $y$.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the calculation of the discriminant to ensure correctness.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the discriminant and confirm the quadratic equation has no real roots, implying no $y$-intercepts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the discriminant for $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$:  
$a = 2$, $b = -3$, $c = 7$  
$\Delta = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 9 - 56 = -47$  
The discriminant is indeed negative, confirming no real solutions. Alternatively, consider the parabolaâ€™s orientation: since $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$ opens horizontally (as $x$ is a function of $y^2$), setting $x = 0$ yields a quadratic in $y$. The negative discriminant ensures the parabola does not cross the $y$-axis.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of $y$-intercepts for the parabola $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set $x = 0$ to form the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation by computing the discriminant.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the discriminant calculation to confirm the number of real solutions.  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the number of $y$-intercepts based on the discriminant.  
Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions to $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$, so the parabola has no $y$-intercepts.

**Final Answer**: The parabola $x = 2y^isma: The parabola $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$ has **0** $y$-intercepts.
