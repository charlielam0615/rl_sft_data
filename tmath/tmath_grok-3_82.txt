**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of $y$-intercepts for the parabola defined by the equation $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$. A $y$-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the $y$-axis, i.e., where $x = 0$. We need to find the number of real solutions for $y$ when $x = 0$.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for the $y$-intercept. Achieve this by substituting $x = 0$ into the equation $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$ to obtain a quadratic equation in $y$.

[IMP]  
Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:  
$0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$  
Rearrange to standard quadratic form:  
$2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$  
This is a quadratic equation in $y$ with coefficients $a = 2$, $b = -3$, and $c = 7$.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of real solutions to the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$. Achieve this by calculating the discriminant of the quadratic equation and analyzing its value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation $ay^2 + by + c = 0$, the discriminant is given by $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. The number of real solutions depends on the discriminant:  
- $\Delta > 0$: Two real solutions.  
- $\Delta = 0$: One real solution.  
- $\Delta < 0$: No real solutions.  

For $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$, we have $a = 2$, $b = -3$, $c = 7$. Calculate the discriminant:  
$\Delta = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = 9 - 56 = -47$  
Since $\Delta = -47 < 0$, there are no real solutions to the equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of $y$-intercepts for the parabola $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation for the $y$-intercept by substituting $x = 0$. (Completed: Obtained $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$)  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation to find the number of real solutions. (Completed: Calculated discriminant $\Delta = -47$)  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the number of real solutions using the discriminant. (Completed: No real solutions since $\Delta < 0$)  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the number of $y$-intercepts based on the discriminant analysis.  
Since there are no real solutions to $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$, the parabola does not intersect the $y$-axis.

Since the discriminant $\Delta = -47 < 0$, there are no real solutions to $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$. Therefore, the parabola $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$ has **0 $y$-intercepts**.
