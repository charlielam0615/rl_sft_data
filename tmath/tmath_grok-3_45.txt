### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( p \) given the equation \( fp - w = 10000 \), where \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( p \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute the given values \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation.  
2. Isolate \( p \) by rearranging the equation.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to find \( p \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation \( fp - w = 10000 \) and solve for \( p \). This will be achieved by plugging in the values, rearranging to isolate \( p \), and simplifying the expression.

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ fp - w = 10000 \]  
Substitute \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \):  
\[ 5p - (5 + 125i) = 10000 \]  
Rearrange to isolate \( p \):  
\[ 5p = 10000 + (5 + 125i) \]  
\[ 5p = 10000 + 5 + 125i \]  
\[ 5p = 10005 + 125i \]  
Divide both sides by 5:  
\[ p = \frac{10005 + 125i}{5} \]  
Simplify:  
\[ p = \frac{10005}{5} + \frac{125i}{5} = 2001 + 25i \]  
Thus, \( p = 2001 + 25i \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( p = 2001 + 25i \) by substituting it back into the original equation \( fp - w = 10000 \) and checking if the equation holds true.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( p = 2001 + 25i \), \( f = 5 \), and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation:  
\[ fp - w = 5(2001 + 25i) - (5 + 125i) \]  
Calculate \( 5(2001 + 25i) \):  
\[ 5 \cdot 2001 = 10005, \quad 5 \cdot 25i = 125i \]  
\[ 5(2001 + 25i) = 10005 + 125i \]  
Now compute:  
\[ (10005 + 125i) - (5 + 125i) = 10005 - 5 + (125i - 125i) = 10000 + 0i = 10000 \]  
The result is 10000, which matches the right-hand side of the equation. The solution is valid.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve for \( p \) in the equation \( fp - w = 10000 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Isolate and simplify to find \( p \) (completed, \( p = 2001 + 25i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, solution verified).  

**Current Goal**: No further subgoals are needed as the solution has been found and validated.

### Final Answer
\[ p = 2001 + 25i \]
