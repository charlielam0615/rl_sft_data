### Problem Restatement
We need to solve for \( p \) in the equation \( fp - w = 10000 \), where \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for \( p \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Substitute the given values \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation.
2. Isolate \( p \) by rearranging the equation.
3. Simplify the expression to find the value of \( p \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Substitute the given values and solve for \( p \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( f = 5 \) and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into the equation \( fp - w = 10000 \), then isolate \( p \) by algebraic manipulation.

[IMP]
Substitute the values into the equation:
\[
5p - (5 + 125i) = 10000
\]
Rearrange to isolate \( p \):
\[
5p = 10000 + (5 + 125i)
\]
\[
5p = 10005 + 125i
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
p = \frac{10005 + 125i}{5}
\]
Simplify:
\[
p = \frac{10005}{5} + \frac{125i}{5} = 2001 + 25i
\]
So, \( p = 2001 + 25i \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the solution for \( p \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( p = 2001 + 25i \) back into the original equation to check if it holds true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( p = 2001 + 25i \), \( f = 5 \), and \( w = 5 + 125i \) into \( fp - w = 10000 \):
\[
f p = 5 (2001 + 25i) = 5 \cdot 2001 + 5 \cdot 25i = 10005 + 125i
\]
\[
fp - w = (10005 + 125i) - (5 + 125i) = 10005 + 125i - 5 - 125i = 10000
\]
The equation holds true, confirming the solution is correct.
