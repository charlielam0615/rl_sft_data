**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\)) and \(\lceil x \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression. The expression involves two parts: computing the floor of \(-2.54\) and the ceiling of \(25.4\), then summing the results. Subgoals:  
1. Compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\).  
2. Compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\).  
3. Add the results from subgoals 1 and 2.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\), the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-2.54\). This will be achieved by identifying the integer \(n\) such that \(n \leq -2.54 < n+1\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\), note that \(-2.54\) lies between \(-3\) and \(-2\) since \(-3 < -2.54 < -2\). The floor function selects the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-2.54\), which is \(-3\).  
Thus, \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor = -3\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(25.4\). This will be achieved by identifying the integer \(n\) such that \(n-1 < 25.4 \leq n\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\), note that \(25.4\) lies between \(25\) and \(26\) since \(25 < 25.4 < 26\). The ceiling function selects the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(25.4\), which is \(26\).  
Thus, \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil = 26\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\). Using the results from previous steps, this involves adding \(-3\) and \(26\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From Step 2, \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor = -3\). From Step 3, \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil = 26\).  
Now, compute the sum: \(-3 + 26 = 23\).  
Thus, the value of the expression is \(23\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\) (completed: \(-3\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\) (completed: \(26\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results (completed: \(-3 + 26 = 23\)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, with the result being \(23\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\) is \(23\).
