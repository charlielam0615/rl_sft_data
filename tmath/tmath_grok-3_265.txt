**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\) into subgoals:  
1. Compute the floor of \(-2.54\).  
2. Compute the ceiling of \(25.4\).  
3. Add the results from subgoals 1 and 2.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the floor of \(-2.54\).  
Description: The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). For \(-2.54\), identify the integer that is less than or equal to \(-2.54\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\):  
\(-2.54\) lies between \(-3\) and \(-2\). The greatest integer less than or equal to \(-2.54\) is \(-3\).  
Thus, \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor = -3\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the ceiling of \(25.4\).  
Description: The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\). For \(25.4\), identify the integer that is greater than or equal to \(25.4\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\):  
\(25.4\) lies between \(25\) and \(26\). The smallest integer greater than or equal to \(25.4\) is \(26\).  
Thus, \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil = 26\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add the results from the floor and ceiling computations.  
Description: Use the results \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor = -3\) and \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil = 26\) to compute their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the sum:  
\(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil = -3 + 26 = 23\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed result.  
Description: Recompute the floor and ceiling values and their sum to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute for validation:  
- Floor of \(-2.54\): Since \(-3 < -2.54 < -2\), \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor = -3\).  
- Ceiling of \(25.4\): Since \(25 < 25.4 < 26\), \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil = 26\).  
- Sum: \(-3 + 26 = 23\).  
The recomputed result matches the previous result, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor + \lceil 25.4 \rceil\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\lfloor -2.54 \rfloor\) (Completed: \(-3\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lceil 25.4 \rceil\) (Completed: \(26\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the results (Completed: \(23\)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed, result validated).  
The final result is \(23\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(23\)
