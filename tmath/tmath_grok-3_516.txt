### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the quadratic inequality and its roots to determine the intervals where it is negative.  
2. Use the given interval \( (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \) to identify the roots of the quadratic equation \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\).  
3. Solve for \( b \) using the relationship between the roots and the coefficients of the quadratic.  
4. Verify that the inequality holds in the specified intervals.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Analyze the quadratic inequality \(-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0\) and determine its roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the inequality in standard form, find the roots of the quadratic equation \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\), and use the roots to understand the behavior of the quadratic function.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = -x^2 + bx - 5 \). Since the leading coefficient is negative (\(-1\)), the parabola opens downward, meaning \( f(x) < 0 \) outside the roots and \( f(x) > 0 \) between the roots (if the roots are real and distinct). The inequality \(-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0\) holds where the parabola is below the x-axis.

To find the roots, solve the quadratic equation:  
\[
-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0 \implies x^2 - bx + 5 = 0
\]
Let the roots be \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \). By the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 20}}{2}
\]
The roots are:  
\[
x = \frac{b + \sqrt{b^2 - 20}}{2}, \quad x = \frac{b - \sqrt{b^2 - 20}}{2}
\]
The discriminant must be positive for real roots:  
\[
b^2 - 20 > 0 \implies b^2 > 20 \implies |b| > \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47
\]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Match the roots of the quadratic to the given interval \( (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Assume the roots are at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \), since the inequality is negative outside these points. Use the sum and product of roots to find \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the inequality holds for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \), the roots of \( x^2 - bx + 5 = 0 \) are likely \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \), as the parabola is negative outside these points due to the downward opening (\( a = -1 \)).

For a quadratic \( x^2 + px + q = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -p \) and the product is \( q \). Here, the quadratic is \( x^2 - bx + 5 = 0 \), so:  
- Sum of roots: \( r_1 + r_2 = b \)  
- Product of roots: \( r_1 r_2 = 5 \)

If the roots are \( r_1 = 1 \) and \( r_2 = 5 \):  
- Sum: \( 1 + 5 = 6 \implies b = 6 \)  
- Product: \( 1 \cdot 5 = 5 \), which matches the constant term.

Thus, \( b = 6 \). The quadratic becomes:  
\[
x^2 - 6x + 5 = (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0
\]
The original function is:  
\[
f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5 = -(x - 1)(x - 5)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(-x^2 + 6x - 5 < 0\) holds only for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the sign of \( f(x) = -(x - 1)(x - 5) \) across the intervals defined by the roots \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( f(x) = -(x - 1)(x - 5) \) has roots at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \). Since the leading coefficient is negative, \( f(x) < 0 \) when \( (x - 1)(x - 5) > 0 \).

Analyze the sign of \( (x - 1)(x - 5) \):  
- For \( x < 1 \): Both \( (x - 1) < 0 \) and \( (x - 5) < 0 \), so \( (x - 1)(x - 5) > 0 \), and \( f(x) = -(x - 1)(x - 5) < 0 \).  
- For \( 1 < x < 5 \): \( (x - 1) > 0 \), but \( (x - 5) < 0 \), so \( (x - 1)(x - 5) < 0 \), and \( f(x) > 0 \).  
- For \( x > 5 \): Both \( (x - 1) > 0 \) and \( (x - 5) > 0 \), so \( (x - 1)(x - 5) > 0 \), and \( f(x) < 0 \).

Thus, \( f(x) < 0 \) for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \), matching the given interval. The solution \( b = 6 \) is consistent.
