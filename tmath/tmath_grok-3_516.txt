### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( b \) such that the quadratic inequality \(-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0\) holds only for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \). This means the quadratic expression \(-x^2 + bx - 5\) is negative outside the interval \([1, 5]\) and non-negative (zero or positive) within \([1, 5]\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( b \).  
1. Understand the quadratic inequality and its behavior based on the given interval.  
2. Determine the roots of the quadratic equation \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\), as they define the boundaries of the inequality.  
3. Use the roots to match the interval \((-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty)\), assuming the roots are at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \).  
4. Solve for \( b \) using the relationship between the roots and the coefficients of the quadratic.  
5. Verify that the inequality holds for the specified intervals with the found \( b \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the roots of the quadratic equation \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\) and assume they are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the fact that for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum and product of the roots can be used to find \( b \). Since the quadratic is \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\), rewrite it in standard form and apply the relationships for the sum and product of the roots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the quadratic equation:
\[
-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0 \implies x^2 - bx + 5 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic in the form \( x^2 + px + q = 0 \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, the coefficient of \( x \) is \(-b\), and the constant is 5. For a quadratic \( x^2 + px + q = 0 \):
- Sum of roots = \(-p = b\)
- Product of roots = \( q = 5 \)

Assume the roots are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \). Then:
- Sum of roots = \( 1 + 5 = 6 = b \)
- Product of roots = \( 1 \cdot 5 = 5 \), which matches the constant term.

Thus, \( b = 6 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that when \( b = 6 \), the inequality \(-x^2 + 6x - 5 < 0\) holds only for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the sign of the quadratic expression \(-x^2 + 6x - 5\) across the number line, using the roots and the parabola’s direction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Consider the quadratic \(-x^2 + 6x - 5\). First, confirm the roots by solving:
\[
-x^2 + 6x - 5 = 0 \implies x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0
\]
\[
(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \implies x = 1, x = 5
\]
The quadratic \(-x^2 + 6x - 5 = -(x - 1)(x - 5)\) has a leading coefficient of \(-1\), so the parabola opens downward. The inequality \(-x^2 + 6x - 5 < 0\) holds where the expression is negative.

Test the sign of \(-(x - 1)(x - 5)\):
- For \( x < 1 \), e.g., \( x = 0 \): \(-(0 - 1)(0 - 5) = -(-1)(-5) = -5 < 0 \).
- For \( 1 < x < 5 \), e.g., \( x = 3 \): \(-(3 - 1)(3 - 5) = -(2)(-2) = 4 > 0 \).
- For \( x > 5 \), e.g., \( x = 6 \): \-(6 - 1)(6 - 5) = -(5)(1) = -5 < 0 \).
- At the roots \( x = 1, 5 \): \-(1 - 1)(1 - 5) = 0, \-(5 - 1)(5 - 5) = 0 (equality, not strict inequality).

The expression is negative for \( x \in (-\infty, 1) \cup (5, \infty) \), as required, and non-negative at \( x = 1, 5 \) and positive in \( (1, 5) \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 1: Understand the quadratic inequality and its behavior.
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the roots of \(-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0\).
