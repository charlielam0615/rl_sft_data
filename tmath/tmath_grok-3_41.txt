**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of distinct x-intercepts of the graph of the function \( y = (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \). The x-intercepts occur where \( y = 0 \), which means solving for the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the number of distinct x-intercepts, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set the function \( y = (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \) to find the x-intercepts.  
2. Solve the equation by finding the roots of each factor: \( x-5 = 0 \) and \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \).  
3. Determine the number of distinct roots from all factors.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \) to find all x-intercepts. This will be achieved by solving each factor separately: first, solve \( x-5 = 0 \), then solve the quadratic \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x-5 = 0 \):  
\[ x = 5 \]  

For \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \):  
Factor the quadratic:  
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) \]  
Set each factor to zero:  
\[ x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2 \]  
\[ x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3 \]  

The roots are \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the roots \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \) are correct and distinct. This will be achieved by checking if these values satisfy the original equation and confirming they are unique.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute each root into the original equation \( y = (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \):  
- For \( x = 5 \):  
  \[ y = (5-5)(5^2 + 5 \cdot 5 + 6) = 0 \cdot (25 + 25 + 6) = 0 \]  
- For \( x = -2 \):  
  \[ y = (-2-5)((-2)^2 + 5 \cdot (-2) + 6) = (-7)(4 - 10 + 6) = (-7) \cdot 0 = 0 \]  
- For \( x = -3 \):  
  \[ y = (-3-5)((-3)^2 + 5 \cdot (-3) + 6) = (-8)(9 - 15 + 6) = (-8) \cdot 0 = 0 \]  

All roots satisfy \( y = 0 \). The roots \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \) are distinct since \( 5 \neq -2 \neq -3 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of distinct x-intercepts of \( y = (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set the function equal to zero and solve for roots.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve each factor: \( x-5 = 0 \) and \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the roots and check for distinctness.  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the distinct roots.  

**Current Goal**: Count the distinct roots to answer the question.  
The roots found are \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \), which are distinct. Thus, there are 3 distinct x-intercepts.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The graph of \( y = (x-5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \) has **3 distinct x-intercepts**.
