### Problem Statement
We need to determine the number of distinct x-intercepts of the graph of the function \( y = (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \). The x-intercepts occur where \( y = 0 \), which means solving the equation \( (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \). We will find the roots of this equation and ensure they are distinct.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the number of distinct x-intercepts, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set the equation \( y = (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \) to find the roots.  
2. Solve the linear factor \( x - 5 = 0 \) to find one root.  
3. Factorize and solve the quadratic \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \) to find additional roots.  
4. Determine if the roots are real and distinct.  
5. Count the distinct roots to determine the number of x-intercepts.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \) to find all roots. This can be achieved by setting each factor to zero and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation is \( (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \). For the product to be zero, at least one factor must be zero.

1. **Solve the linear factor**:  
   \( x - 5 = 0 \)  
   \( x = 5 \)

2. **Solve the quadratic factor**:  
   \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \)  
   Factorize the quadratic:  
   \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) \)  
   Set each factor to zero:  
   - \( x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2 \)  
   - \( x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3 \)

The roots are \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the roots \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \) are correct and real. This can be achieved by substituting the roots back into the original equation to confirm they yield \( y = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute each root into \( y = (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \):

1. For \( x = 5 \):  
   \( y = (5 - 5)(5^2 + 5 \cdot 5 + 6) = 0 \cdot (25 + 25 + 6) = 0 \cdot 56 = 0 \)

2. For \( x = -2 \):  
   \( y = (-2 - 5)((-2)^2 + 5 \cdot (-2) + 6) = (-7)(4 - 10 + 6) = (-7) \cdot 0 = 0 \)

3. For \( x = -3 \):  
   \( y = (-3 - 5)((-3)^2 + 5 \cdot (-3) + 6) = (-8)(9 - 15 + 6) = (-8) \cdot 0 = 0 \)

All roots satisfy \( y = 0 \), confirming they are correct. Since \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \) are real numbers, they correspond to x-intercepts.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of distinct x-intercepts of \( y = (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = 0 \) to find roots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the roots are correct and real (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count the distinct roots to determine the number of x-intercepts (current goal).

**Current Goal**: Count the distinct roots to determine the number of x-intercepts.  
The roots found are \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \). These are all distinct values.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the distinct roots to determine the number of x-intercepts. This can be achieved by listing the roots and ensuring no duplicates exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The roots are \( x = 5 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \). These are three distinct values, so the graph has **3 distinct x-intercepts**.

### Final Answer
The graph of \( y = (x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 6) \) has **3 distinct x-intercepts**.
