[IMP]
To ensure the denominator $ x^2 + bx + 8 $ has no real roots, its discriminant must be negative. The discriminant of a quadratic $ ax^2 + bx + c $ is given by $ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac $. For the quadratic $ x^2 + bx + 8 $, we have $ a = 1 $, $ b = b $, and $ c = 8 $. Thus, the discriminant is:
$$
\Delta = b^2 - 4(1)(8) = b^2 - 32
$$
To ensure no real roots, we require:
$$
b^2 - 32 < 0
$$
Solving this inequality:
$$
b^2 < 32
$$
$$
-\sqrt{32} < b < \sqrt{32}
$$
$$
-4\sqrt{2} < b < 4\sqrt{2}
$$
Since $ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 $, we have:
$$
-4(1.414) < b < 4(1.414)
$$
$$
-5.656 < b < 5.656
$$
The greatest integer value of $ b $ within this range is $ 5 $.

[VERIFY]
1. Discriminant calculation: For denominator $ x^2 + bx + 8 $, discriminant is $ b^2 - 4(1)(8) = b^2 - 32 $. This is correct as the standard discriminant formula $ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac $ is applied with $ a = 1 $, $ c = 8 $.

2. Inequality derivation: Requiring $ \Delta < 0 $ for no real roots leads to $ b^2 - 32 < 0 \Rightarrow b^2 < 32 $. This is valid since a negative discriminant ensures no real solutions.

3. Interval calculation: $ b^2 < 32 \Rightarrow -\sqrt{32} < b < \sqrt{32} $. Since $ \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.656 $, the interval is correctly bounded as $ -5.656 < b < 5.656 $.

4. Integer determination: The greatest integer within $ (-5.656, 5.656) $ is 5. This is correct because $ b = 5 $ satisfies $ 5^2 = 25 < 32 $, while $ b = 6 $ would yield $ 36 > 32 $, violating the condition.

5. Final answer consistency: The solution logically follows from the discriminant condition and correctly identifies the maximum integer $ b $ without real roots in the denominator. No contradictions or computational errors detected.
