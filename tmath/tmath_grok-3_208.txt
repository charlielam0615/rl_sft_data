**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \((\sqrt[6]{4})^9\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To evaluate \((\sqrt[6]{4})^9\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:
1. Simplify the expression \(\sqrt[6]{4}\).
2. Raise the result to the 9th power.
3. Compute the final numerical value.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Simplify \(\sqrt[6]{4}\).
**How to Achieve**: Recognize that \(\sqrt[6]{4} = 4^{1/6}\), as the 6th root is equivalent to raising to the power of \(1/6\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite \(\sqrt[6]{4}\) using exponent notation:
\[
\sqrt[6]{4} = 4^{1/6}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Raise the simplified expression to the 9th power.
**How to Achieve**: Use the simplified form \(4^{1/6}\) and apply the exponent 9, using the power rule \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \(\sqrt[6]{4} = 4^{1/6}\), compute:
\[
(\sqrt[6]{4})^9 = (4^{1/6})^9
\]
Apply the power rule:
\[
(4^{1/6})^9 = 4^{(1/6) \cdot 9} = 4^{9/6}
\]
Simplify the exponent:
\[
\frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
Thus:
\[
4^{9/6} = 4^{3/2}
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute \(4^{3/2}\).
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite \(4^{3/2}\) as \((4^{1/2})^3\) and evaluate, since \(4^{1/2} = \sqrt{4} = 2\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Rewrite the expression:
\[
4^{3/2} = (4^{1/2})^3
\]
Since \(4^{1/2} = \sqrt{4} = 2\), compute:
\[
(4^{1/2})^3 = 2^3 = 8
\]
Thus:
\[
4^{3/2} = 8
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the computation of \(4^{3/2} = 8\).
**How to Achieve**: Use an alternative method to confirm the result, such as expressing \(4^{3/2}\) in terms of its square root and cube.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Alternative approach:
\[
4^{3/2} = (4^3)^{1/2}
\]
Compute:
\[
4^3 = 64
\]
\[
(64)^{1/2} = \sqrt{64} = 8
\]
This matches the previous result, confirming \(4^{3/2} = 8\).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \((\sqrt[6]{4})^9\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify \(\sqrt[6]{4}\) (Completed: \(\sqrt[6]{4} = 4^{1/6}\)).
  - Subgoal 2: Raise to the 9th power (Completed: \((4^{1/6})^9 = 4^{3/2}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the numerical value (Completed: \(4^{3/2} = 8\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (Completed: Alternative method confirms \(8\)).

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.

The evaluation yields \(8\), and validation confirms correctness.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \((\sqrt[6]{4})^9 = 8\)
