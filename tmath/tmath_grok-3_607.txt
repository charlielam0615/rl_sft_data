### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three 6-sided dice.  
2. Identify all combinations of three dice rolls that sum to 16.  
3. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes by counting valid combinations.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three 6-sided dice. Achieve this by calculating the number of outcomes for each die and multiplying them together.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 6 faces, so the number of outcomes per die is 6. For three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:  
\[ 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 6^3 = 216 \]  
Thus, there are 216 possible outcomes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all combinations of three dice rolls that sum to 16. Achieve this by systematically finding all sets of three integers (from 1 to 6) whose sum is 16, considering the dice are distinguishable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the dice rolls be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6\) and \(a + b + c = 16\). Since each die can only show up to 6, the maximum sum for three dice is \(6 + 6 + 6 = 18\), so a sum of 16 is feasible but requires high values.  

List combinations systematically, ensuring \(a \geq b \geq c\) to account for permutations later:  
- If \(a = 6\), then \(b + c = 16 - 6 = 10\), and \(b \geq c\). Possible pairs \((b, c)\):  
  - \(b = 6, c = 4\) (since \(6 + 4 = 10\))  
  - \(b = 5, c = 5\) (since \(5 + 5 = 10\))  
  Valid combinations: \((6, 6, 4)\), \((6, 5, 5)\).  
- If \(a = 5\), then \(b + c = 16 - 5 = 11\), and \(b \geq c\). Possible pairs \((b, c)\):  
  - No integers \(b, c \leq 6\) satisfy \(b + c = 11\) with \(b \geq c\) (e.g., \(6 + 5 = 11\), but we already considered higher \(a\)).  

No combinations are possible with \(a \leq 4\), as \(16 - 4 = 12\), and the maximum \(b + c = 6 + 6 = 12\) requires \(a \geq 5\). Thus, the combinations are:  
- \((6, 6, 4)\): Permutations = \(\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3\) (two 6s are identical).  
- \((6, 5, 5)\): Permutations = \(\frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3\) (two 5s are identical).  

Total favorable outcomes: \(3 + 3 = 6\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the combinations identified for a sum of 16. Re-evaluate the combinations to ensure no cases were missed or miscalculated.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-check combinations for \(a + b + c = 16\):  
- \((6, 6, 4)\): \(6 + 6 + 4 = 16\), valid. Permutations: Arrange two 6s and one 4 in 3 positions, \(\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3\).  
- \((6, 5, 5)\): \(6 + 5 + 5 = 16\), valid. Permutations: Arrange one 6 and two 5s, \(\frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3\).  
- Try other starting points:  
  - \(a = 5, b + c = 11\): No pairs \((b, c)\) with \(b, c \leq 6\) work (e.g., \(6 + 5 = 11\), but already covered).  
  - \(a = 4, b + c = 12\): Maximum \(b = c = 6\), gives \(6 + 6 = 12\), but then sum is \(4 + 6 + 6 = 16\), which gives \((6, 6, 4)\), already counted.  

No additional combinations found. Total favorable outcomes remain 6.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Use the number of favorable outcomes (6) and total outcomes (216) to calculate the probability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Probability = \(\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{6}{216}\).  
Simplify: \(\frac{6 \div 6}{216 \div 6} = \frac{1}{36}\).  
Thus, the probability is \(\frac{1}{36}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the probability that the sum of three dice is 16.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total possible outcomes (completed: 216 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify combinations summing to 16 (completed: 6 favorable outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate probability (completed: \(\frac{1}{36}\)).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The probability that the sum of the face-up integers on three standard 6-sided dice is 16 is \(\frac{1}{36}\).
