**Problem Statement**: Calculate the probability that the sum of the face-up integers on three standard 6-sided dice is 16.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability. Subgoals:  
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three 6-sided dice.  
2. Identify all combinations of three dice that sum to 16.  
3. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes.  
4. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three 6-sided dice. Achieve this by calculating the number of outcomes for each die and combining them.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Each die has 6 faces, and the dice are independent. The total number of possible outcomes is:  
6 × 6 × 6 = 216.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to identify all combinations of three dice that sum to 16. Achieve this by systematically listing all ordered triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, c are integers from 1 to 6, and a + b + c = 16.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since each die shows a number from 1 to 6, the maximum sum for one die is 6. For three dice, the maximum sum is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. We need combinations where a + b + c = 16, and 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 6.  
Consider ordered triplets (a, b, c):  
- If a = 6, then b + c = 16 − 6 = 10. Possible pairs (b, c): (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4).  
- If a = 5, then b + c = 16 − 5 = 11. Possible pairs (b, c): (5, 6), (6, 5).  
- If a = 4, then b + c = 16 − 4 = 12. Possible pairs: (6, 6).  
- If a ≤ 3, then b + c = 16 − a ≥ 13, which is not possible since b, c ≤ 6 (max b + c = 12).  

List the triplets:  
- a = 6: (6, 4, 6), (6, 5, 5), (6, 6, 4)  
- a = 5: (5, 5, 6), (5, 6, 5)  
- a = 4: (4, 6, 6)  

Now, account for permutations:  
- (6, 6, 4): Permutations are (6, 6, 4), (6, 4, 6), (4, 6, 6). (3 permutations, as two 6s are identical).  
- (6, 5, 5): Permutations are (6, 5, 5), (5, 6, 5), (5, 5, 6). (3 permutations, as two 5s are identical).  
- (5, 6, 4): Permutations are (5, 6, 4), (5, 4, 6), (6, 5, 4), (6, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 5). (6 permutations, all distinct).  

Total favorable outcomes: 3 + 3 + 6 = 12.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to check the validity of the identified combinations summing to 16. Verify that all triplets are correctly listed and their permutations are accurately counted.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the combinations:  
- For a = 6, b + c = 10: Pairs (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4). Triplets: (6, 4, 6), (6, 5, 5), (6, 6, 4).  
- For a = 5, b + c = 11: Pairs (5, 6), (6, 5). Triplets: (5, 5, 6), (5, 6, 5).  
- For a = 4, b + c = 12: Pair (6, 6). Triplet: (4, 6, 6).  
- For a = 3, b + c = 13: Not possible (max 6 + 6 = 12).  
Permutations:  
- (6, 6, 4): 3 permutations (6, 6, 4; 6, 4, 6; 4, 6, 6).  
- (6, 5, 5): 3 permutations (6, 5, 5; 5, 6, 5; 5, 5, 6).  
- (5, 6, 4): 6 permutations (all distinct).  
Total: 3 + 3 + 6 = 12 outcomes. The calculation is consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Use the total outcomes (216) and favorable outcomes (12) to calculate the probability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 12 / 216 = 1 / 18.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that the sum of three dice is 16.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine total possible outcomes (completed: 216 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify combinations summing to 16 (completed: 12 outcomes).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate probability (completed: 1/18).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed.

**Final Answer**: The probability that the sum of the face-up integers on three standard 6-sided dice is 16 is **1/18**.
