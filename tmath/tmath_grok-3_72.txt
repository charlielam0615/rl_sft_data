**Problem Statement**: Given the equation \( y = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \), find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \( x \) when \( y = 1 \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( y = 1 \) into the equation.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( y = 1 \) into the equation \( y = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \) and solve for \( x \). This will be achieved by setting up the equation \( 1 = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \) and solving it algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 1 \):  
\[ 1 = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \]  
Take the reciprocal of both sides to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ 1 = 3x + 1 \]  
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
\[ 0 = 3x \]  
Divide by 3:  
\[ x = 0 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 0 \) satisfies the original equation when \( y = 1 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 0 \) back into the equation and checking if \( y = 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the original equation \( y = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \):  
\[ y = \frac{1}{3(0) + 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \]  
Since \( y = 1 \), the solution \( x = 0 \) is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 1 \) in the equation \( y = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( y = 1 \) into the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed, \( x = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution is valid).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as \( x = 0 \) has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( x = 0 \)
