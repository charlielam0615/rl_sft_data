### Problem Restatement
We need to find the coordinates of point \( B = (x, y) \) such that the midpoint of segment \( AB \), where \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (x, y) \), is \( C = (3, 5) \). Then, we compute the product \( xy \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for \( x \) and \( y \).  
2. Solve the equations to find the coordinates of \( B \).  
3. Compute the product \( xy \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of \( B = (x, y) \). The midpoint of \( AB \) is given as \( C = (3, 5) \), with \( A = (1, 8) \). Apply the midpoint formula to set up equations for \( x \) and \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The midpoint formula for points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:  
\[ \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \]  
Given \( A = (1, 8) \), \( B = (x, y) \), and midpoint \( C = (3, 5) \), we set up:  
- For the x-coordinate:  
  \[ \frac{1 + x}{2} = 3 \]  
- For the y-coordinate:  
  \[ \frac{8 + y}{2} = 5 \]  

Solve for \( x \):  
\[ \frac{1 + x}{2} = 3 \]  
\[ 1 + x = 6 \]  
\[ x = 5 \]  

Solve for \( y \):  
\[ \frac{8 + y}{2} = 5 \]  
\[ 8 + y = 10 \]  
\[ y = 2 \]  

Thus, \( B = (5, 2) \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( B = (5, 2) \) results in the midpoint \( C = (3, 5) \). Compute the midpoint of \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \) using the midpoint formula and check if it matches \( (3, 5) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute the midpoint of \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \):  
- x-coordinate:  
  \[ \frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]  
- y-coordinate:  
  \[ \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]  

The midpoint is \( (3, 5) \), which matches \( C = (3, 5) \). The coordinates are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the product \( xy \). Using the coordinates of \( B = (5, 2) \), calculate \( x \cdot y \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( B = (5, 2) \), we have \( x = 5 \), \( y = 2 \).  
Compute:  
\[ xy = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \]  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( xy \) where \( C = (3, 5) \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), with \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (x, y) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Use the midpoint formula to find \( x \) and \( y \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Validate the coordinates of \( B \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( xy \). (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Compute \( xy \) (achieved, result is 10).  
All subgoals are completed, and the main goal is resolved.

### Final Answer
The value of \( xy \) is \( 10 \).
