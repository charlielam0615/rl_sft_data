### Problem Restatement
Given that point \( C = (3, 5) \) is the midpoint of segment \( AB \), where point \( A = (1, 8) \) and point \( B = (x, y) \), find the value of \( xy \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the coordinates of point \( B \) and compute \( xy \).  
- Subgoal 1: Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of point \( B = (x, y) \).  
- Subgoal 2: Compute the product \( xy \) using the coordinates of \( B \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the coordinates of point \( B = (x, y) \) using the midpoint formula. Since \( C = (3, 5) \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), apply the midpoint formula: the coordinates of \( C \) are the averages of the coordinates of \( A \) and \( B \). Set up equations to solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

[IMP]
The midpoint formula states that for points \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), the midpoint \( C = (x_c, y_c) \) has coordinates:
\[
x_c = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \quad y_c = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}
\]
Given:
- \( A = (1, 8) \), so \( x_1 = 1 \), \( y_1 = 8 \).
- \( C = (3, 5) \), so \( x_c = 3 \), \( y_c = 5 \).
- \( B = (x, y) \), so \( x_2 = x \), \( y_2 = y \).

For the x-coordinate:
\[
3 = \frac{1 + x}{2}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
6 = 1 + x \implies x = 6 - 1 = 5
\]

For the y-coordinate:
\[
5 = \frac{8 + y}{2}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
10 = 8 + y \implies y = 10 - 8 = 2
\]

Thus, the coordinates of point \( B \) are \( (5, 2) \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( B = (5, 2) \) is correct by checking if \( C = (3, 5) \) is indeed the midpoint of \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \). Compute the midpoint of \( AB \) and confirm it matches \( C \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the midpoint of \( A = (1, 8) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \):
\[
x_c = \frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]
\[
y_c = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]
The midpoint is \( (3, 5) \), which matches \( C = (3, 5) \). The coordinates of \( B = (5, 2) \) are correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( xy \) using the coordinates of \( B = (5, 2) \). Multiply the x- and y-coordinates of \( B \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \( B = (5, 2) \), compute:
\[
xy = 5 \cdot 2 = 10
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find the value of \( xy \).
  - Subgoal 1: Find the coordinates of \( B = (x, y) \) using the midpoint formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( xy \) using the coordinates of \( B \) (completed).
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final answer for \( xy \).  
The calculations show \( B = (5, 2) \), and \( xy = 10 \). No further subgoals are needed.

### Final Answer
The value of \( xy \) is \( 10 \).
