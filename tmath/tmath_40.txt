Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine which piece of the piecewise function to use for $x = -7$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The function is defined as follows:
$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x + 9 & \text{if } x < -2, \\
5 - 2x & \text{if } x \ge -2.
\end{cases}
$$
Given $x = -7$, we need to check if it satisfies the condition $x < -2$ or $x \ge -2$. Since $-7 < -2$, we use the first piece of the function, $2x + 9$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $x = -7$ into the expression $2x + 9$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $x = -7$ into $2x + 9$:  
$$
2(-7) + 9 = -14 + 9 = -5.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the piecewise function evaluation and arithmetic calculation for $f(-7)$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Condition verification**:  
   The function defines $f(x) = 2x + 9$ for $x < -2$. Since $-7 < -2$ is a true statement, the first case is valid. If $x = -7$ had satisfied $x \ge -2$, using the second case would be incorrect. This step confirms the correct case was selected.

2. **Substitution verification**:  
   Substituting $x = -7$ into $2x + 9$:  
   $2 \cdot (-7) = -14$ (multiplication of positive and negative yields negative).  
   $-14 + 9 = -5$ (addition of negative and positive: subtract magnitudes, sign follows larger magnitude).  
   No errors in arithmetic operations.

3. **Conclusion**: All logical steps (condition evaluation, substitution, arithmetic) are correct. No contradictions or inconsistencies detected.
