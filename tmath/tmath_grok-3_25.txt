**Problem Restatement:** We are given two equations involving real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

1. \((x + y + z)(xy + xz + yz) = 25\)
2. \(x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) = 7\)

Our goal is to find the value of \(xyz\).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to find \(xyz\). First, I aim to understand the given equations and identify any symmetric properties or identities that might simplify them. Next, I will try to express the equations in terms of known symmetric polynomials or derive expressions that can help isolate \(xyz\). Finally, I will solve for \(xyz\) using the relationships derived from the equations.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(xyz\).

  - Subgoal 2: Express the equations in terms of symmetric polynomials or derive useful expressions.  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \(xyz\) using the derived relationships.  

Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Understand the given equations and identify symmetric properties or identities.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Understand the given equations and identify symmetric properties or identities.  
How to Achieve: I will analyze the structure of both equations to see if they can be related to the expansion of \((x + y + z)^3\) or other symmetric identities that might involve \(xyz\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Looking at the first equation \((x + y + z)(xy + xz + yz) = 25\), I recognize that this resembles part of the expansion of \((x + y + z)^3\), which is:  
\[(x + y + z)^3 = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3(x + y + z)(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz.\]  
However, I don't have \((x + y + z)^3\) or \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3\) directly. Instead, I will denote:  
- \(s_1 = x + y + z\),  
- \(s_2 = xy + xz + yz\),  
- \(s_3 = xyz\).  

So the first equation becomes:  
\(s_1 \cdot s_2 = 25\).  

Now, examining the second equation \(x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) = 7\), I rewrite it:  
\(x^2(y + z) = x^2 y + x^2 z\),  
\(y^2(x + z) = y^2 x + y^2 z\),  
\(z^2(x + y) = z^2 x + z^2 y\).  

Combining all terms:  
\(x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z)\), but a better approach is to express it as:  
\(x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) = x^2(s_1 - x) + y^2(s_1 - y) + z^2(s_1 - z) = s_1(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)\).  

I know that \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + xz + yz) = s_1^2 - 2s_2\), so this might help later.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Adjust Subgoals**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Based on the initial analysis, I will refine my subgoals to be more specific. The adjusted subgoals are:  
- Subgoal 1: Define symmetric sums and rewrite both equations using these variables (\(s_1, s_2, s_3\)).  
- Subgoal 2: Relate the second equation to known identities or derive an expression involving \(s_3 = xyz\).  
- Subgoal 3: Solve the system of equations for \(s_3\).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define symmetric sums and rewrite both equations using these variables (\(s_1, s_2, s_3\)).  
How to Achieve: I will express both given equations in terms of \(s_1 = x + y + z\), \(s_2 = xy + xz + yz\), and \(s_3 = xyz\), to simplify the problem and find relationships.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From earlier:  
First equation:  
\((x + y + z)(xy + xz + yz) = s_1 \cdot s_2 = 25\).  

Second equation:  
\(x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) = x^2(s_1 - x) + y^2(s_1 - y) + z^2(s_1 - z) = s_1(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)\).  

Now, \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s_1^2 - 2s_2\), and for \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3\), I recall the identity:  
\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)\),  
so \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3s_3 = s_1(s_1^2 - 3s_2)\),  
thus \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3\).  

Substitute back into the second equation:  
\(s_1(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = s_1(s_1^2 - 2s_2) - (s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3) = s_1^3 - 2s_1 s_2 - s_1^3 + 3s_1 s_2 - 3s_3 = s_1 s_2 - 3s_3\).  

So the second equation becomes:  
\(s_1 s_2 - 3s_3 = 7\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations for \(s_3 = xyz\).  
How to Achieve: Using the two simplified equations \(s_1 s_2 = 25\) and \(s_1 s_2 - 3s_3 = 7\), I will solve for \(s_3\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the first equation:  
\(s_1 s_2 = 25\).  

From the second equation:  
\(s_1 s_2 - 3s_3 = 7\).  

Substitute \(s_1 s_2 = 25\) into the second equation:  
\(25 - 3s_3 = 7\),  
so \(-3s_3 = 7 - 25 = -18\),  
thus \(s_3 = \frac{18}{3} = 6\).  

Therefore, \(xyz = s_3 = 6\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 7: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \(xyz = 6\) by checking if the derived equations and calculations are correct.  
How to Achieve: I will double-check the algebraic manipulations and substitutions to ensure no errors were made in deriving \(s_3 = 6\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Revisit the key steps:  
1. First equation: \((x + y + z)(xy + xz + yz) = s_1 s_2 = 25\), which is directly given.  
2. Second equation simplification:  
   - Expressed as \(s_1(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)\).  
   - Used \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s_1^2 - 2s_2\).  
   - Used \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3\).  
   - Derived \(s_1 s_2 - 3s_3 = 7\).  
3. Solving: \(25 - 3s_3 = 7\) leads to \(s_3 = 6\).  

The algebra checks out without errors in substitution or calculation. The solution \(xyz = 6\) appears consistent with the given equations.

**Step 8: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:
