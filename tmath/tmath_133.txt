Goal of this step: Set up an equation where the two expressions are equal.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We set the expressions $\frac{3+x}{5+x}$ and $\frac{1+x}{2+x}$ equal to each other:
$$
\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve the equation, we will cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:  
$$
(3+x)(2+x) = (1+x)(5+x)
$$  
Expanding both sides:  
$$
(3)(2) + 3x + 2x + x^2 = (1)(5) + 5x + x + x^2
$$  
$$
6 + 5x + x^2 = 5 + 6x + x^2
$$  
Simplify both sides:  
$$
6 + 5x = 5 + 6x
$$  
Subtract $5x$ from both sides:  
$$
6 = 5 + x
$$  
Subtract 5 from both sides:  
$$
x = 1
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the algebraic manipulations and solution validity for the equation $\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Cross-multiplication validity**:  
   Original equation: $\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \frac{1+x}{2+x}$  
   Cross-multiplying assumes $5+x \neq 0$ and $2+x \neq 0$, i.e., $x \neq -5$ and $x \neq -2$. The solution $x = 1$ does not violate these constraints.

2. **Expansion of terms**:  
   Left side: $(3+x)(2+x) = 6 + 5x + x^2$  
   Right side: $(1+x)(5+x) = 5 + 6x + x^2$  
   Simplification to $6 + 5x = 5 + 6x$ is correct. Subtracting $5x$ and $5$ yields $1 = x$, which aligns with the solution $x = 1$.

3. **Back-substitution**:  
   Substitute $x = 1$ into the original equation:  
   Left: $\frac{3+1}{5+1} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$  
   Right: $\frac{1+1}{2+1} = \frac{2}{3}$  
   Both sides are equal, confirming the solution is valid.

4. **Extraneous solution check**:  
   The excluded values $x = -5$ and $x = -2$ make denominators zero, but $x = 1$ does not. No extraneous solutions introduced.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically sound.
