### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation and find the sum of the solutions.

3. Compute the sum of the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \) in standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). This can be achieved by moving all terms to one side of the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \]  
Subtract 1993 from both sides to set the equation to zero:  
\[ x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \]  
This is the standard quadratic form, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \), and \( c = -1993 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \). This can be achieved by applying the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \), identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = 1 \)  
- \( b = 1992 \)  
- \( c = -1993 \)  

The quadratic formula is:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  

Compute the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 1992^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1993) \]  
\[ = 1992^2 + 4 \cdot 1993 \]  

Calculate \( 1992^2 \):  
\[ 1992 = 2000 - 8 \]  
\[ 1992^2 = (2000 - 8)^2 = 2000^2 - 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 8 + 8^2 = 4,000,000 - 32,000 + 64 = 3,968,064 \]  

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 1993 \):  
\[ 4 \cdot 1993 = 4 \cdot (2000 - 7) = 4 \cdot 2000 - 4 \cdot 7 = 8000 - 28 = 7972 \]  

So, the discriminant is:  
\[ 3,968,064 + 7972 = 3,976,036 \]  

Check if the discriminant is a perfect square:  
\[ 1996^2 = (2000 - 4)^2 = 2000^2 - 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 4 + 4^2 = 4,000,000 - 16,000 + 16 = 3,984,016 \]  
\[ 1995^2 = (2000 - 5)^2 = 2000^2 - 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 5 + 5^2 = 4,000,000 - 20,000 + 25 = 3,980,025 \]  
Try a number between 1995 and 1996, say 1994:  
\[ 1994^2 = (2000 - 6)^2 = 2000^2 - 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 6 + 6^2 = 4,000,000 - 24,000 + 36 = 3,976,036 \]  
Thus, \( \sqrt{3,976,036} = 1994 \).  

Now apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-1992 \pm 1994}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
\[ x_1 = \frac{-1992 + 1994}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]  
\[ x_2 = \frac{-1992 - 1994}{2} = \frac{-3986}{2} = -1993 \]  

The solutions are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \) are solutions to the equation \( x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \). This can be achieved by substituting each value back into the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \):  
\[ 1^2 + 1992 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1992 = 1993 \]  
This satisfies the equation.  

Substitute \( x = -1993 \):  
\[ (-1993)^2 + 1992 \cdot (-1993) = 1993^2 - 1992 \cdot 1993 \]  
Calculate \( 1993^2 \):  
\[ 1993 = 2000 - 7 \]  
\[ 1993^2 = (2000 - 7)^2 = 2000^2 - 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 7 + 7^2 = 4,000,000 - 28,000 + 49 = 3,972,049 \]  
Calculate \( 1992 \cdot 1993 \):  
\[ 1992 = 1993 - 1 \]  
\[ 1992 \cdot 1993 = (1993 - 1) \cdot 1993 = 1993^2 - 1993 = 3,972,049 - 1993 = 3,970,056 \]  
So:  
\[ 3,972,049 - 3,970,056 = 1993 \]  
This satisfies the equation.  

Both solutions are valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the solutions \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \). This can be achieved by adding the two values directly or using the sum of roots formula for a quadratic equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Directly compute the sum:  
\[ 1 + (-1993) = 1 - 1993 = -1992 \]  

Alternatively, use the sum of roots formula for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where the sum of roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \):  
\[ a = 1, b = 1992 \]  
\[ \text{Sum} = -\frac{1992}{1} = -1992 \]  

Both methods confirm the sum is \(-1992\).
