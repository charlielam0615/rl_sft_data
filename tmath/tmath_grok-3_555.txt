### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation and find the sum of the solutions:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the values of \( x \).  
3. Sum the values of \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero, resulting in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \]  
Subtract 1993 from both sides to set the equation to zero:  
\[ x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \]  
This is the standard quadratic form, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \), and \( c = -1993 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the quadratic equation is correctly rewritten.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that all terms have been correctly moved to one side and that the equation is in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The rewritten equation is:  
\[ x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \]  
To validate, substitute back into the original equation. If \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \), then \( x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \). The transformation is correct since subtracting 1993 from both sides preserves equality. The coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \), \( c = -1993 \), which matches the standard form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \), and \( c = -1993 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \):  
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \), \( c = -1993 \).  
- Compute the discriminant:  
  \[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1992^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1993) \]  
  \[ 1992^2 = 3968064 \]  
  \[ 4 \cdot 1993 = 7972 \]  
  \[ \Delta = 3968064 + 7972 = 3976036 \]  
- Find the square root of the discriminant:  
  \[ \sqrt{3976036} = 1994 \] (since \( 1994^2 = 3976036 \)).  
- Apply the quadratic formula:  
  \[ x = \frac{-1992 \pm 1994}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
  \[ x_1 = \frac{-1992 + 1994}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]  
  \[ x_2 = \frac{-1992 - 1994}{2} = \frac{-3986}{2} = -1993 \]  
The solutions are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \) satisfy the original equation \( x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution into the original equation and check if the equality holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ 1^2 + 1992 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1992 = 1993 \]  
  This satisfies the equation.  
- For \( x = -1993 \):  
  \[ (-1993)^2 + 1992 \cdot (-1993) = 1993^2 - 1992 \cdot 1993 \]  
  \[ 1993^2 = 3972049 \]  
  \[ 1992 \cdot 1993 = 1992 \cdot (1992 + 1) = 1992^2 + 1992 = 3968064 + 1992 = 3970056 \]  
  \[ 3972049 - 3970056 = 1993 \]  
  This satisfies the equation.  
Both solutions are correct.

  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (completed: \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation to find the values of \( x \) (completed: \( x = 1 \), \( x = -1993 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the values of \( x \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the values of \( x \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sum the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the solutions \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solutions are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1993 \).  
Sum:  
\[ 1 + (-1993) = 1 - 1993 = -1992 \]  
The sum of the values of \( x \) is \(-1992\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the sum of the solutions is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the sum of roots formula for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \), and compare with the calculated sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0 \):  
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1992 \).  
- The sum of the roots is:  
  \[ -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{1992}{1} = -1992 \]  
This matches the calculated sum: \( 1 + (-1993) = -1992 \).  
The sum is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 + 1992x = 1993 \) is \(-1992\).  
\[ \boxed{-1992} \]
