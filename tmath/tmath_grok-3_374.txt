### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \), break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the floor function and rewrite the equation.  
2. Express \( r \) in terms of its integer and fractional parts.  
3. Solve for possible values of \( r \) by considering integer values of \( \lfloor r \rfloor \).  
4. Validate the solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand the floor function and rewrite the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: The floor function \( \lfloor r \rfloor \) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( r \). Rewrite the equation \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \) to isolate the floor function or express \( r \) in a form that facilitates solving.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( n = \lfloor r \rfloor \), where \( n \) is an integer and \( n \leq r < n+1 \). Substituting into the equation:  
\[ n + r = 16.5 \]  
Solving for \( r \):  
\[ r = 16.5 - n \]  
Since \( n = \lfloor r \rfloor \), we need \( n = \lfloor 16.5 - n \rfloor \). Additionally, because \( n \leq r < n+1 \), substitute \( r = 16.5 - n \):  
\[ n \leq 16.5 - n < n + 1 \]  
This gives constraints to find valid integer \( n \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve for \( n \) using the constraints and floor condition.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the constraint \( n \leq 16.5 - n < n + 1 \) and the floor condition \( n = \lfloor 16.5 - n \rfloor \) to find possible integer values of \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the constraint \( n \leq 16.5 - n < n + 1 \), break it into two inequalities:  
1. \( n \leq 16.5 - n \)  
2. \( 16.5 - n < n + 1 \)  

**Solve the first inequality**:  
\[ n \leq 16.5 - n \]  
\[ 2n \leq 16.5 \]  
\[ n \leq 8.25 \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \leq 8 \).  

**Solve the second inequality**:  
\[ 16.5 - n < n + 1 \]  
\[ 16.5 < 2n + 1 \]  
\[ 15.5 < 2n \]  
\[ 7.75 < n \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \geq 8 \).  

Combining: \( n \geq 8 \) and \( n \leq 8 \), so \( n = 8 \).  

Now, apply the floor condition:  
\[ r = 16.5 - n \]  
If \( n = 8 \):  
\[ r = 16.5 - 8 = 8.5 \]  
Check: \( \lfloor r \rfloor = \lfloor 8.5 \rfloor = 8 \), and \( 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 \), which satisfies the equation.  

Test the floor condition:  
\[ n = \lfloor 16.5 - n \rfloor \]  
\[ 8 = \lfloor 16.5 - 8 \rfloor = \lfloor 8.5 \rfloor = 8 \]  
This holds.  

Try other integers to ensure completeness. If \( n = 7 \):  
\[ r = 16.5 - 7 = 9.5 \]  
\[ \lfloor r \rfloor = \lfloor 9.5 \rfloor = 9 \]  
\[ 9 + 9.5 = 18.5 \neq 16.5 \]  
Also:  
\[ \lfloor 16.5 - 7 \rfloor = \lfloor 9.5 \rfloor = 9 \neq 7 \]  

If \( n = 9 \):  
\[ r = 16.5 - 9 = 7.5 \]  
\[ \lfloor r \rfloor = \lfloor 7.5 \rfloor = 7 \]  
\[ 7 + 7.5 = 14.5 \neq 16.5 \]  
Also:  
\[ \lfloor 16.5 - 9 \rfloor = \lfloor 7.5 \rfloor = 7 \neq 9 \]  

No other \( n \) satisfies both the floor condition and the equation.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( r = 8.5 \) is the only solution and check for other possibilities.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the constraints and test boundary conditions to confirm no other solutions exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconsider the constraint \( n \leq 16.5 - n < n + 1 \). The only integer \( n \) satisfying both \( n \geq 8 \) and \( n \leq 8 \) is \( n = 8 \), leading to \( r = 8.5 \).  

Alternatively, express \( r = n + f \), where \( n = \lfloor r \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq f < 1 \). Then:  
\[ \lfloor r \rfloor + r = n + (n + f) = 2n + f = 16.5 \]  
Since \( f \) is fractional (\( 0 \leq f < 1 \)), \( 2n \) is an integer, so \( 2n = \lfloor 16.5 - f \rfloor \). Since \( 0 \leq f < 1 \):  
\[ 15.5 < 16.5 - f \leq 16.5 \]  
\[ \lfloor 15.5 < 16.5 - f \leq 16.5 \rfloor = 16 \]  
Thus:  
\[ 2n = 16 \]  
\[ n = 8 \]  
Then:  
\[ 2 \cdot 8 + f = 16 + f = 16.5 \]  
\[ f = 0.5 \]  
So:  
\[ r = n + f = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5 \]  
This confirms \( r = 8.5 \). No other integer \( n \) makes \( 2n + f = 16.5 \) with \( 0 \leq f < 1 \).
