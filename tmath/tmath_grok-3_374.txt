**Problem Statement**: Find all values of \( r \) such that \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \), where \( \lfloor r \rfloor \) denotes the floor function, giving the greatest integer less than or equal to \( r \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \), break it into subgoals:  
1. Understand the floor function and rewrite the equation.  
2. Express \( r \) in terms of its integer and fractional parts.  
3. Solve for the integer and fractional parts to find all possible \( r \).  
4. Verify solutions.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation using the definition of the floor function.  
How to Achieve: Express \( r \) as \( r = n + f \), where \( n = \lfloor r \rfloor \) is an integer, and \( f = r - \lfloor r \rfloor \) is the fractional part, \( 0 \leq f < 1 \). Substitute into the equation \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( r = n + f \), where \( n = \lfloor r \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq f < 1 \). Since \( \lfloor r \rfloor = n \), the equation becomes:  
\[ n + (n + f) = 16.5 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2n + f = 16.5 \]  
Solve for \( f \):  
\[ f = 16.5 - 2n \]  
Since \( f \) is the fractional part, it must satisfy \( 0 \leq f < 1 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the possible values of \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq f < 1 \).  
How to Achieve: Use the equation \( f = 16.5 - 2n \) and impose the condition \( 0 \leq 16.5 - 2n < 1 \). Solve the resulting inequality for \( n \), ensuring \( n \) is an integer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( f = 16.5 - 2n \), we need:  
\[ 0 \leq 16.5 - 2n < 1 \]  
Solve the inequality:  
- Left side: \( 0 \leq 16.5 - 2n \)  
  \[ 2n \leq 16.5 \]  
  \[ n \leq 8.25 \]  
  Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \leq 8 \).  
- Right side: \( 16.5 - 2n < 1 \]  
  \[ 16.5 - 1 < 2n \]  
  \[ 15.5 < 2n \]  
  \[ 7.75 < n \]  
  Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \geq 8 \).  

Combining: \( n \leq 8 \) and \( n \geq 8 \), so \( n = 8 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find \( r \) using the value of \( n \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 8 \) into \( f = 16.5 - 2n \) to find \( f \), then compute \( r = n + f \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( n = 8 \):  
\[ f = 16.5 - 2 \cdot 8 = 16.5 - 16 = 0.5 \]  
Thus:  
\[ r = n + n = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validate (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( r = 8.5 \) satisfies the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( r = 8.5 \) into \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5 \) and check if it holds. Also, confirm no other integer values of \( n \) yield valid solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( r = 8.5 \):  
- \( \lfloor r \rfloor = \lfloor 8.5 \rfloor = 8 \)  
- Compute: \( \lfloor r \rfloor + r = 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 \), which satisfies the equation.  

Check other \( n \):  
- If \( n = 7 \):  
  \[ f = 16.5 - 2 \cdot 7 = 16.5 - 14 = 2.5 \]  
  Since \( f \geq 1 \), this is invalid.  
- If \( n = 9 \):  
  \[ f = 16.5 - 2 \cdot 9 = 16.5 - 18 = -1.5 \]  
  Since \( f < 0 \), this is invalid.  

No other integer \( n \) satisfy \( 0 \leq 16.5 - 2n < 1 \). Thus, \( r = 8.5 \) is the only solution.
