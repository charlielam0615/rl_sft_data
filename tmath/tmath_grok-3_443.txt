**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) when \( x = 3 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the polynomial and the value of \( x \).  
2. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the polynomial.  
3. Compute each term of the polynomial.  
4. Sum the results to obtain the final value.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) and compute each term.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into each term (\( x^3 \), \( x^2 \), \( x \), and 1), calculate their values, and prepare for summation.

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 3 \):  
- \( x^3 = 3^3 = 27 \)  
- \( x^2 = 3^2 = 9 \)  
- \( x = 3 \)  
- Constant term = 1

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Sum the computed terms to evaluate the polynomial.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the values of \( 3^3 \), \( 3^2 \), \( 3 \), and 1 to get the final result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Sum the terms:  
\( 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40 \)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the computed result.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the polynomial by substituting \( x = 3 \) directly and confirm the sum matches the previous result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute directly:  
\( 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40 \)  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming correctness.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate \( x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) when \( x = 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the polynomial and \( x = 3 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the polynomial (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute each term (completed: \( 3^3 = 27 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 3 = 3 \), \( 1 = 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the terms (completed: \( 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the result (completed: recomputed and confirmed \( 40 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Completed (validation confirmed the result).  
**Final Answer**: The value of the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) when \( x = 3 \) is \( 40 \).
