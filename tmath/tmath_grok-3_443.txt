**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of evaluating the polynomial into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.  
2. Compute each term: $x^3$, $x^2$, $x$, and the constant $1$.  
3. Sum the results of all terms to obtain the final value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute each term of the polynomial after substituting $x = 3$.  
How to Achieve: Calculate $3^3$, $3^2$, $3$, and the constant $1$ individually.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial:  
- $x^3 = 3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27$  
- $x^2 = 3^2 = 3 \cdot 3 = 9$  
- $x = 3$  
- Constant = $1$  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Sum the computed terms to evaluate the polynomial.  
How to Achieve: Add the values of $3^3$, $3^2$, $3$, and $1$ together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the terms:  
$27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40$  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the polynomial evaluation.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the polynomial value using an alternative method, such as direct substitution and summation in one step, to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Directly substitute $x = 3$ into $x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$:  
$3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40$  
The result matches the previous calculation, confirming the solution is correct.

Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Evaluate $x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ when $x = 3$.  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial.  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute each term ($3^3$, $3^2$, $3$, $1$).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the terms to obtain the final value.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result.  
Current Goal: Completed (validation confirmed the result).  
The polynomial evaluates to $40$ when $x = 3$.  
[/REVIEW]
