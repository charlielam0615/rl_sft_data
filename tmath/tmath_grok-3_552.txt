**Problem Restatement**: The quadratic function \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) needs to be expressed in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants. The task is to find the value of \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) by completing the square.  
2. Identify the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the resulting expression.  
3. Compute \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\). This will be achieved by factoring out the leading coefficient and completing the square for the quadratic expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the quadratic: \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\).  
Factor out the leading coefficient \(-6\) from the first two terms and the constant:  
\[-6x^2 + 36x + 216 = -6(x^2 - 6x) + 216.\]  

Complete the square inside the parentheses:  
- For \(x^2 - 6x\), take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-6\), divide by 2 to get \(-3\), and square it: \((-3)^2 = 9\).  
- Add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:  
  \[-6(x^2 - 6x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9) = -6((x - 3)^2 - 9) = -6(x - 3)^2 + 54.\]  

Now incorporate the constant term:  
\[-6(x - 3)^2 + 54 + 216 = -6(x - 3)^2 + 270.\]  

The expression is now in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\):  
\[-6(x - 3)^2 + 270 = -6(x + (-3))^2 + 270.\]  
Thus, \(a = -6\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = 270\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the expression \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\) is equivalent to the original quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\). This will be done by expanding the rewritten form and comparing it to the original.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\):  
- First, compute \((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\).  
- Then, \(-6(x - 3)^2 = -6(x^2 - 6x + 9) = -6x^2 + 36x - 54\).  
- Add the constant: \(-6x^2 + 36x - 54 + 270 = -6x^2 + 36x + 216\).  

This matches the original quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\), confirming the correctness of the form \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b + c\), using the identified constants \(a = -6\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = 270\). This will be achieved by summing these values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \(a + b + c\):  
\[-6 + (-3) + 270 = -6 - 3 + 270 = -9 + 270 = 261.\]  
Thus, \(a + b + c = 261\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b + c\) for the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) written as \(a(x + b)^2 + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). (Completed: \(a = -6\), \(b = -3\), \(c = 270\))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + c\). (Completed: \(a + b + c = 261\))  

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to compute \(a + b + c\), which has been achieved. No further subgoals are needed.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(a + b + c = 261\).
