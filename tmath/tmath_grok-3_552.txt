**Problem Statement**: The quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) needs to be expressed in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants. The goal is to find the value of \(a + b + c\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) by completing the square.  
2. Identify the constants \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the resulting expression.  
3. Compute the sum \(a + b + c\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\).  
**How to Achieve**: Factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms, complete the square inside the parentheses, and adjust the constant term to match the required form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the quadratic: \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\).  
Factor out \(-6\) from the first two terms:  
\[-6(x^2 - 6x) + 216.\]  
Complete the square for \(x^2 - 6x\):  
- Take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-6\), divide by 2 to get \(-3\), and square it: \((-3)^2 = 9\).  
- Add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses:  
  \[x^2 - 6x = x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9.\]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\[-6((x - 3)^2 - 9) + 216.\]  
Distribute \(-6\):  
\[-6(x - 3)^2 + 54 + 216.\]  
Combine constants:  
\[54 + 216 = 270.\]  
Thus, the quadratic is:  
\[-6(x - 3)^2 + 270.\]  
This matches the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\), where:  
- \(a = -6\),  
- \(b = -3\) (since the form is \(a(x + b)^2\), and here it’s \((x - 3) = (x + (-3))\)),  
- \(c = 270\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\) is equivalent to \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\).  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the expression \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\) and check if it matches the original quadratic.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expand \(-6(x - 3)^2 + 270\):  
- Compute \((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\).  
- Multiply by \(-6\): \(-6(x^2 - 6x + 9) = -6x^2 + 36x - 54\).  
- Add 270: \(-6x^2 + 36x - 54 + 270 = -6x^2 + 36x + 216\).  
This matches the original quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\), confirming the expression is correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b + c\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the identified values \(a = -6\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = 270\), and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From Step 2, we have \(a = -6\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = 270\).  
Compute:  
\[-6 + (-3) + 270 = -6 - 3 + 270 = -9 + 270 = 261.\]  
Thus, \(a + b + c = 261\).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b + c\) for the quadratic \(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\) written as \(a(x + b)^2 + c\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the form \(a(x + b)^2 + c\) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + c\) (completed in Step 4).
