### Problem Statement
We need to find the value(s) of \( y \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\frac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y - 1} + \frac{3y^2 + 16y - 12}{3y - 2} = -3
\]

We will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and organizing the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the first fraction \(\frac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y - 1}\).  
2. Simplify the second fraction \(\frac{3y^2 + 16y - 12}{3y - 2}\).  
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.  
4. Set the combined expression equal to \(-3\) and solve for \( y \).  
5. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid and does not make the denominators zero.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to simplify the first fraction \(\frac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y - 1}\). This will be achieved by factoring the numerator and checking for possible cancellations with the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The numerator is \( y^2 - 9y + 8 \). We factor it by finding two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to \(-9\). These numbers are \(-1\) and \(-8\). Thus:  
\[
y^2 - 9y + 8 = (y - 1)(y - 8)
\]  
The fraction becomes:  
\[
\frac{(y - 1)(y - 8)}{y - 1}
\]  
Since \( y \neq 1 \) (to avoid division by zero), we cancel \( y - 1 \):  
\[
\frac{(y - 1)(y - 8)}{y - 1} = y - 8 \quad \text{(for } y \neq 1\text{)}
\]  
So, the first fraction simplifies to \( y - 8 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to simplify the second fraction \(\frac{3y^2 + 16y - 12}{3y - 2}\). This will be achieved by factoring the numerator and checking for possible cancellations with the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The numerator is \( 3y^2 + 16y - 12 \). We use the quadratic formula to find the roots, as factoring directly is not immediately obvious. For a quadratic \( ay^2 + by + c \), the roots are given by:  
\[
y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]  
Here, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 16 \), \( c = -12 \). Compute the discriminant:  
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = 256 + 144 = 400
\]  
\[
\sqrt{400} = 20
\]  
Roots:  
\[
y = \frac{-16 \pm 20}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-16 \pm 20}{6}
\]  
\[
y = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}, \quad y = \frac{-36}{6} = -6
\]  
Thus, the numerator factors as:  
\[
3y^2 + 16y - 12 = 3(y - \frac{2}{3})(y + 6) = (3y - 2)(y + 6)
\]  
The fraction becomes:  
\[
\frac{(3y - 2)(y + 6)}{3y - 2}
\]  
Since \( 3y - 2 \neq 0 \) (i.e., \( y \neq \frac{2}{3} \)), we cancel \( 3y - 2 \):  
\[
\frac{(3y - 2)(y + 6)}{3y - 2} = y + 6 \quad \text{(for } y \neq \frac{2}{3}\text{)}
\]  
So, the second fraction simplifies to \( y + 6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to combine the simplified fractions and set the resulting expression equal to \(-3\). This will be achieved by substituting the simplified forms \( y - 8 \) and \( y + 6 \) into the equation and solving for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation becomes:  
\[
(y - 8) + (y + 6) = -3
\]  
Combine like terms:  
\[
y - 8 + y + 6 = 2y - 2
\]  
Set equal to \(-3\):  
\[
2y - 2 = -3
\]  
Solve:  
\[
2y = -1 \implies y = -\frac{1}{2}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to verify the solution \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking if it satisfies the equation and does not violate denominator constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \) into the original equation.  
**First fraction**:  
\[
y^2 - 9y + 8 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 9\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 8 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{9}{2} + 8 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{18}{4} + \frac{32}{4} = \frac{51}{4}
\]  
Denominator:  
\[
y - 1 = -\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}
\]  
\[
\frac{\frac{51}{4}}{-\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{51}{4} \cdot \frac{-2}{3} = \frac{51 \cdot (-2)}{4 \cdot 3} = -\frac{102}{12} = -\frac{17}{2}
\]  
**Second fraction**:  
\[
3y^2 + 16y - 12 = 3\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 16\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 12 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 8 - 12 = \frac{3}{4} - 20 = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{80}{4} = -\frac{77}{4}
\]  
Denominator:  
\[
3y - 2 = 3\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 2 = -\frac{3}{2} - 2 = -\frac{3}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = -\frac{7}{2}
\]  
\[
\frac{-\frac{77}{4}}{-\frac{7}{2}} = -\frac{77}{4} \cdot \frac{-2}{7} = \frac{77 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{154}{28} = \frac{11}{2}
\]  
Combine:  
\[
-\frac{17}{2} + \frac{11}{2} = \frac{-17 + 11}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
\]  
The left-hand side equals \(-3\), matching the right-hand side.  
Check denominators: \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \) gives \( y - 1 = -\frac{3}{2} \neq 0 \), and \( 3y - 2 = -\frac{7}{2} \neq 0 \). The solution is valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as we have found and verified \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \).
