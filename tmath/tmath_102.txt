Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the correct piece of the piecewise function to use for $x = 5$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The function $f(x)$ is defined as a piecewise function with two cases:  

- $3x + 5$ if $x < -3$,  
- $7 - 4x$ if $x \ge -3$.  

To determine which expression to use for $x = 5$, we evaluate the condition $x \ge -3$. Since $5 \ge -3$ is true, we must use the second expression $7 - 4x$ to compute $f(5)$.

[REVIEW]
I am currently at the stage of calculating $f(5)$ using the correct expression $7 - 4x$, which has already been identified as the appropriate piece of the function for $x = 5$. The next step is to compute the value and verify the result.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $f(5)$ using the correct expression $7 - 4x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We substitute $x = 5$ into the expression $7 - 4x$:  

$$
f(5) = 7 - 4(5) = 7 - 20 = -13
$$  

Thus, the calculated value is $f(5) = -13$.

Self-Verification (Verification): Re-evaluate the substitution and calculation process for $f(5)$ using the expression $7 - 4x$.

1. Check the condition for the piecewise function: $x = 5 \ge -3$ is true, so the correct expression is $7 - 4x$.
2. Substitute $x = 5$ into $7 - 4x$: $7 - 4(5) = 7 - 20 = -13$.
3. The result $f(5) = -13$ is consistent with the function definition and calculation.

Thus, the result is correct.

1. **Condition Evaluation**:  
   - The piecewise function defines $ f(x) = 7 - 4x $ for $ x \ge -3 $.  
   - For $ x = 5 $, the condition $ 5 \ge -3 $ is true.  
   - **Conclusion**: Correct expression $ 7 - 4x $ was selected.  

2. **Arithmetic Calculation**:  
   - Substituting $ x = 5 $:  
     $ 7 - 4(5) = 7 - 20 = -13 $.  
   - Rechecking the subtraction: $ 7 - 20 = -13 $.  
   - **Conclusion**: Arithmetic is accurate and consistent.  

3. **Function Definition Consistency**:  
   - The calculation aligns with the explicit definition of the function for $ x \ge -3 $.  
   - No ambiguity in the function's piecewise boundaries for $ x = 5 $.  
   - **Conclusion**: The result adheres strictly to the given function.  

4. **Overall Validity**:  
   - All steps (condition check, substitution, arithmetic, and verification) were executed without errors.  
   - No alternative interpretations of the function's definition exist for this input.  
   - **Final Conclusion**: The result $ f(5) = -13 $ is fully validated.
