**Problem Statement**: Compute the value of the expression \(2a + 3b\), where \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of computing \(2a + 3b\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute the given values of \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\) into the expression.  
2. Perform the scalar multiplications \(2a\) and \(3b\).  
3. Add the resulting complex numbers.  
4. Simplify the final result to the form \(x + yi\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute the values \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\) into the expression \(2a + 3b\) and perform the scalar multiplications. This will be achieved by multiplying \(a\) by 2 and \(b\) by 3, keeping the complex numbers in the form \(x + yi\).

[IMP]  
Substitute \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\) into the expression:  
- Compute \(2a = 2 \cdot (2 - i) = 2 \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot i = 4 - 2i\).  
- Compute \(3b = 3 \cdot (-1 + i) = 3 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot i = -3 + 3i\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the results of \(2a = 4 - 2i\) and \(3b = -3 + 3i\) to compute \(2a + 3b\). This will be achieved by adding the real and imaginary parts separately.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Add the complex numbers:  
\[ (4 - 2i) + (-3 + 3i) = (4 + (-3)) + (-2i + 3i) = 1 + i. \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \(1 + i\) by checking the calculations for accuracy. This will be achieved by recomputing the steps to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the calculations:  
- Recompute \(2a = 2 \cdot (2 - i) = 4 - 2i\).  
- Recompute \(3b = 3 \cdot (-1 + i) = -3 + 3i\).  
- Recompute the sum: \( (4 - 2i) + (-3 + 3i) = (4 - 3) + (-2i + 3i) = 1 + i\).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the result \(1 + i\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(2a + 3b\) where \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \(a\) and \(b\) into the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform scalar multiplications \(2a\) and \(3b\) (completed: \(2a = 4 - 2i\), \(3b = -3 + 3i\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Add the resulting complex numbers (completed: \(1 + i\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Simplify the result to the form \(x + yi\) (completed: \(1 + i\)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the result (completed: result confirmed as \(1 + i\)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, and the result is \(1 + i\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
The value of \(2a + 3b\), where \(a = 2 - i\) and \(b = -1 + i\), is \(1 + i\).
