**Problem Statement**: Compute the expression \( 2a + 3b \), where \( a = 2 - i \) and \( b = -1 + i \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( 2a + 3b \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute the given values of \( a = 2 - i \) and \( b = -1 + i \) into the expression.  
2. Compute \( 2a \) by multiplying \( a \) by 2.  
3. Compute \( 3b \) by multiplying \( b \) by 3.  
4. Add the results of \( 2a \) and \( 3b \).  
5. Simplify the final expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 2a \), where \( a = 2 - i \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply both the real and imaginary parts of \( a \) by 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( 2a \):  
\[ a = 2 - i \]  
\[ 2a = 2 \cdot (2 - i) = 2 \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot i = 4 - 2i \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 3b \), where \( b = -1 + i \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply both the real and imaginary parts of \( b \) by 3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( 3b \):  
\[ b = -1 + i \]  
\[ 3b = 3 \cdot (-1 + i) = 3 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot i = -3 + 3i \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add \( 2a \) and \( 3b \) to compute \( 2a + 3b \).  
How to Achieve: Add the real parts and imaginary parts of \( 2a = 4 - 2i \) and \( 3b = -3 + 3i \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( 2a + 3b \):  
\[ 2a = 4 - 2i \]  
\[ 3b = -3 + 3i \]  
\[ 2a + 3b = (4 - 2i) + (-3 + 3i) = (4 + (-3)) + (-2i + 3i) = 1 + i \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the result \( 2a + 3b = 1 + i \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute the steps briefly to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- \( a = 2 - i \), so \( 2a = 2 \cdot (2 - i) = 4 - 2i \).  
- \( b = -1 + i \), so \( 3b = 3 \cdot (-1 + i) = -3 + 3i \).  
- \( 2a + 3b = (4 - 2i) + (-3 + 3i) = (4 - 3) + (-2i + 3i) = 1 + i \).  
The result matches, confirming correctness.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( 2a + 3b \), where \( a = 2 - i \) and \( b = -1 + i \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 2a \). (Completed: \( 4 - 2i \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( 3b \). (Completed: \( -3 + 3i \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Add \( 2a \) and \( 3b \). (Completed: \( 1 + i \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result. (Completed: Verified \( 1 + i \))  
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.  
Final Result: \( 2a + 3b = 1 + i \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ 2a + 3b = 1 + i \]
