### Problem Restatement
We need to express the quadratic \( x^2 - 16x + 60 \) in the form \( (x - a)(x - b) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are nonnegative integers and \( a > b \). Then, we compute the value of \( 3b - a \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Factorize the quadratic \( x^2 - 16x + 60 \) into the form \( (x - a)(x - b) \).
2. Identify \( a \) and \( b \), ensuring they are nonnegative integers and \( a > b \).
3. Compute \( 3b - a \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Factorize \( x^2 - 16x + 60 \) into \( (x - a)(x - b) \).
How to Achieve: Find two nonnegative integers \( a \) and \( b \) whose product is the constant term (60) and whose sum is the absolute value of the coefficient of \( x \) (16), since the quadratic is \( x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - a)(x - b) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List pairs of nonnegative integers \( (a, b) \) such that \( a \cdot b = 60 \):
- \( 1 \cdot 60 = 60 \)
- \( 2 \cdot 30 = 60 \)
- \( 3 \cdot 20 = 60 \)
- \( 4 \cdot 15 = 60 \)
- \( 5 \cdot 12 = 60 \)
- \( 6 \cdot 10 = 60 \)
- \( 10 \cdot 6 = 60 \)
- \( 12 \cdot 5 = 60 \)
- \( 15 \cdot 4 = 60 \)
- \( 20 \cdot 3 = 60 \)
- \( 30 \cdot 2 = 60 \)
- \( 60 \cdot 1 = 60 \)

Check which pair satisfies \( a + b = 16 \):
- \( 6 + 10 = 16 \)

Thus, the factors are \( (x - 6)(x - 10) \) or \( (x - 10)(x - 6) \). Since \( a > b \), consider \( a = 10 \), \( b = 6 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the factorization \( (x - 10)(x - 6) \).
How to Achieve: Expand the factored form and check if it matches \( x^2 - 16x + 60 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( (x - 10)(x - 6) \):
\[
(x - 10)(x - 6) = x^2 - 6x - 10x + 60 = x^2 - 16x + 60
\]
The expansion matches the original quadratic, confirming the factorization is correct.

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( 3b - a \) for \( x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - a)(x - b) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are nonnegative integers, \( a > b \).
  - Subgoal 1: Factorize \( x^2 - 16x + 60 \) (completed: \( (x - 10)(x - 6) \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \( a = 10 \), \( b = 6 \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( 3b - a \).

Current Goal: Compute \( 3b - a \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( 3b - a \).
How to Achieve: Use the values \( a = 10 \), \( b = 6 \) and calculate \( 3 \cdot 6 - 10 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
3b - a = 3 \cdot 6 - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8
\]
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \( 3b - a \) is \( 8 \).
