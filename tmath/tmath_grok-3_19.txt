**Problem Restatement**: We need to express the quadratic $x^2 - 16x + 60$ in the factored form $(x - a)(x - b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers and $a > b$. Then, we compute the value of $3b - a$.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Factor the quadratic $x^2 - 16x + 60$ into the form $(x - a)(x - b)$.  
2. Ensure $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers with $a > b$.  
3. Compute the expression $3b - a$ using the values of $a$ and $b$.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to factor the quadratic $x^2 - 16x + 60$ into the form $(x - a)(x - b)$. To achieve this, find two nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ whose sum is 16 (since the coefficient of $x$ is $-16$, so $a + b = 16$) and whose product is 60 (since the constant term is 60, so $a \cdot b = 60$), with $a > b$.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To factor $x^2 - 16x + 60$, we need two numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + b = 16$ and $a \cdot b = 60$, with $a > b$ and both nonnegative integers. List the factor pairs of 60:  
- $1 \times 60 = 60$  
- $2 \times 30 = 60$  
- $3 \times 20 = 60$  
- $4 \times 15 = 60$  
- $5 \times 12 = 60$  
- $6 \times 10 = 60$  

Check which pair sums to 16:  
- $1 + 60 = 61$  
- $2 + 30 = 32$  
- $3 + 20 = 23$  
- $4 + 15 = 19$  
- $5 + 12 = 17$  
- $6 + 10 = 16$  

The pair $(10, 6)$ satisfies $a + b = 16$ and $a \cdot b = 60$. Since $a > b$, let $a = 10$ and $b = 6$. Thus, the quadratic factors as $(x - 10)(x - 6)$.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the factorization $(x - 10)(x - 6)$ is correct and that $a = 10$, $b = 6$ satisfy all conditions ($a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers, $a > b$).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand $(x - 10)(x - 6)$ to confirm:  
$(x - 10)(x - 6) = x^2 - 6x - 10x + 60 = x^2 - 16x + 60$, which matches the original quadratic.  
Check conditions:  
- $a = 10$, $b = 6$ are nonnegative integers.  
- $a > b$ since $10 > 6$.  
The factorization is correct, and the conditions are satisfied.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute $3b - a$ using $a = 10$ and $b = 6$.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate $3b - a$:  
$3b = 3 \cdot 6 = 18$, and $a = 10$, so $3b - a = 18 - 10 = 8$.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute $3b - a$ for the quadratic $x^2 - 16x + 60$ factored as $(x - a)(x - b)$ with $a > b$, both nonnegative integers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Factor the quadratic into $(x - a)(x - b)$. (Completed: Found $a = 10$, $b = 6$)  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the factorization and conditions. (Completed: $(x - 10)(x - 6)$ is correct, $a = 10$, $b = 6$ satisfy conditions)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute $3b - a$. (Completed: $3b - a = 8$)  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).

**Final Answer**: The value of $3b - a$ is $8$.
