### Problem Restatement
Luke wants to fence a square piece of land with an area of at least 400 square feet, using the least amount of fencing possible. We need to determine the side length of the square that satisfies the area requirement while minimizing the perimeter (fencing).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the side length of the square.  
- Subgoal 1: Define the mathematical relationship between the area and the side length of the square.  
- Subgoal 2: Define the fencing (perimeter) in terms of the side length.  
- Subgoal 3: Determine the minimum side length that satisfies the area requirement of at least 400 square feet.  
- Subgoal 4: Calculate the corresponding perimeter to ensure it is minimized.  

[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the mathematical relationship between the area and the side length of the square. To achieve this, express the area of the square in terms of its side length using the formula for the area of a square.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a square with side length \( s \), the area \( A \) is given by:  
\[ A = s^2 \]  
The problem states that the area must be at least 400 square feet, so:  
\[ s^2 \geq 400 \]  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the minimum side length that satisfies the area requirement of at least 400 square feet. Solve the inequality \( s^2 \geq 400 \) to find the smallest possible side length.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the inequality \( s^2 \geq 400 \), take the square root of both sides:  
\[ s \geq \sqrt{400} \]  
\[ s \geq 20 \]  
Since we want the least amount of fencing, choose the smallest side length that satisfies the area requirement:  
\[ s = 20 \text{ feet} \]  
Verify the area:  
\[ A = 20^2 = 400 \text{ square feet} \]  
This meets the requirement of at least 400 square feet.  

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the fencing (perimeter) in terms of the side length and calculate it for the minimum side length. Use the formula for the perimeter of a square and compute it for \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \).  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a square with side length \( s \), the perimeter \( P \) (fencing) is:  
\[ P = 4s \]  
For \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \):  
\[ P = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]  

[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the side length \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \) minimizes the fencing while meeting the area requirement. Check if a larger side length would result in less fencing or if the perimeter is optimal for the given constraint.  

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To minimize fencing, we need the smallest perimeter that satisfies \( s^2 \geq 400 \). Since \( P = 4s \), the perimeter is directly proportional to \( s \). Thus, the smallest \( s \) that satisfies \( s^2 \geq 400 \) (i.e., \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \)) gives the smallest perimeter:  
\[ P = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]  
For a larger side length, e.g., \( s = 21 \text{ feet} \):  
- Area: \( 21^2 = 441 \text{ square feet} \), which satisfies the requirement.  
- Perimeter: \( 4 \times 21 = 84 \text{ feet} \), which is larger than 80 feet.  
Since the perimeter increases with \( s \), and \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \) is the smallest side length that gives an area of at least 400 square feet, the perimeter of 80 feet is optimal.  

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the side length of a square with an area of at least 400 square feet that uses the least amount of fencing.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the area in terms of side length (\( s^2 \geq 400 \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 2: Define the perimeter in terms of side length (\( P = 4s \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the minimum side length (\( s = 20 \text{ feet} \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the perimeter for the minimum side length (\( P = 80 \text{ feet} \)). [Completed]  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate that \( s = 20 \text{ feet} \) minimizes the perimeter. [Completed]  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals have been addressed, and the solution is complete.  
The side length of 20 feet achieves an area of 400 square feet with a perimeter of 80 feet, which is the minimum possible while satisfying the area constraint.  

[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The side of the square should be 20 feet to achieve an area of at least 400 square feet while using the least amount of fencing (80 feet).
