### Problem Restatement
Luke wants to fence a square piece of land with an area of at least 400 square feet. We need to determine the side length of the square that minimizes the amount of fencing used while meeting the area requirement.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define the relationship between the side length, area, and fencing (perimeter) for a square.
2. Identify the minimum side length that satisfies the area requirement of at least 400 square feet.
3. Calculate the fencing required for this side length and confirm it is the minimum.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the relationship between the side length, area, and fencing for a square.
How to Achieve: Use the formulas for the area and perimeter of a square. Let the side length be \( s \). The area is \( s^2 \), and the perimeter (fencing) is \( 4s \). Set up the constraint for the area and the expression for the fencing.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a square with side length \( s \):
- Area: \( s^2 \geq 400 \)
- Fencing (perimeter): \( P = 4s \)

To find the minimum fencing, we need the smallest \( s \) that satisfies \( s^2 \geq 400 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the minimum side length that satisfies the area requirement.
How to Achieve: Solve the inequality \( s^2 \geq 400 \) to find the smallest possible \( s \). Since fencing increases with \( s \), the minimum \( s \) will yield the least fencing.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve for \( s \):
\[ s^2 \geq 400 \]
\[ s \geq \sqrt{400} \]
\[ s \geq 20 \]

Since \( s^2 \geq 400 \), the smallest side length is \( s = 20 \) feet, as any smaller \( s \) would result in an area less than 400 square feet.
Check: If \( s = 20 \), then \( s^2 = 20^2 = 400 \), which satisfies the area requirement.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the fencing required for the minimum side length and confirm it is the minimum.
How to Achieve: Compute the perimeter using \( P = 4s \) with \( s = 20 \). Verify that increasing \( s \) increases the fencing, confirming the minimum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( s = 20 \):
\[ P = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

To confirm this is the minimum, consider a slightly larger \( s \), e.g., \( s = 21 \):
- Area: \( 21^2 = 441 \geq 400 \) (satisfies requirement)
- Fencing: \( P = 4 \times 21 = 84 \text{ feet} \)

Since 84 > 80, increasing \( s \) increases the fencing. Thus, \( s = 20 \) gives the least fencing.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the side length of a square with an area of at least 400 square feet that uses the least amount of fencing.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the relationship between side length, area, and fencing (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the minimum side length satisfying the area requirement (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the fencing for this side length and confirm it is the minimum (completed).

Current Goal: Completed (all subgoals achieved).
The side length of 20 feet results in 80 feet of fencing, which is the minimum.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The side length of the square should be 20 feet, requiring 80 feet of fencing.
