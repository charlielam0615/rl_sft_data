[IMP]
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence, denoted by $ a_n $, can be represented by the formula:
$$ a_n = a + (n-1)d $$
Where:
- $ a $ is the first term of the sequence.
- $ d $ is the common difference between consecutive terms.
- $ n $ is the term number.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ terms of an arithmetic sequence to represent the sum of the first four terms.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The sum of the first $ n $ terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:  
$$ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d) $$  
For the first four terms ($ n = 4 $):  
$$ S_4 = \frac{4}{2}(2a + (4-1)d) = 2(2a + 3d) $$  
We are told $ S_4 = 10 $, so:  
$$ 2(2a + 3d) = 10 $$  
Simplifying:  
$$ 4a + 6d = 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$

Goal of this step: Use the formula for the nth term to represent the fifth term.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The fifth term ($ a_5 $) of the sequence is given by:  
$$ a_5 = a + (5-1)d = a + 4d $$  
We are told $ a_5 = 5 $, so:  
$$ a + 4d = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations to find $ a $ and $ d $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now solve the system of equations:  
1. $ 4a + 6d = 10 $  
2. $ a + 4d = 5 $  

From Equation 2, solve for $ a $:  
$$ a = 5 - 4d $$  

Substitute $ a = 5 - 4d $ into Equation 1:  
$$ 4(5 - 4d) + 6d = 10 $$  
$$ 20 - 16d + 6d = 10 $$  
$$ 20 - 10d = 10 $$  
$$ -10d = -10 $$  
$$ d = 1 $$  

Substitute $ d = 1 $ into Equation 2 to find $ a $:  
$$ a + 4(1) = 5 $$  
$$ a + 4 = 5 $$  
$$ a = 1 $$  

Thus, the first term $ a = 1 $ and the common difference $ d = 1 $.

Goal of this step: Calculate the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence using the derived values of $ a $ and $ d $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The sixth term ($ a_6 $) of the sequence is given by the formula:  
$$ a_6 = a + (6-1)d = a + 5d $$  
Substitute $ a = 1 $ and $ d = 1 $:  
$$ a_6 = 1 + 5(1) = 1 + 5 = 6 $$  
Thus, the sixth term is $ 6 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Check the derived values of $ a $ and $ d $**:
   - From the system of equations:
     - Equation 1: $ 4a + 6d = 10 $
     - Equation 2: $ a + 4d = 5 $
   - Substituting $ d = 1 $ into Equation 2: $ a + 4(1) = 5 $ â†’ $ a = 1 $. This is valid.
   - Substituting $ a = 1 $, $ d = 1 $ into Equation 1: $ 4(1) + 6(1) = 4 + 6 = 10 $. Matches the given sum of the first four terms.

2. **Validate the fifth term**:
   - $ a_5 = a + 4d = 1 + 4(1) = 5 $. Matches the given condition.

3. **Calculate the sixth term**:
   - $ a_6 = a + 5d = 1 + 5(1) = 6 $. This follows directly from the formula.

4. **Consistency check with the sequence**:
   - The sequence with $ a = 1 $, $ d = 1 $: $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \dots $
   - Sum of first four terms: $ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 $. Correct.
   - Fifth term: $ 5 $. Correct.
   - Sixth term: $ 6 $. Correct.

All steps align with the given conditions and mathematical principles. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
