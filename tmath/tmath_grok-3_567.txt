**Problem Restatement**:  
We need to find the value of \( b + m \), where two lines defined by the equations \( y = mx + 4 \) and \( y = 3x + b \) intersect at the point \( (6, 10) \). The constants \( m \) and \( b \) are to be determined based on this intersection condition.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( b + m \), we need to determine the values of \( m \) and \( b \) such that the lines \( y = mx + 4 \) and \( y = 3x + b \) intersect at \( (6, 10) \). Break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the intersection point \( (6, 10) \) to set up equations for both lines.  
2. Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( m \) and \( b \).  
3. Compute \( b + m \).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Use the intersection point \( (6, 10) \) to set up equations for both lines.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 10 \) into both line equations to create a system of equations involving \( m \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( (6, 10) \) into the first line equation \( y = mx + 4 \):  
\( 10 = m \cdot 6 + 4 \)  
\( 10 = 6m + 4 \)  
\( 6m = 10 - 4 \)  
\( 6m = 6 \)  
\( m = 1 \)

Substitute \( (6, 10) \) into the second line equation \( y = 3x + b \):  
\( 10 = 3 \cdot 6 + b \)  
\( 10 = 18 + b \)  
\( b = 10 - 18 \)  
\( b = -8 \)  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the values \( m = 1 \) and \( b = -8 \) satisfy the condition that the lines intersect at \( (6, 10) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( m = 1 \) and \( b = -8 \) back into both line equations and check if \( (6, 10) \) lies on both lines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the first line \( y = mx + 4 \) with \( m = 1 \):  
\( y = 1 \cdot x + 4 = x + 4 \)  
At \( x = 6 \):  
\( y = 6 + 4 = 10 \)  
This satisfies \( (6, 10) \).

For the second line \( y = 3x + b \) with \( b = -8 \):  
\( y = 3x - 8 \)  
At \( x = 6 \):  
\( y = 3 \cdot 6 - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10 \)  
This satisfies \( (6, 10) \).

Both lines pass through \( (6, 10) \), confirming the values are correct.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( b + m \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values \( m = 1 \) and \( b = -8 \) to calculate \( b + m \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( b + m = -8 + 1 = -7 \)
