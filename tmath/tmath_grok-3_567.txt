### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( b + m \) for two lines defined by the equations \( y = mx + 4 \) and \( y = 3x + b \), which intersect at the point \( (6, 10) \). Since the lines intersect at \( (6, 10) \), the point satisfies both equations. We will use this information to determine the constants \( m \) and \( b \), then compute \( b + m \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( b + m \):  
1. Use the intersection point \( (6, 10) \) in the first line’s equation \( y = mx + 4 \) to find \( m \).  
2. Use the intersection point \( (6, 10) \) in the second line’s equation \( y = 3x + b \) to find \( b \).  
3. Compute the sum \( b + m \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( m \) by substituting the point \( (6, 10) \) into the first line’s equation \( y = mx + 4 \). This involves plugging in \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \), and solving for \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \) into \( y = mx + 4 \):  
\[ 10 = m \cdot 6 + 4 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ 10 - 4 = 6m \]  
\[ 6 = 6m \]  
Divide by 6:  
\[ m = 1 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find \( b \) by substituting the point \( (6, 10) \) into the second line’s equation \( y = 3x + b \). This involves plugging in \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \), and solving for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 6 \), \( y = 10 \) into \( y = 3x + b \):  
\[ 10 = 3 \cdot 6 + b \]  
Calculate \( 3 \cdot 6 \):  
\[ 10 = 18 + b \]  
Subtract 18 from both sides:  
\[ 10 - 18 = b \]  
\[ b = -8 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( b + m \) using the values of \( m \) and \( b \) obtained in previous steps. This involves adding the values of \( m \) and \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From previous steps, \( m = 1 \) and \( b = -8 \). Compute:  
\[ b + m = -8 + 1 = -7 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the lines \( y = mx + 4 \) and \( y = 3x + b \) with \( m = 1 \), \( b = -8 \) intersect at \( (6, 10) \), and that \( b + m = -7 \) is correct. This involves substituting \( m \) and \( b \) back into the equations and checking the intersection point.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- First line with \( m = 1 \): \( y = 1 \cdot x + 4 = x + 4 \). At \( x = 6 \):  
  \[ y = 6 + 4 = 10 \]  
  This gives \( (6, 10) \), which matches the given point.  
- Second line with \( b = -8 \): \( y = 3x - 8 \). At \( x = 6 \):  
  \[ y = 3 \cdot 6 - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10 \]  
  This also gives \( (6, 10) \), confirming the lines intersect at \( (6, 10) \).  
- Verify \( b + m \):  
  \[ b + m = -8 + 1 = -7 \]  
The calculations are consistent, and the intersection point is satisfied.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( b + m \) for the lines \( y = mx + 4 \) and \( y = 3x + b \) intersecting at \( (6, 10) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find \( m \) using the first line’s equation and the point \( (6, 10) \). (Completed: \( m = 1 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Find \( b \) using the second line’s equation and the point \( (6, 10) \). (Completed: \( b = -8 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( b + m \). (Completed: \( b + m = -7 \))  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution by checking the intersection point and sum. (Completed: Verified)  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution is validated.

### Final Answer
The value of \( b + m \) is \( -7 \).
