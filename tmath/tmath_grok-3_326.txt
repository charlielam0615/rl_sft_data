**Problem Restatement**: Find all values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \), and express the solutions in simplest fractional form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \), break it into subgoals:
1. Handle the absolute value by considering two cases: \( x - 3 \geq 0 \) (i.e., \( x \geq 3 \)) and \( x - 3 < 0 \) (i.e., \( x < 3 \)).
2. Solve the resulting equations for each case.
3. Validate the solutions by checking if they satisfy the original equation.
4. Express the solutions in simplest fractional form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation for the case \( x \geq 3 \), where \( |x - 3| = x - 3 \).
Description: Set up the equation \( x - 3 = 2x + 4 \), solve for \( x \), and check if the solution satisfies \( x \geq 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x \geq 3 \), the equation becomes:
\[ x - 3 = 2x + 4 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ -3 = x + 4 \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ x = -7 \]
Since \( x = -7 < 3 \), this solution does not satisfy the condition \( x \geq 3 \). Thus, no valid solutions exist for this case.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation for the case \( x < 3 \), where \( |x - 3| = -(x - 3) \).
Description: Set up the equation \( -(x - 3) = 2x + 4 \), solve for \( x \), and check if the solution satisfies \( x < 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x < 3 \), the equation becomes:
\[ -(x - 3) = 2x + 4 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ -x + 3 = 2x + 4 \]
Add \( x \) to both sides:
\[ 3 = 3x + 4 \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ -1 = 3x \]
Divide by 3:
\[ x = -\frac{1}{3} \]
Since \( x = -\frac{1}{3} < 3 \), this solution satisfies the condition \( x < 3 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) by substituting it into the original equation.
Description: Substitute \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) into \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \):
Left side: \( \left| -\frac{1}{3} - 3 \right| = \left| -\frac{1}{3} - \frac{9}{3} \right| = \left| -\frac{10}{3} \right| = \frac{10}{3} \).
Right side: \( 2 \left( -\frac{1}{3} \right) + 4 = -\frac{2}{3} + \frac{12}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \).
Since \( \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \), the solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5

Action: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find all values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \( x \geq 3 \) (completed, no valid solutions).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x < 3 \) (completed, solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions (completed, \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid).
  - Subgoal 4: Express solutions in simplest fractional form (pending).
Current Goal: Express the solution in simplest fractional form.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Express the solution in simplest fractional form.
Description: Confirm that \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is in simplest fractional form and present the final answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is already in simplest fractional form, as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. Thus, the only solution to the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) is \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \).
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) is \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \).
