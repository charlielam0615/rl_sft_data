**Problem Statement**: Find all values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \), expressing the answers in simplest fractional form.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \), break it into subgoals based on the definition of the absolute value. The absolute value \( |x - 3| \) requires considering two cases: when \( x - 3 \geq 0 \) (i.e., \( x \geq 3 \)) and when \( x - 3 < 0 \) (i.e., \( x < 3 \)). Subgoals:  
1. Solve the equation for the case \( x \geq 3 \).  
2. Solve the equation for the case \( x < 3 \).  
3. Validate solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) for the case \( x \geq 3 \), where \( |x - 3| = x - 3 \). Set up and solve the resulting equation \( x - 3 = 2x + 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x \geq 3 \), the equation becomes:  
\[ x - 3 = 2x + 4 \]  
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:  
\[ -3 = x + 4 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ x = -7 \]  
Since \( x = -7 < 3 \), this solution does not satisfy the condition \( x \geq 3 \). Thus, no solutions exist for this case.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to solve \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) for the case \( x < 3 \), where \( |x - 3| = -(x - 3) = 3 - x \). Set up and solve the resulting equation \( 3 - x = 2x + 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x < 3 \), the equation becomes:  
\[ 3 - x = 2x + 4 \]  
Add \( x \) to both sides:  
\[ 3 = 3x + 4 \]  
Subtract 4 from both sides:  
\[ -1 = 3x \]  
Divide by 3:  
\[ x = -\frac{1}{3} \]  
Since \( x = -\frac{1}{3} < 3 \), this solution satisfies the condition for this case.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) by substituting it into the original equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) to ensure it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) into the left side:  
\[ |x - 3| = \left| -\frac{1}{3} - 3 \right| = \left| -\frac{1}{3} - \frac{9}{3} \right| = \left| -\frac{10}{3} \right| = \frac{10}{3} \]  
Substitute into the right side:  
\[ 2x + 4 = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{3} \right) + 4 = -\frac{2}{3} + \frac{12}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]  
Since \( \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \), the solution \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) for all values of \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \( x \geq 3 \) (completed, no valid solutions).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( x < 3 \) (completed, found \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate solutions (completed, \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution set.  
All subgoals have been addressed. The only valid solution is \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The only value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( |x - 3| = 2x + 4 \) is \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \).  
\[ \boxed{-\dfrac{1}{3}} \]
