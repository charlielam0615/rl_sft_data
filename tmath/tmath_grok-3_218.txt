### Problem Statement
We need to find the two distinct solutions, \( p \) and \( q \), to the equation \((x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63\), where \( p > q \), and compute the value of \( p - q \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify and solve the given equation to find the solutions \( x \).
2. Identify the two distinct solutions and label them as \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p > q \).
3. Compute the difference \( p - q \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify and solve the equation \((x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63\).
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side, move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation, and solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the left-hand side:
\[
(x-3)(x+3) = x^2 - 3^2 = x^2 - 9
\]
The equation becomes:
\[
x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63
\]
Move all terms to one side:
\[
x^2 - 9 - 21x + 63 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -21 \), \( c = 54 \):
\[
\text{Discriminant} = (-21)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 54 = 441 - 216 = 225
\]
\[
x = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{21 \pm 15}{2}
\]
Calculate the solutions:
\[
x_1 = \frac{21 + 15}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]
\[
x_2 = \frac{21 - 15}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]
The solutions are \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the solutions \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \) satisfy the original equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute each solution into the original equation \((x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63\) and check if both sides are equal.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 18 \):
- Left-hand side: \((18-3)(18+3) = 15 \cdot 21 = 315\)
- Right-hand side: \(21 \cdot 18 - 63 = 378 - 63 = 315\)
- \( 315 = 315 \), so \( x = 18 \) is valid.

For \( x = 3 \):
- Left-hand side: \((3-3)(3+3) = 0 \cdot 6 = 0\)
- Right-hand side: \(21 \cdot 3 - 63 = 63 - 63 = 0\)
- \( 0 = 0 \), so \( x = 3 \) is valid.

Both solutions satisfy the equation.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find \( p - q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are solutions to the equation and \( p > q \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the equation (completed: solutions are \( x = 18 \), \( x = 3 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \( p \) and \( q \) with \( p > q \).
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( p - q \).

Current Goal: Identify \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p > q \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p > q \).
How to Achieve: Compare the solutions \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \), and assign \( p \) to the larger value and \( q \) to the smaller value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solutions are \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \). Since \( 18 > 3 \), assign:
- \( p = 18 \)
- \( q = 3 \)
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \( p - q \).
How to Achieve: Subtract \( q \) from \( p \) using the values \( p = 18 \) and \( q = 3 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
p - q = 18 - 3 = 15
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \( p - q \) is \( 15 \).
