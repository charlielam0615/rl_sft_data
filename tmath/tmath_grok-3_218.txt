**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equation into a standard quadratic form.  
2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the two distinct solutions, \( p \) and \( q \).  
3. Identify which solution is \( p \) (the larger) and which is \( q \) (the smaller).  
4. Compute the difference \( p - q \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the given equation into a standard quadratic form.  
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side, move all terms to one side, and combine like terms to form a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[
(x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63
\]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\[
(x-3)(x+3) = x^2 - 9
\]  
So the equation becomes:  
\[
x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63
\]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[
x^2 - 9 - 21x + 63 = 0
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0
\]  
The equation is now in standard quadratic form: \( x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0 \) to find the two distinct solutions.  
How to Achieve: Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -21 \), and \( c = 54 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0 \):  
- Coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -21 \), \( c = 54 \).  
- Discriminant:  
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-21)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 54 = 441 - 216 = 225
\]  
- Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{-(-21) \pm \sqrt{225}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{21 \pm 15}{2}
\]  
- First solution:  
\[
x = \frac{21 + 15}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]  
- Second solution:  
\[
x = \frac{21 - 15}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]  
The solutions are \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal-Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find \( p - q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are the distinct solutions to the equation, and \( p > q \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation into quadratic form (completed: \( x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic to find solutions (completed: solutions are \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify \( p \) and \( q \) based on \( p > q \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( p - q \).  
Current Goal: Identify \( p \) and \( q \), where \( p > q \).  
From the solutions, \( 18 > 3 \), so let \( p = 18 \) and \( q = 3 \).

[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the difference \( p - q \).  
How to Achieve: Subtract \( q \) from \( p \) using the identified values \( p = 18 \) and \( q = 3 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( p = 18 \) and \( q = 3 \):  
\[
p - q = 18 - 3 = 15
\]

[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \) are solutions to the original equation and confirm the computation of \( p - q \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 18 \) and \( x = 3 \) into the original equation \((x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63\) and check if both sides are equal. Then verify the subtraction \( p - q \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Check \( x = 18 \):  
  Left-hand side:  
  \[
  (18 - 3)(18 + 3) = 15 \cdot 21 = 315
  \]  
  Right-hand side:  
  \[
  21 \cdot 18 - 63 = 378 - 63 = 315
  \]  
  \( 315 = 315 \), so \( x = 18 \) is a solution.  

- Check \( x = 3 \):  
  Left-hand side:  
  \[
  (3 - 3)(3 + 3) = 0 \cdot 6 = 0
  \]  
  Right-hand side:  
  \[
  21 \cdot 3 - 63 = 63 - 63 = 0
  \]  
  \( 0 = 0 \), so \( x = 3 \) is a solution.  

- Verify \( p - q \):  
  With \( p = 18 \) and \( q = 3 \), we computed:  
  \[
  p - q = 18 - 3 = 15
  \]  
  The solutions and computation are valid.

The value of \( p - q \) is \( 15 \).
