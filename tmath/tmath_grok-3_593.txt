### Problem Restatement
We have two spinners. The first spinner is divided into thirds, labeled with numbers 3, 4, and 5. The second spinner is divided into quarters, labeled with numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8. Each spinner is spun once, and we need to find the probability that the product of the two numbers obtained is even. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to calculate the probability of the product being even:
1. Identify the possible outcomes for each spinner.
2. Determine the total number of outcome pairs.
3. Identify which outcome pairs result in an even product.
4. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible outcomes for each spinner and the total number of outcome pairs. Achieve this by listing the numbers on each spinner and computing the total number of combinations.

- The first spinner has numbers: 3, 4, 5 (3 sections, each with equal probability 1/3).
- The second spinner has numbers: 5, 6, 7, 8 (4 sections, each with equal probability 1/4).
- Total outcome pairs = 3 (first spinner) × 4 (second spinner) = 12.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List the outcomes:
- First spinner: {3, 4, 5}
- Second spinner: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Total number of outcome pairs:
- Since each spinner is spun once, the total number of possible pairs is 3 × 4 = 12.
All pairs are equally likely, with each pair having a probability of (1/3) × (1/4) = 1/12.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify which outcome pairs result in an even product. Achieve this by listing all possible pairs and checking if their product is even (i.e., divisible by 2).

- A product is even if at least one of the numbers is even.
- First spinner numbers: 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd).
- Second spinner numbers: 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List all possible pairs and their products:
- (3, 5): 3 × 5 = 15 (odd)
- (3, 6): 3 × 6 = 18 (even)
- (3, 7): 3 × 7 = 21 (odd)
- (3, 8): 3 × 8 = 24 (even)
- (4, 5): 4 × 5 = 20 (even)
- (4, 6): 4 × 6 = 24 (even)
- (4, 7): 4 × 7 = 28 (even)
- (4, 8): 4 × 8 = 32 (even)
- (5, 5): 5 × 5 = 25 (odd)
- (5, 6): 5 × 6 = 30 (even)
- (5, 7): 5 × 7 = 35 (odd)
- (5, 8): 5 × 8 = 40 (even)

Favorable pairs (even product):
- (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 8)
Number of favorable pairs = 8.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the favorable pairs and ensure all pairs with even products are counted. Achieve this by re-checking the condition for an even product and confirming the count.

- A product is even if at least one number is even.
- Re-evaluate the pairs systematically.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-check pairs by considering the parity:
- First spinner: 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd).
- Second spinner: 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even).
- Even product occurs when:
  - First number is even (4) and second is anything: 4 × {5, 6, 7, 8} = 4 pairs.
  - First number is odd (3 or 5) and second is even (6 or 8): 
    - 3 × {6, 8} = 2 pairs.
    - 5 × {6, 8} = 2 pairs.
Total favorable pairs = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, confirming the previous count.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Calculate the probability that the product of the two spins is even.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible outcomes for each spinner (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine total number of outcome pairs (completed, 12 pairs).
  - Subgoal 3: Identify pairs with even products (completed, 8 pairs).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the count of favorable pairs (completed, confirmed 8 pairs).
  - Subgoal 5 (current): Calculate the probability using the ratio of favorable to total outcomes.

**Current Goal**: Compute the final probability as a fraction.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Achieve this by dividing the number of favorable pairs by the total number of pairs and expressing the result as a common fraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Total outcome pairs = 12.
- Favorable pairs (even product) = 8.
- Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 8/12 = 2/3 (simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4).
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final probability calculation. Achieve this by confirming the simplification and checking for alternative methods to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Confirm simplification: 8/12 = (8 ÷ 4)/(12 ÷ 4) = 2/3.
- Alternative method: Use probability of even numbers.
  - P(even from first spinner) = 1/3 (only 4 is even).
  - P(even from second spinner) = 2/4 = 1/2 (6 and 8 are even).
  - P(at least one even) = 1 - P(both odd).
  - P(both odd) = P(odd from first) × P(odd from second) = (2/3) × (2/4) = 4/12 = 1/3.
  - P(at least one even) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.
This matches the previous result, confirming the probability is 2/3.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that the product of the results of the two spins is even is **2/3**.
