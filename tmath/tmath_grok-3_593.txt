**Problem Restatement**: We have two spinners. The first spinner is divided into thirds, with sections labeled 3, 4, and 5. The second spinner is divided into quarters, with sections labeled 5, 6, 7, and 8. We need to find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from spinning each spinner once is an even number. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to solve for the probability of getting an even product. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify all possible outcomes when spinning both spinners.  
2. Determine the total number of outcomes.  
3. Identify the favorable outcomes where the product of the two numbers is even.  
4. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify all possible outcomes and total number of outcomes.  
Description: I will list all combinations of results from the first spinner (3, 4, 5) and the second spinner (5, 6, 7, 8) to determine the total number of possible outcomes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first spinner has 3 sections: 3, 4, 5.  
The second spinner has 4 sections: 5, 6, 7, 8.  
Since each spin is independent, the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sections on each spinner:  
3 × 4 = 12 possible outcomes.  
The outcomes are:  
(3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)  
(4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)  
(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Identify favorable outcomes where the product is even.  
Description: I will calculate the product for each outcome and determine which pairs result in an even number. A product is even if at least one of the numbers is even.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let's analyze each pair and check if the product is even:  
- (3,5): 3×5=15 (odd)  
- (3,6): 3×6=18 (even)  
- (3,7): 3×7=21 (odd)  
- (3,8): 3×8=24 (even)  
- (4,5): 4×5=20 (even)  
- (4,6): 4×6=24 (even)  
- (4,7): 4×7=28 (even)  
- (4,8): 4×8=32 (even)  
- (5,5): 5×5=25 (odd)  
- (5,6): 5×6=30 (even)  
- (5,7): 5×7=35 (odd)  
- (5,8): 5×8=40 (even)  

Favorable outcomes (even products): (3,6), (3,8), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8)  
Total favorable outcomes = 8.

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the product of the results from two spins is even.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all possible outcomes (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the total number of outcomes (Completed, total = 12).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify favorable outcomes where the product is even (Completed, favorable = 8).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the probability (Pending).  

Current Goal: Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of an even product.  
Description: I will compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes and express it as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Total number of outcomes = 12  
Number of favorable outcomes (even product) = 8  
Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 8/12  
Simplifying the fraction: 8/12 = 2/3  

Therefore, the probability that the product of the results of the two spins is an even number is 2/3.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the solution.  
Description: I will double-check the counting of total and favorable outcomes and confirm the calculation of the probability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Reconfirming total outcomes: 3 options from the first spinner and 4 from the second = 3×4=12 (correct).  
Reconfirming favorable outcomes: I listed 8 pairs with even products. Alternatively, a product is even if at least one number is even.  
- First spinner: 4 is even (1 out of 3).  
- Second spinner: 6 and 8 are even (2 out of 4).  
Probability of at least one even = 1 - probability both odd.  
- Probability first spinner odd: 2/3 (3 or 5).  
- Probability second spinner odd: 2/4 = 1/2 (5 or 7).  
- Probability both odd: (2/3) × (1/2) = 1/3.  
- Probability at least one even: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.  
This matches my earlier result of 8/12 = 2/3, confirming the solution is correct.
