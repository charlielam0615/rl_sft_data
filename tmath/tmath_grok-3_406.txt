**Problem Statement**: The greatest integer function, denoted as \([x]\), is defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). We need to find \([\pi - 4]\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \([\pi - 4]\), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the value of \(\pi - 4\).  
2. Determine the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\pi - 4\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the value of \(\pi - 4\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the approximate value of \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) and subtract 4. Perform the arithmetic to find the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), compute:  
\(\pi - 4 \approx 3.14159 - 4 = -0.85841\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\pi - 4\).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-0.85841\). This is the definition of the floor function \([x]\), which returns the largest integer \(\leq x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \(x = -0.85841\), the integers less than or equal to \(-0.85841\) are \(\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0\). The greatest among them is \(-1\).  
Thus, \([\pi - 4] = [-0.85841] = -1\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of \([\pi - 4] = -1\).  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that \(-1 \leq \pi - 4 < 0\), as the floor function \([x]\) returns the greatest integer such that \([x] \leq x\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
We have \(\pi - 4 \approx -0.85841\). Check the bounds:  
- Is \(-1 \leq -0.85841\)? Yes, since \(-1 < -0.85841\).  
- Is \(-0.85841 < 0\)? Yes, since \(-0.85841 < 0\).  
Thus, the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-0.85841\) is \(-1\), confirming \([\pi - 4] = -1\).

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \([\pi - 4]\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\pi - 4\). (Completed: \(\pi - 4 \approx -0.85841\))

  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result. (Completed: Confirmed \(-1 \leq -0.85841 < 0\))  
**Current Goal**: Completed (no further goals needed).  
**Final Answer**: \([\pi - 4] = -1\).
