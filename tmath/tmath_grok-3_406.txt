### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of the greatest integer function applied to \(\pi - 4\), denoted as \([\pi - 4]\). The greatest integer function \([x]\) is defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). Here, \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), and we need to compute \([\pi - 4]\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \([\pi - 4]\).  
1. Compute the expression \(\pi - 4\).  
2. Apply the greatest integer function to the result, finding the largest integer less than or equal to \(\pi - 4\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\pi - 4\). This can be achieved by using the approximate value of \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) and subtracting 4, then evaluating the numerical result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), compute:  
\[
\pi - 4 \approx 3.14159 - 4 = -0.85841
\]
The result of \(\pi - 4\) is approximately \(-0.85841\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the greatest integer function to \(\pi - 4 \approx -0.85841\). This involves finding the largest integer less than or equal to \(-0.85841\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The greatest integer function \([x]\) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\). For \(x = -0.85841\), we need the largest integer \(n\) such that \(n \leq -0.85841\). Since \(-0.85841\) is between \(-1\) and \(0\), the possible integers are \(-1, -2, -3, \ldots\). The largest integer satisfying \(n \leq -0.85841\) is \(-1\), because \(-1 \leq -0.85841\) and \(0 > -0.85841\).  
Thus, \([\pi - 4] = [-0.85841] = -1\).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of \([\pi - 4] = -1\). This can be achieved by confirming the computation of \(\pi - 4\) and ensuring the greatest integer function is applied correctly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute \(\pi - 4\) using a more precise value of \(\pi\) if needed, but \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) is sufficient for this purpose.  
\[
\pi - 4 \approx 3.14159 - 4 = -0.85841
\]
Since \(-1 \leq -0.85841 < 0\), the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-0.85841\) is \(-1\).  
To further validate, consider the bounds of \(\pi\). Since \(3.14 < \pi < 3.15\), we have:  
\[
3.14 - 4 = -0.86 \quad \text{and} \quad 3.15 - 4 = -0.85
\]
Thus, \(-0.86 < \pi - 4 < -0.85\). The greatest integer less than or equal to any number in \([-0.86, -0.85)\) is \(-1\), confirming \([\pi - 4] = -1\).

### Step 5: Track Goals

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \([\pi - 4]\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(\pi - 4\). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the greatest integer function to \(\pi - 4\). (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result. (Completed in Step 4)  
**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, and the result \([\pi - 4] = -1\) has been computed and validated.

### Final Answer
\[
[\pi - 4] = -1
