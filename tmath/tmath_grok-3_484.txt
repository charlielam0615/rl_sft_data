**Problem Statement**: Find the distance between the points (1,1) and (4,7) and express the answer in simplest radical form.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the distance between two points, break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for the distance between two points.  
2. Extract the coordinates of the given points.  
3. Apply the formula by substituting the coordinates.  
4. Simplify the resulting expression to simplest radical form.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the formula for the distance between two points. This can be achieved by recalling the distance formula for two points in a coordinate plane.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:  
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract the coordinates of the given points (1,1) and (4,7). This can be achieved by directly identifying the x and y values from the problem statement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The coordinates are:  
- Point 1: \((x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)\)  
- Point 2: \((x_2, y_2) = (4, 7)\)  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the distance formula by substituting the coordinates (1,1) and (4,7). This can be achieved by plugging the values into the formula and computing the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the distance formula \(d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\):  
\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36} = \sqrt{45}
\]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify \(\sqrt{45}\) to its simplest radical form. This can be achieved by factoring the number under the radical and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):  
\[
\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]  
The expression \(3\sqrt{5}\) is in simplest radical form.  
[/IMP]
