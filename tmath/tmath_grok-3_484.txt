**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the distance between (1,1) and (4,7) into subgoals:  
1. Identify the formula for the distance between two points.  
2. Substitute the coordinates into the formula.  
3. Simplify the expression to compute the distance.  
4. Ensure the result is in simplest radical form.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the formula for the distance between two points.  
How to Achieve: Recall the standard distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:  
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute the coordinates (1,1) and (4,7) into the distance formula.  
How to Achieve: Assign \((x_1, y_1) = (1,1)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (4,7)\), then plug these values into the formula \(d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \((x_1, y_1) = (1,1)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (4,7)\):  
\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36} = \sqrt{45}
\]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the expression \(\sqrt{45}\) to compute the distance in simplest radical form.  
How to Achieve: Factor 45 to identify perfect square factors, simplify the square root, and express the result in its simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify \(\sqrt{45}\):  
\[
\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]  
The distance is \(3\sqrt{5}\), which is in simplest radical form since 5 has no perfect square factors other than 1.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the computed distance \(3\sqrt{5}\).  
How to Achieve: Recompute the distance formula with the given points to confirm the arithmetic and simplification steps are correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
Points (1,1) and (4,7).  
\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36} = \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]  
The recomputed result matches \(3\sqrt{5}\), confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]
