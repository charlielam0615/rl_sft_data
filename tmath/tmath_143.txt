Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $ g(a) $ into $ f(x) $ to form the equation $ f(g(a)) = 8 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given that $ f(x) = x^2 + 8 $ and $ g(x) = x^2 - 4 $, we substitute $ g(a) $ into $ f(x) $:
$$
f(g(a)) = f(a^2 - 4)
$$
Now, substitute $ a^2 - 4 $ into $ f(x) $:
$$
f(a^2 - 4) = (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8
$$
We are given that $ f(g(a)) = 8 $, so:
$$
(a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 $ for $ a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Start with the equation:  
$$
(a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8
$$  
Subtract 8 from both sides:  
$$
(a^2 - 4)^2 = 0
$$  
Take the square root of both sides:  
$$
a^2 - 4 = 0
$$  
Solve for $ a^2 $:  
$$
a^2 = 4
$$  
Take the square root again:  
$$
a = \pm 2
$$  
Since $ a > 0 $, we discard $ a = -2 $ and accept:  
$$
a = 2
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution process for solving $ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 $ and ensuring $ a > 0 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Validity**: The substitution of $ g(a) $ into $ f(x) $ is correct:  
   $ f(g(a)) = (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 $.  
   The equation $ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 $ simplifies to $ (a^2 - 4)^2 = 0 $, which is valid.  

2. **Algebraic Steps**:  
   - Subtracting 8 from both sides: $ (a^2 - 4)^2 = 0 $ is correct.  
   - Taking square roots: $ a^2 - 4 = 0 $ is valid because $ \sqrt{0} = 0 $.  
   - Solving $ a^2 = 4 $: This yields $ a = \pm 2 $.  
   - Applying $ a > 0 $: Discarding $ a = -2 $ is logically consistent with the problem constraint.  

3. **Final Verification by Substitution**:  
   Plug $ a = 2 $ into $ g(x) $: $ g(2) = 2^2 - 4 = 0 $.  
   Then $ f(0) = 0^2 + 8 = 8 $, which matches the given $ f(g(a)) = 8 $.  

4. **Uniqueness of Solution**:  
   The equation $ (a^2 - 4)^2 = 0 $ has only one real solution ($ a^2 = 4 $), and the constraint $ a > 0 $ ensures uniqueness.  

All steps are mathematically valid, and the final answer satisfies the original equation and constraints.
