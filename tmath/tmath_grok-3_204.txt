**Problem Statement**: Find the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers. The positive difference means the absolute value of the difference between the two sums.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Identify the first 20 positive even integers and calculate their sum.  
2. Identify the first 15 positive odd integers and calculate their sum.  
3. Find the difference between the two sums and take the absolute value to ensure a positive result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers. To achieve this, identify the sequence of the first 20 positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ..., 40), recognize it as an arithmetic sequence, and use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \), where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first 20 positive even integers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 40.  
This is an arithmetic sequence with:  
- First term (\( a_1 \)) = 2  
- Last term (\( a_n \)) = 40 (since the \( n \)-th even integer is \( 2n \), so for \( n = 20 \), \( a_n = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \))  
- Number of terms (\( n \)) = 20  

Using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \]  
\[ S_{20} = \frac{20}{2}(2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420 \]  

Alternatively, the sum of the first \( n \) even integers can be derived as \( n(n+1) \):  
\[ S_{20} = 20 \cdot (20 + 1) = 20 \cdot 21 = 420 \]  

The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers. To achieve this, identify the sequence of the first 15 positive odd integers (1, 3, 5, ..., 29), recognize it as an arithmetic sequence, and use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence or the known formula for the sum of odd integers: \( S_n = n^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The first 15 positive odd integers are: 1, 3, 5, ..., 29.  
This is an arithmetic sequence with:  
- First term (\( a_1 \)) = 1  
- Last term (\( a_n \)) = 29 (since the \( n \)-th odd integer is \( 2n - 1 \), so for \( n = 15 \), \( a_n = 2 \cdot 15 - 1 = 29 \))  
- Number of terms (\( n \)) = 15  

Using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence:  
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \]  
\[ S_{15} = \frac{15}{2}(1 + 29) = \frac{15}{2} \cdot 30 = 15 \cdot 15 = 225 \]  

Alternatively, the sum of the first \( n \) odd integers is \( n^2 \):  
\[ S_{15} = 15^2 = 225 \]  

The sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is 225.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Find the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers (completed: sum = 420).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers (completed: sum = 225).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the positive difference between the two sums (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is:  
- Main goal: Find the positive difference between the sums.  
  - Subgoal 1: Sum of first 20 even integers = 420.  
  - Subgoal 2: Sum of first 15 odd integers = 225.  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the positive difference (current).  

The current goal is to compute the positive difference between 420 and 225.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers (420) and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers (225). To achieve this, subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum and take the absolute value to ensure the result is positive.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.  
The sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is 225.  
The difference is:  
\[ 420 - 225 = 195 \]  
The positive difference is the absolute value:  
\[ |420 - 225| = 195 \]  

The positive difference is 195.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations by rechecking the sums and the difference. This involves verifying the sequences, recalculating the sums using an alternative method if possible, and confirming the final difference.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Verify the sum of the first 20 positive even integers**:  
Sequence: 2, 4, 6, ..., 40 (20 terms).  
Using the formula for the sum of even integers: \( S = n(n+1) = 20 \cdot 21 = 420 \).  
Confirmed correct.  

**Verify the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers**:  
Sequence: 1, 3, 5, ..., 29 (15 terms).  
Using the formula for the sum of odd integers: \( S = n^2 = 15^2 = 225 \).  
Confirmed correct.  

**Verify the positive difference**:  
\[ 420 - 225 = 195 \]  
\[ |195| = 195 \]  
The calculation is consistent.  

The positive difference is validated as 195.

**Final Answer**: The positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is 195.
