### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify and calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
2. Identify and calculate the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers.  
3. Compute the difference between the two sums.  
4. Ensure the difference is positive by taking the absolute value if necessary.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.  
- **How to Achieve:** The first 20 positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 40. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a_1 = 2 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and number of terms \( n = 20 \). Use the arithmetic series sum formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \), where \( a_n \) is the last term.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is 2, 4, 6, ..., 40.  
- First term: \( a_1 = 2 \).  
- Last term: \( a_n = 2 \times 20 = 40 \).  
- Number of terms: \( n = 20 \).  
Using the formula \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \):  
\[ S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} (2 + 40) = 10 \times 42 = 420. \]  
The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers.  
- **How to Achieve:** The first 15 positive odd integers are 1, 3, 5, ..., 29. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a_1 = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and number of terms \( n = 15 \). Alternatively, recognize that the sum of the first \( n \) odd integers is \( n^2 \). Use this formula or the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is 1, 3, 5, ..., 29.  
- For the first \( n \) positive odd integers, the sum is \( n^2 \).  
- Here, \( n = 15 \), so the sum is \( 15^2 = 225 \).  
To confirm using the arithmetic series formula:  
- First term: \( a_1 = 1 \).  
- Last term: \( a_n = 1 + (15-1) \times 2 = 1 + 28 = 29 \).  
- Number of terms: \( n = 15 \).  
\[ S_{15} = \frac{15}{2} (1 + 29) = \frac{15}{2} \times 30 = 15 \times 15 = 225. \]  
The sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is 225.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the difference between the two sums and ensure it is positive.  
- **How to Achieve:** Subtract the sum of the first 15 odd integers from the sum of the first 20 even integers. Take the absolute value if necessary to ensure a positive difference.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Sum of the first 20 even integers: 420.  
- Sum of the first 15 odd integers: 225.  
- Difference: \( 420 - 225 = 195 \).  
Since 195 is positive, the positive difference is 195.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate the calculations to ensure correctness.  
- **How to Achieve:** Recheck the sums and difference using alternative methods or by verifying key steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Verify even integers sum:** The sequence 2, 4, ..., 40 can also be summed using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) even integers: \( n(n+1) \). For \( n = 20 \), \( 20 \times 21 = 420 \). This matches.  
- **Verify odd integers sum:** The sum of the first \( n \) odd integers is \( n^2 \). For \( n = 15 \), \( 15^2 = 225 \). This matches.  
- **Verify difference:** \( 420 - 225 = 195 \). The result is consistent.  
The calculations are valid.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers (completed: 420).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers (completed: 225).

  - Subgoal 4: Ensure the difference is positive (completed: 195 is positive).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the calculations (completed: calculations confirmed).  

**Current Goal:** The main goal is achieved, as all subgoals are completed, and the positive difference is 195.
