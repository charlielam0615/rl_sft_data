### Problem Restatement
We need to find all "cool" rectangles, defined as rectangles with integer side lengths where the area (in square units) equals twice the perimeter (in linear units). Then, we calculate the sum of all distinct possible areas of these rectangles.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Define the mathematical relationship for a cool rectangle using its area and perimeter.
2. Derive an equation based on the condition that the area equals twice the perimeter.
3. Find all integer side lengths that satisfy this equation.
4. Calculate the area for each valid rectangle.
5. Identify all distinct areas and compute their sum.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to define the mathematical relationship for a cool rectangle and derive the equation. This will be achieved by expressing the area and perimeter in terms of the rectangleâ€™s side lengths and setting up the condition that the area equals twice the perimeter.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the rectangle have integer side lengths \( l \) and \( w \), where \( l, w \geq 1 \). The area of the rectangle is \( A = l \cdot w \), and the perimeter is \( P = 2(l + w) \). According to the problem, a cool rectangle satisfies:

\[ A = 2P \]

Substituting the expressions for area and perimeter:

\[ l \cdot w = 2 \cdot 2(l + w) \]

\[ l \cdot w = 4(l + w) \]

This is the key equation defining a cool rectangle. To make it easier to work with, rearrange it:

\[ l \cdot w - 4l - 4w = 0 \]

Add 16 to both sides to facilitate factoring:

\[ l \cdot w - 4l - 4w + 16 = 16 \]

\[ (l - 4)(w - 4) = 16 \]

This equation suggests that \( l - 4 \) and \( w - 4 \) are integer factors of 16, which will help find possible values for \( l \) and \( w \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to find all integer side lengths \( l \) and \( w \) that satisfy \( (l - 4)(w - 4) = 16 \). This will be achieved by identifying all integer factor pairs of 16, computing corresponding \( l \) and \( w \), and ensuring they are positive integers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( (l - 4)(w - 4) = 16 \), let \( a = l - 4 \) and \( b = w - 4 \), where \( a \cdot b = 16 \). The integer factor pairs of 16 (including negative pairs, as they may yield positive \( l \) and \( w \)) are:

\[ (1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1) \]

For each pair \( (a, b) \), compute \( l = a + 4 \), \( w = b + 4 \), and check if \( l, w \geq 1 \):

1. \( (1, 16) \): \( l = 1 + 4 = 5 \), \( w = 16 + 4 = 20 \). Valid.
2. \( (2, 8) \): \( l = 2 + 4 = 6 \), \( w = 8 + 4 = 12 \). Valid.
3. \( (4, 4) \): \( l = 4 + 4 = 8 \), \( w = 4 + 4 = 8 \). Valid.
4. \( (8, 2) \): \( l = 8 + 4 = 12 \), \( w = 2 + 4 = 6 \). Valid (same as pair (2, 8) with swapped dimensions).
5. \( (16, 1) \): \( l = 16 + 4 = 20 \), \( w = 1 + 4 = 5 \). Valid (same as pair (1, 16)).
6. \( (-1, -16) \): \( l = -1 + 4 = 3 \), \( w = -16 + 4 = -12 \). Invalid (\( w < 1 \)).
7. \( (-2, -8) \): \( l = -2 + 4 = 2 \), \( w = -8 + 4 = -4 \). Invalid (\( w < 1 \)).
8. \( (-4, -4) \): \( l = -4 + 4 = 0 \), \( w = -4 + 4 = 0 \). Invalid (\( l, w < 1 \)).
9. \( (-8, -2) \): \( l = -8 + 4 = -4 \), \( w = -2 + 4 = 2 \). Invalid (\( l < 1 \)).
10. \( (-16, -1) \): \( l = -16 + 4 = -12 \), \( w = -1 + 4 = 3 \). Invalid (\( l < 1 \)).

The valid pairs, considering \( (l, w) \) and \( (w, l) \) as the same rectangle, are:

- \( (5, 20) \) or \( (20, 5) \)
- \( (6, 12) \) or \( (12, 6) \)
- \( (8, 8) \)

Verify each by checking \( l \cdot w = 4(l + w) \):

- For \( (5, 20) \): \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \), \( 4(5 + 20) = 4 \cdot 25 = 100 \). Satisfied.
- For \( (6, 12) \): \( 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \), \( 4(6 + 12) = 4 \cdot 18 = 72 \). Satisfied.
- For \( (8, 8) \): \( 8 \cdot 8 = 64 \), \( 4(8 + 8) = 4 \cdot 16 = 64 \). Satisfied.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate that no other integer solutions exist for \( l \cdot w = 4(l + w) \). This will be achieved by exploring alternative approaches, such as fixing one variable and solving for the other, to ensure all possible solutions have been found.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To confirm completeness, try solving \( l \cdot w = 4(l + w) \) by fixing \( w \) and solving for \( l \):

\[ l \cdot w = 4l + 4w \]

\[ l \cdot w - 4l = 4w \]

\[ l(w - 4) = 4w \]

\[ l = \frac{4w}{w - 4} \]

For \( l \) to be an integer, \( w - 4 \) must divide \( 4w \). Test positive integer values of \( w \geq 1 \), excluding \( w = 4 \) (as it makes the denominator zero):

- \( w = 5 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{5 - 4} = \frac{20}{1} = 20 \). Pair \( (20, 5) \).
- \( w = 6 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 6}{6 - 4} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \). Pair \( (12, 6) \).
- \( w = 8 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 8}{8 - 4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \). Pair \( (8, 8) \).
- \( w = 12 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 12}{12 - 4} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \). Pair \( (6, 12) \).
- \( w = 20 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{20 - 4} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \). Pair \( (5, 20) \).

For other values, check divisibility:

- \( w = 1 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 1}{1 - 4} = \frac{4}{-3} \). Not an integer.
- \( w = 2 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 2}{2 - 4} = \frac{8}{-2} = -4 \). Not positive.
- \( w = 3 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{3 - 4} = \frac{12}{-1} = -12 \). Not positive.
- \( w = 7 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 7}{7 - 4} = \frac{28}{3} \). Not an integer.
- \( w = 9 \): \( l = \frac{4 \cdot 9}{9 - 4} = \frac{36}{5} \). Not an integer.

Larger \( w \) yield similar results (e.g., \( w = 10 \): \( l = \frac{40}{6} \), not integer). Since \( l = \frac{4w}{w - 4} = 4 \cdot \frac{w}{w - 4} \), \( w - 4 \) must divide \( w \), which aligns with the factor pairs found earlier. This confirms the solutions \( (5, 20) \), \( (6, 12) \), and \( (8, 8) \) are complete.

- \( (5, 20) \): Area = \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \).
- \( (6, 12) \): Area = \( 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \).
- \( (8, 8) \): Area = \( 8 \cdot 8 = 64 \).

The distinct areas are: 64, 72, 100.
