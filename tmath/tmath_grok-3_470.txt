### Problem Restatement
We need to find all "cool" rectangles, defined as rectangles with integer side lengths where the area (in square units) equals twice the perimeter (in units). Then, we must compute the sum of all distinct possible areas of these rectangles.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Define the mathematical relationship for a cool rectangle using its area and perimeter.
2. Derive an equation based on the condition that the area equals twice the perimeter.
3. Find all integer side lengths that satisfy this equation.
4. Calculate the area for each valid rectangle.
5. Identify all distinct areas and compute their sum.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define the mathematical relationship for a cool rectangle and derive the equation.
How to Achieve: Let the rectangle have side lengths \( l \) and \( w \), both integers. The area is \( l \cdot w \), and the perimeter is \( 2(l + w) \). The condition states that the area equals twice the perimeter, so set up the equation \( l \cdot w = 2 \cdot 2(l + w) \). Simplify this equation to find relationships between \( l \) and \( w \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a rectangle with integer side lengths \( l \) and \( w \):
- Area = \( l \cdot w \)
- Perimeter = \( 2(l + w) \)
- Given condition: Area = 2 × Perimeter
\[
l \cdot w = 2 \cdot 2(l + w) = 4(l + w)
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
l \cdot w = 4(l + w)
\]
Rearrange to form a standard equation:
\[
l \cdot w - 4l - 4w = 0
\]
Add 16 to both sides to facilitate factoring:
\[
l \cdot w - 4l - 4w + 16 = 16
\]
\[
(l - 4)(w - 4) = 16
\]
Since \( l \) and \( w \) are positive integers (as they are side lengths), \( l - 4 \) and \( w - 4 \) are integers, and their product is 16. We need to find all positive integer pairs \( (l, w) \) that satisfy this equation.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find all integer side lengths \( l \) and \( w \) that satisfy \( (l - 4)(w - 4) = 16 \).
How to Achieve: List all factor pairs of 16, including negative pairs since \( l - 4 \) and \( w - 4 \) can be positive or negative integers. For each pair, compute \( l \) and \( w \), and ensure they are positive integers. Exclude cases where \( l = w \) if the problem interprets rectangles as having distinct side lengths, but since it’s not specified, consider all pairs and note symmetry later.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation is:
\[
(l - 4)(w - 4) = 16
\]
Find all integer factor pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( a \cdot b = 16 \), where \( a = l - 4 \) and \( b = w - 4 \). The factor pairs of 16 are:
\[
(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1)
\]
For each pair, compute \( l = a + 4 \), \( w = b + 4 \), and check if \( l \) and \( w \) are positive integers:

1. \( (a, b) = (1, 16) \):
   \[
   l = 1 + 4 = 5, \quad w = 16 + 4 = 20
   \]
   Pair: \( (l, w) = (5, 20) \)

2. \( (a, b) = (2, 8) \):
   \[
   l = 2 + 4 = 6, \quad w = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]
   Pair: \( (l, w) = (6, 12) \)

3. \( (a, b) = (4, 4) \):
   \[
   l = 4 + 4 = 8, \quad w = 4 + 4 = 8
   \]
   Pair: \( (l, w) = (8, 8) \)

4. \( (a, b) = (8, 2) \):
   \[
   l = 8 + 4 = 12, \quad w = 2 + 4 = 6
   \]
   Pair: \( (l, w) = (12, 6) \)

5. \( (a, b) = (16, 1) \):
   \[
   l = 16 + 4 = 20, \quad w = 1 + 4 = 5
   \]
   Pair: \( (l, w) = (20, 5) \)

Now consider negative pairs:

6. \( (a, b) = (-1, -16) \):
   \[
   l = -1 + 4 = 3, \quad w = -16 + 4 = -12
   \]
   \( w = -12 \) is not a positive integer, so discard.

7. \( (a, b) = (-2, -8) \):
   \[
   l = -2 + 4 = 2, \quad w = -8 + 4 = -4
   \]
   \( w = -4 \) is not a positive integer, so discard.

8. \( (a, b) = (-4, -4) \):
   \[
   l = -4 + 4 = 0, \quad w = -4 + 4 = 0
   \]
   \( l = 0 \) and \( w = 0 \) are not positive integers, so discard.

9. \( (a, b) = (-8, -2) \):
   \[
   l = -8 + 4 = -4, \quad w = -2 + 4 = 2
   \]
   \( l = -4 \) is not a positive integer, so discard.

10. \( (a, b) = (-16, -1) \):
    \[
    l = -16 + 4 = -12, \quad w = -1 + 4 = 3
    \]
    \( l = -12 \) is not a positive integer, so discard.

Valid pairs are:
\[
(5, 20), (6, 12), (8, 8), (12, 6), (20, 5)
\]
Note that \( (6, 12) \) and \( (12, 6) \), as well as \( (5, 20) \) and \( (20, 5) \), are reflections (since rectangles are symmetric under length-width swapping). We’ll address distinct rectangles later.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the side lengths satisfy the cool rectangle condition.
How to Achieve: For each pair \( (l, w) \), compute the area \( l \cdot w \) and perimeter \( 2(l + w) \), and check if \( l \cdot w = 4(l + w) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify each pair:

1. \( (l, w) = (5, 20) \):
   \[
   \text{Area} = 5 \cdot 20 = 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2(5 + 20) = 50
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot \text{Perimeter} = 2 \cdot 50 = 100
   \]
   \[
   100 = 100 \quad \text{(Satisfies)}
   \]

2. \( (l, w) = (6, 12) \):
   \[
   \text{Area} = 6 \cdot 12 = 72
   \]
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2(6 + 12) = 36
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot \text{Perimeter} = 2 \cdot 36 = 72
   \]
   \[
   72 = 72 \quad \text{(Satisfies)}
   \]

3. \( (l, w) = (8, 8) \):
   \[
   \text{Area} = 8 \cdot 8 = 64
   \]
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2(8 + 8) = 32
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot \text{Perimeter} = 2 \cdot 32 = 64
   \]
   \[
   64 = 64 \quad \text{(Satisfies)}
   \]

4. \( (l, w) = (12, 6) \):
   Same as \( (6, 12) \), satisfies.

5. \( (l, w) = (20, 5) \):
   Same as \( (5, 20) \), satisfies.

All pairs satisfy the condition.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the areas and identify all distinct areas.
How to Achieve: Compute the area \( l \cdot w \) for each pair. Since the problem asks for “different possible areas,” determine whether \( (l, w) \) and \( (w, l) \) produce distinct rectangles. If they are considered the same (due to rotational symmetry), use unique areas only once.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate areas:
- \( (5, 20) \): Area = \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \)
- \( (6, 12) \): Area = \( 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \)
- \( (8, 8) \): Area = \( 8 \cdot 8 = 64 \)
- \( (12, 6) \): Area = \( 12 \cdot 6 = 72 \)
- \( (20, 5) \): Area = \( 20 \cdot 5 = 100 \)

List of areas, including duplicates:
\[
100, 72, 64, 100, 100, 72
\]
Since the problem asks for “different possible areas” and rectangles with \( (l, w) \) and \( (w, l) \) are typically considered the same geometrically, take unique areas:
\[
64, 72, 100
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all distinct possible areas of cool rectangles.
  - Subgoal 1: Define the mathematical relationship (Completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Derive equation (Completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Find integer side lengths (Completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate areas (Completed).
  - Subgoal 5: Identify distinct areas (Completed).
  - Subgoal 6: Compute sum of distinct areas (Pending).

Current Goal: Compute the sum of distinct areas.

Summary: We’ve derived the equation \( (l - 4)(w - 4) = 16 \), found valid pairs \( (5, w20), (6, w12), (8, w8), (12, w6), (20, w5) \), verified they satisfy the cool rectangle condition, and identified distinct areas \( 64, 72, w100 \). The next step is to sum these areas.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
Action:1 [PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum of distinct areas.
How to Achieve: Add the distinct areas \( 64, 72, w \), and 100 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the distinct areas:
\[
64 + 72 + 100 = 236
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the final answer by rechecking the distinct areas and their sum.
How to Achieve: Recompute the areas, ensure all distinct areas are included, and verify the sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute areas for confirmation:
- \( (5, 20) \): Area = \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \)
- \( (6, 12) \): Area = 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \)
- \( (8, 8) \): Area = \( 8 \cdot 8 = 64 \)

Distinct areas (considering \( (l, w) \equiv (w, l) \)):
\[
64, 72, 100
\]
Sum:
\[
64 + 72 + 136 = 236
\]
The sum is consistent.
To ensure completeness, consider if other side lengths were missed. The factor pairs of 16 were exhaustively listed, and negative pairs were discarded as they produced non-positive integers. No additional pairs exist.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The sum of all distinct possible areas of the cool rectangles is:
\[
236
\]
