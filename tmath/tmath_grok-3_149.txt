**Problem Statement**: We need to find \( x \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \)), and express \( x \) as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), break it into subgoals:  
1. Understand the floor function and express \( x \) as \( x = n + f \), where \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \) is an integer and \( f \) is the fractional part (\( 0 \leq f < 1 \)).  
2. Substitute into the equation to form a simpler equation involving \( n \) and \( f \).  
3. Solve for \( f \) and determine possible values of \( n \).  
4. Combine \( n \) and \( f \) to find \( x \) as a common fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( x \) as \( x = n + f \), substitute into the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), and derive a relationship between \( n \) and \( f \). This will be achieved by substituting \( \lfloor x \rfloor = n \) and \( x = n + f \) into the given equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), let \( x = n + f \), where \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \) is an integer and \( 0 \leq f < 1 \). Since \( \lfloor x \rfloor = n \), the equation becomes:  
\[ n + (n + f) = \frac{13}{3} \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2n + f = \frac{13}{3} \]  
Solve for \( f \):  
\[ f = \frac{13}{3} - 2n \]  
Since \( f \) is the fractional part, we need \( 0 \leq f < 1 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine possible integer values of \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq f < 1 \), using the equation \( f = \frac{13}{3} - 2n \). This will be achieved by setting up the inequality \( 0 \leq \frac{13}{3} - 2n < 1 \) and solving for \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the previous step, we have:  
\[ f = \frac{13}{3} - 2n \]  
Since \( 0 \leq f < 1 \), set up the inequality:  
\[ 0 \leq \frac{13}{3} - 2n < 1 \]  
Break this into two parts:  
1. \( \frac{13}{3} - 2n \geq 0 \)  
\[ 2n \leq \frac{13}{3} \]  
\[ n \leq \frac{13}{6} \approx 2.1667 \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \leq 2 \).  
2. \( \frac{13}{3} - 2n < 1 \)  
\[ \frac{13}{3} - 1 < 2n \]  
\[ \frac{13}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{10}{3} < 2n \]  
\[ \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.3333 < 2n \]  
\[ n > \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \]  
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n > 1.6667 \), so \( n \geq 2 \).  
Combining both: \( n \geq 2 \) and \( n \leq 2 \), so \( n = 2 \).  
Now, substitute \( n = 2 \):  
\[ f = \frac{13}{3} - 2 \cdot 2 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{12}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \]  
Since \( 0 \leq \frac{1}{3} < 1 \), this is valid. Thus, \( x = n + f = 2 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) satisfies the original equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) into the equation and checking if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.3333 \), the floor is:  
\[ \lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{7}{3} \rfloor = 2 \]  
Substitute into the equation:  
\[ \lfloor x \rfloor + x = 2 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{13}{3} \]  
This matches the right-hand side, so \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) is a solution.  
To ensure completeness, consider other possible \( n \). Try \( n = 1 \):  
\[ f = \frac{13}{3} - 2 \cdot 1 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{6}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \]  
Since \( \frac{7}{3} > 1 \), this violates \( 0 \leq f < 1 \). Try \( n = 3 \):  
\[ f = \frac{13}{3} - 2 \cdot 3 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{18}{3} = -\frac{5}{3} \]  
Since \( -\frac{5}{3} < 0 \), this is also invalid. Thus, \( n = 2 \) is the only integer solution.
