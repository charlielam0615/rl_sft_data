**Problem Restatement**: We need to find \( x \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \)), and express \( x \) as a common fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = \frac{13}{3} \), break it into subgoals:  
1. Understand the floor function and rewrite the equation to isolate \( x \).  
2. Consider possible integer values for \( \lfloor \rfloor \) since it must be an integer.  
3. Solve for \( x \) for each possible value of \( \lfloor \rfloor \).  
4. Verify the solution is a common fraction form and satisfies the equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation to isolate \( x \) and identify constraints on \( \lfloor x \rfloor \).  
How to Achieve: Let \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), where \( n \) is an integer, and \( n \leq x < n+1 \). Substitute into the equation \( n + x = \frac{13}{3} \) to get \( x = \frac{13}{3} - n \). Then ensure \( n \leq x < n+1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), we have:  
\[ x = \frac{13 \rfloor - n \]  
We also know \( n \leq x < n+1 \). Substitute \( x = \frac{13}{3} - n \) into this inequality:  
\[ n \leq \frac{13}{3} - n < n+1 \]  
Since \( \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.333 \), try integer values for \( n \) around 4 (e.g., \( n=3, 4, 5 \)) to find which satisfy the condition.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Goal: Test possible values of \( n \) to find \( x \)).  
How to Achieve: For each integer \( n \), compute \( x = \frac{13}{3} - n \), and check if \( n \leq x < n+1 \). Then verify if \( \lfloor x \rfloor = n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Try \( n = 4 \):  
\[ x = \frac{13}{3} - 4 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{12}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]  
Check: \( 4 \leq \frac{1}{3} < 5 \). This is false since \( \frac{1}{3} < 4 \). Also, \( \lfloor \frac{1}{3} \rfloor = 0 \neq 4 \). So \( n=4 \) is invalid.  

Try \( n = 3 \):  
\[ x = \frac{13}{3} - 3 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{9}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333 \]  
Check: \( 3 \leq \frac{4}{3} < 4 \). This is false since \( \frac{4}{3} < 3 \). Also, \( \lfloor \frac{4}{3} \rfloor = 1 \neq 3 \). So \( n=3 \) is invalid.  

Try \( n = 2 \):  
\[ x = \frac{13}{3} - 2 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{6}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \]  
Check: \( 2 \leq \frac{7}{3} < 3 \). Since \( 2 \leq 2.333 < 3 \), this holds. Also, \( \lfloor \frac{7}{3} \rfloor = 2 \), which matches \( n=2 \).  

Verify: \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x = 2 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{13}{3} \). This satisfies the equation.  

Try \( n = 1 \):  
\[ x = \frac{13}{3} - 1 = \frac{13}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.333 \]  
Check: \( 1 \leq \frac{10}{3} < 2 \). This is false since \( \frac{10}{3} > 2 \). Also, \( \lfloor \frac{10}{3} \rfloor = 3 \neq 1 \). So \( n=1 \) is invalid.  

Higher or lower \( n \) (e.g., \( n=5 \), \( n=0 \)) yield \( x \) outside the range \( n \leq x < n+1 \). Thus, \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) is the candidate.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Goal: Confirm that \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) is the only solution and is a common fraction.  
How to Achieve: Recompute \( \lfloor x \rfloor + x \) using \( x = \frac{7}{3} \) and check if other \( n \) values were correctly ruled out. Ensure \( \frac{7}{3} \) is in simplest form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = \frac{7}{3} \):  
\[ \lfloor \frac{7}{3} \rfloor = 2, \quad 2 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{13}{3} \]  
This matches the equation. Check if \( \frac{7}{3} \) is in simplest form: Since 7 and 3 are coprime (no common factors other than 1), it is a common fraction.  

Reconfirm other \( n \):  
- \( n=4 \): \( x = \frac{1}{3} \), but \( \lfloor x \rfloor = 0 \), and \( 0 + \frac{1}{3} \neq \frac{13}{3} \).  
- \( n=3 \): \( x = \frac{4}{3} \), but \( \lfloor x \rfloor = 1 \), and \( 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \neq \frac{13}{3} \).  
- \( n=1 \): \( x = \frac{10}{3} \), but \( \lfloor x \rfloor = 3 \), and \( 3 + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{19}{3} \neq \frac{13}{3} \).  

Since \( \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.333 \), and \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is an integer, only \( n=2 \) satisfies both \( n \leq x < n+1 \) and the original equation.
