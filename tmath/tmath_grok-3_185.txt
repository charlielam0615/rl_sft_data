**Problem Restatement**: Given the complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \), where \( i^2 = -1 \), compute \( z^2 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To compute \( z^2 \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Square the complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \), i.e., compute \( (3 + 4i)^2 \).  
2. Expand the expression using the binomial formula or multiplication.  
3. Simplify the result, accounting for \( i^2 = -1 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( (3 + 4i)^2 \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply \( z = 3 + 4i \) by itself, expand the product, and simplify using \( i^2 = -1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( z^2 \):  
\[ z^2 = (3 + 4i)(3 + 4i) \]  
Expand using the distributive property:  
\[ (3 + 4i)(3 + 4i) = 3 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4i + 4i \cdot 3 + 4i \cdot 4i \]  
\[ = 9 + 12i + 12i + 16i^2 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ 9 + (12i + 12i) + 16i^2 = 9 + 24i + 16i^2 \]  
Since \( i^2 = -1 \):  
\[ 16i^2 = 16 \cdot (-1) = -16 \]  
Substitute:  
\[ 9 + 24i - 16 = (9 - 16) + 24i = -7 + 24i \]  
Thus, \( z^2 = -7 + 24i \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of \( z^2 = -7 + 24i \).  
How to Achieve: Recompute \( (3 + 4i)^2 \) using an alternative method (e.g., polar form) or check the arithmetic in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify using the arithmetic from Step 2:  
Recompute:  
\[ (3 + 4i)(3 + 4i) = 9 + 12i + 12i + 16i^2 = 9 + 24i + 16(-1) = 9 + 24i - 16 = -7 + 24i \]  
The arithmetic is consistent.  
Alternatively, use polar form:  
- Magnitude: \( |z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \).  
- Argument: \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(4/3) \).  
- \( z = 5 (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), so \( z^2 = 5^2 (\cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta) = 25 (\cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta) \).  
Converting back to rectangular form requires computing \( \cos 2\theta \) and \( \sin 2\theta \), but the arithmetic method is sufficient and matches, confirming \( z^2 = -7 + 24i \).

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( z^2 \) for \( z = 3 + 4i \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Square \( z = 3 + 4i \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Expand and simplify the expression. (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result. (Completed in Step 3)  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, with \( z^2 = -7 + 24i \). No further subgoals are needed.

**Final Answer**:  
\[ z^2 = -7 + 24i \]
