**Problem Statement**: Given the complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \), where \( i^2 = -1 \), compute \( z^2 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve for \( z^2 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Understand the structure of the complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \).
2. Compute \( z^2 = (3 + 4i)^2 \) by squaring the complex number.
3. Simplify the result using the property \( i^2 = -1 \).
4. Present the final answer in the standard form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Compute \( z^2 = (3 + 4i)^2 \).
How to Achieve: Square the complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \) by multiplying it by itself, i.e., \( (3 + 4i)(3 + 4i) \), using the distributive property, and simplify using \( i^2 = -1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To compute \( z^2 \):
\[
z^2 = (3 + 4i)(3 + 4i)
\]
Use the distributive property (FOIL method):
\[
(3 + 4i)(3 + 4i) = 3 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4i + 4i \cdot 3 + 4i \cdot 4i
\]
\[
= 9 + 12i + 12i + 16i^2
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
= 9 + 24i + 16i^2
\]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \):
\[
16i^2 = 16 \cdot (-1) = -16
\]
So:
\[
z^2 = 9 + 24i - 16 = (9 - 16) + 24i = -7 + 24i
\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the correctness of \( z^2 = -7 + 24i \).
How to Achieve: Recalculate \( z^2 \) using an alternative method (e.g., polar form) or check the computation steps for accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, recompute \( z^2 \) using the binomial formula for confirmation:
\[
(3 + 4i)^2 = 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4i + (4i)^2
\]
\[
= 9 + 24i + 16i^2
\]
\[
= 9 + 24i + 16(-1) = 9 + 24i - 16 = -7 + 24i
\]
The result matches the previous computation, confirming correctness.
Alternatively, check via polar form:
- Magnitude of \( z \): \( |z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \).
- Argument of \( z \): \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(4/3) \approx 0.927 \) radians.
- Polar form: \( z = 5 (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \).
- Square: \( z^2 = 5^2 (\cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta) = 25 (\cos 2\theta + i \sin 2\theta) \).
Converting back to rectangular form requires trigonometric evaluation, but the rectangular method is simpler and consistent, so we trust the result.

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Compute \( z^2 \) for \( z = 3 + 4i \).
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the complex number structure (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( z^2 = (3 + 4i)^2 \) (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify using \( i^2 = -1 \) (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 5: Present the final answer (to be completed).

Current Goal: Present the final answer in standard form.

The goals reflect the steps taken, with the computation and validation completed. The final step is to state the result clearly.
