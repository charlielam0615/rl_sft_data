### Problem Restatement
We are given the equation \( 3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x) \), where \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \), and \( h(x) \) are polynomials in \( x \). The degree of \( f(x) \) is 8, and the degree of \( h(x) \) is 9. We need to find the minimum possible degree of \( g(x) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the minimum possible degree of \( g(x) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand how the degrees of polynomials combine in the given equation.  
2. Determine the relationship between the degrees of \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \), and \( h(x) \).  
3. Identify the conditions that allow \( g(x) \) to have the smallest possible degree while satisfying the equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Determine the degree relationship in the equation \( 3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Analyze the degrees of the polynomials. Since \( f(x) \) has degree 8 and \( h(x) \) has degree 9, use polynomial degree rules to find the degree of \( g(x) \) by considering the leading terms of the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For polynomials \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) with degrees \( m \) and \( n \), the degree of their sum \( p(x) + q(x) \) is typically \( \max(m, n) \), unless the leading terms cancel out, in which case the degree may be lower. Scalar multiplication (e.g., \( 3 \cdot f(x) \)) does not change the degree.  

Let:  
- Degree of \( f(x) \) = 8, so degree of \( 3 \cdot f(x) \) = 8.  
- Degree of \( g(x) \) = \( k \), so degree of \( 4 \cdot g(x) \) = \( k \).  
- Degree of \( h(x) \) = 9.  

The equation is \( 3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x) \). The degree of the left-hand side is determined by \( \max(\text{degree of } 3 \cdot f(x), \text{degree of } 4 \cdot g(x)) = \max(8, k) \), unless cancellation occurs. Since the right-hand side \( h(x) \) has degree 9, we need:  
\[ \max(8, k) \geq 9 \]  
or the degree could be less than 9 if the leading terms of \( 3 \cdot f(x) \) and \( 4 \cdot g(x) \) cancel.  

- If \( k < 8 \), then \( \max(8, k) = 8 \), and the left-hand side has degree 8 (from \( 3 \cdot f(x) \)). For the equation to hold, the degree of \( h(x) = 9 \) requires cancellation to not reduce the degree below 9, which suggests \( k \) may need to be higher.  
- If \( k = 8 \), then \( \max(8, k) = 8 \), and cancellation of leading terms could adjust the degree.  
- If \( k \geq 9 \), then \( \max(8, k) = k \), and the degree of the left-hand side is \( k \). If \( k = 9 \), the degree matches \( h(x) \)'s degree 9 without cancellation.  

To find the *minimum* \( k \), test the smallest possible \( k \) that satisfies the degree of \( h(x) = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify if the degree of \( g(x) \) can be less than 9 while producing a degree 9 polynomial for \( h(x) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Examine the leading terms of \( 3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) \) to check if cancellation or degree adjustment allows \( k < 9 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Write the leading terms:  
- Let \( f(x) = a x^8 + \text{lower terms} \), so \( 3 \cdot f(x) = 3a x^8 + \text{lower terms} \).  
- Let \( g(x) = b x^k + \text{lower terms} \), so \( 4 \cdot g(x) = 4b x^k + \text{lower terms} \).  
- Let \( h(x) = c x^9 + \text{lower terms} \), with degree 9, so \( c \neq 0 \).  

The left-hand side is \( 3a x^8 + 4b x^k + \text{lower terms} \). We need the sum to have degree 9.  

- **Case 1: \( k = 9 \)**  
  \( g(x) = b x^9 + \text{lower terms} \), so \( 4 \cdot g(x) = 4b x^9 + \text{lower terms} \).  
  The leading term of the left-hand side is \( 4b x^9 \) (since degree 9 > 8), giving degree 9, which matches \( h(x) \). No cancellation is needed. This works for any \( b \neq 0 \).  

- **Case 2: \( k = 8 \)**  
  \( g(x) = b x^8 + \text{lower terms} \), so \( 4 \cdot g(x) = 4b x^8 + \text{lower terms} \).  
  The leading terms are \( 3a x^8 + 4b x^8 = (3a + 4b) x^8 \). For the sum to have degree 9, the coefficient \( 3a + 4b \neq 0 \), giving degree 8, which contradicts \( h(x) \)'s degree 9. If \( 3a + 4b = 0 \), the degree drops below 8, further contradicting degree 9. Thus, \( k = 8 \) is not possible.  

- **Case 3: \( k < 8 \)**  
  If \( k < 8 \), the leading term is \( 3a x^8 \), giving degree 8. This cannot produce a degree 9 polynomial unless higher-degree terms arise, which is not possible since \( k < 8 \).  

Thus, the smallest \( k \) that works is \( k = 9 \).

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track Goals: Update and list the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and confirm the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the minimum possible degree of \( g(x) \) such that \( 3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x) \), with \( \deg(f(x)) = 8 \), \( \deg(h(x)) = 9 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand polynomial degree rules in the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the degree relationship for \( g(x) \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the minimum degree of \( g(x) \) (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the minimum degree of \( g(x) \) is 9 and finalize the solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Finalize the minimum degree of \( g(x) \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Conclude based on previous validation that \( k = 9 \) is the smallest degree that satisfies the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the validation step, the minimum degree of \( g(x) \) is 9, as lower degrees (e.g., \( k = 8 \) or less) cannot produce a polynomial of degree 9 on the left-hand side without contradicting the degree of \( h(x) \).  

**Final Answer**: The minimum possible degree of \( g(x) \) is 9.
