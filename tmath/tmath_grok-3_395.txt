**Problem Statement**: Given the equation \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x)\), where \(f(x)\), \(g(x)\), and \(h(x)\) are polynomials in \(x\), with \(\deg(f(x)) = 8\) and \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\), find the minimum possible degree of \(g(x)\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to determine the minimum degree of \(g(x)\).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the relationship between the degrees of polynomials in the given equation.  
- Subgoal 2: Apply polynomial degree rules to express \(\deg(g(x))\) in terms of \(\deg(f(x))\) and \(\deg(h(x))\).  
- Subgoal 3: Determine the conditions under which \(\deg(g(x))\) is minimized while satisfying the equation.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution by considering polynomial degree properties and possible cancellations.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply polynomial degree rules to find the degree of \(g(x)\) that satisfies \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x)\), given \(\deg(f(x)) = 8\) and \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\). This will be achieved by analyzing the degree of the left-hand side and equating it to the degree of the right-hand side, considering the coefficients are non-zero constants.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For polynomials \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\), the degree of their sum \(\deg(p(x) + q(x))\) is typically the maximum of \(\deg(p(x))\) and \(\deg(q(x))\), unless the leading terms cancel out. In the equation \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x)\), the left-hand side is a sum of two polynomials: \(3 \cdot f(x)\), which has degree 8 (since the degree of a polynomial is unaffected by a non-zero constant multiplier like 3), and \(4 \cdot g(x)\), which has degree \(\deg(g(x))\). The right-hand side, \(h(x)\), has degree 9.  

Thus, the degree of the left-hand side, \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x)\), is:  
\[
\deg(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x)) = \max(\deg(3 \cdot f(x)), \deg(4 \cdot g(x))) = \max(8, \deg(g(x))).
\]  
Since this equals \(h(x)\), which has degree 9, we have:  
\[
\max(8, \deg(g(x))) = 9.
\]  
For the maximum to be 9, \(\deg(g(x))\) must be at least 9, because if \(\deg(g(x)) < 8\), then \(\max(8, \deg(g(x))) = 8\), which would make the degree of the left-hand side 8, not 9. If \(\deg(g(x)) = 8\), the degree of the left-hand side could be 8 (if no cancellation occurs) or less than 8 (if the leading terms of \(3 \cdot f(x)\) and \(4 \cdot g(x)\) cancel out), neither of which guarantees degree 9 unless specific conditions are met. To achieve degree 9 without relying on cancellation (which may not always occur), \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) is the simplest case.  

To explore the minimum, consider if \(\deg(g(x)) < 9\) is possible by allowing cancellation of higher-degree terms.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to investigate whether \(\deg(g(x))\) can be less than 9 by considering the possibility of leading term cancellation in \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x)\). This will be achieved by analyzing the leading terms and their coefficients to see if cancellation can produce a sum with degree 9.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let:  
- \(f(x) = a_m x^8 + \text{lower terms}\), where \(a_m \neq 0\) and \(\deg(f(x)) = 8\).  
- \(g(x) = b_n x^n + \text{lower terms}\), where \(b_n \neq 0\) and \(\deg(g(x)) = n\).  
- \(h(x) = c_9 x^9 + \text{lower terms}\), where \(c_9 \neq 0\) and \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\).  

Then:  
\[
3 \cdot f(x) = 3 a_m x^8 + \text{lower terms}, \quad 4 \cdot g(x) = 4 b_n x^n + \text{lower terms}.
\]  
The sum is:  
\[
3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = 3 a_m x^ DTS (x) + \text{lower terms} = c_9 x^9 + \text{lower terms}.
\]  
For the sum to have degree 9, the highest degree term on the left must be degree 9, which suggests \(\deg(4 \cdot g(x)) = n = 9\), so \(4 b_9 x^9\) contributes to the leading term. If \(n = 9\), the left-hand side’s leading term is \(4 b_9 x^9\), and equating to \(h(x)\) gives \(4 b_9 = c_9\), which is possible since \(b_9\) and \(c_9\) are constants.

Now, consider if \(n < 9\). If \(n = 8\), then:  
\[
3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = 3 a_m x^8 + 4 b_8 x^8 + \text{lower terms} = (3 a_m + 4 b_8) x^8 + \text{lower terms}.
\]  
The degree is 8 (or less if \(3 a_m + 4 b_8 = 0\)), which cannot equal 9. If \(n < 8\), the degree of \(4 \cdot g(x)\) is even lower, and the sum’s degree is at most 8, which contradicts \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\).  

Cancellation of higher terms (e.g., if \(n = 9\) and the \(x^9\) terms cancel) would reduce the degree below 9, which is not possible unless the coefficients are specifically chosen to cancel, but this is a special case and not the general minimum. Thus, \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) is necessary to consistently achieve \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the minimum possible degree of \(g(x)\) such that \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x) = h(x)\), with \(\deg(f(x)) = 8\) and \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand polynomial degree relationships (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply degree rules to find \(\deg(g(x))\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Check if \(\deg(g(x)) < 9\) is possible via cancellation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (current).  

**Current Goal**: Verify the solution that \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) is the minimum possible degree.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) is the minimum degree by confirming that lower degrees lead to contradictions or special cases that don’t generally hold. This will be achieved by testing the polynomial equation with \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) and ensuring consistency with the given degrees.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Assume \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\). Then \(4 \cdot g(x)\) has degree 9, and the left-hand side \(3 \cdot f(x) + 4 \cdot g(x)\) has degree \(\max(8, 9) = 9\), which matches \(\deg(h(x)) = 9\). The leading term of \(4 \cdot g(x)\) (i.e., \(4 b_9 x^9\)) ensures the sum has degree 9, as the degree 8 term from \(3 \cdot f(x)\) does not affect the leading term.

If \(\deg(g(x)) < 9\), say \(\deg(g(x)) = 8\), the left-hand side’s degree is at most 8, which cannot produce a degree 9 polynomial unless the degree 8 terms cancel to reveal a lower degree, but this still doesn’t yield degree 9. For cancellation to produce degree 9, \(\deg(g(x))\) must be 9 or higher, and any higher degree would not be minimal. Thus, \(\deg(g(x)) = 9\) is the minimum degree that consistently satisfies the equation.  

**Final Answer**: The minimum possible degree of \(g(x)\) is 9.
