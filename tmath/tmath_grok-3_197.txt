**Problem Restatement**: Solve for \( r \) in the equation \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\), and express the answer as a fraction.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator or cross-multiplying.  
2. Simplify the resulting equation to a polynomial form.  
3. Solve the polynomial equation for \( r \).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it does not make any denominator zero.  
5. Express the final answer as a fraction.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the fractions to simplify the equation.  
How to Achieve: Cross-multiply the two fractions to remove the denominators, resulting in a polynomial equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Cross-multiply the equation \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\):  
\((r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the polynomial equation obtained from cross-multiplication.  
How to Achieve: Expand both sides of the equation, combine like terms, and set the equation to zero.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand the left side: \((r+3)(r+1) = r^2 + r + 3r + 3 = r^2 + 4r + 3\).  
Expand the right side: \((r-1)(r-2) = r^2 - 2r - r + 2 = r^2 - 3r + 2\).  
Equate both sides: \(r^2 + 4r + 3 = r^2 - 3r + 2\).  
Subtract \( r^2 \) from both sides: \(4r + 3 = -3r + 2\).  
Add \( 3r \) to both sides: \(7r + 3 = 2\).  
Subtract 3 from both sides: \(7r = -1\).  
Solve for \( r \): \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( r = -\frac{1}{7} \) to ensure it is valid and does not make any denominator zero.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( r = -\frac{1}{7} \) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal. Also, confirm that the denominators are non-zero.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( r = -\frac{1}{7} \):  
Left side: \(\frac{-\frac{1}{7} + 3}{-\frac{1}{7} - 2} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} + \frac{21}{7}}{\-\frac{1}{7} - \frac{14}{7}} = \frac{\frac{20}{7}}{-\frac{15}{7}} = \frac{20}{7} \cdot \left(-\frac{7}{15}\right) = -\frac{20}{15} = -\frac{4}{3}\).  
Right side: \(\frac{-\frac{1}{7} - 1}{-\frac{1}{7} + 1} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} - \frac{7}{7}}{-\frac{1}{7} + \frac{7}{7}} = \frac{-\frac{8}{7}}{\frac{6}{7}} = -\frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{6} = -\frac{8}{6} = -\frac{4}{3}\).  
Both sides equal \(-\frac{4}{3}\), so the solution is correct.  
Check denominators: For \( r = -\frac{1}{7} \), \( r-2 = -\frac{1}{7} - 2 = -\frac{15}{7} \neq 0 \), and \( r+1 = -\frac{1}{7} + 1 = \frac{6}{7} \neq 0 \). No denominator is zero.
