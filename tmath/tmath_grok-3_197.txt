**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\), break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying.  
2. Simplify the resulting equation.  
3. Solve for \( r \).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it does not make any denominator zero.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Eliminate the fractions in \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-multiply the fractions to obtain a polynomial equation, as this removes the denominators and simplifies the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cross-multiply the equation \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\):  
\((r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2)\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the polynomial equation \((r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2)\).  
**How to Achieve**: Expand both sides of the equation, combine like terms, and set the equation equal to zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the left side:  
\((r+3)(r+1) = r^2 + r + 3r + 3 = r^2 + 4r + 3\).  
Expand the right side:  
\((r-1)(r-2) = r^2 - 2r - r + 2 = r^2 - 3r + 2\).  
Set the equation:  
\(r^2 + 4r + 3 = r^2 - 3r + 2\).  
Subtract \(r^2\) from both sides:  
\(4r + 3 = -3r + 2\).  
Add \(3r\) to both sides:  
\(7r + 3 = 2\).  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
\(7r = -1\).  
Solve for \(r\):  
\(r = -\frac{1}{7}\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\) to ensure it is valid and does not make any denominator zero.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\) into the original equation and check if both sides are equal. Also, confirm that the denominators are non-zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\) into the left side:  
\(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} + 3}{-\frac{1}{7} - 2} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} + \frac{21}{7}}{-\frac{1}{7} - \frac{14}{7}} = \frac{\frac{20}{7}}{-\frac{15}{7}} = \frac{20}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{-15} = -\frac{20}{15} = -\frac{4}{3}\).  
Substitute \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\) into the right side:  
\(\frac{r-1}{r+1} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} - 1}{-\frac{1}{7} + 1} = \frac{-\frac{1}{7} - \frac{7}{7}}{-\frac{1}{7} + \frac{7}{7}} = \frac{-\frac{8}{7}}{\frac{6}{7}} = -\frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{6} = -\frac{8}{6} = -\frac{4}{3}\).  
Both sides equal \(-\frac{4}{3}\), so the solution is correct.  
Check denominators:  
\(r-2 = -\frac{1}{7} - 2 = -\frac{15}{7} \neq 0\), and \(r+1 = -\frac{1}{7} + 1 = \frac{6}{7} \neq 0\).  
The solution is valid.
