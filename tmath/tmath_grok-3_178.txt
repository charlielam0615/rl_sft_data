**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( t(x) = \sqrt{3x + 1} \) and \( f(x) = 5 - t(x) \), compute \( t(f(5)) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( t(f(5)) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(5) \), which requires evaluating \( t(5) \) since \( f(x) = 5 - t(x) \).  
2. Use the result of \( f(5) \) as the input to \( t(x) \) to find \( t(f(5)) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(5) \).  
How to Achieve: Evaluate \( t(5) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 5 + 1} \), then compute \( f(5) = 5 - t(5) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( t(5) \):  
\[ t(5) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 5 + 1} = \sqrt{15 + 1} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]  
Now compute \( f(5) \):  
\[ f(5) = 5 - t(5) = 5 - 4 = 1 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( t(f(5)) \).  
How to Achieve: Use the result \( f(5) = 1 \) as the input to \( t(x) \), so compute \( t(1) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 1 + 1} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( t(f(5)) = t(1) \):  
\[ t(1) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 1 + 1} = \sqrt{3 + 1} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( t(f(5)) \).  
How to Achieve: Recalculate \( f(5) \) and \( t(f(5)) \) to ensure correctness and check the domain of \( t(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the domain of \( t(x) = \sqrt{3x + 1} \): The expression inside the square root must be non-negative, so \( 3x + 1 \geq 0 \), which gives \( x \geq -\frac{1}{3} \).  
- For \( t(5) \), \( x = 5 \geq -\frac{1}{3} \), so valid.  
- For \( t(1) \), \( x = 1 \geq -\frac{1}{3} \), so valid.  
Recalculate:  
\[ t(5) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]  
\[ f(5) = 5 - 4 = 1 \]  
\[ t(f(5)) = t(1) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]  
The calculations are consistent.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( t(f(5)) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(5) \). (Completed: \( f(5) = 1 \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( t(f(5)) \). (Completed: \( t(1) = 2 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the computation. (Completed: Calculations verified)  
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( t(f(5)) = 2 \)
