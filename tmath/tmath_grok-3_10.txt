**Problem Statement**: Solve the quadratic equation \(11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\) by completing the square to find the equivalent equation \((x + r)^2 = s\), and determine the value of \(r + s\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \(r + s\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form for completing the square.  
2. Complete the square to express the equation in the form \((x + r)^2 = s\).  
3. Identify the constants \(r\) and \(s\).  
4. Compute \(r + s\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the quadratic equation \(11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\) in a form suitable for completing the square. This involves dividing through by the leading coefficient and adjusting the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the equation \(11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\). Move the constant term to the right:  
\[11x^2 - 44x = 99\]  
Divide through by 11 to make the leading coefficient 1:  
\[x^2 - 4x = 9\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the square on \(x^2 - 4x = 9\) to express it as \((x + r)^2 = s\). This involves adding and subtracting the appropriate constant to form a perfect square trinomial on the left.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \(x^2 - 4x\), take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-4\), halve it to get \(-2\), and square it to get \(4\). Add and subtract 4 on the left:  
\[x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4 = 9\]  
Rewrite as:  
\[(x - 2)^2 - 4 = 9\]  
Add 4 to both sides:  
\[(x - 2)^2 = 13\]  
This matches the form \((x + r)^2 = s\), where \(x - 2 = x + (-2)\), so \(r = -2\) and \(s = 13\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \((x - 2)^2 = 13\) is equivalent to the original equation. Expand the derived equation and check if it matches \(11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\) after reversing the steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Expand \((x - 2)^2 = 13\):  
\[(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\]  
So:  
\[x^2 - 4x + 4 = 13\]  
Subtract 4:  
\[x^2 - 4x = 9\]  
Multiply by 11:  
\[11x^2 - 44x = 99\]  
Subtract 99:  
\[11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\]  
This matches the original equation, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals:  
- Main goal: Find \(r + s\) for the equation \((x + r)^2 = s\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the quadratic equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Complete the square to find \(r\) and \(s\) (completed, \(r = -2\), \(s = 13\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(r + s\) (current goal).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals shows that we have identified \(r = -2\) and \(s = 13\). The current goal is to compute \(r + s\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(r + s\) using the identified values \(r = -2\) and \(s = 13\). This involves simple arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate:  
\[r + s = -2 + 13 = 11\]  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \(r + s = 11\)
