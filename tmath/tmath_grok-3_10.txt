**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the constants \( r \) and \( s \) in the equivalent equation \( (x + r)^2 = s \), which Krzysztof derived by completing the square for the quadratic equation \( 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \). Then, we compute \( r + s \).

Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( r + s \), we need to:
1. Complete the square for \( 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \) to transform it into the form \( (x + r)^2 = s \).
2. Identify the constants \( r \) and \( s \) from the resulting equation.
3. Compute \( r + s \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Complete the square for \( 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \) to obtain \( (x + r)^2 = s \).
Description: Divide the equation by the leading coefficient, rewrite the quadratic expression to form a perfect square trinomial, and isolate the constant term to match the form \( (x + r)^2 = s \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the equation:
\[ 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \]

Move the constant term to the right:
\[ 11x^2 - 44x = 99 \]

Divide through by the leading coefficient 11:
\[ x^2 - 4x = 9 \]

To complete the square, take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-4\), halve it to get \(-2\), and square it to get \( 4 \). Add 4 to both sides:
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9 + 4 \]
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 13 \]

Rewrite to match \( (x + r)^2 = s \):
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 13 \] implies \( (x + (-2))^2 = 13 \).

Thus, \( r = -2 \) and \( s = 13 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that completing the square yields \( (x - 2)^2 = 13 \) and matches the original equation.
Description: Expand \( (x - 2)^2 = 13 \), transform it back to the standard quadratic form, and confirm it equals \( 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand \( (x - 2)^2 = 13 \):
\[ (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 13 \]
\[ x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]

Multiply through by 11 to match the original equation’s leading coefficient:
\[ 11(x^2 - 4x - 9) = 0 \]
\[ 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \]

This matches the original equation, confirming the solution is correct.

\[ r + s = -2 + 13 = 11 \]
