**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the area of a circle in a coordinate plane, given that points \( A(3,5) \) and \( B(7,10) \) are the endpoints of its diameter. The area should be expressed in terms of \( \pi \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the area of the circle, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the length of the diameter using the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \).  
2. Calculate the radius of the circle from the diameter.  
3. Use the radius to compute the area of the circle using the formula \( \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the length of the diameter.  
How to Achieve: Use the distance formula between points \( A(3,5) \) and \( B(7,10) \), given by \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \), to find the diameter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the distance between \( A(3,5) \) and \( B(7,10) \):  
\[  
\text{Diameter} = \sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (10 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}.  
\]  
The diameter of the circle is \( \sqrt{41} \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the radius of the circle.  
How to Achieve: Since the radius is half the diameter, divide the diameter \( \sqrt{41} \) by 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The diameter is \( \sqrt{41} \). Therefore, the radius is:  
\[  
r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2}.  
\]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the radius calculation.  
How to Achieve: Ensure the radius \( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \) is correct by checking the relationship between diameter and radius.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The radius is half the diameter. Given diameter \( \sqrt{41} \):  
\[  
r = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2}.  
\]  
This confirms the radius calculation is correct, as \( 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} = \sqrt{41} \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the area of the circle.  
How to Achieve: Use the area formula \( \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \), where \( r = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The radius squared is:  
\[  
r = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2}, \quad r^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{41}{4}.  
\]  
The area of the circle is:  
\[  
\text{Area} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot \frac{41}{4} = \frac{41 \pi}{4}.  
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management:  
- Main Goal: Find the area of the circle with diameter defined by points \( A(3,5) \) and \( B(7,10) \),) expressed in terms of \( \pi \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the diameter (Completed: Diameter = \sqrt{41} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the radius (Completed: Radius = \( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the area (Completed: Area = \( \frac{41 \pi}{4} \)).  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**

The area of the circle is \( \frac{41 \pi}{4} \) square units.

\[ \boxed{\dfrac{41\pi}{4}} \]
