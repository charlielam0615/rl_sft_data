The quadratic equation is given as $ x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 $, where $ A $ is a single-digit positive integer.  

To express the terms involving $ A $ more clearly, we interpret:  
- $ 1A $: This represents the two-digit number formed by the digits 1 and $ A $. For example, if $ A = 3 $, then $ 1A = 13 $.  
- $ A0 $: This represents the two-digit number formed by the digits $ A $ and 0. For example, if $ A = 3 $, then $ A0 = 30 $.  

Thus, the equation becomes:  
$$
x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0
$$

This is a standard quadratic equation in the form $ x^2 + bx + c = 0 $, where $ b = -(10 + A) $ and $ c = 10A $.  

We now aim to find for how many values of $ A $ (with $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $) the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions.

For the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $ to have integer solutions, the discriminant $ D $ must be a perfect square. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ is given by $ D = b^2 - 4ac $.  

For our equation, $ a = 1 $, $ b = -(10 + A) $, and $ c = 10A $. Substituting these into the formula for the discriminant:  
$$
D = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A) = (10 + A)^2 - 40A

Simplifying:  
$$
D = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100

[REVIEW]
For the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $ to have positive integer solutions, the discriminant $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ must be a perfect square, and the roots $ x $ must be positive integers. The roots of a quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ are given by the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
$$
Since $ a = 1 $, $ b = -(10 + A) $, and $ c = 10A $, the roots simplify to:  
$$
x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}

We must ensure both values of $ x $ are positive integers.

where $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $, and $ \sqrt{D} $ is an integer for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, as shown in the previous step.

1. **$ A = 1 $:**  
   - $ D = 81 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 9 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 1 $ — both are positive integers.

   - Roots: $ x = \frac{18 \pm 2}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 8 $ — both are positive integers.

[REVIEW]
We were asked to find how many values of $ A $, where $ A $ is a positive single digit, make the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 $ have positive integer solutions.

We interpreted the notation:
- $ 1A $ as $ 10 + A $
- $ A0 $ as $ 10A $

This transformed the equation into:
$$
x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0
$$

We analyzed the discriminant $ D $ of the quadratic equation:
$$
D = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A) = A^2 - 20A + 100
$$
We found that for each $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, the discriminant $ D $ is a perfect square.

We then computed the roots using the quadratic formula:
$$
x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$
and verified that for all $ A $ values, the roots are positive integers.

Thus, the number of valid $ A $ values is 9.
[/REVIEW]

We are given the quadratic equation:

$$
x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0
$$

where $ A $ is a **positive single-digit integer**. The notation $ 1A $ and $ A0 $ represents two-digit numbers, where $ A $ is the digit in the ones place. For example, if $ A = 2 $, then $ 1A = 12 $ and $ A0 = 20 $.

---

### Step 1: Rewriting the Equation

We convert the equation into a standard form using the digit representation:

- $ 1A = 10 + A $
- $ A0 = 10A $

So the equation becomes:

$$
x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0
$$

This is a quadratic equation in standard form $ x^2 + bx + c = 0 $, where:

- $ b = -(10 + A) $
- $ c = 10A $

---

### Step 2: Conditions for Integer Solutions

A quadratic equation has **integer solutions** if its discriminant is a **perfect square**.

The discriminant $ D $ is given by:

$$
D = b^2 - 4ac = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A)
$$

Simplify:

$$
D = (10 + A)^2 - 40A = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100
$$

We now check for which values $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $ the expression $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $ is a perfect square.

---

All discriminants are perfect squares.

### Step 4: Check for Positive Integer Roots

$$
x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$

All values of $ A $ from 1 to 9 yield **positive integer roots**.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

There are **9** values of $ A $ for which the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions.

[PLANNING]
The verification step involves confirming the correctness of the entire solution, including the interpretation of notation, the discriminant calculation, the perfect square check, and the root calculation. The goal is to ensure that the final answer of 9 is accurate and that no logical or computational errors were made.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Notation Interpretation**:  
   The problem uses $ 1A $ and $ A0 $ to denote two-digit numbers where $ A $ is a single-digit digit. This was correctly interpreted as $ 10 + A $ for $ 1A $ and $ 10A $ for $ A0 $. For example, if $ A = 3 $, then $ 1A = 13 $ and $ A0 = 30 $, which aligns with the equation $ x^2 - 13x + 30 = 0 $. This interpretation is consistent and valid.

2. **Discriminant Calculation**:  
   The discriminant was correctly computed as $ (10 + A)^2 - 40A $, which simplifies to $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $. This expression was evaluated for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, and the results were verified to be perfect squares. For example, when $ A = 1 $, the discriminant is $ 81 = 9^2 $, and when $ A = 9 $, the discriminant is $ 1 = 1^2 $. The arithmetic and logic here are correct.

3. **Perfect Square Check**:  
   For each $ A $, the expression $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $ was evaluated and confirmed to be a perfect square. The results (e.g., $ 81, 64, 49, \ldots $) match the expected perfect squares. This step is critical for ensuring that the roots are rational, and the verification shows no errors.

4. **Root Calculation and Positivity**:  
   The roots $ x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} $ were computed for each $ A $. All roots are integers (e.g., $ \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} = 10, 1 $ for $ A = 1 $), and all are positive. The logic for determining positivity is sound, as both roots are positive for all tested values of $ A $. This confirms that the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $.

5. **Final Conclusion**:  
   Since all steps are logically consistent and the calculations are verified, the conclusion that there are 9 valid values of $ A $ is correct. No errors or inconsistencies were found during the verification.

What to recall: The condition for the quadratic equation to have positive integer solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
For the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $ to have positive integer solutions, the discriminant $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ must be a perfect square, and the roots $ x $ must be positive integers. The roots of a quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ are given by the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
$$
Since $ a = 1 $, $ b = -(10 + A) $, and $ c = 10A $, the roots simplify to:  
$$
x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$
We must ensure both values of $ x $ are positive integers.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Verify that for each $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, the roots of the quadratic equation are positive integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For each $ A $, we compute the roots using the formula:  
$$
x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$  
where $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $, and $ \sqrt{D} $ is an integer for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, as shown in the previous step.  

We now compute the roots for each $ A $ and verify that they are positive integers:  

1. **$ A = 1 $:**  
   - $ D = 81 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 9 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 1 $ — both are positive integers.  

2. **$ A = 2 $:**  
   - $ D = 64 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 8 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{12 \pm 8}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 2 $ — both are positive integers.  

3. **$ A = 3 $:**  
   - $ D = 49 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 7 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{13 \pm 7}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 3 $ — both are positive integers.  

4. **$ A = 4 $:**  
   - $ D = 36 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 6 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{14 \pm 6}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 4 $ — both are positive integers.  

5. **$ A = 5 $:**  
   - $ D = 25 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 5 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{15 \pm 5}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 5 $ — both are positive integers.  

6. **$ A = 6 $:**  
   - $ D = 16 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 4 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{16 \pm 4}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 6 $ — both are positive integers.  

7. **$ A = 7 $:**  
   - $ D = 9 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 3 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{17 \pm 3}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 7 $ — both are positive integers.  

8. **$ A = 8 $:**  
   - $ D = 4 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 2 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{18 \pm 2}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 8 $ — both are positive integers.  

9. **$ A = 9 $:**  
   - $ D = 1 $, $ \sqrt{D} = 1 $  
   - Roots: $ x = \frac{19 \pm 1}{2} $ → $ x = 10 $, $ x = 9 $ — both are positive integers.  

Thus, for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, the quadratic equation has positive integer roots.

[REVIEW]
We were asked to find how many values of $ A $, where $ A $ is a positive single digit, make the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 $ have positive integer solutions.

We interpreted the notation:
- $ 1A $ as $ 10 + A $
- $ A0 $ as $ 10A $

This transformed the equation into:
$$
x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0
$$

We analyzed the discriminant $ D $ of the quadratic equation:
$$
D = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A) = A^2 - 20A + 100
$$
We found that for each $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, the discriminant $ D $ is a perfect square.

We then computed the roots using the quadratic formula:
$$
x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$
and verified that for all $ A $ values, the roots are positive integers.

Thus, the number of valid $ A $ values is 9.
[/REVIEW]

We are given the quadratic equation:

$$
x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0
$$

where $ A $ is a **positive single-digit integer**. The notation $ 1A $ and $ A0 $ represents two-digit numbers, where $ A $ is the digit in the ones place. For example, if $ A = 2 $, then $ 1A = 12 $ and $ A0 = 20 $.

---

### Step 1: Rewriting the Equation

We convert the equation into a standard form using the digit representation:

- $ 1A = 10 + A $
- $ A0 = 10A $

So the equation becomes:

$$
x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0
$$

This is a quadratic equation in standard form $ x^2 + bx + c = 0 $, where:

- $ b = -(10 + A) $
- $ c = 10A $

---

### Step 2: Conditions for Integer Solutions

A quadratic equation has **integer solutions** if its discriminant is a **perfect square**.

The discriminant $ D $ is given by:

$$
D = b^2 - 4ac = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A)
$$

Simplify:

$$
D = (10 + A)^2 - 40A = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100
$$

We now check for which values $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $ the expression $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $ is a perfect square.

---

### Step 3: Compute Discriminant for Each $ A $

We compute $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ for each value of $ A $ from 1 to 9:

| $ A $ | $ A^2 $ | $ -20A $ | $ +100 $ | Total $ D $ | $ \sqrt{D} $ | Is perfect square? |

| 3      | 9        | -60        | +100       | **49**         | 7              | ✅                  |

| 5      | 25       | -100       | +100       | **25**         | 5              | ✅                  |

| 7      | 49       | -140       | +100       | **9**          | 3              | ✅                  |

All discriminants are perfect squares.

### Step 4: Check for Positive Integer Roots

We now compute the roots for each $ A $ using the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$

Let’s compute the roots for each $ A $ and verify they are positive integers.

| $ A $ | $ 10 + A $ | $ \sqrt{D} $ | Roots $ \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} $ | Integer? | Positive? |

All values of $ A $ from 1 to 9 yield **positive integer roots**.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

There are **9** values of $ A $ for which the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions.

[PLANNING]
The verification step involves confirming the correctness of the entire solution, including the interpretation of notation, the discriminant calculation, the perfect square check, and the root calculation. The goal is to ensure that the final answer of 9 is accurate and that no logical or computational errors were made.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Notation Interpretation**:  
   The problem uses $ 1A $ and $ A0 $ to denote two-digit numbers where $ A $ is a single-digit digit. This was correctly interpreted as $ 10 + A $ for $ 1A $ and $ 10A $ for $ A0 $. For example, if $ A = 3 $, then $ 1A = 13 $ and $ A0 = 30 $, which aligns with the equation $ x^2 - 13x + 30 = 0 $. This interpretation is consistent and valid.

2. **Discriminant Calculation**:  
   The discriminant was correctly computed as $ (10 + A)^2 - 40A $, which simplifies to $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $. This expression was evaluated for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $, and the results were verified to be perfect squares. For example, when $ A = 1 $, the discriminant is $ 81 = 9^2 $, and when $ A = 9 $, the discriminant is $ 1 = 1^2 $. The arithmetic and logic here are correct.

3. **Perfect Square Check**:  
   For each $ A $, the expression $ A^2 - 20A + 100 $ was evaluated and confirmed to be a perfect square. The results (e.g., $ 81, 64, 49, \ldots $) match the expected perfect squares. This step is critical for ensuring that the roots are rational, and the verification shows no errors.

4. **Root Calculation and Positivity**:  
   The roots $ x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} $ were computed for each $ A $. All roots are integers (e.g., $ \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} = 10, 1 $ for $ A = 1 $), and all are positive. The logic for determining positivity is sound, as both roots are positive for all tested values of $ A $. This confirms that the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $.

5. **Final Conclusion**:  
   Since all steps are logically consistent and the calculations are verified, the conclusion that there are 9 valid values of $ A $ is correct. No errors or inconsistencies were found during the verification.

\boxed{correct}
[/VERIFY]
[PLANNING]
Since the solution has been verified and all steps are consistent and accurate, there is no need for further reasoning or computation. The final answer is already confirmed to be correct.
[/PLANNING]

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

[PLANNING]
The backward subgoaling process involves working **from the final conclusion** backward to verify that all prior steps logically lead to that result. In this case, our final conclusion is that **there are 9 values of $ A $ for which the quadratic equation has positive integer solutions**. We will verify that this conclusion follows from:  
1. The correct interpretation of the problem's notation.  
2. The accurate computation of the discriminant.  
3. The confirmation that the discriminant is a perfect square for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $.  
4. The computation of roots for each $ A $ and the confirmation that they are positive integers.  

This will ensure the logic of the solution is sound and consistent.
[/PLANNING]
---

### Final Step: Backward Subgoaling

#### **Conclusion**:  
There are **9 values of $ A $** for which the quadratic equation $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $ has **positive integer solutions**.

#### **From the Conclusion to the Last Subgoal**:  
This conclusion is valid **only if** all the roots of the quadratic equation for each $ A $ are **positive integers**.  

Let’s look at the root formula again:  

$$
x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
$$

This yields two roots for each $ A $, and we must ensure both are **positive integers**.

From the previous verification, this was confirmed for all $ A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} $. For example:  
- For $ A = 1 $: $ x = \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} = 10, 1 $  
- For $ A = 9 $: $ x = \frac{19 \pm 1}{2} = 10, 9 $  

All such pairs are valid positive integers.

#### **From Root Calculation to the Discriminant**:  
The roots are integers **only if** the discriminant $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ is a **perfect square**.  

We verified this for each $ A $, and the results were:  
- $ A = 1 $: $ D = 81 = 9^2 $  
- $ A = 9 $: $ D = 1 = 1^2 $  

All values of $ D $ were confirmed to be perfect squares.

#### **From the Discriminant to the Equation**:  
The discriminant $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ was derived from the quadratic formula $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $, using the standard formula for the discriminant $ D = b^2 - 4ac $.  

- Here, $ b = -(10 + A) $, $ a = 1 $, and $ c = 10A $  
- So, $ D = (10 + A)^2 - 4(1)(10A) = A^2 - 20A + 100 $

This derivation is correct and consistent.

#### **From the Equation to the Notation**:  
The original problem uses the notation $ 1A $ and $ A0 $ to represent two-digit numbers with a single-digit $ A $.  
- $ 1A $ is interpreted as $ 10 + A $  
- $ A0 $ is interpreted as $ 10A $

These interpretations are consistent with standard place value notation and were used correctly in forming the quadratic equation.

### Final Self-Verification

Let’s summarize the backward subgoaling process:

1. **Final Conclusion**: 9 values of $ A $ yield positive integer solutions.  
   ✅ Confirmed by computing roots for each $ A $ and checking for positivity and integrality.

2. **Roots are Integers**:  
   ✅ Confirmed by showing $ x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} $ are integers for all $ A $.

3. **Discriminant is a Perfect Square**:  
   ✅ Confirmed by calculating $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $ and verifying it is a perfect square for all $ A $.

4. **Equation is Correctly Formed**:  
   ✅ The equation $ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 $ was derived from the problem's notation and is consistent.

5. **Notation Interpretation is Valid**:  
   ✅ $ 1A = 10 + A $, $ A0 = 10A $: standard and correct.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

The next step of reasoning is to finalize the solution by confirming that the backward subgoaling process has verified the correctness of all prior steps, and to present the final answer in a clear and concise manner.

[PLANNING]
The verification step will focus on confirming the correctness of the discriminant calculation, the root calculation for each value of A, and the conclusion that all 9 values of A result in positive integer roots. This involves rechecking the mathematical derivations and ensuring no arithmetic errors were made.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Discriminant Calculation**:  
   The discriminant $ D = (10 + A)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10A $ was simplified to $ D = A^2 - 20A + 100 $. This is correct because:  
   $$
   (10 + A)^2 - 40A = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100.
   $$

2. **Perfect Square Check**:  
   For $ A = 1 $ to $ 9 $, compute $ D $:  
   - $ A = 1 $: $ 1 - 20 + 100 = 81 = 9^2 $.  
   - $ A = 2 $: $ 4 - 40 + 100 = 64 = 8^2 $.  
   - $ A = 3 $: $ 9 - 60 + 100 = 49 = 7^2 $.  
   - $ A = 4 $: $ 16 - 80 + 100 = 36 = 6^2 $.  
   - $ A = 5 $: $ 25 - 100 + 100 = 25 = 5^2 $.  
   - $ A = 6 $: $ 36 - 120 + 100 = 16 = 4^2 $.  
   - $ A = 7 $: $ 49 - 140 + 100 = 9 = 3^2 $.  
   - $ A = 8 $: $ 64 - 160 + 100 = 4 = 2^2 $.  
   - $ A = 9 $: $ 81 - 180 + 100 = 1 = 1^2 $.  
   All $ D $ values are perfect squares, confirming the roots are rational.

3. **Root Calculation**:  
   The roots are $ x = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} $. For each $ A $:  
   - $ A = 1 $: $ \frac{11 \pm 9}{2} = 10, 1 $.  
   - $ A = 2 $: $ \frac{12 \pm 8}{2} = 10, 2 $.  
   - $ A = 3 $: $ \frac{13 \pm 7}{2} = 10, 3 $.  
   - $ A = 4 $: $ \frac{14 \pm 6}{2} = 10, 4 $.  
   - $ A = 5 $: $ \frac{15 \pm 5}{2} = 10, 5 $.
