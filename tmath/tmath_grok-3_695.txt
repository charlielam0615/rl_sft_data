### Problem Restatement
We need to calculate the probability that when flipping four distinct coins (a penny worth 1 cent, a nickel worth 5 cents, a dime worth 10 cents, and a quarter worth 25 cents) simultaneously, the total value of the coins that land on heads is at least 15 cents.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the probability:
1. Identify all possible outcomes of flipping four coins.
2. Determine the value of each outcome based on which coins land heads.
3. Identify outcomes where the total value of heads is at least 15 cents.
4. Calculate the probability by summing the probabilities of favorable outcomes.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify all possible outcomes of flipping four coins and their probabilities.  
**How to Achieve**: Each coin has two outcomes (heads or tails) with equal probability (1/2). For four coins, compute the total number of outcomes and assign probabilities.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Each coin (penny, nickel, dime, quarter) can either be heads (H) or tails (T), each with probability 1/2. Since there are four coins, the total number of outcomes is:

\[ 2^4 = 16 \]

Each outcome is equally likely, so the probability of any specific outcome (e.g., HHHH, HTHH) is:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \]

The outcomes can be listed as all combinations of H and T for the four coins (in order: penny, nickel, dime, quarter):
- TTTT, TTTH, TTHT, TTHH, THTT, THTH, THHT, THHH
- HTTT, HTTH, HTHT, HTHH, HHTT, HHTH, HHHT, HHHH
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the value of each outcome based on which coins land heads.  
**How to Achieve**: Assign values to each coin (penny = 1 cent, nickel = 5 cents, dime = 10 cents, quarter = 25 cents) and calculate the total value for heads in each outcome.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Define the coins:
- Penny = 1 cent (H contributes 1, T contributes 0)
- Nickel = 5 cents (H contributes 5, T contributes 0)
- Dime = 10 cents (H contributes 10, T contributes 0)
- Quarter = 25 cents (H contributes 25, T contributes 0)

Calculate the total value for each outcome (H = heads, T = tails, order: penny, nickel, dime, quarter):
- TTTT: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 cents
- TTTH: 0 + 0 + 0 + 25 = 25 cents
- TTHT: 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 = 10 cents
- TTHH: 0 + 0 + 10 + 25 = 35 cents
- THTT: 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 5 cents
- THTH: 0 + 5 + 0 + 25 = 30 cents
- THHT: 0 + 5 + 10 + 0 = 15 cents
- THHH: 0 + 5 + 10 + 25 = 40 cents
- HTTT: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 cent
- HTTH: 1 + 0 + 0 + 25 = 26 cents
- HTHT: 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 = 11 cents
- HTHH: 1 + 0 + 10 + 25 = 36 cents
- HHTT: 1 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 6 cents
- HHTH: 1 + 5 + 0 + 25 = 31 cents
- HHHT: 1 + 5 + 10 + 0 = 16 cents
- HHHH: 1 + 5 + 10 + 25 = 41 cents
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify outcomes where the total value of heads is at least 15 cents.  
**How to Achieve**: From the list of outcomes and their values, select those with a total value ≥ 15 cents.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, the outcomes with total value ≥ 15 cents are:
- TTTH: 25 cents
- TTHH: 35 cents
- THTH: 30 cents
- THHT: 15 cents
- THHH: 40 cents
- HTTH: 26 cents
- HTHH: 36 cents
- HHTH: 31 cents
- HHHT: 16 cents
- HHHH: 41 cents

There are 10 favorable outcomes.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Calculate the probability that the total value of coins landing heads is at least 15 cents.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all possible outcomes of flipping four coins (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the value of each outcome based on heads (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Identify outcomes with total value ≥ 15 cents (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the probability of favorable outcomes (pending).

**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability by summing the probabilities of favorable outcomes.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the probability of outcomes with total value ≥ 15 cents.  
**How to Achieve**: Sum the probabilities of the favorable outcomes identified in Step 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 4, there are 10 favorable outcomes, each with probability 1/16. The total number of outcomes is 16. Thus, the probability is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8} \]

Alternatively, compute as the sum of probabilities:

\[ 10 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8} \]

So, the probability is \( \frac{5}{8} \).

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated probability.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the list of favorable outcomes and confirm the total number of outcomes. Consider an alternative method to validate the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Check Favorable Outcomes**: Reconfirm the outcomes with value ≥ 15 cents:
- TTTH (25), TTHH (35), THTH (30), THHT (15), THHH (40), HTTH (26), HTHH (36), HHTH (31), HHHT (16), HHHH (41).
Count: 10 outcomes, which matches Step 4.

**Total Outcomes**: Four coins, each with 2 possibilities, give \( 2^4 = 16 \) outcomes, as calculated in Step 2.

**Alternative Method**: Consider the complement (value < 15 cents):
- TTTT (0), TTHT (10), THTT (5), HTTT (1), HTHT (11), HHTT (6).
Count: 6 outcomes.
Probability of complement = \( \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8} \).
Thus, probability of value ≥ 15 cents = \( 1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \).

Both methods agree, confirming the probability is \( \frac{5}{8} \).
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads is \( \frac{5}{8} \).
