Goal of this step: Derive the linear function $ f(x) $ using the given relationship $ f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $ f(x) $ is linear, let $ f(x) = ax + b $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are constants to be determined. 

The inverse of a linear function $ f(x) = ax + b $ is $ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{a} $, provided $ a \neq 0 $. 

From the given equation $ f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 $, substitute the expressions for $ f(x) $ and $ f^{-1}(x) $:
$$
ax + b = 4\left(\frac{x - b}{a}\right) + 6
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:
$$
ax + b = \frac{4x - 4b}{a} + 6
$$

Multiply both sides by $ a $ to eliminate the denominator:
$$
a(ax + b) = 4x - 4b + 6a
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:
$$
a^2x + ab = 4x - 4b + 6a
$$

Now equate the coefficients of $ x $ and the constant terms to solve for $ a $ and $ b $. First, match the coefficients of $ x $:
$$
a^2 = 4 \Rightarrow a = \pm 2
$$

Now, match the constant terms:
$$
ab = -4b + 6a
$$

Substitute $ a = 2 $ into the constant equation:
$$
2b = -4b + 12 \Rightarrow 6b = 12 \Rightarrow b = 2
$$

Now, verify that $ f(1) = 4 $ holds with $ a = 2 $ and $ b = 2 $:
$$
f(1) = 2(1) + 2 = 4
$$

This satisfies the given condition. Thus, the linear function is $ f(x) = 2x + 2 $.

Substitute $ x = 2 $ into the function $ f(x) = 2x + 2 $:  
$$
f(2) = 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6

Thus, $ f(2) = 6 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify that the derived function f(x) = 2x + 2 satisfies the original functional equation f(x) = 4f⁻¹(x) + 6 and that the computed f(2) = 6 is consistent.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Verify the functional equation**:  
   - Given f(x) = 2x + 2, the inverse function is f⁻¹(x) = (x - 2)/2.  
   - Compute 4f⁻¹(x) + 6:  
     $$
     4 \cdot \frac{x - 2}{2} + 6 = 2(x - 2) + 6 = 2x - 4 + 6 = 2x + 2
     $$  
     This matches f(x) = 2x + 2. The equation holds.  

2. **Verify f(1) = 4**:  
   Substituting x = 1 into f(x) = 2x + 2:  
   $$
   f(1) = 2(1) + 2 = 4
   $$  
   This satisfies the given condition.  

3. **Verify f(2) = 6**:  
   Substituting x = 2 into f(x) = 2x + 2:  
   $$
   f(2) = 2(2) + 2 = 6
   $$  
   This is consistent with the derived function.  

4. **Check alternative case (a = -2)**:  
   If a = -2, then f(x) = -2x + b. Using f(1) = 4 gives b = 6. The inverse function would be f⁻¹(x) = (x - 6)/(-2) = (-x + 6)/2. Substituting into the functional equation:  
   $$
   4f⁻¹(x) + 6 = 4 \cdot \frac{-x + 6}{2} + 6 = -2x + 12 + 6 = -2x + 18
   $$  
   This does not equal f(x) = -2x + 6. Thus, a = -2 is invalid.  

All critical steps are verified. The solution is logically consistent and satisfies all given conditions.
