### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2^8 = 16^x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving \( 2^8 = 16^x \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express 16 in terms of a power of 2, since both bases are related.  
2. Rewrite the equation with the same base.  
3. Equate the exponents to solve for \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express 16 as a power of 2 and rewrite the equation. This can be achieved by recognizing that 16 = 2^4, substituting this into the equation, and simplifying.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( 16 = 2^4 \), we can rewrite \( 16^x = (2^4)^x = 2^{4x} \).  
The original equation \( 2^8 = 16^x \) becomes:  
\[ 2^8 = 2^{4x} \].

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( x \) by equating the exponents, since the bases are the same. This involves setting the exponents equal and solving the resulting linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With \( 2^8 = 2^{4x} \), since the bases are identical, we equate the exponents:  
\[ 8 = 4x \].  
Solving for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \].  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = 2 \) by substituting it back into the original equation and checking if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( 2^8 = 16^x \):  
Left side: \( 2^8 = 256 \).  
Right side: \( 16^2 = (2^4)^2 = 2^8 = 256 \).  
Since \( 256 = 256 \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Solve \( 2^8 = 16^x \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express 16 as a power of 2 (completed: \( 16 = 2^4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Rewrite the equation with the same base (completed: \( 2^8 = 2^{4x} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Equate exponents to solve for \( x \) (completed: \( x = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: \( x = 2 \) satisfies the equation).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
**Final Answer**: \( x = 2 \).
