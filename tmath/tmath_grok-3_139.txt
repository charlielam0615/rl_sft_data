**Problem Statement**: Solve the equation \( 2^8 = 16^x \) for \( x \).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( 2^8 = 16^x \), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express both sides of the equation with the same base to simplify comparison.  
2. Equate the exponents to solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express both sides of the equation with the same base.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that \( 16 = 2^4 \), so rewrite \( 16^x \) as \( (2^4)^x \). Then, simplify and compare with \( 2^8 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( 16 = 2^4 \), we can rewrite \( 16^x \) as:  
\[ 16^x = (2^4)^x = 2^{4x} \]  
The equation becomes:  
\[ 2^8 = 2^{4x} \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Equate the exponents to solve for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Since the bases are the same (\( 2 \)), set the exponents equal to each other and solve the resulting linear equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
With \( 2^8 = 2^{4x} \), equate the exponents:  
\[ 8 = 4x \]  
Solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = 2 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 2 \):  
Left side: \( 2^8 = 256 \)  
Right side: \( 16^2 = (2^4)^2 = 2^8 = 256 \)  
Since \( 256 = 256 \), the solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( 2^8 = 16^x \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express both sides with the same base (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate exponents to solve for \( x \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved with \( x = 2 \).
