**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the coordinates of point \( C \) on segment \( AB \), where \( A \) has coordinates \((-1, 0)\), \( B \) has coordinates \((3, 8)\), and point \( C \) is three times as far from point \( A \) as it is from point \( B \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the coordinates of point \( C \).  
1. Determine the condition for point \( C \) being on segment \( AB \).  
2. Interpret the distance condition: the distance from \( C \) to \( A \) is three times the distance from \( C \) to \( B \).  
3. Set up equations based on the distance condition or use the section formula for points dividing a segment.  
4. Solve for the coordinates of \( C \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up equations to find the coordinates of point \( C \) using the section formula, as \( C \) divides segment \( AB \) such that the distance from \( C \) to \( A \) is three times the distance from \( C \) to \( B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( C \) is on segment \( AB \), use the section formula for a point dividing a segment in a given ratio. The distance condition suggests \( AC = 3 \cdot CB \), which implies \( C \) divides \( AB \) in the ratio \( CB : AC = 1 : 3 \). Apply the section formula to compute the coordinates of \( C \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Letâ€™s use the section formula. Suppose point \( C \) divides segment \( AB \) in the ratio \( m : n \), where \( CB : AC = 1 : 3 \). This means \( C \) is closer to \( B \), so the segment is divided such that the part from \( C \) to \( B \) is 1 part, and from \( C \) to \( A \) is 3 parts, giving the ratio \( m : n = 3 : 1 \) (since the section formula uses the ratio of the segments from the first point \( A \) to \( C \) and from \( C \) to \( B \)).

The section formula for a point dividing the segment joining \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \) in the ratio \( m : n \) is:

\[
C = \left( \frac{m x_2 + n x_1}{m + n}, \frac{m y_2 + n y_1}{m + n} \right)
\]

Here, \( A(-1, 0) \), \( B(3, 8) \), and the ratio \( m : n = 3 : 1 \) (where \( m = 3 \) corresponds to the segment toward \( B \), and \( n = 1 \) corresponds to the segment toward \( A \)).

- For the x-coordinate:
\[
x = \frac{3 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot (-1)}{3 + 1} = \frac{9 - 1}{4} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
\]

- For the y-coordinate:
\[
y = \frac{3 \cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 0}{3 + 1} = \frac{24 + 0}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
\]

Thus, the coordinates of point \( C \) are \( (2, 6) \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that point \( C(2, 6) \) satisfies the condition that the distance from \( C \) to \( A \) is three times the distance from \( C \) to \( B \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute the distances \( AC \) and \( CB \) using the distance formula and check if \( AC = 3 \cdot CB \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the distance \( AC \):
\[
AC = \sqrt{(2 - (-1))^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36} = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Calculate the distance \( CB \):
\[
CB = \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (8 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{(1)^2 + (2)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Check the condition:
\[
AC = 3\sqrt{5}, \quad CB = \sqrt{5}, \quad 3 \cdot CB = 3 \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]
Since \( AC = 3 \cdot CB \), the coordinates \( C(2, 6) \) satisfy the distance condition.
