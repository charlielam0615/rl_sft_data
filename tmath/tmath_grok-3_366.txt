### Problem Statement
We need to find the width \( w \) of a rectangular prism given its length \( l = 3 \), height \( h = 12 \), and diagonal length \( 13 \). The formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism is \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the width \( w \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Substitute the known values into the diagonal formula.  
2. Set up an equation based on the given diagonal length.  
3. Solve the equation for \( w \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the equation for the diagonal using the given values. Achieve this by substituting \( l = 3 \), \( h = 12 \), and the diagonal \( = 13 \) into the formula \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 13 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute the known values into the diagonal formula:  
\[ \sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = 13 \]  
Simplify the known terms:  
\[ 3^2 = 9, \quad 12^2 = 144 \]  
\[ \sqrt{9 + w^2 + 144} = 13 \]  
\[ \sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( \sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13 \) for \( w \). Achieve this by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root and then isolating \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Square both sides of the equation:  
\[ (\sqrt{w^2 + 153})^2 = 13^2 \]  
\[ w^2 + 153 = 169 \]  
Subtract 153 from both sides:  
\[ w^2 = 169 - 153 \]  
\[ w^2 = 16 \]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[ w = \sqrt{16} = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad w = -\sqrt{16} = -4 \]  
Since width is a physical dimension, discard the negative solution:  
\[ w = 4 \]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( w = 4 \) by substituting it back into the diagonal formula and checking if the result equals 13.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( l = 3 \), \( w = 4 \), and \( h = 12 \) into the diagonal formula:  
\[ \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \]  
The calculated diagonal equals the given diagonal, so \( w = 4 \) is valid.
