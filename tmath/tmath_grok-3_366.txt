**Problem Statement**: Given a rectangular prism with length \( l = 3 \), height \( h = 12 \), and a diagonal of length 13, find the width \( w \). The formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism is \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the width \( w \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Substitute the known values (\( l = 3 \), \( h = 12 \), diagonal = 13) into the diagonal formula.  
2. Set up an equation to solve for \( w \).  
3. Solve the equation to find the value of \( w \).  
4. Verify the solution to ensure it is valid.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Substitute the known values into the diagonal formula and set up an equation for \( w \).  
**How to Achieve**: Plug \( l = 3 \), \( h = 12 \), and diagonal = 13 into \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 13 \), then simplify to form an equation for \( w \).

[IMP]  
Substitute the values into the formula:  
\[ \sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = 13 \]  
Calculate the known terms:  
\[ 3^2 = 9, \quad 12^2 = 144 \]  
So:  
\[ \sqrt{9 + w^2 + 144} = 13 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ \sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13 \]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( \sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13 \) for \( w \).  
**How to Achieve**: Square both sides to eliminate the square root, isolate \( w^2 \), and solve for \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13 \]  
Square both sides:  
\[ w^2 + 153 = 13^2 \]  
\[ w^2 + 153 = 169 \]  
Isolate \( w^2 \):  
\[ w^2 = 169 - 153 \]  
\[ w^2 = 16 \]  
Take the square root:  
\[ w = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]  
Since width is a physical dimension, consider only the positive root: \( w = 4 \).

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( w = 4 \) satisfies the diagonal formula.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( l = 3 \), \( w = 4 \), and \( h = 12 \) back into the diagonal formula and check if the result equals 13.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( l = 3 \), \( w = 4 \), \( h = 12 \) into \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \):  
\[ l^2 = 3^2 = 9, \quad w^2 = 4^2 = 16, \quad h^2 = 12^2 = 144 \]  
\[ l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 9 + 16 + 144 = 169 \]  
\[ \sqrt{169} = 13 \]  
The calculated diagonal matches the given value of 13, so \( w = 4 \) is valid.

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the width \( w \) of the rectangular prism.  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute known values into the diagonal formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation for \( w \) (completed, \( w = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, solution valid).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the width has been found and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The width of the rectangular prism is \( w = 4 \).
