**Problem Statement**: Compute \( a - 2b \), where \( a = 4 - 2i \) and \( b = 3 + 2i \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( a - 2b \).  
Subgoals:  
1. Compute \( 2b \) by multiplying \( b = 3 + 2i \) by 2.  
2. Subtract the result of \( 2b \) from \( a = 4 - 2i \).  
3. Simplify the resulting complex number to the form \( x + yi \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( 2b \), where \( b = 3 + 2i \).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply both the real and imaginary parts of \( b \) by 2.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Given \( b = 3 + 2i \), compute \( 2b \):  
\[ 2b = 2 \cdot (3 + 2i) = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2i = 6 + 4i \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Subtract \( 2b \) from \( a \), where \( a = 4 - 2i \) and \( 2b = 6 + 4i \).  
**How to Achieve**: Perform complex number subtraction by subtracting the real and imaginary parts separately.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( a - 2b \):  
\[ a - 2b = (4 - 2i) - (6 + 4i) \]  
\[ = 4 - 6 + (-2i - 4i) \]  
\[ = (4 - 6) + (-2 - 4)i \]  
\[ = -2 - 6i \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the result \( -2 - 6i \) is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Recalculate \( a - 2b \) step-by-step to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- \( b = 3 + 2i \), so \( 2b = 2 \cdot (3 + 2i) = 6 + 4i \).  
- \( a = 4 - 2i \), so \( a - 2b = (4 - 2i) - (6 + 4i) = 4 - 6 + (-2i - 4i) = -2 - 6i \).  
The result matches, confirming \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( a - 2b \), where \( a = 4 - 2i \), \( b = 3 + 2i \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 2b \) (completed: \( 2b = 6 + 4i \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Subtract \( 2b \) from \( a \) (completed: \( -2 - 6i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify the result (completed: \( -2 - 6i \) is in \( x + yi \) form).  
- Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The result \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \) has been computed and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ a - 2b = -2 - 6i \]
