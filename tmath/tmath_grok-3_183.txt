**Problem Statement**: Compute \( a - 2b \), where \( a = 4 - 2i \) and \( b = 3 + 2i \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( a - 2b \):  
1. Substitute the given complex numbers \( a = 4 - 2i \) and \( b = 3 + 2i \) into the expression.  
2. Compute \( 2b \) by multiplying \( b \) by 2.  
3. Subtract \( 2b \) from \( a \).  
4. Simplify the result to the standard form of a complex number (\( x + yi \)).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 2b \), where \( b = 3 + 2i \).  
Description: Multiply the complex number \( b = 3 + 2i \) by 2 by distributing the scalar to both the real and imaginary parts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To compute \( 2b \):  
\[ 2b = 2 \cdot (3 + 2i) = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2i = 6 + 4i \]  
So, \( 2b = 6 + 4i \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( a - 2b \), using \( a = 4 - 2i \) and \( 2b = 6 + 4i \).  
Description: Subtract the complex number \( 2b \) from \( a \) by subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To compute \( a - 2b \):  
\[ a - 2b = (4 - 2i) - (6 + 4i) \]  
Distribute the subtraction:  
\[ = 4 - 2i - 6 - 4i \]  
Combine real parts: \( 4 - 6 = -2 \).  
Combine imaginary parts: \( -2i - 4i = -6i \).  
So, \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computation \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \).  
Description: Recompute the expression step-by-step to ensure accuracy and check if the result is in standard form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
1. Given \( a = 4 - 2i \), \( b = 3 + 2i \).  
2. Compute \( 2b \): \( 2 \cdot (3 + 2i) = 6 + 4i \).  
3. Compute \( a - 2b \): \( (4 - 2i) - (6 + 4i) = 4 - 6 - 2i - 4i = -2 - 6i \).  
The result matches: \( -2 - 6i \).  
The result is in standard form \( x + yi \), where \( x = -2 \), \( y = -6 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( a - 2b \), where \( a = 4 - 2i \), \( b = 3 + 2i \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 2b \) (completed: \( 2b = 6 + 4i \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( a - 2b \) (completed: \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed: result verified as \( -2 - 6i \)).  
Current Goal: None (computation complete).  
The final result is \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \).

**Final Answer**: \( a - 2b = -2 - 6i \)
