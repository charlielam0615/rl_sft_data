### Problem Restatement
We need to find the difference between the zeros of the quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), given its graph defined by the Asymptote code. The function is specified as \( g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \), with a vertex at \( (2, -4) \), and the zeros are at \( x = m \) and \( x = n \), where \( m > n \). We are tasked with computing \( m - n \). The solution must follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and formatting responses with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( m - n \), we need to identify the zeros of the quadratic function. Let’s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Extract the quadratic equation from the given function \( g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \).  
2. Convert it to standard form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).  
3. Find the zeros by solving \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
4. Identify which zero is \( m \) and which is \( n \) based on \( m > n \).  
5. Compute the difference \( m - n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to extract and convert the given function \( g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) into standard form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). This will be achieved by expanding the expression algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the function:  
\[ g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \]  
Expand \( (x-2)^2 \):  
\[ (x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]  
Multiply by 4:  
\[ 4(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 4x^2 - 16x + 16 \]  
Subtract 4:  
\[ 4x^2 - 16x + 16 - 4 = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \]  
Thus, the standard form is:  
\[ y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \]  
So, \( a = 4 \), \( b = -16 \), \( c = 12 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the standard form \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \) matches the given function by checking the vertex and a point on the graph, such as \( (4, 12) \). This ensures our expansion is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the vertex: The vertex form is \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \), so the vertex is at \( (2, -4) \). For the standard form \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \), find the x-coordinate of the vertex using \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \):  
\[ x = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]  
Evaluate at \( x = 2 \):  
\[ y = 4(2^2) - 16(2) + 12 = 4 \cdot 4 - 32 + 12 = 16 - 32 + 12 = -4 \]  
Vertex is \( (2, -4) \), which matches.  
Check point \( (4, 12) \):  
\[ y = 4(4^2) - 16(4) + 12 = 4 \cdot 16 - 64 + 12 = 64 - 64 + 12 = 12 \]  
This matches \( y = 12 \). The standard form is correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the zeros of the quadratic \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \) by solving \( 4x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0 \). This will be achieved by factoring the equation or using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve:  
\[ 4x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0 \]  
Divide by 4:  
\[ x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \]  
Factorize:  
\[ x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \]  
Roots are:  
\[ x = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3 \]  
The zeros are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). Since \( m > n \), assign \( m = 3 \), \( n = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the zeros \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) by substituting them into the original function \( g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) to confirm they yield \( y = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = 1 \):  
\[ g(1) = 4(1-2)^2 - 4 = 4(-1)^2 - 4 = 4 \cdot 1 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  
For \( x = 3 \):  
\[ g(3) = 4(3-2)^2 - 4 = 4(1)^2 - 4 = 4 \cdot 1 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  
Both satisfy \( g(x) = 0 \), confirming the zeros are correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( m - n \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are the zeros of the quadratic, and \( m > n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Extract and convert \( g(x) = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) to standard form. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the standard form using the vertex and a point. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the zeros by solving the quadratic equation. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the zeros using the original function. (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 5 (Current)**: Compute \( m - n \).  
The current goal is to compute \( m - n \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( m - n \), where \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 1 \). This will be achieved by subtracting \( n \) from \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ m - n = 3 - 1 = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result \( m - n = 2 \) by confirming the zeros align with the graph’s context and the condition \( m > n \). Additionally, consider an alternative method, such as the relationship between zeros and coefficients, to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Confirm \( m > n \): Since \( m = 3 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( 3 > 1 \), the assignment satisfies the condition.  
Alternative method: For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the zeros \( m \) and \( n \) satisfy:  
- Sum of zeros: \( m + n = -\frac{b}{a} \)  
- Product of zeros: \( mn = \frac{c}{a} \)  
From \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \), we have \( a = 4 \), \( b = -16 \), \( c = 12 \).  
- Sum: \( m + n = -\frac{-16}{4} = 4 \). Check: \( 3 + 1 = 4 \).  
- Product: \( mn = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \). Check: \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \).  
Both match, confirming the zeros.  
Now, compute the difference using the formula for the absolute difference of zeros:  
\[ |m - n| = \sqrt{(m + n)^2 - 4mn} = \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{16 - 12} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]  
Since \( m - n \) is positive (\( 3 - 1 = 2 \)), the result is \( m - n = 2 \).  
The graph’s context (zeros around the vertex at \( x = 2 \)) supports zeros at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and the computation \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) is consistent.

\[ m - n = 2 \]
