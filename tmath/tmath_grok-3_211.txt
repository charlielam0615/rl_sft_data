### Problem Statement
We need to find the difference between the zeros of the quadratic function given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where the zeros are at \( x = m \) and \( x = n \) with \( m > n \). The function is represented in the Asymptote code as \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \), and we are tasked with computing \( m - n \).

### Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Convert the given function \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) into standard quadratic form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).  
2. Find the zeros of the quadratic by solving \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
3. Identify the zeros \( m \) and \( n \) (with \( m > n \)) and compute \( m - n \).

### Step 2: Convert to standard form
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) into the standard quadratic form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). This will be achieved by expanding the expression algebraically.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \):  
\[ (x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \]  
\[ 4(x-2)^2 = 4(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 4x^2 - 16x + 16 \]  
\[ y = 4x^2 - 16x + 16 - 4 = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \]  
Thus, the quadratic in standard form is:  
\[ y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \]  
So, \( a = 4 \), \( b = -16 \), \( c = 12 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Verify the quadratic form
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the quadratic \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \) matches the given Asymptote graph, particularly by checking the vertex and a point on the graph.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The Asymptote code indicates the vertex at \( (2, -4) \) and a point at \( (4, 12) \).  
- **Vertex check**: For a quadratic \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
  \[ a = 4, b = -16 \]  
  \[ x = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]  
  Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \):  
  \[ y = 4(2)^2 - 16(2) + 12 = 4 \cdot 4 - 32 + 12 = 16 - 32 + 12 = -4 \]  
  Vertex is \( (2, -4) \), which matches.  
- **Point check**: Substitute \( x = 4 \):  
  \[ y = 4(4)^2 - 16(4) + 12 = 4 \cdot 16 - 64 + 12 = 64 - 64 + 12 = 12 \]  
  Point is \( (4, 12) \), which matches.  
The quadratic \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \) is consistent with the graph.

### Step 4: Find the zeros
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the zeros of the quadratic \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \) by solving \( 4x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0 \). This will be achieved by simplifying the equation and applying the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the equation:  
\[ 4x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0 \]  
Divide through by 4:  
\[ x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = 3 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 16 - 12 = 4 \]  
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm 2}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{4 + 2}{2} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1 \]  
The zeros are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).

### Step 5: Review goals and assign zeros
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( m - n \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are the zeros of the quadratic with \( m > n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert \( y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4 \) to standard form (completed: \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Verify the quadratic using the vertex and a point (completed: matches vertex \( (2, -4) \) and point \( (4, 12) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the zeros of the quadratic (completed: zeros at \( x = 1 \), \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( m - n \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Assign \( m \) and \( n \) (with \( m > n \)) and compute \( m - n \).  
Since \( m > n \), let \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 1 \).

### Step 6: Compute the difference
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( m - n \), where \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 1 \). This will be achieved by subtracting \( n \) from \( m \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ m - n = 3 - 1 = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validate the solution
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the zeros and the difference \( m - n = 2 \) by checking if the zeros satisfy the quadratic and confirm the order of \( m \) and \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Verify zeros in \( y = 4x^2 - 16x + 12 \):  
  For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ y = 4(1)^2 - 16(1) + 12 = 4 - 16 + 12 = 0 \]  
  For \( x = 3 \):  
  \[ y = 4(3)^2 - 16(3) + 12 = 4 \cdot 9 - 48 + 12 = 36 - 48 + 12 = 0 \]  
  Both \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) are zeros.  
- Confirm \( m > n \): Since \( m = 3 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( 3 > 1 \), the condition is satisfied.  
- Difference: \( m - n = 3 - 1 = 2 \), which is consistent.  
The solution is valid.

### Final Answer
The difference between the zeros \( m \) and \( n \) is:  
\[ \boxed{2} \]
