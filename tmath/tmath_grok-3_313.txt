### Problem Restatement
We are given two nonconstant geometric sequences: \( k, a_2, a_3 \) with common ratio \( r \) and \( k, b_2, b_3 \) with common ratio \( s \), where \( r \neq s \). The sequences satisfy the condition \( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \). We need to find the sum of the common ratios, \( r + s \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express \( a_2, a_3, b_2, b_3 \) in terms of \( k \), \( r \), and \( s \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( k, a_2, a_3 \) is a geometric sequence with common ratio \( r \), and \( k, b_2, b_3 \) is a geometric sequence with common ratio \( s \), use the definition of a geometric sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the sequence \( k, a_2, a_3 \):  
- First term: \( a_1 = k \).  
- Second term: \( a_2 = a_1 \cdot r = k \cdot r = kr \).  
- Third term: \( a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = kr \cdot r = kr^2 \).  

For the sequence \( k, b_2, b_3 \):  
- First term: \( b_1 = k \).  
- Second term: \( b_2 = b_1 \cdot s = k \cdot s = ks \).  
- Third term: \( b_3 = b_2 \cdot s = ks \cdot s = ks^2 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Substitute the expressions for \( a_2, a_3, b_2, b_3 \) into the given condition \( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the expressions derived in Step 2 and plug them into the equation, then simplify to form an equation involving \( r \) and \( s \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given: \( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \).  
Substitute:  
- \( a_3 = kr^2 \), \( b_3 = ks^2 \).  
- \( a_2 = kr \), \( b_2 = ks \).  

Left-hand side:  
\[ a_3 - b_3 = kr^2 - ks^2 = k(r^2 - s^2). \]  

Right-hand side:  
\[ a_2 - b_2 = kr - ks = k(r - s). \]  
\[ 3(a_2 - b_2) = 3 \cdot k(r - s) = 3k(r - s). \]  

So the equation becomes:  
\[ k(r^2 - s^2) = 3k(r - s). \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the equation \( k(r^2 - s^2) = 3k(r - s) \) to find a relationship between \( r \) and \( s \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since \( k \neq 0 \) (as the sequences are nonconstant), divide both sides by \( k \) and simplify the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Starting with:  
\[ k(r^2 - s^2) = 3k(r - s). \]  

Since \( k \neq 0 \), divide both sides by \( k \):  
\[ r^2 - s^2 = 3(r - s). \]  

Use the difference of squares: \( r^2 - s^2 = (r - s)(r + s) \).  
Substitute:  
\[ (r - s)(r + s) = 3(r - s). \]  

Since the sequences are nonconstant and have different common ratios, assume \( r \neq s \), so \( r - s \neq 0 \). Divide both sides by \( r - s \):  
\[ r + s = 3. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( r + s = 3 \) satisfies the equation and aligns with the problem constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( r + s = 3 \) back into the simplified equation and check if it holds. Also, ensure the solution respects that the sequences are nonconstant and have different common ratios.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 4, we have:  
\[ (r - s)(r + s) = 3(r - s). \]  
If \( r + s = 3 \), substitute:  
\[ (r - s) \cdot 3 = 3(r - s). \]  
This is an identity, true for all \( r - s \neq 0 \), which holds since \( r \neq s \).  

Additionally, check the original equation:  
\[ k(r^2 - s^2) = 3k(r - s). \]  
Since \( r^2 - s^2 = (r - s)(r + s) \), and \( r + s = 3 \), we get:  
\[ k(r - s)(3) = 3k(r - s), \]  
which is satisfied.  

The sequences are nonconstant (\( r \neq 1 \), \( s \neq 1 \)) and have different common ratios (\( r \neq s \)), and the solution \( r + s = 3 \) does not impose restrictions that violate these conditions.
