### Problem Statement
We need to find the polynomial \( g(x) \) given that \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \) and \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( g(x) \).  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the given equation \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \).  
- Subgoal 2: Substitute the given \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \) into the equation.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve for \( g(x) \) by isolating it.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \) into the equation \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \) and solve for \( g(x) \). This can be achieved by algebraic manipulation to isolate \( g(x) \).

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \) and \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \), substitute \( f(x) \):  
\[ (x^3 - 2x - 2) + g(x) = -2 + x \]  
Isolate \( g(x) \):  
\[ g(x) = (-2 + x) - (x^3 - 2x - 2) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ g(x) = -2 + x - x^3 + 2x + 2 \]  
\[ g(x) = -x^3 + (x + 2x) + (-2 + 2) \]  
\[ g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \) satisfies the original equation \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \). This can be achieved by substituting \( g(x) \) back into the equation and checking if the result holds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \) and \( g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \) into \( f(x) + g(x) \):  
\[ f(x) + g(x) = (x^3 - 2x - 2) + (-x^3 + 3x) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ = x^3 - x^3 - 2x + 3x - 2 \]  
\[ = x - 2 \]  
This matches the given expression \( -2 + x \), confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( g(x) \) such that \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \), given \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the given equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \( f(x) \) and solve for \( g(x) \) (completed, result: \( g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed, solution verified).  
**Current Goal**: No further goals remain, as the solution has been found and verified.

### Final Answer
The polynomial \( g(x) \) is:  
\[ g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \]
