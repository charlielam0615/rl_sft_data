**Problem Restatement**: Given two polynomials \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) such that \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \), and \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \), find \( g(x) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( g(x) \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the given equation \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \) to express \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \).  
2. Substitute the expression for \( f(x) \) into the equation.  
3. Simplify to isolate \( g(x) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( g(x) \) using the equation \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \). Achieve this by rearranging the equation to solve for \( g(x) \), i.e., \( g(x) = -2 + x - f(x) \), and then substitute \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \).

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \]  
Rearrange to solve for \( g(x) \):  
\[ g(x) = -2 + x - f(x) \]  
Substitute \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \):  
\[ g(x) = -2 + x - (x^3 - 2x - 2) \]  
Simplify:  
\[ g(x) = -2 + x - x^3 + 2x + 2 \]  
Combine like terms:  
- \( x \)-terms: \( x + 2x = 3x \)  
- Constant terms: \( -2 + 2 = 0 \)  
- \( x^3 \)-term: \( -x^3 \)  
Thus:  
\[ g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \) satisfies the condition \( f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x \). Achieve this by computing \( f(x) + g(x) \) and checking if the result equals \( -2 + x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( f(x) + g(x) \):  
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 \]  
\[ g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \]  
Add them:  
\[ f(x) + g(x) = (x^3 - 2x - 2) + (-x^3 + 3x) \]  
Combine like terms:  
- \( x^3 \)-terms: \( x^3 - x^3 = 0 \)  
- \( x \)-terms: \( -2x + 3x = x \)  
- Constant terms: \( -2 \)  
Thus:  
\[ f(x) + g(x) = x - 2 \]  
This matches the given expression \( -2 + x \). Therefore, \( g(x) = -x^3 + 3x \) is correct.
