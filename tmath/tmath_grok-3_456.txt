**Problem Restatement**: The sequence \(2, 7, 12, a, b, 27\) is arithmetic, meaning the difference between consecutive terms is constant. We need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and compute \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Determine the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  
2. Use the common difference to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).  
3. Calculate \(a + b\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  
How to Achieve: Calculate the difference between known consecutive terms (e.g., \(7 - 2\) and \(12 - 7\)) and verify consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the differences:  
- Second term minus first term: \(7 - 2 = 5\).  
- Third term minus second term: \(12 - 7 = 5\).  
Since both differences are equal, the common difference is \(5\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use the common difference to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).  
How to Achieve: Since the sequence is \(2, 7, 12, a, b, 27\), use the common difference \(5\) to find the fourth term (\(a\)), fifth term (\(b\)), and verify the sixth term (\(27\)). Alternatively, use the arithmetic sequence formula \(t_n = t_1 + (n-1)d\) to find the terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the common difference:  
- First term: \(2\).  
- Second term: \(2 + 5 = 7\).  
- Third term: \(7 + 5 = 12\).  
- Fourth term (\(a\)): \(12 + 5 = 17\).  
- Fifth term (\(b\)): \(17 + 5 = 22\).  
- Sixth term: \(22 + 5 = 27\), which matches the given sequence.  

Thus, \(a = 17\) and \(b = 22\).  

Alternatively, using the formula \(t_n = t_1 + (n-1)d\):  
- First term \(t_1 = 2\), common difference \(d = 5\).  
- Fourth term (\(n=4\)): \(t_4 = 2 + (4-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 15 = 17\).  
- Fifth term (\(n=5\)): \(t_5 = 2 + (5-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 20 = 22\).  
- Sixth term (\(n=6\)): \(t_6 = 2 + (6-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 25 = 27\), which confirms the sequence.  

So, \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the current path.  
How to Achieve: Verify that the sequence \(2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27\) is arithmetic by checking if the differences between all consecutive terms are equal to \(5\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check differences:  
- \(7 - 2 = 5\).  
- \(12 - 7 = 5\).  
- \(17 - 12 = 5\).  
- \(22 - 17 = 5\).  
- \(27 - 22 = 5\).  

All differences are \(5\), confirming the sequence is arithmetic and the values \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\) are correct.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate \(a + b\).  
How to Achieve: Add the values of \(a\) and \(b\) found in Step 3.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3, \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\).  
Calculate: \(a + b = 17 + 22 = 39\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(a + b\) for the arithmetic sequence \(2, 7, 12, a, b, 27\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the common difference (completed: \(d = 5\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) (completed: \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \(a + b\) (completed: \(a + b = 39\)).  

Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution process is complete, and the final answer is \(a + b = 39\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(a + b = 39\)
