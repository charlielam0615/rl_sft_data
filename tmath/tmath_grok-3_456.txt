**Problem Restatement**: The sequence \(2, 7, 12, a, b, 27\) is arithmetic. We need to find the value of \(a + b\).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(a + b\), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine the common difference of the arithmetic sequence using known terms.  
2. Use the common difference to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).  
3. Calculate \(a + b\).  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  
How to Achieve: In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Calculate the difference using the first three terms: \(7 - 2\) and \(12 - 7\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the differences:  
- Second term minus first term: \(7 - 2 = 5\).  
- Third term minus second term: \(12 - 7 = 5\).  
The common difference is \(5\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: List and organize the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the common difference (completed: common difference is 5).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the common difference to find \(a\) and \(b\) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \(a + b\).  
Current Goal: Use the common difference to find \(a\) and \(b\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Use the common difference to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).  
How to Achieve: Since the sequence is arithmetic with a common difference of 5, express each term relative to the first term. The sequence is \(2, 7, 12, a, b, 27\), corresponding to terms \(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6\). Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, \(t_n = t_1 + (n-1)d\), to find \(a = t_4\) and \(b = t_5\), and verify using \(t_6 = 27\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
- First term \(t_1 = 2\).  
- Common difference \(d = 5\).  
The \(n\)-th term is:  
\[ t_n = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 5 \]  

Calculate terms:  
- For \(t_4\) (\(n = 4\)):  
\[ t_4 = 2 + (4-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 3 \cdot 5 = 2 + 15 = 17 \]  
So, \(a = 17\).  

- For \(t_5\) (\(n = 5\)):  
\[ t_5 = 2 + (5-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 4 \cdot 5 = 2 + 20 = 22 \]  
So, \(b = 22\).  

Verify \(t_6\) (\(n = 6\)):  
\[ t_6 = 2 + (6-1) \cdot 5 = 2 + 5 \cdot 5 = 2 + 25 = 27 \]  
This matches the given term, confirming the calculations.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculated values for \(a\) and \(b\).  
How to Achieve: Verify that the sequence \(2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27\) is arithmetic by checking that the difference between consecutive terms is consistently 5.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check differences:  
- \(7 - 2 = 5\)  
- \(12 - 7 = 5\)  
- \(17 - 12 = 5\)  
- \(22 - 17 = 5\)  
- \(27 - 22 = 5\)  
All differences are 5, confirming the sequence is arithmetic and the values \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\) are correct.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate \(a + b\).  
How to Achieve: Add the values of \(a\) and \(b\) obtained from the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 4: \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\).  
Calculate:  
\[ a + b = 17 + 22 = 39 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Update and review the goal hierarchy, confirming completion.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(a + b\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the common difference (completed: common difference is 5).  
  - Subgoal 2: Use the common difference to find \(a\) and \(b\) (completed: \(a = 17\), \(b = 22\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate \(a + b\) (completed: \(a + b = 39\)).  
Current Goal: None (all goals completed).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**

The value of \(a + b\) is \(39\).
