**Problem Statement**: Find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the expansion of \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \).

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories, following the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the expansion of \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \).  

Subgoals:  
1. Identify the appropriate mathematical tool for finding the coefficient in a binomial expansion.  
2. Set up the binomial expansion for \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \).  
3. Determine the term in the expansion that corresponds to \( x^3 \).  
4. Calculate the coefficient of that term.  
5. Verify the calculation to ensure accuracy.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Identify the appropriate mathematical tool for finding the coefficient in a binomial expansion.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recognize that the binomial theorem is the standard method for expanding expressions of the form \( (a + b)^n \) and finding specific coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The binomial theorem states that for \( (a + b)^n \), the general term is given by:  
\[ T_{k+1} = \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \]  
For the expression \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \), we identify \( a = x \), \( b = 2\sqrt{3} \), and \( n = 7 \). This tool will allow us to find the term containing \( x^3 \) and its coefficient.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Set up the binomial expansion and identify the term corresponding to \( x^3 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Apply the binomial theorem to \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \), write the general term, and find the value of \( k \) that gives \( x^3 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \) is:  
\[ T_{k+1} = \binom{7}{k} x^{7-k} (2\sqrt{3})^k \]  
Simplify the term:  
\[ (2\sqrt{3})^k = 2^k (\sqrt{3})^k = 2^k \cdot 3^{k/2} \]  
So, the general term becomes:  
\[ T_{k+1} = \binom{7}{k} \cdot 2^k \cdot 3^{k/2} \cdot x^{7-k} \]  
To find the term with \( x^3 \), set the exponent of \( x \):  
\[ 7 - k = 3 \]  
\[ k = 4 \]  
Thus, the term corresponds to \( k = 4 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the coefficient of the term with \( x^3 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( k = 4 \) into the general term and compute the numerical coefficient.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( k = 4 \):  
\[ T_{4+1} = \binom{7}{4} x^{7-4} (2\sqrt{3})^4 \]  
\[ = \binom{7}{4} x^3 \cdot 2^4 \cdot (\sqrt{3})^4 \]  
Calculate each part:  
- Binomial coefficient:  
\[ \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{4! \cdot 3!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 35 \]  
- Power of 2:  
\[ 2^4 = 16 \]  
- Power of \( \sqrt{3} \):  
\[ (\sqrt{3})^4 = (3^{1/2})^4 = 3^2 = 9 \]  
So:  
\[ (2\sqrt{3})^4 = 2^4 \cdot (\sqrt{3})^4 = 16 \cdot 9 = 144 \]  
The coefficient is:  
\[ \binom{7}{4} \cdot (2\sqrt{3})^4 = 35 \cdot 144 = 35 \cdot (144) \]  
\[ 144 \cdot 35 = 144 \cdot (30 + 5) = 144 \cdot 30 + 144 \cdot 5 = 4320 + 720 = 5040 \]  
The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 5040.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the calculation to ensure the coefficient is correct.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recalculate the coefficient using an alternative method, such as expanding a few terms manually or checking the binomial formula application.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, recompute the coefficient for \( k = 4 \):  
General term:  
\[ T_{k+1} = \binom{7}{k} \cdot 2^k \cdot 3^{k/2} \cdot x^{7-k} \]  
For \( k = 4 \):  
\[ \binom{7}{4} = 35 \]  
\[ (2\sqrt{3})^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 = 16 \cdot 9 = 144 \]  
\[ 35 \cdot 144 = 5040 \]  
Alternatively, consider the structure:  
\[ (2\sqrt{3})^4 = (2 \cdot 3^{1/2})^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^{4/2} = 16 \cdot 9 = 144 \]  
The calculations are consistent.  
To further confirm, check a neighboring term, e.g., \( k = 3 \):  
\[ T_{3+1} = \binom{7}{3} x^4 (2\sqrt{3})^3 = 35 \cdot x^4 \cdot 8 \cdot 3^{3/2} \]  
This gives \( x^4 \), not \( x^3 \), confirming \( k = 4 \) is correct for \( x^3 \).  
The coefficient 5040 is consistent.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the binomial theorem as the tool (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up the binomial expansion and find the term with \( x^3 \) (completed, \( k = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the coefficient for \( k = 4 \) (completed, coefficient = 5040).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculation (completed, coefficient confirmed).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is 5040, and all steps have been validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \( x^3 \) in the expansion of \( (x + 2\sqrt{3})^7 \) is 5040.
