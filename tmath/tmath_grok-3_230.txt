### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the denominator of the left-hand side.  
2. Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying.  
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution by checking for domain restrictions and substituting back into the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the denominator of the left-hand side, \( 4x - 4 \).  
How to Achieve: Factor the denominator to identify any restrictions on \( x \) and simplify the expression if possible.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The denominator is \( 4x - 4 \). Factor it:  
\[ 4x - 4 = 4(x - 1) \]  
Thus, the original equation becomes:  
\[ \frac{3x - 1}{4(x - 1)} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
Note that \( x \neq 1 \), as the denominator cannot be zero when \( 4(x - 1) = 0 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying.  
How to Achieve: Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators to clear the fractions, ensuring to account for the domain restriction \( x \neq 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ \frac{3x - 1}{4(x - 1)} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
Cross-multiply by multiplying both sides by \( 4(x - 1) \cdot 3 \):  
Left side:  
\[ (3x - 1) \cdot 3 = 3(3x - 1) = 9x - 3 \]  
Right side:  
\[ \frac{2}{3} \cdot 4(x - 1) \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 4(x - 1) = 8(x - 1) = 8x - 8 \]  
This gives the equation:  
\[ 9x - 3 = 8x - 8 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the resulting linear equation \( 9x - 3 = 8x - 8 \) for \( x \).  
How to Achieve: Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[ 9x - 3 = 8x - 8 \]  
Subtract \( 8x \) from both sides:  
\[ 9x - 8x - 3 = -8 \]  
\[ x - 3 = -8 \]  
Add 3 to both sides:  
\[ x = -8 + 3 = -5 \]  
So, \( x = -5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x = -5 \) by checking the domain and substituting back into the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Ensure \( x = -5 \) does not make the denominator zero and substitute \( x = -5 \) into \( \frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4} = \frac{2}{3} \) to confirm equality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the domain: The denominator \( 4x - 4 = 4(x - 1) \) is zero when \( x = 1 \). Since \( x = -5 \neq 1 \), it is valid.  
Substitute \( x = -5 \):  
Left side:  
\[ \frac{3(-5) - 1}{4(-5) - 4} = \frac{-15 - 1}{-20 - 4} = \frac{-16}{-24} = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
Right side:  
\[ \frac{2}{3} \]  
Since \( \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \), the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Solve \( \frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4} = \frac{2}{3} \) for \( x \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve the linear equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the solution \( x = -5 \) has been verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( x = -5 \)
