**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \): \(\frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4} = \frac{2}{3}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation \(\frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4} = \frac{2}{3}\), break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the denominator \(4x - 4\).
2. Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying.
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \(x\).
4. Validate the solution by checking for restrictions and substituting back.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the denominator \(4x - 4\).
How to Achieve: Factorize the denominator to identify any restrictions on \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The denominator is \(4x - 4\). Factorize it:
\[
4x - 4 = 4(x - 1)
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{3x - 1}{4(x - 1)} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Note that \(x \neq 1\), as it makes the denominator zero.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying.
How to Achieve: Multiply both sides by the denominators \(4(x - 1)\) and \(3\) to clear the fractions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with:
\[
\frac{3x - 1}{4(x - 1)} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Cross-multiply:
\[
3(3x - 1) = 2 \cdot 4(x - 1)
\]
Simplify:
\[
9x - 3 = 8(x - 1)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the resulting linear equation \(9x - 3 = 8(x - 1)\).
How to Achieve: Expand, combine like terms, and isolate \(x\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the right-hand side:
\[
9x - 3 = 8x - 8
\]
Subtract \(8x\) from both sides:
\[
9x - 8x - 3 = -8
\]
\[
x - 3 = -8
\]
Add \(3\) to both sides:
\[
x = -8 + 3 = -5
\]
So, \(x = -5\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the solution \(x = -5\).
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = -5\) into the original equation and check for consistency; ensure it satisfies denominator restrictions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \(x = -5\) into \(\frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4} = \frac{2}{3}\):
- Numerator: \(3(-5) - 1 = -15 - 1 = -16\)
- Denominator: \(4(-5) - 4 = -20 - 4 = -24\)
- Left-hand side: \(\frac{-16}{-24} = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3}\)
- Right-hand side: \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Since \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\), the solution is valid.
Check restriction: \(x = -5 \neq 1\), so it does not violate the denominator condition.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
