### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, the order of the balls within a box and the order of the boxes themselves do not matter. We are counting distinct distributions based on the number of balls in each box.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
- Subgoal 1: Understand the constraints of the problem (indistinguishable balls and boxes).  
- Subgoal 2: Identify a mathematical approach to count distributions (e.g., partitions of an integer).  
- Subgoal 3: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 4 balls into 3 boxes.  
- Subgoal 4: Verify the solution for correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Understand the constraints and formulate the problem mathematically.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recognize that since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we need to find the number of ways to partition the integer 4 (the number of balls) into at most 3 non-negative parts (representing the number of balls in each box), where the parts are considered unordered due to the boxes being indistinguishable.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the balls are indistinguishable, we are concerned only with the number of balls in each box. Because the boxes are indistinguishable, distributions like (2, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 2) are considered the same. This corresponds to finding the partitions of the number 4 into at most 3 positive or non-negative parts, where the parts are treated as unordered (i.e., we count distinct multisets of part sizes).

To formalize, we need the number of partitions of 4 into at most 3 parts, where the parts are non-negative integers, and we account for indistinguishability by considering the parts in non-increasing order (to avoid overcounting permutations of the boxes). Alternatively, we can list all possible distributions and adjust for indistinguishability.

Let’s proceed by listing possible distributions and then refine our approach in the next step.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the approach by breaking down the calculation into a clear method.  
- Subgoal 3.1: List all partitions of 4 into at most 3 non-negative parts.  
- Subgoal 3.2: Ensure partitions account for indistinguishable boxes by using non-increasing sequences or direct counting.  
- Subgoal 3.3: Count only distinct distributions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Calculate the number of partitions of 4 into at most 3 non-negative parts, accounting for indistinguishable boxes.  
- **How to Achieve**: List all partitions of 4 into 1, 2, or 3 non-negative parts in non-increasing order (to handle indistinguishability). Each partition represents a unique way to distribute the balls.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A partition of 4 into at most 3 non-negative parts, in non-increasing order (a ≥ b ≥ c), corresponds to solutions to the equation a + b + c = 4, where a, b, c are non-negative integers and a ≥ b ≥ c. We list the possible partitions:

- **One part**: (4) → (4, 0, 0)  
  - 4 balls in one box, others empty.
- **Two parts**: 
  - 3 + 1 = 4 → (3, 1, 0)  
    - 3 balls in one box, 1 in another, 0 in the third.
  - 2 + 2 = 4 → (2, 2, 0)  
    - 2 balls in one box, 2 in another, 0 in the third.
- **Three parts**: 
  - 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 → (2, 1, 1)  
    - 2 balls in one box, 1 in each of the other two.
  - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, but this requires 4 parts, which exceeds the number of boxes (3), so it’s not possible.

Thus, the valid partitions are:
- (4, 0, 0)
- (3, 1, 0)
- (2, 2, 0)
- (2, 1, 1)

There are 4 distinct partitions. Each partition represents a unique distribution because the boxes are indistinguishable, and listing parts in non-increasing order ensures we don’t double-count equivalent distributions.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the calculated partitions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Check each partition to ensure it sums to 4, has at most 3 parts, and accounts for indistinguishability. Consider an alternative method (e.g., stars and bars with adjustments) to confirm the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s verify the partitions:
- (4, 0, 0): 4 + 0 + 0 = 4, 3 parts, valid.
- (3, 1, 0): 3 + 1 + 0 = 4, 3 parts, valid.
- (2, 2, 0): 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, 3 parts, valid.
- (2, 1, 1): 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, 3 parts, valid.

To confirm, consider an alternative approach using the “stars and bars” theorem, adjusted for indistinguishable boxes. The number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 4, given by C(4 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(6, 2) = 15. However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need partitions of 4 into at most 3 parts, which we’ve already computed.

Another check: The partitions of 4 into at most 3 parts in non-increasing order are standard in number theory. The partitions listed match the known partitions of 4:
- 4
- 3 + 1
- 2 + 2
- 2 + 1 + 1

No other partitions with at most 3 parts exist, and the non-increasing order ensures indistinguishability of boxes. Thus, the count of 4 is consistent.
