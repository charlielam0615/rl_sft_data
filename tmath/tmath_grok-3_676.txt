### Problem Restatement
We need to find the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that contains 43 numbers. In Pascal's triangle, the \(n\)-th row (starting with \(n=0\) for the row with a single number, 1) has \(n+1\) numbers. Thus, a row with 43 numbers corresponds to \(n=42\). The second number in any row \(n\) of Pascal's triangle is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(n, 1)\), which equals \(n\). Therefore, we need to compute the second number in row 42.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling – Planning (P)  

To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Identify the row of Pascal’s triangle that has 43 numbers by determining the row index \(n\).  
2. Determine the formula for the second number in row \(n\).  
3. Calculate the second number for the identified row.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal – Implementation (I))  

**Goal**: Identify the row of Pascal’s triangle with 43 numbers.  
**How to achieve**: In Pascal’s triangle, row \(n\) (0-based indexing) has \(n+1\) entries. We need to find \(n\) such that \(n+1 = 43\), and compute \(n\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the row with 43 numbers:  
- The number of entries in row \(n\) is \(n+1\).  
- Set \(n+1 = 43\).  
- Solve: \(n = 43 - 1 = 42\).  
Thus, the row with 43 numbers is row \(n=42\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal – Implementation (I)  

**Goal**: Determine the formula for the second number in row \(n\).  
**How to achieve**: Use the structure of Pascal’s triangle, where entries are binomial coefficients \(C(n,k)\), to identify the second number’s formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In Pascal’s triangle row \(n\), the entries are \(C(n,0), C(n,1), \ldots, C(n,n)\). The second number corresponds to \(k=1\), so it is \(C(n,1)\). The binomial coefficient is:  
\[ C(n,1) = \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = n \]  
Thus, the second number in row \(n\) is \(n\).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal – Implementation (I)  

**Goal**: Calculate the second number in row 42.  
**How to achieve**: Apply the formula for the second number using \(n=42\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the previous step, the second number in row \(n\) is \(n\). For row 42 (\(n=42\)):  
- Second number = \(n = 42\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation – Implementation (I)  

**Goal**: Verify the correctness of the solution.  
**How to achieve**: Confirm the row index, formula, and calculation by checking the structure of Pascal’s triangle and recomputing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Check row index**: Row \(n\) has \(n+1\) numbers. For 43 numbers, \(n+1=43 \implies n=42\). Correct.  
- **Check formula**: The second number in row \(n\) is \(C(n,1)=n\). For \(n=42\), \(C(42,1)=42\).  
- **Recompute**: Alternatively, construct the first few rows to confirm the pattern:  
  - Row 0: 1  
  - Row 1: 1, 1  
  - Row 2: 1, 2, 1  
  - Row 3: 1, 3, 3, 1  
  The second number is always \(n\). Thus, for row 42, it’s 42.  
The solution is consistent.

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals – Review (R)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the second number in the row of Pascal’s triangle with 43 numbers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the row with 43 numbers (completed: row 42).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the formula for the second number (completed: \(C(n,1)=n\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the second number for row 42 (completed: 42).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, solution validated).  
The solution process is complete, with the answer being 42.

### Final Answer
The second number in the row of Pascal’s triangle with 43 numbers is **42**.
