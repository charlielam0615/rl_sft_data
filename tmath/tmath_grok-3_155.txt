### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the value of the function \( E(x) \) at \( x = 3 \), given that \( E(3) \) is an integer. The function is defined in the Asymptote code as:

\[ E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \]

Our task is to compute \( E(3) \) and confirm that it is an integer.

To solve for \( E(3) \), we need to:
1. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \).
2. Evaluate each term of the function.
3. Sum the terms to find the value of \( E(3) \).
4. Verify that the result is an integer.

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( E(3) \) by substituting \( x = 3 \) into the function \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \). This will be achieved by evaluating each term separately and summing them.

Let’s compute \( E(3) \):

1. **Evaluate the first term: \( \sqrt{|x + 1|} \)**  
   For \( x = 3 \):  
   \[ |x + 1| = |3 + 1| = 4 \]  
   \[ \sqrt{|x + 1|} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]

2. **Evaluate the second term: \( \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \)**  
   For \( x = 3 \):  
   \[ |x| = 3 \]  
   \[ \sqrt{|x|} = \sqrt{3} \]  
   \[ \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \arctan(\sqrt{3}) \]  
   Since \( \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3} \), we have:  
   \[ \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \]  
   Now compute:  
   \[ \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{9}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

3. **Sum the terms**:  
   \[ E(3) = \sqrt{|3 + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|3|}) = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

4. **Verify the result**:  
   The problem states that \( E(3) \) is an integer, and \( 5 \) is indeed an integer.

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( E(3) = 5 \) by rechecking the calculations and ensuring the function was evaluated correctly at \( x = 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s re-evaluate \( E(3) \) to confirm:  
- First term: \( \sqrt{|3 + 1|} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).  
- Second term: \( \sqrt{|3|} = \sqrt{3} \), so \( \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \), and \( \frac{9}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = 3 \).  
- Total: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \).  

The calculations are consistent. Additionally, the Asymptote code defines the function as \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \), and no alternative definitions are provided. The result \( 5 \) is an integer, satisfying the problem’s condition.
