### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the value of the function \( E(x) \) at \( x = 3 \), given that \( E(3) \) is an integer. The function is defined in the Asymptote code as:

\[ E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \]

Our task is to compute \( E(3) \) and confirm that it is an integer.

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

To solve for \( E(3) \), we need to:
1. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \).
2. Evaluate each term of the function at \( x = 3 \).
3. Sum the results to find \( E(3) \).
4. Verify that the result is an integer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Compute \( E(3) \) by substituting \( x = 3 \) into the function \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \).

**How to Achieve**: Evaluate each term separately:
- Compute \( \sqrt{|x + 1|} \) at \( x = 3 \).
- Compute \( \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \) at \( x = 3 \).
- Add the results to obtain \( E(3) \).

Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( E(x) \):

\[ E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \]

**First term: \( \sqrt{|x + 1|} \)**  
- Compute \( x + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \).  
- Since \( 4 > 0 \), \( |4| = 4 \).  
- Thus, \( \sqrt{|3 + 1|} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).

**Second term: \( \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \)**  
- Compute \( |x| = |3| = 3 \).  
- Thus, \( \sqrt{|x|} = \sqrt{3} \).  
- So, \( \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) = \arctan(\sqrt{3}) \).  
- We know \( \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3} \), so \( \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \).  
- Therefore, \( \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{9}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \).

**Sum the terms**:  
\[ E(3) = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

The value of \( E(3) \) is 5, which is an integer.

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Verify that the computation of \( E(3) = 5 \) is correct.

**How to Achieve**: Recompute each term independently and check for consistency. Ensure all mathematical steps, especially the evaluation of \( \arctan(\sqrt{3}) \), are accurate.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Letâ€™s recompute \( E(3) \):

- **First term**: \( \sqrt{|3 + 1|} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).  
- **Second term**: \( \sqrt{|3|} = \sqrt{3} \), so \( \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \).  
  Then, \( \frac{9}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = 3 \).  
- **Total**: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \).

The calculations are consistent. Additionally, we confirm that \( \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3} \) since \( \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3} \), and the absolute values are handled correctly (\( |3| = 3 \), \( |4| = 4 \)). The result \( E(3) = 5 \) is an integer, as required.

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Compute \( E(3) \) and confirm it is an integer.
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( E(x) = \sqrt{|x + 1|} + \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \).
  - Subgoal 2: Evaluate each term (\( \sqrt{|x + 1|} \) and \( \frac{9}{\pi} \arctan(\sqrt{|x|}) \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum the terms to find \( E(3) \).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation to ensure correctness.

**Current Goal**: The current goal was to validate the computation, which has been completed. The main goal of computing \( E(3) \) has been achieved, with the result \( E(3) = 5 \), which is an integer.
