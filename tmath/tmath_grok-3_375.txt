**Problem Statement**: Find two numbers whose sum is 25 and whose product is 126, then calculate the absolute value of their difference.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Set up equations based on the given conditions (sum and product).  
2. Solve for the two numbers.  
3. Calculate the absolute value of their difference.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations based on the given conditions. Define the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x \cdot y = 126 \). Use these to form a system of equations.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \). From the problem:  
- \( x + y = 25 \)  
- \( x \cdot y = 126 \)  

These equations represent the sum and product of the two numbers.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x \cdot y = 126 \) to find the two numbers. Use the quadratic equation derived from these equations.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( x + y = 25 \), express \( y = 25 - x \). Substitute into the product equation:  
\[ x \cdot (25 - x) = 126 \]  
\[ 25x - x^2 = 126 \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[ x^2 - 25x + 126 = 0 \]  

Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -25 \), \( c = 126 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-25)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 126 = 625 - 504 = 121 \]  
\[ x = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{25 \pm 11}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{25 + 11}{2} = 18 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{25 - 11}{2} = 7 \]  

If \( x = 18 \), then \( y = 25 - 18 = 7 \). If \( x = 7 \), then \( y = 25 - 7 = 18 \).  
The numbers are \( 18 \) and \( 7 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the numbers \( 18 \) and \( 7 \) satisfy both conditions: their sum is 25, and their product is 126.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the sum: \( 18 + 7 = 25 \), which satisfies the first condition.  
Check the product: \( 18 \cdot 7 = 126 \), which satisfies the second condition.  
The solution is valid.  

[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers, \( 18 \) and \( 7 \). Compute \( |18 - 7| \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The difference is \( 18 - 7 = 11 \).  
The absolute value is \( |11| = 11 \).

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
