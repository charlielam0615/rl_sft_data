### Problem Statement
We need to find two numbers whose sum is 25 and whose product is 126, then calculate the absolute value of their difference.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the two numbers and compute the absolute value of their difference.  
Subgoals:  
1. Set up equations based on the given conditions (sum and product).  
2. Solve for the two numbers.  
3. Calculate the absolute value of their difference.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve equations to find the two numbers. Use the given conditions: their sum is 25, and their product is 126. Represent the numbers as \(x\) and \(y\), form equations, and solve them, likely using a quadratic equation derived from the system.

[IMP]
Let the two numbers be \(x\) and \(y\). We have:  
1. \(x + y = 25\)  
2. \(xy = 126\)  

From the first equation, express \(y\) as \(y = 25 - x\). Substitute into the second equation:  
\[ x(25 - x) = 126 \]  
\[ 25x - x^2 = 126 \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form:  
\[ x^2 - 25x + 126 = 0 \]  

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -25\), and \(c = 126\):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = (-25)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 126 = 625 - 504 = 121 \]  
\[ x = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{25 \pm 11}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{25 + 11}{2} = 18 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{25 - 11}{2} = 7 \]  

If \(x = 18\), then \(y = 25 - 18 = 7\). If \(x = 7\), then \(y = 25 - 7 = 18\). Thus, the two numbers are 18 and 7.  
Verify: Sum = \(18 + 7 = 25\), product = \(18 \cdot 7 = 126\). Both conditions are satisfied.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers, 18 and 7. Subtract the numbers and take the absolute value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The two numbers are 18 and 7. Their difference is:  
\[ 18 - 7 = 11 \]  
The absolute value is:  
\[ |18 - 7| = 11 \]  
(Alternatively, \(|7 - 18| = |-11| = 11\)).

### Step 4

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the absolute value of the difference of two numbers whose sum is 25 and product is 126.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations based on the given conditions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for the two numbers (completed: numbers are 18 and 7).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the absolute value of their difference (completed: result is 11).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution aligns with all subgoals, which it does, as all steps have been completed.

### Final Answer
The absolute value of the difference of the two numbers is 11.
