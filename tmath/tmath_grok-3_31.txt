### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( k \) in the quadratic equation \( 7x^2 + 3x + k = 0 \), given that its roots are \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( k \), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Use the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation.
2. Apply the sum and product of roots formulas to find \( k \).
3. Verify the solution if needed.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- **Current Goal**: Use the sum and product of roots to find \( k \).
- **How to Achieve**: For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \), and the product of roots is \( \frac{c}{a} \). Here, \( a = 7 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = k \). Compute the sum and product of the given roots \( \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} \) and \( \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} \), then use the product of roots formula to solve for \( k \).

[IMP]
The roots are \( r_1 = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} \) and \( r_2 = \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).

- **Sum of roots**:
  \[
  r_1 + r_2 = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} + \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299} - 3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} = \frac{-6}{14} = -\frac{3}{7}.
  \]
  For the quadratic \( 7x^2 + 3x + k \), the sum of roots is:
  \[
  -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{3}{7}.
  \]
  This matches, confirming the coefficients are consistent.

- **Product of roots**:
  \[
  r_1 \cdot r_2 = \left( \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} \right) = \frac{(-3)^2 - (i\sqrt{299})^2}{14^2} = \frac{9 - i^2 \cdot 299}{196}.
  \]
  Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
  \[
  9 - (-1) \cdot 299 = 9 + 299 = 308.
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{308}{196} = \frac{308 \div 4}{196 \div 4} = \frac{77}{49} = \frac{11}{7}.
  \]
  For the quadratic, the product of roots is:
  \[
  \frac{c}{a} = \frac{k}{7}.
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  \frac{k}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \implies k = 11.
  \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( k = 11 \) produces the given roots.
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( k = 11 \) into the quadratic, compute the discriminant, and confirm the roots match \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With \( k = 11 \), the quadratic is \( 7x^2 + 3x + 11 = 0 \). Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2} - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 7 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 11 \).

- **Discriminant**:
  \[
  \Delta^2 = b^2 - 4ac = 9 - 4 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 = 9 - 308 = -299.
  \]
  \[
  \Delta = \sqrt{-299} = i\sqrt{299}.
  \]

- **Roots**:
  \[
  x = \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14}.
  \]
This matches the given roots \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \), confirming \( k = 11 \) is correct.
