### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( k \) in the quadratic equation \( 7x^2 + 3x + k = 0 \), given that its roots are \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).

### Step 1: Understand the quadratic and its roots

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to find \( k \).  
- Subgoal 1: Use the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation.
- Subgoal 2: Apply the sum and product of roots formulas for the quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
- Subgoal 3: Compute \( k \) using the product of the roots.

### Step 2: Identify the sum and product of the roots

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the sum and product of the roots to relate them to the coefficients of the quadratic.  
**How to Achieve**: For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \), and the product of the roots is \( \frac{c}{a} \). Here, \( a = 7 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = k \). Use the given roots \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \) to compute the sum and product, then find \( k \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The roots are \( r_1 = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} \) and \( r_2 = \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).

- **Sum of the roots**:
  \[
  r_1 + r_2 = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} + \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} = \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299} - 3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} = \frac{-6}{14} = -\frac{3}{7}.
  \]
  For the quadratic \( 7x^2 + 3x + k = 0 \), the sum of the roots is:
  \[
  -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{3}{7}.
  \]
  This confirms \( a = 7 \), \( b = 3 \), as \( -\frac{3}{7} = -\frac{b}{a} \), which is consistent.

- **Product of the roots**:
  \[
  r_1 \cdot r_2 = \left( \frac{-3 + i\sqrt{299}}{14} \right) \left( \frac{-3 - i\sqrt{299}}{14} \right) = \frac{(-3)^2 - (i\sqrt{299})^2}{14^2} = \frac{9 - i^2 \cdot 299}{196}.
  \]
  Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
  \[
  9 - (-299) = 9 + 299 = 308.
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{308}{196} = \frac{308 \div 4}{196 \div 4} = \frac{77}{49} = \frac{11}{7}.
  \]
  For the quadratic, the product of the roots is:
  \[
  \frac{c}{a} = \frac{k}{7}.
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  \frac{k}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \implies k = 11.
  \]

### Step 3: Validate the solution

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( k = 11 \) produces the given roots for the quadratic.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( k = 11 \) into the quadratic and compute the roots using the quadratic formula, then check if they match \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
With \( k = 11 \), the quadratic is \( 7x^2 + 3x + 11 = 0 \). Use the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]
where \( a = 7 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 11 \).

- Compute the discriminant:
  \[
  b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 = 9 - 308 = -299.
  \]
- Apply the quadratic formula:
  \[
  x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{-299}}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14}.
  \]
The roots are:
\[
\frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14},
\]
which match the given roots exactly. Thus, \( k = 11 \) is correct.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find \( k \) such that the quadratic \( 7x^2 + 3x + k = 0 \) has roots \( \frac{-3 \pm i\sqrt{299}}{14} \).
  - Subgoal 1: Use the relationship between roots and coefficients (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the sum and product of the roots to find \( k \) (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking the roots with the computed \( k \) (completed).

**Current Goal**: The main goal has been achieved, as \( k = 11 \) has been computed and validated.

**Summary**: The subgoals were systematically addressed by applying the sum and product of roots formulas and verifying the result. No further subgoals are needed.
