### Problem Restatement
We need to find all possible values of the expression \( S + P \), where \( S \) is the sum of two positive even integers less than 15 (which may be the same), and \( P \) is their product. The goal is to determine how many distinct values this expression can take.

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify all positive even integers less than 15.
2. Form all possible pairs of these integers (including pairs where the integers are the same).
3. For each pair, compute the sum \( S \) and product \( P \).
4. Calculate the expression \( S + P \) for each pair.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify all positive even integers less than 15 and form all possible pairs.

**How to Achieve**: List all positive even integers less than 15, then generate all possible pairs, including cases where the integers are the same, since the problem allows non-distinct integers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The positive even integers less than 15 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

All possible pairs (including same integers) are:
- Same integers: (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8), (10, 10), (12, 12), (14, 14)
- Different integers (considering (a, b) and (b, a) as the same since sum and product are commutative): (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 12), (4, 14), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 14), (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 14), (10, 12), (10, 14), (12, 14)

Total pairs: 7 (same) + 21 (different) = 28 pairs.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the calculations of \( S + P \) for each pair to ensure accuracy.

**How to Achieve**: Recheck a sample of calculations and confirm that all pairs have been considered.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sample verification:
- For (2, 2): \( S = 2 + 2 = 4 \), \( P = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \), \( S + P = 4 + 4 = 8 \). Correct.
- For (4, 8): \( S = 4 + 8 = 12 \), \( P = 4 \cdot 8 = 32 \), \( S + P = 12 + 32 = 44 \). Correct.
- For (12, 14): \( S = 12 + 14 = 26 \), \( P = 12 \cdot 14 = 168 \), \( S + P = 26 + 168 = 194 \). Correct.

All 28 pairs (7 same, 21 different) were considered, matching the combination formula \( \binom{7}{2} + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28 \). Calculations appear consistent.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Determine the number of distinct values of \( S + P \).

**How to Achieve**: Collect all \( S + P \) values from Step 3, remove duplicates, and count the unique values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List of \( S + P \) values: 8, 24, 48, 80, 120, 168, 224, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 62, 76, 90, 104, 98, 116, 134, 142, 164, 194.

Sorted unique values: 8, 14, 20, 24, 26, 32, 34, 38, 44, 48, 54, 62, 64, 74, 76, 80, 90, 98, 104, 116, 120, 134, 142, 164, 168, 194.

Number of distinct values: 26.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Determine how many different possible values result from \( S + P \) for two positive even integers less than 15.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all positive even integers less than 15. (Completed in Step 2)
  - Subgoal 2: Form all possible pairs of these integers. (Completed in Step 2)
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( S + P \) for each pair. (Completed in Step 3)
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the calculations. (Completed in Step 4)
  - Subgoal 5: Count the number of distinct \( S + P \) values. (Completed in Step 5)

**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the count of distinct values.

The current goal has been addressed by calculating 26 distinct values for \( S + P \).
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Confirm that no possible pairs were missed and that the count of distinct values is correct.

**How to Achieve**: Reconfirm the list of even integers, verify the pair count, and check for any missing or duplicate \( S + P \) values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Reconfirm even integers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (7 numbers).
Pairs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) (different) + 7 (same) = 28 pairs, as calculated.
Check for duplicates: The value 44 appears twice (from (2, 14) and (4, 8)), but all other values are unique. The sorted list in Step 5 accounts for this, with 26 unique values.
No pairs are missing, and the count is consistent.
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The number of different possible values of \( S + P \) is **26**.
