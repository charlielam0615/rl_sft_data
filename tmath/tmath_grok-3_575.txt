### Problem Restatement
We need to find two positive even integers, each less than 15 (they can be the same), compute the sum of their sum and their product, and determine how many distinct values this result can take. Mathematically, for two even integers \(a\) and \(b\) where \(2 \leq a, b \leq 14\), we compute \(a + b + ab\) and find the number of unique values.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to systematically approach the solution:  
1. Identify all possible positive even integers less than 15.  
2. Compute the expression \(a + b + ab\) for all possible pairs \((a, b)\), including cases where \(a = b\).  
3. Collect all resulting values and determine how many are distinct.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify all positive even integers less than 15 and list all possible pairs \((a, b)\). This will be achieved by listing even numbers and forming all combinations, including pairs where \(a = b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The positive even integers less than 15 are \(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\). Since the numbers are not necessarily distinct, we consider all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a, b \in \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\}\). This includes cases like \((2, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 2)\), etc. There are 7 choices for \(a\) and 7 choices for \(b\), so there are \(7 \times 7 = 49\) possible pairs.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b + ab\) for each pair \((a, b)\) and collect the results. This will be achieved by calculating the expression for all 49 pairs and storing the values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(a + b + ab\). To simplify, note that:
\[
a + b + ab = ab + a + b = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1
\]
This transformation can help with calculations. We compute \(a + b + ab\) directly for clarity, listing results for all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a, b \in \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\}\).

[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of distinct values from the computed results. This will be achieved by extracting unique values from the list and counting them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
List all values from the previous step:  
\(8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90, 104, 26, 44, 62, 80, 98, 116, 134, 32, 54, 76, 98, 120, 142, 164, 38, 64, 90, 116, 142, 168, 194, 44, 74, 104, 134, 164, 194, 224\).

Remove duplicates by listing unique values in ascending order:  
\(8, 14, 20, 24, 26, 32, 34, 38, 44, 48, 54, 62, 64, 74, 76, 80, 90, 98, 104, 116, 120, 134, 142, 164, 168, 194, 224\).

Count the unique values: There are 27 distinct values.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computed values and the count of distinct values. This will be achieved by checking a sample of calculations and confirming the uniqueness of the values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify sample calculations:  
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 = 8\). Correct.  
- For \((4, 4)\): \(4 + 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 8 + 16 = 24\). Correct.  
- For \((14, 14)\): \(14 + 14 + 14 \cdot 14 = 28 + 196 = 224\). Correct.

Confirm the unique values by re-checking the list for duplicates. The sorted list \(8, 14, 20, 24, 26, 32, 34, 38, 44, 48, 54, 62, 64, 74, 76, 80, 90, 98, 104, 116, 120, 134, 142, 164, 168, 194, 224\) has no duplicates, and the count is 27.

To further validate, consider the expression \(a + b + ab = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1\). Since \(a, b\) are even, \(a + 1, b + 1\) are odd, so \((a + 1)(b + 1)\) is odd, and subtracting 1 gives an even number. All computed values are even, which aligns with the formula. The range of values (from 8 to 224) seems reasonable given the constraints (\(a, b \leq 14\)).

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of distinct values of \(a + b + ab\) for positive even integers \(a, b < 15\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all possible even integers and form pairs (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(a + b + ab\) for all pairs (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the number of distinct values (completed in Step 4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the results (completed in Step 5).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution by confirming the number of distinct values, which has been addressed. The solution is complete.  

The final answer is 27 distinct values.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The number of different possible values of \(a + b + ab\) for two positive even integers less than 15 is **27**.
