**Problem Restatement**: Find the count of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 6 < n < 60 \) and \( n \) is relatively prime to 15 (i.e., \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \)).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the range of natural numbers to consider (greater than 6 and less than 60).
2. Identify the condition for a number to be relatively prime to 15 (i.e., \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \)).
3. Develop a method to count numbers in the range that satisfy the condition.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the range of natural numbers to consider.
Description: Identify all natural numbers \( n \) where \( 6 < n < 60 \). Since natural numbers are positive integers, list the integers from 7 to 59 inclusive.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The range of natural numbers greater than 6 and less than 60 includes all integers \( n \) such that \( 7 \leq n \leq 59 \). This gives the set:
\[ \{7, 8, 9, \ldots, 58, 59\} \]
To find the count of numbers in this range:
- Smallest number: 7
- Largest number: 59
- Number of integers from 7 to 59 inclusive: \( 59 - 7 + 1 = 53 \).
Thus, there are 53 natural numbers in the range.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the condition for a number to be relatively prime to 15.
Description: A number \( n \) is relatively prime to 15 if \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \). Factorize 15 to understand which numbers share no common factors with it other than 1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factorize 15:
\[ 15 = 3 \times 5 \]
For \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \), \( n \) must not be divisible by 3 or 5 (since 3 and 5 are the prime factors of 15). Thus, \( n \) is relatively prime to 15 if:
- \( n \mod 3 \neq 0 \), and
- \( n \mod 5 \neq 0 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Develop a method to count numbers in the range that are relatively prime to 15.
Description: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers from 7 to 59 that are not divisible by 3 or 5, as these are the numbers with \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To count numbers from 7 to 59 that are relatively prime to 15, calculate the numbers not divisible by 3 or 5 using inclusion-exclusion.

**Step 1**: Total numbers from 7 to 59: 53 (from Step 2).

**Step 2**: Numbers divisible by 3 in the range [7, 59]:
- First multiple of 3: 9
- Last multiple of 3: 57 (since \( 60 \div 3 = 20 \), so \( 3 \times 19 = 57 \))
- Sequence: \( 9, 12, 15, \ldots, 57 \)
- This is an arithmetic sequence with:
  - First term \( a_1 = 9 \)
  - Common difference \( d = 3 \)
  - Last term \( a_n = 57 \)
  - Number of terms: \( n = \frac{57 - 9}{3} + 1 = \frac{48}{3} + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \)
- Thus, 17 numbers are divisible by 3.

**Step 3**: Numbers divisible by 5 in the range [7, 59]:
- First multiple of 5: 10
- Last multiple of 5: 55
- Sequence: \( 10, 15, 20, \ldots, 55 \)
- Number of terms: \( n = \frac{55 - 10}{5} + 1 = \frac{45}{5} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \)
- Thus, 10 numbers are divisible by 5.

**Step 4**: Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., by 15) in the range [7, 59]:
- First multiple of 15: 15
- Last multiple of 15: 45
- Sequence: \( 15, 30, 45 \)
- Number of terms: \( n = \frac{45 - 15}{15} + 1 = \frac{30}{15} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- Thus, 3 numbers are divisible by 15.

**Step 5**: Apply inclusion-exclusion to find numbers divisible by 3 or 5:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
where:
- \( |A| \): Numbers divisible by 3 = 17
- \( |B| \): Numbers divisible by 5 = 10
- \( |A \cap B| \): Numbers divisible by 15 = 3
\[ |A \cup B| = 17 + 10 - 3 = 24 \]
Thus, 24 numbers are divisible by 3 or 5.

**Step 6**: Numbers not divisible by 3 or 5:
\[ 53 - 24 = 29 \]
Thus, 29 numbers from 7 to 59 are relatively prime to 15.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of numbers relatively prime to 15.
Description: Cross-check the result using Euler’s totient function and adjust for the specific range to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use Euler’s totient function to count numbers up to 59 that are relatively prime to 15, then exclude those up to 6.

**Euler’s totient function**:
For \( n = 15 = 3 \times 5 \),
\[ \phi(15) = 15 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 15 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = 15 \times \frac{8}{15} = 8 \]
Thus, \( \phi(15) = 8 \), meaning in every cycle of 15 numbers, 8 are relatively prime to 15.

**Numbers from 1 to 59**:
- Number of complete cycles of 15: \( \lfloor 59 \div 15 \rfloor = 3 \)
- Numbers relatively prime in 3 cycles: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \)
- Remaining numbers: \( 59 - 3 \times 15 = 59 - 45 = 14 \)
- Check numbers from 46 to 59 (14 numbers) for relative primality to 15 by listing those not divisible by 3 or 5:
  - Sequence: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59
  - Exclude multiples of 3: 48, 51, 54, 57 (4 numbers)
  - Exclude multiples of 5: 50, 55 (2 numbers)
  - Exclude overlap (multiples of 15): None
  - Total excluded: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)
  - Relatively prime: \( 14 - 6 = 8 \)
- Total relatively prime from 1 to 59: \( 24 + 8 = 32 \)

**Exclude numbers from 1 to 6**:
- Check 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \):
  - \( \gcd(1, 15) = 1 \)
  - \( \gcd(2, 15) = 1 \)
  - \( \gcd(3, 15) = 3 \)
  - \( \gcd(4, 15) = 1 \)
  - \( \gcd(5, 15) = 5 \)
  - \( \gcd(6, 15) = 3 \)
- Relatively prime: 1, 2, 4 (3 numbers)

**Numbers from 7 to 59 relatively prime to 15**:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

This matches the previous result of 29, confirming the calculation.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Count natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 6 < n < 60 \) and \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the range of natural numbers (7 to 59, 53 numbers).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for relative primality (\( n \) not divisible by 3 or 5).
  - Subgoal 3: Count numbers in the range satisfying the condition (29 numbers via inclusion-exclusion).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (confirmed using Euler’s totient function).

**Current Goal**: Completed validation; no further subgoals needed.

**Summary**: The solution is complete with 29 numbers identified, validated by two methods.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 29 natural numbers greater than 6 and less than 60 that are relatively prime to 15.
