### Problem Statement
We need to find the number of natural numbers greater than 6 and less than 60 that are relatively prime to 15. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. Thus, we are looking for numbers \( n \) such that \( 6 < n < 60 \) and \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Determine the range of natural numbers to consider based on the constraints \( 6 < n < 60 \).
2. Understand what it means for a number to be relatively prime to 15 by analyzing the prime factors of 15.
3. Identify a method to count numbers relatively prime to 15, possibly using Euler's totient function or direct GCD computation.
4. Apply the method to the specified range and compute the final count.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the range of natural numbers to consider.
How to Achieve: Identify all natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 6 < n < 60 \). Since natural numbers are positive integers, list the integers from 7 to 59 inclusive, and calculate how many numbers are in this range.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The range is defined by \( 6 < n < 60 \). Thus, the natural numbers are \( n = 7, 8, \ldots, 59 \).
To find the count of numbers in this range:
- Smallest number: 7
- Largest number: 59
- Number of integers from 7 to 59 inclusive is \( 59 - 7 + 1 = 53 \).

There are 53 natural numbers in the range.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Analyze the condition for a number to be relatively prime to 15.
How to Achieve: Factorize 15 into its prime factors and determine the condition for \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \). A number \( n \) is relatively prime to 15 if it shares no common prime factors with 15.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factorize 15:
\[ 15 = 3 \times 5 \]
For \( \gcd(n, 15) = 1 \), \( n \) must not be divisible by either 3 or 5, since these are the prime factors of 15. Thus, we need numbers \( n \) in the range \( 7 \leq n \leq 59 \) that are neither multiples of 3 nor multiples of 5.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Develop a method to count numbers relatively prime to 15 in the range.
How to Achieve: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers from 7 to 59 that are not divisible by 3 or 5. Alternatively, consider Euler's totient function for numbers up to 59 and adjust for the lower bound \( n > 6 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the count of numbers from 7 to 59 that are not divisible by 3 or 5.

- **Total numbers**: From 7 to 59, there are 53 numbers (calculated in Step 2).
- **Numbers divisible by 3**:
  - Multiples of 3: \( 9, 12, \ldots, 57 \)
  - Sequence: \( 3k \), where \( 9 \leq 3k \leq 57 \)
  - Solve for \( k \): \( k \geq 3 \) and \( k \leq 19 \)
  - Number of multiples: \( 19 - 3 + 1 = 17 \)
- **Numbers divisible by 5**:
  - Multiples of 5: \( 10, 15, \ldots, 55 \)
  - Sequence: \( 5k \), where \( 10 \leq 5k \leq 55 \)
  - Solve for \( k \): \( k \geq 2 \) and \( k \leq 11 \)
  - Number of multiples: \( 11 - 2 + 1 = 10 \)
- **Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., by 15)**:
  - Multiples of 15: \( 15, 30, 45 \)
  - Sequence: \( 15k \), where \( 15 \leq 15k \leq 59 \)
  - Solve for \( k \): \( k \leq 3.933 \), so \( k = 1, 2, 3 \)
  - Number of multiples: 3

Using inclusion-exclusion:
\[ \text{Numbers divisible by 3 or 5} = (\text{Multiples of 3}) + (\text{Multiples of 5}) - (\text{Multiples of 15}) \]
\[ = 17 + 10 - 3 = 24 \]

Numbers not divisible by 3 or 5:
\[ 53 - 24 = 29 \]

Thus, 29 numbers in the range are relatively prime to 15.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the count of numbers relatively prime to 15.
How to Achieve: Use Euler’s totient function to compute the number of integers up to 59 that are relatively prime to 15, subtract those up to 6, and compare with the inclusion-exclusion result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Euler’s totient function \( \phi(m) \) counts numbers up to \( m \) that are relatively prime to \( m \). For \( m = 15 = 3 \times 5 \):
\[ \phi(15) = 15 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 15 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 8 \]

- Numbers from 1 to 59 relatively prime to 15:
  - In each block of 15 numbers, there are \( \phi(15) = 8 \) numbers relatively prime to 15.
  - From 1 to 60 covers 4 blocks (\( 60 \div 15 = 4 \)).
  - Total: \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).
  - Exclude \( n = 60 \): Check \( \gcd(60, 15) = 15 \neq 1 \), so 60 is not relatively prime. Thus, from 1 to 59, there are 32 numbers.
- Numbers from 1 to 6 relatively prime to 15:
  - Check each: \( \gcd(1, 15) = 1 \), \( \gcd(2, 15) = 1 \), \( \gcd(3, 15) = 3 \), \( \gcd(4, 15) = 1 \), \( \gcd(5, 15) = 5 \), \( \gcd(6, 15) = 3 \).
  - Relatively prime: \( \{1, 2, 4\} \). Count = 3.

Numbers from 7 to 59:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

This matches the inclusion-exclusion result of 29, confirming the solution.
