**Problem Statement**: Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).

To solve this, I will use the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M) and select one action per step, structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Compute \((12.1)^2\).
2. Apply the floor function to get \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor\).
3. Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
4. Calculate \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
5. Subtract the result of step 4 from step 2 to get the final answer.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \((12.1)^2\).
Description: Square the number 12.1 by multiplying 12.1 by itself.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate \((12.1)^2\):
\[
12.1 \times 12.1 = 12.1 \times (12 + 0.1) = (12.1 \times 12) + (12.1 \times 0.1) = 145.2 + 1.21 = 146.41
\]
So, \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the floor function to get \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor\).
Description: Take the result from the previous step, 146.41, and find the greatest integer less than or equal to it.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). For \(x = 146.41\):
\[
\lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146
\]
since 146 is the largest integer such that \(146 \leq 146.41\).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
Description: Apply the floor function to 12.1 to find the greatest integer less than or equal to 12.1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \(x = 12.1\):
\[
\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12
\]
since 12 is the largest integer such that \(12 \leq 12.1\).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
Description: Use the result from the previous step, \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\), and multiply it by itself.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12, \quad \text{so} \quad \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12 \times 12 = 144
\]
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the final expression \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
Description: Subtract the result of \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 144\) from \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = 146\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = 146, \quad \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 144
\]
\[
146 - 144 = 2
\]
So, the value of the expression is 2.
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculations.
Description: Recalculate key steps to ensure accuracy, including \((12.1)^2\), \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor\), \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\), and the final subtraction.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recompute \((12.1)^2\):
\[
12.1 = 121/10, \quad (12.1)^2 = \left(\frac{121}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{121^2}{100}, \quad 121^2 = 121 \times 121 = 14641, \quad \frac{14641}{100} = 146.41
\]
This confirms \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\), so \(\lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146\).
- Recompute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\):
\[
12.1 = 12 + 0.1, \quad \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12
\]
\[
\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12 \times 12 = 144
\]
- Final expression:
\[
146 - 144 = 2
\]
All calculations are consistent with previous results.

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Evaluate \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = \lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12 \times 12 = 144\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \(146 - 144 = 2\). (Completed)
  - Subgoal 6: Validate calculations. (Completed)

Current Goal: None, as all subgoals and the main goal are completed.
The final answer is 2, and all steps have been validated.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of the expression \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\) is **2**.
