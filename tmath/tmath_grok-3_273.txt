### Problem Statement
Evaluate the expression \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to evaluate the expression systematically. The expression involves computing \((12.1)^2\), taking its floor, computing the floor of 12.1, and then performing the subtraction. Subgoals:
1. Calculate \((12.1)^2\).
2. Apply the floor function to \((12.1)^2\).
3. Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
4. Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\).
5. Subtract the result of step 4 from the result of step 2.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate \((12.1)^2\). This can be achieved by squaring 12.1 using arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \((12.1)^2\):  
Since \(12.1 = \frac{121}{10}\), we can calculate:  
\[
(12.1)^2 = \left(\frac{121}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{121^2}{10^2} = \frac{14641}{100} = 146.41.
\]
Alternatively, directly:  
\[
12.1 \times 12.1 = 12.1 \times (12 + 0.1) = 12.1 \times 12 + 12.1 \times 0.1 = 145.2 + 1.21 = 146.41.
\]
So, \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the floor function to \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\). The floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the number.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = \lfloor 146.41 \rfloor\):  
Since 146.41 is between 146 and 147, the greatest integer less than or equal to 146.41 is 146.  
Thus, \(\lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\). The floor function applied to 12.1 returns the greatest integer less than or equal to 12.1.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\):  
Since 12.1 is between 12 and 13, the greatest integer less than or equal to 12.1 is 12.  
Thus, \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\). Since \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\), this involves multiplying 12 by itself.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12 \cdot 12\):  
\[
12 \cdot 12 = 144.
\]
So, \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 144\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the final expression \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\). Using the results from previous steps, subtract the result of step 5 from the result of step 3.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor\):  
From step 3, \(\lfloor (12.1)^2 \rfloor = 146\).  
From step 5, \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 144\).  
\[
146 - 144 = 2.
\]
So, the value of the expression is 2.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation by rechecking the steps to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck the calculations:  
- \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\), so \(\lfloor 146.41 \rfloor = 146\).  
- \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12\), so \(\lfloor 12.1 \rfloor \cdot \lfloor 12.1 \rfloor = 12 \cdot 12 = 144\).  
- \(146 - 144 = 2\).  
The arithmetic is consistent. To further validate, note that \((12.1)^2 = 146.41\) is slightly above 146, and \(12^2 = 144\), so the difference \(\lfloor 146.41 \rfloor - 144 = 146 - 144 = 2\) aligns with the small fractional part of 12.1 contributing to the floor difference.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current goal has been achieved.
