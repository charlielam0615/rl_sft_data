**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.

2. Identify the condition for a number to be divisible by 3 (sum of digits is divisible by 3).  
3. Count the total number of valid three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3.  
4. Count how many of these numbers are divisible by 3.  
5. Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the range of possible three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3. This involves identifying the structure of the number (hundreds, tens, and ones digits) and specifying the constraints based on the ones digit being 3.  

[IMP]  
A three-digit number \( N \) can be expressed as \( N = 100h + 10t + u \), where:  
- \( h \) is the hundreds digit, ranging from 1 to 9 (since itâ€™s a three-digit number).  
- \( t \) is the tens digit, ranging from 0 to 9.  
- \( u \) is the ones digit, fixed at 3.  

Thus, the possible numbers are of the form \( 100h + 10t + 3 \), where \( h \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \) and \( t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 9\} \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the total number of valid three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3. This involves calculating the number of possible values for each digit based on the constraints identified.  

[IMP]  
- Hundreds digit (\( h \)): 9 choices (1 to 9).  
- Tens digit (\( t \)): 10 choices (0 to 9).  
- Ones digit (\( u \)): 1 choice (fixed at 3).  

Total number of valid numbers: \( 9 \times 10 \times 1 = 90 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the condition for a number to be divisible by 3 and apply it to the numbers of the form \( 100h + 10t + 3 \). A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  

[IMP]  
For a number \( N = 100h + 10t + 3 \), the sum of the digits is:  
\[ h + t + 3 \]  
For \( N \) to be divisible by 3, the sum \( h + t + 3 \) must be divisible by 3, i.e.,  
\[ h + t + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]  
Since \( 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), this simplifies to:  
\[ h + t \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]  
Thus, we need \( h + t \) to be divisible by 3, where \( h \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \) and \( t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 9\} \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count how many numbers of the form \( 100h + 10t + 3 \) have a digit sum \( h + t + 3 \) divisible by 3. This involves finding pairs \( (h, t) \) such that \( h + t \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \).  

[IMP]  
Since \( h + t \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), we need \( h + t \) to be a multiple of 3. The possible values of \( h + t \) range from:  
- Minimum: \( h = 1, t = 0 \implies h + t = 1 \)  
- Maximum: \( h = 9, t = 9 \implies h + t = 18 \)  

Thus, \( h + t \) ranges from 1 to 18. The values of \( h + t \) that are divisible by 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18.  

For each value of \( h \) from 1 to 9, we find the number of \( t \) (from 0 to 9) such that \( h + t = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Equivalently, \( t = 3k - h \), and \( t \) must be in \( \{0, 1, \ldots, 9\} \).  

- **For \( h + t = 3 \)**:  
  \( t = 3 - h \).  
  - \( h = 1 \): \( t = 2 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 2 \): \( t = 1 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 3 \): \( t = 0 \) (valid).  
  - \( h > 3 \): \( t < 0 \) (invalid).  
  Number of pairs: 3 (\( (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0) \)).  

- **For \( h + t = 6 \)**:  
  \( t = 6 - h \).  
  - \( h = 1 \): \( t = 5 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 2 \): \( t = 4 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 3 \): \( t = 3 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 4 \): \( t = 2 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 5 \): \( t = 1 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 6 \): \( t = 0 \) (valid).  
  - \( h > 6 \): \( t < 0 \) (invalid).  
  Number of pairs: 6.  

- **For \( h + t = 9 \)**:  
  \( t = 9 - h \).  
  - \( h = 1 \): \( t = 8 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 2 \): \( t = 7 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 3 \): \( t = 6 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 4 \): \( t = 5 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 5 \): \( t = 4 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 6 \): \( t = 3 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 7 \): \( t = 2 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 8 \): \( t = 1 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 9 \): \( t = 0 \) (valid).  
  Number of pairs: 9.  

- **For \( h + t = 12 \)**:  
  \( t = 12 - h \).  
  - \( h = 3 \): \( t = 9 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 4 \): \( t = 8 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 5 \): \( t = 7 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 6 \): \( t = 6 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 7 \): \( t = 5 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 8 \): \( t = 4 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 9 \): \( t = 3 \) (valid).  
  Number of pairs: 7.  

- **For \( h + t = 15 \)**:  
  \( t = 15 - h \).  
  - \( h = 6 \): \( t = 9 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 7 \): \( t = 8 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 8 \): \( t = 7 \) (valid).  
  - \( h = 9 \): \( t = 6 \) (valid).  
  Number of pairs: 4.  

- **For \( h + t = 18 \)**:  
  \( t = 18 - h \).  
  - \( h = 9 \): \( t = 9 \) (valid).  
  Number of pairs: 1.  

Total favorable pairs: \( 3 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 30 \).

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the calculation of favorable outcomes by checking the divisibility condition for a sample of numbers and ensuring the counting logic is consistent.  

[IMP]  
To validate, consider a few numbers:  
- \( N = 123 \): Digits 1, 2, 3. Sum: \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \), divisible by 3. Check: \( 123 \div 3 = 41 \). Valid.  
- \( N = 213 \): Digits 2, 1, 3. Sum: \( 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \), divisible by 3. Check: \( 213 \div 3 = 71 \). Valid.  
- \( N = 113 \): Digits 1, 1, 3. Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 \), not divisible by 3. Valid.  

The counting logic (summing pairs for each multiple of 3) is consistent, as each case respects the constraints on \( h \) and \( t \). Total favorable outcomes (30) align with the systematic enumeration.

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that a three-digit number with a ones digit of 3 is divisible by 3.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the range of possible three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for divisibility by 3 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count the total number of valid numbers (completed: 90 numbers).  
  - Subgoal 4: Count the number of favorable numbers divisible by 3 (completed: 30 numbers).  
  - **Current Subgoal**: Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  

The current goal is to compute the final probability using the results from previous steps.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 3) to total outcomes (all three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3).  

[IMP]  
- Total outcomes: 90 (from Step 3).  
- Favorable outcomes: 30 (from Step 5).  
- Probability: \( \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3} \).  

The fraction is already in its simplest form, as \( \gcd(30, 90) = 30 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the probability calculation by confirming the ratio and considering an alternative approach to ensure correctness.  

[IMP]  
**Ratio Check**: \( \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3} \), which is a common fraction as required.  

**Alternative Approach**: Consider the residues modulo 3. Since the ones digit is 3 (\( \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)), divisibility depends on \( h + t \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \). The residues of \( h \) and \( t \mod 3 \):  
- \( h \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \): Residues are 1 (for 1, 4, 7), 2 (for 2, 5, 8), 0 (for 3, 6, 9). Each residue has 3 values.  
- \( t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 9\} \): Residues are 0 (for 0, 3, 6, 9), 1 (for 1, 4, 7), 2 (for 2, 5, 8). Each residue has 3 or 4 values.  

For \( h + t \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \):  
- \( h \equiv 0 \): \( t \equiv 0 \). Pairs: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \).  
- \( h \equiv 1 \): \( t \equiv 2 \). Pairs: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).  
- \( h \equiv 2 \): \( t \equiv 1 \). Pairs: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).  
Total: \( 12 + 9 + 9 = 30 \), matching earlier.  
Probability: \( \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3} \).  

The alternative confirms the result.

**Final Answer**

The probability that a three-digit positive integer with a ones digit of 3 is divisible by 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}} \]
