### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( m + n \) for the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - mx + n = 0 \), where the roots sum to 6 and multiply to 10.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( m + n \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Use the properties of quadratic equations to relate the roots’ sum and product to the coefficients \( m \) and \( n \).  
2. Set up equations based on these relationships.  
3. Solve for \( m \) and \( n \).  
4. Compute \( m + n \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to relate the roots’ sum and product to the coefficients of the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - mx + n = 0 \). For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -\frac{b}{a} \) and the product is \( \frac{c}{a} \). We will apply these formulas to derive equations for \( m \) and \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For the equation \( 2x^2 - mx + n = 0 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 2 \), \( b = -m \), \( c = n \).  
- Sum of roots: \( -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-m}{2} = \frac{m}{2} \). Given sum is 6, so \( \frac{m}{2} = 6 \implies m = 12 \).  
- Product of roots: \( \frac{c}{a} = \frac{n}{2} \). Given product is 10, so \( \frac{n}{2} = 10 \implies n = 20 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the values \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 20 \) by checking if they satisfy the conditions for the roots’ sum and product in the equation \( 2x^2 - 12x + 20 = 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( m = 12 \), \( n = 20 \) into the equation: \( 2x^2 - 12x + 20 = 0 \).  
- Sum of roots: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \), which matches the given sum.  
- Product of roots: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \), which matches the given product.  
The values are valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( m + n \) using the values \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 20 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate: \( m + n = 12 + 20 = 32 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals:  
- Main goal: Find \( m + n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Relate roots’ sum and product to coefficients (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \( m \) and \( n \) (completed: \( m = 12 \), \( n = 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( m + n \) (completed: \( 32 \)).  
**Current goal**: Confirm the solution is complete.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the value \( m + n = 32 \) has been computed and validated. The solution is complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( m + n \) is \( 32 \).
