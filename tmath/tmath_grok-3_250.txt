### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Use the properties of the roots of a quadratic equation to express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of the sum and product of the roots.  
2. Calculate \(m\) and \(n\) using the given sum (6) and product (10).  
3. Compute \(m + n\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express \(m\) and \(n\) using the sum and product of the roots.  
How to Achieve: For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the sum of the roots is \(-\frac{b}{a}\) and the product is \(\frac{c}{a}\). Apply this to \(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -m\), and \(c = n\), using the given sum (6) and product (10).

[IMP]  
For the quadratic \(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\):  
- Sum of roots: \(-\frac{-m}{2} = \frac{m}{2} = 6 \implies m = 12\).  
- Product of roots: \(\frac{n}{2} = 10 \implies n = 20\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculated values of \(m\) and \(n\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(m = 12\) and \(n = 20\) into the quadratic equation, find the roots, and check if their sum is 6 and product is 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(m = 12\), \(n = 20\) into the equation: \(2x^2 - 12x + 20 = 0\).  
Simplify: Divide by 2 to get \(x^2 - 6x + 10 = 0\).  
Solve using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), \(c = 10\):  
\[ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 40}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2i}{2} = 3 \pm i. \]  
Roots are \(3 + i\) and \(3 - i\).  
- Sum: \((3 + i) + (3 - i) = 6\).  
- Product: \((3 + i)(3 - i) = 9 - i^2 = 9 + 1 = 10\).  
The sum and product match the given values, confirming \(m = 12\) and \(n = 20\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(m + n\).  
How to Achieve: Add the values of \(m\) and \(n\) obtained from Step 2.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\(m = 12\), \(n = 20\).  
\[ m + n = 12 + 20 = 32. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(m + n\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \(m\) and \(n\) using the sum and product of the roots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate \(m\) and \(n\) (completed: \(m = 12\), \(n = 20\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify \(m\) and \(n\) (completed: roots sum to 6, product is 10).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(m + n\) (completed: \(m + n = 32\)).  
Current Goal: Compute \(m + n\) (achieved).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(m + n\) is \(32\).
