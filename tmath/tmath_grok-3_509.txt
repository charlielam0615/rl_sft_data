**Problem Statement**: We need to find the range of the function \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \), expressed as an interval \( (a, b] \), and compute \( a + b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the range of \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the function to understand its behavior.  
2. Determine the possible output values of \( g(x) \) by analyzing its domain and behavior.  
3. Identify the interval \( (a, b] \) representing the range.  
4. Compute \( a + b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the function \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \).  
How to Achieve: Factor the denominator to express the function in a simpler form, which will help analyze its behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify \( g(x) \):  
\[ g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} = \frac{2}{2(1 + 2x^2)} = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2}. \]  
This form shows the function as a constant divided by a positive expression, which will aid in finding the range.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the possible output values of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \).  
How to Achieve: Since the domain of \( g(x) \) is all real numbers (as the denominator is never zero), evaluate the function at key points and analyze its behavior as \( x \to \pm \infty \) to find the minimum and maximum values.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Analyze \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \):  
- The denominator \( 1 + 2x^2 \geq 1 \) since \( 2x^2 \geq 0 \).  
- At \( x = 0 \), \( g(0) = \frac{1}{1 + 2(0)^2} = 1 \), which is the maximum possible value since the denominator is minimized when \( x = 0 \).  
- As \( x \to \pm \infty \), \( 2x^2 \to \infty \), so \( 1 + 2x^2 \to \infty \), and \( g(x) \to \frac{1}{\infty} = 0 \).  
- Since \( 1 + 2x^2 \) is continuous and increases as \( |x| \) increases, \( g(x) \) takes all values between 0 (exclusive, as the denominator is never infinite) and 1 (inclusive, achieved at \( x = 0 \)).  

To confirm, letâ€™s try a substitution to find the range explicitly. Let \( u = 2x^2 \), so \( u \geq 0 \), and:  
\[ g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + u}, \quad u \in [0, \infty). \]  
As \( u \) ranges from 0 to \( \infty \), \( 1 + u \) ranges from 1 to \( \infty \), so:  
\[ g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + u} \]  
ranges from \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) (when \( u = 0 \)) to \( \frac{1}{\infty} \to 0 \) (as \( u \to \infty \)). Since \( u = 0 \) is achievable, 1 is included, but 0 is approached asymptotically, so not included.  

Thus, the range is \( (0, 1] \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the range \( (0, 1] \) is correct.  
How to Achieve: Check if all values in \( (0, 1] \) can be achieved by \( g(x) \) and if values outside this interval are not achievable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, solve for \( x \) such that \( g(x) = y \):  
\[ \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} = y. \]  
\[ 1 + 2x^2 = \frac{1}{y}, \]  
\[ 2x^2 = \frac{1}{y} - 1, \]  
\[ x^2 = \frac{1 - y}{2y}. \]  
For \( x \) to be real, \( x^2 \geq 0 \):  
\[ \frac{1 - y}{2y} \geq 0. \]  
Since \( 2y \) is positive (assume \( y > 0 \)), analyze \( 1 - y \geq 0 \):  
\[ y \leq 1. \]  
Also, \( y > 0 \) because \( g(x) > 0 \) (numerator and denominator are positive). If \( y = 1 \):  
\[ x^2 = \frac{1 - 1}{2 \cdot 1} = 0, \quad x = 0, \]  
which gives \( g(0) = 1 \). For \( 0 < y < 1 \), \( 1 - y > 0 \), so \( x^2 > 0 \), and real \( x \) exists. If \( y \leq 0 \), \( \frac{1}{y} \leq 0 \), so \( 1 + 2x^2 \leq 0 \), which is impossible since \( 1 + 2x^2 \geq 1 \). Thus, \( y \in (0, 1] \).  

The range \( (0, 1] \) is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the range of \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \) as \( (a, b] \) and compute \( a + b \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the range (completed, range is \( (0, 1] \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify \( a \) and \( b \) from the interval (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( a + b \).  

Current Goal: Identify \( a \) and \( b \) from the interval \( (0, 1] \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify \( a \) and \( b \) from the range \( (0, 1] \) and compute \( a + b \).  
How to Achieve: Compare the range \( (0, 1] \) with the interval \( (a, b] \), assign \( a \) and \( b \), and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The range is \( (0, 1] \), which matches \( (a, b] \). Thus:  
\[ a = 0, \quad b = 1. \]  
Compute:  
\[ a + b = 0 + 1 = 1. \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( a + b \).  
How to Achieve: Reconfirm the interval and the sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The range \( (0, 1] \) gives \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \). The sum is:  
\[ 0 + 1 = 1. \]  
This is consistent with the interval notation. To ensure correctness, note that the problem specifies \( (a, b] \), so the range must be an open interval at \( a = 0 \) and closed at \( b = 1 \), which aligns with our findings. The computation is correct.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The range of \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \) is \( (0, 1] \), so \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), and:  
\[ a + b = 1. \]  
\[ \boxed{1} \]
