**Problem Statement**  
We need to determine the range of the function \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2 \), express it as an interval \((a, b]\), and compute \( a + b \).

### Step 1: Break Down the Problem
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the range of \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \), we need to identify all possible output values of the function. The range should be expressed as an interval \((a, b]\), and then compute \( a + b \). Subgoals:  
1. Simplify the function to understand its behavior.  
2. Determine the possible values of \( g(x) \).  
3. Identify the bounds \( a \) and \( b \) of the interval \((a, b]\).  
4. Compute \( a + b \).

### Step 2: Simplify the Function
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Simplify the function \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \) to make it easier.  
**How to Achieve**: Factor out common terms in the numerator and denominator to rewrite the function in a simpler form.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the function \( g(x) = \frac{2}{2 + 4x^2} \).  
Notice the denominator: \( 2 + 4x^2 \).  
Factor out the common factor:  
\[ 2 + 4x^2 = 2(1 + 2x^2) \]  
Thus, the function becomes:  
\[ g(x) = \frac{2}{2(1 + 2x^2)} = \frac{2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \]  
The simplified function is:  
\[ g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \]  
This form is easier to analyze for finding the range.

### Step 4: Find Possible Values of \( g(x) \)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Determine the range of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the behavior of the function by evaluating the denominator \( 1 + 2x^2 \), which affects the output values, and find the minimum and maximum values of \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find the range, evaluate \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \).  
- The denominator \( 1 + 2x^2 \) depends on \( x^2 \), and since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we have:  
  \[ 2x^2 \geq 0 \implies 1 + 2x^2 \geq 1 \]  
- Thus, the denominator \( 1 + 2x^2 \) is always at least 1 and increases as \( |x| \) increases.  
- When \( x = 0 \):  
  \[ g(0) = \frac{1}{1 + 2(0)^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \]  
  This is the maximum possible value since the denominator is minimized when \( x^2 = 0 \).  
- As \( |x| \to \infty \), \( 2x^2 \to \infty \), so:  
  \[ 1 + 2x^2 \to \infty \implies g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \to 0 \]  
- For any \( x \), since \( 1 + 2x^2 \geq 1 \), we have:  
  \[ g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \leq 1 \]  
  and since \( 1 + 2x^2 > 1 \) for \( x \neq 0 \), \( g(x) < 1 \).  
- As \( x^2 \to \infty \), \( g(x) \to 0^+ \), so \( g(x) \) approaches 0 but never reaches it (since \( 1 + 2x^2 \) is never infinite for finite \( x \)).  
Thus, \( g(x) \) takes values in \( (0, 1] \).  
To confirm, consider whether \( g(x) \) can be negative:  
- Since the numerator is 1 and the denominator is positive, \( g(x) > 0 \).  
The range appears to be \( (0, 1] \).

### Step 5: Verify the Range
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Validate that the range of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \) is \( (0, 1] \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check if all values in \( (0, 1] \) can be achieved by solving \( g(x) = y \) for \( y \in (0, 1] \), and confirm no values outside this interval are possible.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, solve \( g(x) = y \) for \( y \):  
\[ \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} = y \]  
\[ 1 + 2x^2 = \frac{1}{y} \]  
\[ 2x^2 = \frac{1}{y} - 1 = \frac{1 - y}{y} \]  
\[ x^2 = \frac{1 - y}{2y} \]  
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we need:  
\[ \frac{1 - y}{2y} \geq 0 \]  
Since \( 2y > 0 \) for \( y > 0 \), this requires:  
\[ 1 - y \geq 0 \implies y \leq 1 \]  
Also, \( y > 0 \) because \( g(x) > 0 \).  
- For \( y = 1 \):  
  \[ x^2 = \frac{1 - 1}{2 \cdot 1} = 0 \implies x = 0 \]  
  Check: \( g(0) = \frac{1}{1 + 2(0)^2} = 1 \). Valid.  
- For \( 0 < y < 1 \):  
  \[ 1 - y > 0 \implies \frac{1 - y}{2y} > 0 \]  
  Thus, \( x^2 > 0 \), and:  
  \[ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - y}{2y}} \]  
  Since \( \frac{1 - y}{2y} > 0 \), the square root is real, so there exists an \( x \).  
- For \( y \leq 0 \):  
  \[ \frac{1 - y}{y} \geq 0 \]  
  If \( y < 0 \), then \( 1 - y > 0 \), but \( y < 0 \), so:  
  \[ \frac{1 - y}{y} < 0 \]  
  Thus, \( x^2 < 0 \), which is impossible. If \( y = 0 \), \( \frac{1}{y} \) is undefined.  
Hence, \( y \in (0, 1] \) produces real \( x \), and no other values do.  
The range is indeed \( (0, 1] \).

### Step 6: Identify Interval Bounds and Compute \( a + b \)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Goal**: Express the range as \((a, b]\) and compute \( a + b \).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify \( a \) and \( b \) from the range \((0, 1]\) and sum them.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The range of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 2x^2} \) is \( (0, 1] \).  
In interval notation \((a, b]\):  
- \( a = 0 \) (open endpoint, as \( g(x) \to 0 \) but never equals 0).  
- \( b = 1 \) (closed endpoint, as \( g(0) = 1 \)).  
Compute:  
\[ a + b = 0 + 1 = 1 \]
