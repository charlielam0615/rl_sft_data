### Problem Restatement
We need to find two positive integers whose squares sum to 193 and whose product is 84. Then, we must compute the sum of these two integers.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the equations based on the given conditions: the sum of the squares of two positive integers is 193, and their product is 84.
2. Solve the system of equations to find the two integers.
3. Compute the sum of the two integers.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Set up the equations based on the problem conditions.
How to Achieve: Define the two positive integers as \(x\) and \(y\). Create equations from the given conditions: \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) (sum of squares) and \(xy = 84\) (product). Use these to form a system of equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let the two positive integers be \(x\) and \(y\). From the problem:
- \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\)
- \(xy = 84\)

These equations represent the conditions that the sum of the squares of the two integers is 193 and their product is 84. We will use these equations in the next step to find \(x\) and \(y\).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the two integers.
How to Achieve: Use the equations \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) and \(xy = 84\). Express one variable in terms of the other using the product equation, substitute into the sum of squares equation, and solve the resulting quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From \(xy = 84\), we can express \(y = \frac{84}{x}\). Substitute into the sum of squares equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\):

\[
x^2 + \left(\frac{84}{x}\right)^2 = 193
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 + \frac{7056}{x^2} = 193
\]

Multiply through by \(x^2\) to eliminate the denominator:

\[
x^4 + 7056 = 193x^2
\]

Rearrange into standard quadratic form in terms of \(u = x^2\):

\[
x^4 - 193x^2 + 7056 = 0
\]

Let \(u = x^2\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
u^2 - 193u + 7056 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(u = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -193\), and \(c = 7056\):

\[
\text{Discriminant} = (-193)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7056 = 37249 - 28224 = 9025
\]

\[
\sqrt{9025} = 95
\]

\[
u = \frac{193 \pm 95}{2}
\]

\[
u = \frac{193 + 95}{2} = \frac{288}{2} = 144 \quad \text{or} \quad u = \frac{193 - 95}{2} = \frac{98}{2} = 49
\]

Since \(u = x^2\), we have:

\[
x^2 = 144 \implies x = 12 \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is a positive integer})
\]
\[
x^2 = 49 \implies x = 7
\]

For each case, find \(y\) using \(xy = 84\):

- If \(x = 12\), then \(y = \frac{84}{12} = 7\).
- If \(x = 7\), then \(y = \frac{84}{7} = 12\).

Thus, the two integers are \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) (or vice versa).

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the integers \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) satisfy both conditions.
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) into the equations \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) and \(xy = 84\) to confirm they hold.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the sum of squares:

\[
12^2 + 7^2 = 144 + 49 = 193
\]

Check the product:

\[
12 \cdot 7 = 84
\]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the integers \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) are correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum of the two integers.
How to Achieve: Add the two integers \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) to find their sum.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of the integers is:

\[
12 + 7 = 19
\]
