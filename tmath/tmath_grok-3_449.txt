**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Set up equations based on the given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Define the two positive integers as \(x\) and \(y\). Use the given conditions to form the equations \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) and \(xy = 84\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let the two positive integers be \(x\) and \(y\). From the problem:  
- \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) (sum of squares).  
- \(xy = 84\) (product).  
These equations will be used to find \(x\) and \(y\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations to find the two integers.  
How to Achieve: Use the equations \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\) and \(xy = 84\). Express \(y = 84/x\) from the product equation and substitute into the sum of squares equation to form a quadratic equation in \(x\). Solve for \(x\), then find \(y\), ensuring both are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(xy = 84\), we get \(y = 84/x\). Substitute into \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\):  
\[ x^2 + \left(\frac{84}{x}\right)^2 = 193 \]  
Multiply through by \(x^2\) to clear the denominator:  
\[ x^4 + 84^2 = 193x^2 \]  
Since \(84^2 = 7056\), the equation becomes:  
\[ x^4 + 7056 = 193x^2 \]  
Rearrange into standard form:  
\[ x^4 - 193x^2 + 7056 = 0 \]  
This is a quartic equation. To simplify, let \(u = x^2\). Then:  
\[ u^2 - 193u + 7056 = 0 \]  
Solve for \(u\) using the quadratic formula, where \(a = 1\), \(b = -193\), \(c = 7056\):  
\[ u = \frac{193 \pm \sqrt{(-193)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7056}}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ (-193)^2 - 4 \cdot 7056 = 37249 - 28224 = 9025 \]  
\[ \sqrt{9025} = 95 \]  
So:  
\[ u = \frac{193 \pm 95}{2} \]  
\[ u_1 = \frac{193 + 95}{2} = \frac{288}{2} = 144 \]  
\[ u_2 = \frac{193 - 95}{2} = \frac{98}{2} = 49 \]  
Since \(u = x^2\), we have:  
- \(x^2 = 144 \implies x = 12\) (since \(x\) is a positive integer).  
- \(x^2 = 49 \implies x = 7\).  
For each \(x\), find \(y = 84/x\):  
- If \(x = 12\), then \(y = 84/12 = 7\).  
- If \(x = 7\), then \(y = 84/7 = 12\).  
Thus, the two integers are \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\). Verify:  
- Product: \(12 \cdot 7 = 84\), which satisfies \(xy = 84\).  
- Sum of squares: \(12^2 + 7^2 = 144 + 49 = 193\), which satisfies \(x^2 + y^2 = 193\).  
The pair \((12, 7)\) is valid.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the integers satisfy all conditions.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the product and sum of squares for \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\) to confirm they match the given values (product = 84, sum of squares = 193).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\):  
- Product: \(12 \cdot 7 = 84\), which matches.  
- Sum of squares: \(12^2 + 7^2 = 144 + 49 = 193\), which matches.  
The solution is correct.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the sum of the two integers.  
How to Achieve: Add the two integers \(x = 12\) and \(y = 7\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The two integers are 12 and 7. Their sum is:  
\[ 12 + 7 = 19 \]
