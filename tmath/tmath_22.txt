Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms of the given polynomial expressions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given expressions are:  
$(9x^9+7x^8+4x^7) + (x^{11}+x^9+2x^7+3x^3+5x+8).$  

To combine like terms, identify terms with the same degree:  
- $x^{11}$: appears only once.  
- $x^9$: $9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9$.  
- $x^8$: $7x^8$.  
- $x^7$: $4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7$.  
- $x^3$: $3x^3$.  
- $x$: $5x$.  
- Constant: $8$.  

Combining these results in the simplified polynomial:  
$x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of combining like terms and ordering of the simplified polynomial.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Original polynomials: (9x^9+7x^8+4x^7) + (x^{11}+x^9+2x^7+3x^3+5x+8)

2. Combining like terms:
   - x^{11}: 1x^{11} (present in second polynomial only) ✓
   - x^9: 9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9 ✓
   - x^8: 7x^8 (present in first polynomial only) ✓
   - x^7: 4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7 ✓
   - x^3: 3x^3 (present in second polynomial only) ✓
   - x: 5x (present in second polynomial only) ✓
   - Constant: 8 (present in second polynomial only) ✓

3. Ordering check:
   Degrees in final answer: 11, 9, 8, 7, 3, 1, 0 (constant)
   This is in strictly decreasing order ✓

4. No missing terms:
   All original terms accounted for in the result ✓
   
5. Coefficient arithmetic:
   9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9 ✓
   4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7 ✓

\boxed{correct}
