**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of the piecewise function \( f(x) \) at \( x = 5 \), where the function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
3x + 5 & \text{if } x < -3, \\
7 - 4x & \text{if } x \ge -3.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( f(5) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies based on the value of \( x = 5 \).  
2. Apply the appropriate function rule to compute \( f(5) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine which piece of the piecewise function applies for \( x = 5 \). This involves checking the condition \( x \ge -3 \) or \( x < -3 \) and selecting the corresponding function rule.

Since \( x = 5 \), we check the conditions:  
- \( 5 \ge -3 \) is true, so the second piece, \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \), applies.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(5) \) using the function rule \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \). This involves substituting \( x = 5 \) into the expression and performing the arithmetic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \):  
\( f(5) = 7 - 4 \cdot 5 = 7 - 20 = -13 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( f(5) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(5) \) using the appropriate rule (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by reviewing the steps.  
The condition \( x \ge -3 \) was correctly identified for \( x = 5 \), and the computation \( f(5) = 7 - 4 \cdot 5 = -13 \) follows the function rule.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\( f(5) = -13 \)
