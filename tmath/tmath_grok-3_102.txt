### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of the piecewise function \( f(x) \) at \( x = 5 \), where:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
3x + 5 & \text{if } x < -3, \\
7 - 4x & \text{if } x \geq -3.
\end{cases}
\]

I will solve this problem step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( f(5) \), we need to:  
1. Determine which piece of the piecewise function applies by evaluating the condition for \( x = 5 \).  
2. Apply the appropriate function rule to compute \( f(5) \).  
3. Verify the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine which piece of the piecewise function applies for \( x = 5 \). This involves checking whether \( 5 < -3 \) or \( 5 \geq -3 \), then selecting the corresponding function rule.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find \( f(5) \), we evaluate the condition:  
- \( x = 5 \).  
- Check if \( 5 < -3 \): This is false since \( 5 > -3 \).  
- Check if \( 5 \geq -3 \): This is true since \( 5 > -3 \).  

Thus, we use the second piece of the function: \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \) for \( x \geq -3 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(5) \) using the function rule \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \), since \( x = 5 \) satisfies \( x \geq -3 \). This involves substituting \( x = 5 \) into the expression and calculating the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \):  
- Substitute \( x = 5 \):  
  \[
  f(5) = 7 - 4 \cdot 5 = 7 - 20 = -13.
  \]  
So, \( f(5) = -13 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of \( f(5) = -13 \) by checking the condition and computation for accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Reconfirm the condition: \( x = 5 \geq -3 \), so \( f(x) = 7 - 4x \) is correct.  
- Recalculate: \( f(5) = 7 - 4 \cdot 5 = 7 - 20 = -13 \).  
- Check the other piece: If \( x < -3 \), we use \( 3x + 5 \), but since \( 5 \not< -3 \), this does not apply.  
The computation is consistent, and the condition is correctly applied.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( f(5) \) for the given piecewise function.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine which piece of the function applies for \( x = 5 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(5) \) using the appropriate function rule. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result for accuracy. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm that all subgoals have been addressed and to finalize the solution. Since all subgoals are completed, the main goal is achieved with \( f(5) = -13 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[
f(5) = -13
\]
