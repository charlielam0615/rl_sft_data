**Problem Restatement**: I need to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{28x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} \cdot \sqrt{21x}\) and express the answer in simplest radical form in terms of \(x\).

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to simplify the expression. My plan is to:  
1. Combine the square roots into a single square root by multiplying the radicands.  
2. Simplify the resulting expression inside the square root by factoring into perfect squares and remaining terms.  
3. Express the final answer in simplest radical form.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Combine the square roots into a single square root.  
How to Achieve: Use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\) to multiply the radicands together, including the variable \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I start by multiplying the three square roots: \(\sqrt{28x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} \cdot \sqrt{21x}\). Using the property \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\), I combine them into a single square root:  
\(\sqrt{28x \cdot 15x \cdot 21x}\).  
Next, I multiply the numerical parts and the variable parts separately:  
\(28 \cdot 15 \cdot 21\) for the numbers, and \(x \cdot x \cdot x = x^3\) for the variable.  
So, the expression becomes \(\sqrt{28 \cdot 15 \cdot 21 \cdot x^3}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Simplify the numerical part inside the square root by calculating the product of 28, 15, and 21.  
How to Achieve: Compute the product of the numbers step by step to get a single value for the radicand's numerical coefficient.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I calculate the product of the numerical coefficients:  
First, \(28 \cdot 15 = 420\).  
Then, \(420 \cdot 21 = 8820\).  
So, the expression inside the square root is \(8820 \cdot x^3\), making it \(\sqrt{8820 x^3}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Simplify the radicand \(8820 x^3\) by factoring into perfect squares.  
How to Achieve: Factor 8820 into its prime factors to identify perfect squares, and handle \(x^3\) by separating it into \(x^2 \cdot x\), where \(x^2\) is a perfect square.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I begin by factoring 8820 into prime factors:  
\(8820 \div 2 = 4410\),  
\(4410 \div 2 = 2205\),  
\(2205 \div 3 = 735\),  
\(735 \div 3 = 245\),  
\(245 \div 5 = 49\),  
\(49 \div 7 = 7\),  
\(7 \div 7 = 1\).  
So, the prime factorization of 8820 is \(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^2\).  
For \(x^3\), I can write it as \(x^2 \cdot x\), where \(x^2\) is a perfect square.  
Now, the radicand \(8820 x^3 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2 \cdot x^2 \cdot x\).  
I group the perfect squares together: \((2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2 \cdot x^2) \cdot (5 \cdot x)\).  
Taking the square root, \(\sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2 \cdot x^2) \cdot (5 \cdot x)} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^2 \cdot x^2} \cdot \sqrt{5 \cdot x}\).  
Simplifying the perfect squares: \(\sqrt{2^2} = 2\), \(\sqrt{3^2} = 3\), \(\sqrt{7^2} = 7\), \(\sqrt{x^2} = x\) (assuming \(x \geq 0\)).  
So, this becomes \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot x \cdot \sqrt{5x} = 42x \cdot \sqrt{5x}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Verify the simplification of the expression to ensure correctness.  
How to Achieve: Double-check the prime factorization of 8820 and the handling of the variable \(x\), then confirm the final form is the simplest radical form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I verify the prime factorization of 8820: \(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2 = 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 49\). Calculating step-by-step: \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\), \(36 \cdot 5 = 180\), \(180 \cdot 49 = 8820\), which matches.  
For \(x^3\), splitting into \(x^2 \cdot x\) is correct, and taking the square root gives \(x \cdot \sqrt{x}\).  
The numerical part outside the square root is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 42\), and the remaining radicand is \(5 \cdot x = 5x\), so the expression \(42x \cdot \sqrt{5x}\) appears correct.  
I also confirm that \(\sqrt{5x}\) cannot be simplified further since 5 is prime and \(x\) is a variable (assuming \(x\) is not a perfect square). Thus, the expression is in simplest radical form.
