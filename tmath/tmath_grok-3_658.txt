**Problem Statement**: We need to find the probability that at least 5 heads appear when a fair coin is flipped 7 times.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this, break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes for 7 coin flips.
2. Identify the favorable outcomes (at least 5 heads, i.e., 5, 6, or 7 heads).
3. Calculate the probability of getting exactly 5, 6, and 7 heads using the binomial probability formula.
4. Sum these probabilities to find the probability of at least 5 heads.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for 7 coin flips.
How to Achieve: Since each flip has 2 outcomes (heads or tails) and the coin is flipped 7 times, compute \(2^7\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
A fair coin has 2 possible outcomes per flip. For 7 flips, the total number of outcomes is:
\[ 2^7 = 128 \]
So, there are 128 possible outcomes.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads.
How to Achieve: Use the binomial probability formula \( P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n = 7 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( p = 0.5 \) for a fair coin.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The binomial probability formula is:
\[ P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]
For \( n = 7 \), \( k = 5 \), \( p = 0.5 \):
- \(\binom{7}{5} = \frac{7!}{5!(7-5)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6}{2 \cdot 1} = 21\)
- \( p^k = (0.5)^5 = \frac{1}{32} \)
- \( (1-p)^{n-k} = (0.5)^{7-5} = (0.5)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
So:
\[ P(5) = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{21}{128} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 6 heads.
How to Achieve: Apply the binomial probability formula with \( n = 7 \), \( k = 6 \), \( p = 0.5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the binomial formula:
- \(\binom{7}{6} = \frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = 7\)
- \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \)
- \( (0.5)^{7-6} = (0.5)^1 = 0.5 \)
So:
\[ P(6) = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{64} \cdot 0.5 = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{7}{128} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 7 heads.
How to Achieve: Apply the binomial probability formula with \( n = 7 \), \( k = 7 \), \( p = 0.5 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the binomial formula:
- \(\binom{7}{7} = 1\)
- \( (0.5)^7 = \frac{1}{128} \)
- \( (0.5)^{7-7} = (0.5)^0 = 1 \)
So:
\[ P(7) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{128} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{128} \]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the probability of at least 5 heads in 7 coin flips.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total outcomes (completed: 128 outcomes).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate probability of exactly 5 heads (completed: \(\frac{21}{128}\)).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate probability of exactly 6 heads (completed: \(\frac{7}{128}\)).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate probability of exactly 7 heads (completed: \(\frac{1}{128}\)).
  - Subgoal 5: Sum probabilities for at least 5 heads (pending).
Current Goal: Sum the probabilities of getting 5, 6, and 7 heads to find the probability of at least 5 heads.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum the probabilities of getting 5, 6, and 7 heads to find the probability of at least 5 heads.
How to Achieve: Add the probabilities \( P(5) + P(6) + P(7) \), using a common denominator.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Sum the probabilities:
\[ P(\text{at least 5}) = P(5) + P(6) + P(7) = \frac{21}{128} + \frac{7}{128} + \frac{1}{128} = \frac{21 + 7 + 1}{128} = \frac{29}{128} \]
To express as a decimal (optional):
\[ \frac{29}{128} \approx 0.2265625 \]
So, the probability is \(\frac{29}{128}\) or approximately 0.227.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the calculated probability.
How to Achieve: Check calculations by ensuring the binomial coefficients and probabilities are correct, and consider an alternative method (e.g., complementary probability).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify binomial coefficients:
- \(\binom{7}{5} = 21\), \(\binom{7}{6} = 7\), \(\binom{7}{7} = 1\) are correct.
- Probabilities: \( P(5) = \frac{21}{128} \), \( P(6) = \frac{7}{128} \), \( P(7) = \frac{1}{128} \).
Alternative method (complementary probability):
- At least 5 heads = 1 - P(fewer than 5 heads) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4)].
- Compute: \( P(k) = \binom{7}{k} (0.5)^7 \), since \( (0.5)^k (0.5)^{7-k} = (0.5)^7 = \frac{1}{128} \).
  - \( P(0) = \binom{7}{0} \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{1}{128} \)
  - \( P(1) = \binom{7}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{7}{128} \)
  - \( P(2) = \binom{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{21}{128} \)
  - \( P(3) = \binom{7}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{35}{128} \)
  - \( P(4) = \binom{7}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{128} = \frac{35}{128} \)
- Sum: \(\frac{1 + 7 + 21 + 35 + 35}{128} = \frac{99}{128}\)
- Complementary: \( 1 - \frac{99}{128} = \frac{29}{128} \).
Both methods agree, confirming the result.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability of getting at least 5 heads in 7 flips of a fair coin is \(\frac{29}{128}\) or approximately 0.227.
