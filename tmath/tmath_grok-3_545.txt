**Problem Restatement**: Andrew's grandfather's age is currently twelve times Andrew's age. When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 55 years old. We need to determine Andrew's current age.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve this problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Define variables for Andrew's and his grandfather's current ages.  
2. Set up equations based on the given information about their ages.  
3. Solve the equations to find Andrew's current age.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations based on the problem's conditions.  
How to Achieve: Let Andrew's current age be \( A \). Since his grandfather's age is twelve times Andrew's, the grandfather's current age is \( 12A \). Additionally, when Andrew was born (i.e., \( A \) years ago), his grandfather was 55 years old, so the grandfather's current age can also be expressed as \( 55 + A \). Equate these expressions to form an equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( A \) be Andrew's current age.  
- Grandfather's current age: \( 12A \).  
- Since Andrew was born \( A \) years ago, the grandfather's age at that time was \( 12A - A = 55 \).  
This gives the equation:  
\[ 12A - A = 55 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 11A = 55 \]  
Solve for \( A \):  
\[ A = \frac{55}{11} = 5 \]  
So, Andrew's current age is 5 years.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if the calculated age satisfies all conditions.  
How to Achieve: Substitute Andrew's age (\( A = 5 \)) into the conditions to ensure the grandfather's current age is twelve times Andrew's and that the grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- If Andrew is 5 years old, the grandfather's current age is \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \).  
- When Andrew was born (\( 5 \) years ago), the grandfather's age was \( 60 - 5 = 55 \), which matches the given condition.  
Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine Andrew's current age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables for Andrew's and his grandfather's ages. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve equations based on the problem's conditions. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution. (Completed)  
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, as Andrew's age is calculated and verified.  
Andrew is 5 years old.
