**Problem Restatement**: Andrew's grandfather's age is currently twelve times Andrew's age. When Andrew was born, his grandfather was 55 years old. We need to determine Andrew's current age.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for Andrew's current age and his grandfather's current age.  
2. Set up equations based on the given relationships (grandfather's age is twelve times Andrew's age, and grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born).  
3. Solve the equations to find Andrew's current age.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Define variables and set up equations based on the problem's relationships.  
How to Achieve: Let Andrew's current age be \( A \). Then, his grandfather's current age is \( 12A \). Since the grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born, and Andrew is now \( A \) years old, the grandfather's age at Andrew's birth was \( 12A - A = 55 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( A \) be Andrew's current age.  
- Grandfather's current age is \( 12A \).  
- When Andrew was born, Andrew's age was 0, so the grandfather's age was \( 12A - A = 11A \).  
- Given that the grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born, we have the equation:  
  \( 11A = 55 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the equation to find Andrew's current age.  
How to Achieve: Solve \( 11A = 55 \) for \( A \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\( 11A = 55 \)  
\( A = \frac{55}{11} = 5 \)  
So, Andrew's current age is 5 years.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies all given conditions.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( A = 5 \) into the relationships: check if the grandfather's current age is twelve times Andrew's age and if the grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- If Andrew is 5 years old, the grandfather's current age is \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \).  
- When Andrew was born, Andrew was 0 years old, so 5 years ago, the grandfather was \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).  
- Both conditions are satisfied:  
  - Grandfather's current age (\( 60 \)) is twelve times Andrew's age (\( 5 \)).  
  - Grandfather was 55 when Andrew was born.  
The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Determine Andrew's current age.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equations to find Andrew's age (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is achieved, as Andrew's current age is 5 years, and the solution has been validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: Andrew is 5 years old.
