**Problem Statement**: Find the 205th term of a geometric sequence where the first term is 6 and the second term is -6.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the 205th term of the geometric sequence, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Determine the common ratio of the sequence.  
2. Derive the general formula for the nth term of the geometric sequence.  
3. Calculate the 205th term using the formula.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence.  
How to Achieve: Divide the second term by the first term to find the common ratio \( r \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given the first term \( a_1 = 6 \) and the second term \( a_2 = -6 \), the common ratio \( r \) is calculated as:  
\[ r = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-6}{6} = -1 \]  
The common ratio is \( r = -1 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Derive the general formula for the nth term of the geometric sequence.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, \( a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \), with the known values of \( a_1 \) and \( r \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:  
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \]  
Given \( a_1 = 6 \) and \( r = -1 \), the formula becomes:  
\[ a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the 205th term using the formula.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( n = 205 \) into the formula \( a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \) and compute the result.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the formula \( a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \), calculate the 205th term (\( n = 205 \)):  
\[ a_{205} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{205-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{204} \]  
Since 204 is even, \( (-1)^{204} = 1 \). Thus:  
\[ a_{205} = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \]  
The 205th term is 6.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculation of the 205th term.  
How to Achieve: Check the pattern of the sequence for the first few terms to confirm the formula and then re-evaluate the 205th term.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the formula \( a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \), compute the first few terms:  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( a_1 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{1-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^0 = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \)  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( a_2 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{2-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^1 = 6 \cdot (-1) = -6 \)  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( a_3 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{3-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^2 = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \)  
- For \( n = 4 \): \( a_4 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{4-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^3 = 6 \cdot (-1) = -6 \)  
The sequence alternates: 6, -6, 6, -6, ...  
Since \( n = 205 \) is odd, \( a_{205} \) should be 6 (matching odd-indexed terms). Recompute:  
\[ a_{205} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{204} = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \]  
The calculation is consistent with the pattern.
