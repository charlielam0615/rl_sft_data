### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the 205th term of the geometric sequence, we need to:  
1. Determine the common ratio of the sequence.  
2. Identify the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.  
3. Apply the formula to find the 205th term.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the common ratio of the geometric sequence. This can be achieved by dividing the second term by the first term.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given the first term \( a_1 = 6 \) and the second term \( a_2 = -6 \), the common ratio \( r \) is calculated as:  
\[ r = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-6}{6} = -1 \]  
The common ratio is \( r = -1 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the 205th term of the geometric sequence.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the common ratio (completed: \( r = -1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the general formula for the nth term (pending).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence. This can be achieved by recalling the standard formula for a geometric sequence and applying the known values of the first term and common ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:  
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \]  
where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the term number.  
Given \( a_1 = 6 \) and \( r = -1 \), the formula for the nth term is:  
\[ a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the formula for the nth term. This can be achieved by checking if the formula correctly produces the first and second terms of the sequence.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the formula \( a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \):  
- For \( n = 1 \):  
  \[ a_1 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{1-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^0 = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \]  
  This matches the given first term.  
- For \( n = 2 \):  
  \[ a_2 = 6 \cdot (-1)^{2-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^1 = 6 \cdot (-1) = -6 \]  
  This matches the given second term.  
The formula is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the 205th term using the validated formula. This can be achieved by substituting \( n = 205 \) into the formula \( a_n = 6 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the 205th term (\( a_{205} \)):  
\[ a_{205} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{205-1} = 6 \cdot (-1)^{204} \]  
Since \( 204 \) is even, \( (-1)^{204} = 1 \). Thus:  
\[ a_{205} = 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \]  
The 205th term is 6.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation of the 205th term. This can be achieved by considering the pattern of the sequence and confirming the result.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The sequence alternates due to the common ratio \( r = -1 \):  
- \( a_1 = 6 \), \( a_2 = -6 \), \( a_3 = 6 \), \( a_4 = -6 \), and so on.  
The terms follow the pattern: odd-numbered terms (\( n = 1, 3, 5, \ldots \)) are 6, and even-numbered terms (\( n = 2, 4, 6, \ldots \)) are -6.  
Since \( n = 205 \) is odd, the 205th term should be 6, which matches the calculated result \( a_{205} = 6 \).  
The calculation is valid.  
[/IMP]
