Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $ B = 4 $ into the equation $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $ and set it equal to 58.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given the operation $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $, we substitute $ B = 4 $ and $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 58 $:  

$$
A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 3A + 2(4) + 5 = 58
$$

Simplify the constants on the right-hand side:  

$$
3A + 8 + 5 = 58
$$

$$
3A + 13 = 58
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ 3A + 13 = 58 $ for $ A $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve $ 3A + 13 = 58 $, subtract 13 from both sides:  

$$
3A = 58 - 13
$$

$$
3A = 45
$$

Now divide both sides by 3:  

$$
A = \frac{45}{3}
$$

$$
A = 15
$$

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The process and key steps taken to solve $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 58 $ using the given operation $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The relevant information for solving $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 58 $ is as follows:  

1. The operation is defined as $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $.  
2. Substituting $ B = 4 $ into the operation gives $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 3A + 2(4) + 5 = 3A + 8 + 5 = 3A + 13 $.  
3. Setting $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 58 $, we formed the equation $ 3A + 13 = 58 $.  
4. Solving this equation involved subtracting 13 from both sides to get $ 3A = 45 $, then dividing by 3 to find $ A = 15 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Validate the correctness of the solution for $ A $ in the equation $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 58 $, where $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Original Equation**:  
   $ A\ \clubsuit\ B = 3A + 2B + 5 $.  
   Substituting $ B = 4 $:  
   $ A\ \clubsuit\ 4 = 3A + 2(4) + 5 = 3A + 8 + 5 = 3A + 13 $.  
   Setting this equal to 58: $ 3A + 13 = 58 $.  

2. **Solving the Equation**:  
   - Subtract 13 from both sides: $ 3A = 58 - 13 = 45 $.  
   - Divide by 3: $ A = 45 / 3 = 15 $.  

3. **Verification of Result**:  
   Substitute $ A = 15 $ into the original operation:  
   $ 3(15) + 2(4) + 5 = 45 + 8 + 5 = 58 $.  
   This matches the target value, confirming the solution is correct.  

4. **Critical Analysis**:  
   - The substitution of $ B = 4 $ into the operation was performed correctly.  
   - The arithmetic steps (simplifying constants, solving for $ A $) are logically sound and error-free.  
   - The final verification step confirms the result satisfies the original equation.  

No inconsistencies or errors were identified in the reasoning or calculations.
