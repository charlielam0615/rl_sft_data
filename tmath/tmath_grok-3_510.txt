**Problem Statement**: Mark is at coordinate (0, 7), and Sandy is at (-4, -1). They plan to meet at the midpoint of their coordinates. We need to find the coordinate where they will meet.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the concept of a midpoint between two coordinates.  
2. Identify the formula for finding the midpoint of two points in a coordinate plane.  
3. Apply the formula using Mark’s and Sandy’s coordinates.  
4. Verify the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the midpoint of the coordinates (0, 7) and (-4, -1). This will be achieved by applying the midpoint formula, which averages the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The midpoint formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:  
\[
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]  
For Mark at (0, 7) and Sandy at (-4, -1):  
- \(x_1 = 0\), \(y_1 = 7\), \(x_2 = -4\), \(y_2 = -1\).  
- x-coordinate of midpoint: \(\frac{0 + (-4)}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\).  
- y-coordinate of midpoint: \(\frac{7 + (-1)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\).  
Thus, the midpoint is (-2, 3).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the midpoint calculation (-2, 3). This will be achieved by checking if the distances from each point to the midpoint are equal, confirming it lies exactly halfway.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate, calculate the distances from Mark’s point (0, 7) and Sandy’s point (-4, -1) to the midpoint (-2, 3) using the distance formula:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  

- Distance from Mark (0, 7) to midpoint (-2, 3):  
\[
\sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472
\]  

- Distance from Sandy (-4, -1) to midpoint (-2, 3):  
\[
\sqrt{((-4) - (-2))^2 + ((-1) - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472
\]  

Both distances are equal, confirming the midpoint is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the coordinate where Mark and Sandy meet.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the concept of a midpoint (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the midpoint formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula to calculate the midpoint (completed, result: (-2, 3)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed, distances equal).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the midpoint (-2, 3) has been calculated and verified.

**Final Answer**: Mark and Sandy will meet at the coordinate (-2, 3).
