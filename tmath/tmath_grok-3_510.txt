### Problem Statement
Mark is at the coordinate (0, 7), and Sandy is at (-4, -1). They plan to meet at the midpoint of their coordinates. We need to determine the coordinates of their meeting point.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the midpoint:  
1. Identify the coordinates of Mark and Sandy.  
2. Apply the midpoint formula to calculate the meeting point.  
3. Verify the result.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the midpoint of Mark’s coordinate (0, 7) and Sandy’s coordinate (-4, -1) using the midpoint formula. The midpoint formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\). We will apply this formula to find the coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the midpoint:  
- Mark’s coordinates: (0, 7)  
- Sandy’s coordinates: (-4, -1)  
- Midpoint formula: \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\)  

Calculate the x-coordinate:  
\(\frac{0 + (-4)}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)  

Calculate the y-coordinate:  
\(\frac{7 + (-1)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\)  

The midpoint is (-2, 3).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that (-2, 3) is the correct midpoint by checking if it lies equidistant from Mark’s and Sandy’s coordinates using the distance formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use the distance formula \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\) to check the distance from the midpoint (-2, 3) to both points:  

- Distance from (-2, 3) to Mark (0, 7):  
\(\sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47\)  

- Distance from (-2, 3) to Sandy (-4, -1):  
\(\sqrt{((-4) - (-2))^2 + ((-1) - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47\)  

Both distances are equal, confirming that (-2, 3) is the midpoint.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the midpoint of Mark’s and Sandy’s coordinates.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the coordinates of Mark and Sandy (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the midpoint formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, as all subgoals have been addressed.  
The midpoint coordinate is (-2, 3).

### Final Answer
Mark and Sandy will meet at the coordinate **(-2, 3)**.
