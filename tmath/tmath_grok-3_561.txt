**Problem Statement**: We need to find all positive values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = 15\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation.  
1. Simplify the given expression by combining the square roots.  
2. Set up the resulting equation and solve for \( x \).  
3. Verify that the solutions are positive and satisfy the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x}\). This will be achieved by using properties of square roots to combine the terms into a single expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The product of square roots can be combined as follows:  
\[
\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = \sqrt{(8x) \cdot (10x) \cdot (3x) \cdot (15x)}.
\]  
Calculate the product inside the square root:  
\[
8x \cdot 10x \cdot 3x \cdot 15x = (8 \cdot 10 \cdot 3 \cdot 15) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x) = 3600 \cdot x^4.
\]  
Thus, the expression becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{3600 x^4} = \sqrt{3600} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} = 60 \cdot x^2,
\]  
since \(\sqrt{3600} = 60\) and \(\sqrt{x^4} = (x^4)^{1/2} = x^2\) (noting that \( x \) is positive).  
The equation is now:  
\[
60 x^2 = 15.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( 60 x^2 = 15 \) for \( x \). This will be achieved by isolating \( x^2 \) and taking the square root, ensuring \( x \) is positive.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the equation:  
\[
60 x^2 = 15.
\]  
Divide both sides by 60:  
\[
x^2 = \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]  
Take the square root of both sides:  
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]  
Since \( x \) must be positive, discard \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \). Thus, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the original equation \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = 15\). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into the original expression and checking if the result equals 15.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):  
\[
8x = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4, \quad 10x = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 5, \quad 3x = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}, \quad 15x = 15 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{15}{2}.
\]  
The expression becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}}.
\]  
Combine the terms under a single square root:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{15}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \cdot 15}{2 \cdot 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{45}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 5}}{2} = \frac{3 \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{3 \sqrt{5}}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3 \cdot 5 = 15.
\]  
The left-hand side equals 15, so \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the equation.

### Step 5

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find all positive \( x \) such that \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = 15\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the expression (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed, found \( x = \frac{1}{2} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm if there are other possible positive solutions or finalize the solution set.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm whether there are other positive solutions for \( x \). This will be achieved by analyzing the equation \( 60 x^2 = 15 \) to ensure all solutions have been considered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The equation \( 60 x^2 = 15 \) was solved as:  
\[
x^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]  
Taking the square root gives:  
\[
x = \pm \frac{1}{2}.
\]  
Since \( x \) must be positive, only \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) was considered. The quadratic equation \( x^2 = \frac{1}{4} \) has exactly one positive root, and no other positive solutions are possible. Additionally, the function \( f(x) = 60 x^2 \) is monotonically increasing for \( x > 0 \), confirming a unique positive solution where \( 60 x^2 = 15 \).
