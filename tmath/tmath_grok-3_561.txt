### Problem Restatement
We need to find all positive values of \( x \) such that the product of square roots satisfies the equation:

\[
\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = 15
\]

Since \( x \) is positive, all square roots are real and positive, and we aim to solve for \( x \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the equation, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Simplify the product of the square roots by combining them into a single expression.
2. Set the simplified expression equal to 15 and solve the resulting equation.
3. Verify the solutions to ensure they are positive and satisfy the original equation.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the product \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x}\).
How to Achieve: Use the property of square roots, \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}\), to combine the product into a single square root, then simplify the expression inside.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Combine the square roots:

\[
\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = \sqrt{(8x) \cdot (10x) \cdot (3x) \cdot (15x)}
\]

Calculate the product inside the square root:

\[
(8x) \cdot (10x) \cdot (3x) \cdot (15x) = 8 \cdot 10 \cdot 3 \cdot 15 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x = 3600 \cdot x^4
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{3600 x^4} = \sqrt{3600} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} = 60 \cdot x^2
\]

The simplified product is:

\[
60 x^2
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the equation \( 60 x^2 = 15 \).
How to Achieve: Set the simplified expression equal to 15, isolate \( x^2 \), and solve for \( x \), ensuring solutions are positive.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Set the equation:

\[
60 x^2 = 15
\]

Solve for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Since \( x \) must be positive, discard \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \). Thus:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2}
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the original equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into the original equation and compute the product to check if it equals 15.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\sqrt{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{10 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{15 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}}
\]

Compute each term:

\[
\sqrt{4} = 2, \quad \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{5}, \quad \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Combine:

\[
2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3 \cdot 15}}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 2}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{45}}{2} = \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 45} = \sqrt{225} = 15
\]

The product equals 15, so \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find all positive \( x \) such that \(\sqrt{8x} \cdot \sqrt{10x} \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{15x} = 15\).
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the product of square roots (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation (completed, found \( x = \frac{1}{2} \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution (completed, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is valid).

Current Goal: Ensure all possible solutions have been found.

The equation \( 60 x^2 = 15 \) is quadratic in \( x^2 \), yielding one positive solution \( x = \frac{1}{2} \). Since the function \( f(x) = 60 x^2 \) is monotonically increasing for \( x > 0 \), and the original equation involves even powers of \( x \), no other positive solutions exist.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-data: Retrieve information related to the nature of the equation to confirm no other solutions exist, focusing on the quadratic form and domain constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The equation was reduced to \( 60 x^2 = 15 \), a quadratic equation in \( x^2 \). Solving gave \( x^2 = \frac{1}{4} \), with \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) (positive). The original equation involves square roots, requiring \( x > 0 \), and the product \( 60 x^2 \) is a quadratic function with a single positive root for \( x^2 \). Previous steps (Step 3, Step 5) confirm the solutionâ€™s uniqueness due to the monotonicity of the function for positive \( x \).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The only positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2}
\]
