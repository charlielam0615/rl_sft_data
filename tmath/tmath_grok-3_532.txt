### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of integer values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \) is **not satisfied**. This means we are looking for the integer values of \( x \) where \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \) in standard form.  
2. Solve the corresponding equation \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 = 20 \) to find the boundary points.  
3. Determine the intervals where the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \) holds.  
4. Identify the integer values of \( x \) within those intervals.  
5. Count the number of such integers.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the inequality in standard form and solve the corresponding equation to find boundary points.  
**How to Achieve**: Subtract 20 from both sides to get \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 - 20 \leq 0 \), which simplifies to \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \). Then, solve the equation \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 = 0 \) to find the roots, which will define the boundary points of the inequality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the inequality:  
\[ 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \]  
Subtract 20 from both sides:  
\[ 5x^2 + 19x + 16 - 20 \leq 0 \]  
\[ 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \]  

Now, solve the equation \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 5 \), \( b = 19 \), and \( c = -4 \).  

Calculate the discriminant:  
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 19^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-4) = 361 + 80 = 441 \]  
\[ \sqrt{441} = 21 \]  

Compute the roots:  
\[ x = \frac{-19 \pm 21}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-19 \pm 21}{10} \]  
- First root:  
\[ x_1 = \frac{-19 + 21}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2 \]  
- Second root:  
\[ x_2 = \frac{-19 - 21}{10} = \frac{-40}{10} = -4 \]  

The roots of the equation are \( x = 0.2 \) and \( x = -4 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the intervals where the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \) holds.  
**How to Achieve**: Since the quadratic \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \) has a positive leading coefficient (\( a = 5 \)), the parabola opens upward. The inequality \( \leq 0 \) holds between the roots (including the endpoints). Test the intervals defined by the roots \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 0.2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The roots divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -4) \), \( [-4, 0.2] \), and \( (0.2, \infty) \). Test a point in each interval to determine where \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \).  

- **Interval \( (-\infty, -4) \)**: Test \( x = -5 \).  
\[ 5(-5)^2 + 19(-5) - 4 = 5 \cdot 25 - 95 - 4 = 125 - 95 - 4 = 26 \]  
Since \( 26 > 0 \), the inequality does not hold in \( (-\infty, -4) \).  

- **Interval \( [-4, 0.2] \)**: Test \( x = 0 \).  
\[ 5(0)^2 + 19(0) - 4 = -4 \]  
Since \( -4 \leq 0 \), the inequality holds at \( x = 0 \). Check the endpoints:  
- At \( x = -4 \):  
\[ 5(-4)^2 + 19(-4) - 4 = 5 \cdot 16 - 76 - 4 = 80 - 76 - 4 = 0 \]  
- At \( x = 0.2 \):  
\[ 5(0.2)^2 + 19(0.2) - 4 = 5 \cdot 0.04 + 3.8 - 4 = 0.2 + 3.8 - 4 = 0 \]  
The inequality holds at the endpoints (\( \leq 0 \)).  

- **Interval \( (0.2, \infty) \)**: Test \( x = 1 \).  
\[ 5(1)^2 + 19(1) - 4 = 5 + 19 - 4 = 20 \]  
Since \( 20 > 0 \), the inequality does not hold in \( (0.2, \infty) \).  

Thus, the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \) holds for \( x \in [-4, 0.2] \).

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the integer values of \( x \) within the interval \( [-4, 0.2] \).  
**How to Achieve**: List all integers from \( x = -4 \) to the largest integer less than or equal to \( 0.2 \), which is \( 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The interval \( [-4, 0.2] \) includes \( x = -4 \) and all integers up to \( x = 0 \) (since \( 0 \leq 0.2 \)). The integers in this range are:  
\[ -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of integer values of \( x \) where the inequality is satisfied.  
**How to Achieve**: Count the integers identified in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The integers are \( -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \). There are 5 integers.

### Step 6: Track Goals

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of integer values of \( x \) for which \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \) is not satisfied (i.e., \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \)).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the inequality in standard form (completed: \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \leq 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation \( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 = 0 \) to find boundary points (completed: roots at \( x = -4, 0.2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the intervals where the inequality holds (completed: \( x \in [-4, 0.2] \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify integer values in the interval (completed: \( -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Count the integers (completed: 5 integers).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the count of integers satisfies the problem requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking the inequality at the boundary points and ensuring all integers are accounted for.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the inequality at the integer points and confirm the interval boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the inequality \( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \leq 20 \) at the integers \( -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \):  
- \( x = -4 \): \( 5(-4)^2 + 19(-4) + 16 = 80 - 76 + 16 = 20 \leq 20 \) (satisfied).  
- \( x = -3 \): \( 5(-3)^2 + 19(-3) + 16 = 45 - 57 + 16 = 4 \leq 20 \) (satisfied).  
- \( x = -2 \): \( 5(-2)^2 + 19(-2) + 16 = 20 - 38 + 16 = -2 \leq 20 \) (satisfied).  
- \( x = -1 \): \( 5(-1)^2 + 19(-1) + 16 = 5 - 19 + 16 = 2 \leq 20 \) (satisfied).  
- \( x = 0 \): \( 5(0)^2 + 19(0) + 16 = 16 \leq 20 \) (satisfied).  

Check points outside the interval to confirm:  
- \( x = -5 \): \( 5(-5)^2 + 19(-5) + 16 = 125 - 95 + 16 = 46 > 20 \) (not satisfied).  
- \( x = 1 \): \( 5(1)^2 + 19(1) + 16 = 5 + 19 + 16 = 40 > 20 \) (not satisfied).  

The integers \( -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \) satisfy the inequality, and integers outside \( [-4, 0.2] \) do not. The count of 5 integers is consistent.
