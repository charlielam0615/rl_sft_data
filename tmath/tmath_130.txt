Goal of this step: Isolate one square root and square both sides.

Starting with the equation:
$$
\sqrt{5 + x} + \sqrt{20 - x} = 7
$$
Subtract $\sqrt{20 - x}$ from both sides to isolate one square root:
$$
\sqrt{5 + x} = 7 - \sqrt{20 - x}
$$
Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:
$$
(\sqrt{5 + x})^2 = (7 - \sqrt{20 - x})^2
$$
$$
5 + x = 49 - 14\sqrt{20 - x} + (20 - x)
$$
$$
5 + x = 69 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
$$

Goal of this step: Simplify the resulting equation after squaring.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting from:
$$
5 + x = 69 - x - 14\sqrt{20 - x}
$$
Bring like terms together. Add $x$ to both sides and subtract 69 from both sides:
$$
5 + x - 69 + x = -14\sqrt{20 - x}
$$
$$
2x - 64 = -14\sqrt{20 - x}
$$
Divide both sides by -2 to simplify:
$$
x - 32 = -7\sqrt{20 - x}
$$

Goal of this step: Isolate the square root term and square both sides again.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the simplified equation:  
$$
x - 32 = -7\sqrt{20 - x}
$$  
Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
$$
(x - 32)^2 = (-7\sqrt{20 - x})^2
$$  
$$
x^2 - 64x + 1024 = 49(20 - x)
$$  
$$
x^2 - 64x + 1024 = 980 - 49x
$$  
Bring all terms to one side:  
$$
x^2 - 64x + 1024 - 980 + 49x = 0
$$  
$$
x^2 - 15x + 44 = 0
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 15x + 44 = 0$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 15x + 44 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:  
$$
x = \frac{-(-15) \pm \sqrt{(-15)^2 - 4(1)(44)}}{2(1)}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{225 - 176}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
$$  
$$
x = \frac{15 \pm 7}{2}
$$  
$$
x = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4
$$

Goal of this step: Substitute the values of $x$ into $(5 + x)(20 - x)$ and simplify.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now substitute $x = 11$ and $x = 4$ into the expression $(5 + x)(20 - x)$:  

1. For $x = 11$:  
$$
(5 + x)(20 - x) = (5 + 11)(20 - 11) = (16)(9) = 144
$$

2. For $x = 4$:  
$$
(5 + x)(20 - x) = (5 + 4)(20 - 4) = (9)(16) = 144
$$

In both cases, the value is $144$.
