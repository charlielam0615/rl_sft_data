**Problem Statement**: Simplify the expression \((9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\) and express the resulting polynomial with terms in decreasing order of degree.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To simplify the polynomial expression, break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Combine the given polynomials by adding them.  
2. Identify and group like terms based on their degrees.  
3. Arrange the terms of the resulting polynomial in decreasing order of degree.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the polynomials \((9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\). To achieve this, add the coefficients of terms with the same degree and include terms that appear in only one polynomial.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add the polynomials by combining like terms:  
- **Degree 11**: \(x^{11}\) (from the second polynomial, no like term in the first).  
- **Degree 9**: \(9x^9 + x^9 = (9 + 1)x^9 = 10x^9\).  
- **Degree 8**: \(7x^8\) (from the first polynomial, no like term in the second).  
- **Degree 7**: \(4x^7 + 2x^7 = (4 + 2)x^7 = 6x^7\).  
- **Degree 3**: \(3x^3\) (from the second polynomial, no like term in the first).  
- **Degree 1**: \(5x\) (from the second polynomial, no like term in the first).  
- **Constant term**: \(8\) (from the second polynomial, no like term in the first).  

The combined polynomial is: \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\).

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the combined polynomial \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\) is correct. To achieve this, check that all like terms were correctly added and that no terms were missed during the combination.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Verify the combination:  
- **Degree 11**: Only \(x^{11}\) from the second polynomial, correctly included.  
- **Degree 9**: \(9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9\), correct.  
- **Degree 8**: Only \(7x^8\) from the first polynomial, correct.  
- **Degree 7**: \(4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7\), correct.  
- **Degree 3**: Only \(3x^3\) from the second polynomial, correct.  
- **Degree 1**: Only \(5x\) from the second polynomial, correct.  
- **Constant**: Only \(8\) from the second polynomial, correct.  

All terms are accounted for, and coefficients are correct. The polynomial is already arranged in decreasing order of degree, as required.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify the polynomial expression and express it with terms in decreasing order of degree.  
  - Subgoal 1: Combine the given polynomials by adding them (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify and group like terms (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Arrange terms in decreasing order of degree (completed in Step 2, verified in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed in Step 3).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is complete, as the polynomial has been simplified and expressed in decreasing order of degree.  
The final polynomial is: \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\).
