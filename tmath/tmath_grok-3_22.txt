**Problem Restatement**: Simplify the expression \((9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\) and express the resulting polynomial with terms in decreasing order of degree.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Combine the two polynomials by adding them.  
2. Identify and group like terms based on their degrees.  
3. Arrange the resulting terms in decreasing order of degree.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Combine the two polynomials by adding them.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the coefficients of corresponding terms from both polynomials, including terms with zero coefficients where necessary.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Add the polynomials \((9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\):  
- Combine terms:  
  - \(x^{11}\): \(0 + 1x^{11} = x^{11}\)  
  - \(x^9\): \(9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9\)  
  - \(x^8\): \(7x^8 + 0 = 7x^8\)  
  - \(x^7\): \(4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7\)  
  - \(x^3\): \(0 + 3x^3 = 3x^3\)  
  - \(x\): \(0 + 5x = 5x\)  
  - Constant: \(0 + 8 = 8\)  
Resulting polynomial: \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the combined polynomial is correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that all like terms were correctly added and that no terms were missed during the combination.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the addition:  
- Original polynomials: \((9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\).  
- Check each degree:  
  - Degree 11: Only in second polynomial (\(x^{11}\)), correct.  
  - Degree 9: \(9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9\), correct.  
  - Degree 8: \(7x^8 + 0 = 7x^8\), correct.  
  - Degree 7: \(4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7\), correct.  
  - Degree 3: \(0 + 3x^3 = 3x^3\), correct.  
  - Degree 1: \(0 + 5x = 5x\), correct.  
  - Constant: \(0 + 8 = 8\), correct.  
The polynomial \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Arrange the polynomial terms in decreasing order of degree.  
**How to Achieve**: List the terms of the combined polynomial starting from the highest degree to the lowest.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The combined polynomial is \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\).  
Degrees in decreasing order: 11, 9, 8, 7, 3, 1, 0.  
The polynomial is already in decreasing order: \(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\).
