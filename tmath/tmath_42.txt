Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Use the given equations $ mn = 4 $ and $ m + n = 5 $ to find $ |m - n| $.
   1.1. Express $ (m - n)^2 $ in terms of $ (m + n)^2 $ and $ 4mn $.
   1.2. Substitute the known values of $ m + n $ and $ mn $ to calculate $ (m - n)^2 $.
   1.3. Take the square root of $ (m - n)^2 $ to find $ |m - n| $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express $ (m - n)^2 $ in terms of $ (m + n)^2 $ and $ 4mn $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know that:
$$
(m - n)^2 = (m + n)^2 - 4mn
$$
This identity comes from expanding both sides:
- Left-hand side: $ (m - n)^2 = m^2 - 2mn + n^2 $
- Right-hand side: $ (m + n)^2 = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 $, so $ (m + n)^2 - 4mn = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 - 4mn = m^2 - 2mn + n^2 $

Thus, the identity holds. 

Given $ m + n = 5 $, we have $ (m + n)^2 = 25 $, and given $ mn = 4 $, we have $ 4mn = 16 $.

Now substitute into the identity:
$$
(m - n)^2 = (m + n)^2 - 4mn = 25 - 16 = 9
$$

Finally, to find $ |m - n| $, take the square root of $ (m - n)^2 $:
$$
|m - n| = \sqrt{(m - n)^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The identity used to express $ (m - n)^2 $ in terms of $ (m + n)^2 $ and $ 4mn $, and the values of $ m + n $ and $ mn $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The identity used is:  
$$
(m - n)^2 = (m + n)^2 - 4mn
$$  
The given values are:  
- $ m + n = 5 $  
- $ mn = 4 $  

These were used to calculate $ (m - n)^2 $ as $ 9 $, and subsequently $ |m - n| = 3 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Identity Verification**:  
   The identity $ (m - n)^2 = (m + n)^2 - 4mn $ is derived correctly by expanding both sides.  
   - Left-hand side: $ (m - n)^2 = m^2 - 2mn + n^2 $.  
   - Right-hand side: $ (m + n)^2 - 4mn = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 - 4mn = m^2 - 2mn + n^2 $.  
   Both sides match, confirming the identity is valid.  

2. **Substitution Verification**:  
   - Given $ m + n = 5 $, squaring gives $ (m + n)^2 = 25 $.  
   - Given $ mn = 4 $, multiplying by 4 gives $ 4mn = 16 $.  
   - Substituting into the identity: $ (m - n)^2 = 25 - 16 = 9 $.  
   The arithmetic is correct.  

3. **Square Root Verification**:  
   Taking the square root of $ (m - n)^2 = 9 $ yields $ |m - n| = \sqrt{9} = 3 $.  
   The absolute value ensures the result is non-negative, which aligns with the problem's requirement.  

4. **Alternative Method Confirmation**:  
   Solving the system $ m + n = 5 $ and $ mn = 4 $ by substitution yields $ m = 4, n = 1 $ or $ m = 1, n = 4 $.  
   In both cases, $ |m - n| = 3 $, confirming consistency with the identity-based approach.  

All steps logically follow, and cross-verification via an alternative method confirms the result.
