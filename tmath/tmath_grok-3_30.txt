**Problem Statement**: Find all points where the parabolas defined by the equations \( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \) and \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \) intersect, and list the points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the intersection points:  
1. Set the two parabola equations equal to each other to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( x \).  
3. Substitute the \( x \)-values back into one of the parabola equations to find the corresponding \( y \)-values.  
4. Verify the points by checking both equations.  
5. List the intersection points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the \( x \)-coordinates where the parabolas intersect by setting the equations \( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \) and \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \) equal to each other. This will form a quadratic equation, which we will solve for \( x \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2x^2 - 10x - 10 - x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), and \( c = -16 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-16)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 + 10}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{6 - 10}{2} = -2 \]  
The \( x \)-coordinates of the intersection points are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the \( y \)-coordinates of the intersection points by substituting \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \) into one of the parabola equations. Use \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \) for simplicity.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( x = -2 \):  
\[ y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 \]  
Point: \( (-2, 18) \).  

For \( x = 8 \):  
\[ y = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6 = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38 \]  
Point: \( (8, 38) \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the intersection points \( (-2, 18) \) and \( (8, 38) \) by checking if they satisfy both parabola equations.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check \( (-2, 18) \):  
- First equation: \( y = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10 = 2 \cdot 4 + 20 - 10 = 8 + 20 - 10 = 18 \).  
- Second equation: \( y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 \).  
Both equations are satisfied.  

Check \( (8, 38) \):  
- First equation: \( y = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10 = 2 \cdot 64 - 80 - 10 = 128 - 80 - 10 = 38 \).  
- Second equation: \( y = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6 = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38 \).  
Both equations are satisfied.  

The points \( (-2, 18) \) and \( (8, 38) \) are valid intersection points.
