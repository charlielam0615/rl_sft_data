**Problem Statement**: Find all points where the parabolas given by the equations \( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \) and \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \) intersect. List the intersection points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the intersection points, break the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set the two equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates where the parabolas intersect.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( x \).  
3. Substitute the \( x \)-values back into one of the equations to find the corresponding \( y \)-values.  
4. List the points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set the two equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection. Achieve this by equating \( 2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6 \), simplifying the equation, and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6 \]  
Subtract \( x^2 - 4x + 6 \) from both sides:  
\[ (2x^2 - 10x - 10) - (x^2 - 4x + 6) = 0 \]  
\[ 2x^2 - 10x - 10 - x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ (2x^2 - x^2) + (-10x + 4x) + (-10 - 6) = x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \]  
The quadratic equation is:  
\[ x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \]  
Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), \( c = -16 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-16)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{6 + 10}{2} = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{6 - 10}{2} = -2 \]  
The \( x \)-coordinates are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates for \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 8 \). Achieve this by substituting these \( x \)-values into one of the parabola equations, preferably the simpler one, \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute into \( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \):  
For \( x = -2 \):  
\[ y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 \]  
Point: \( (-2, 18) \).  

For \( x = 8 \):  
\[ y = 8^2 - 4 \cdot 8 + 6 = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38 \]  
Point: \( (8, 38) \).  

To ensure correctness, verify with the other equation \( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \):  
For \( x = -2 \):  
\[ y = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10 = 8 + 20 - 10 = 18 \]  
Matches.  

For \( x = 8 \):  
\[ y = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10 = 128 - 80 - 10 = 38 \]  
Matches.  

The intersection points are \( (-2, 18) \) and \( (8, 38) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that there are only two intersection points. Achieve this by confirming the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \) has exactly two real roots and checking if the points satisfy both equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \) has discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = (-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-16) = 36 + 64 = 100 \]  
Since \( \Delta > 0 \), there are two real roots, confirming two intersection points.  
Both points \( (-2, 18) \) and \( (8, 38) \) were verified in Step 3 to satisfy both equations. No additional roots are expected since the equation is quadratic.
