### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \(\log_{10}{579}\) and determine the consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\). Then, compute \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Estimate \(\log_{10}{579}\) by finding bounds using known logarithms of powers of 10.  
2. Identify the consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) that \(\log_{10}{579}\) lies between.  
3. Compute \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to estimate \(\log_{10}{579}\) by finding numbers with known logarithms that bound 579. Since 579 is between 100 and 1000 (\(\log_{10}{100} = 2\), \(\log_{10}{1000} = 3\)), we can refine the estimate further. We will use reasoning to approximate \(\log_{10}{579}\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \(100 = 10^2\) and \(1000 = 10^3\), we know:  
- \(\log_{10}{100} = 2\)  
- \(\log_{10}{1000} = 3\)  
Thus, \(2 < \log_{10}{579} < 3\).  

To narrow it down, note that \(579\) is closer to 1000 than to 100. Let’s try to approximate by comparing with numbers like 500 or 600:  
- \(500 = 5 \times 10^2\), so \(\log_{10}{500} = \log_{10}{5} + \log_{10}{10^2} \approx 0.699 + 2 = 2.699\).  
- \(600 = 6 \times 10^2\), so \(\log_{10}{600} = \log_{10}{6} + \log_{10}{10^2} \approx 0.778 + 2 = 2.778\).  

Since \(500 < 579 < 600\), we have \(2.699 < \log_{10}{579} < 2.778\). This suggests \(\log_{10}{579}\) is between 2 and 3, likely closer to 2.7–2.8.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the estimate of \(\log_{10}{579}\) by checking if it consistently lies between 2 and 3 and refining the approximation if needed to confirm the integer bounds.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, we have \(2 < \log_{10}{579} < 3\). To refine, consider that \(579 \approx 580\), and estimate:  
- \(580 = 5.8 \times 10^2\), so \(\log_{10}{580} = \log_{10}{5.8} + 2\).  
- Since \(\log_{10}{5} \approx 0.699\) and \(\log_{10}{6} \approx 0.778\), \(\log_{10}{5.8}\) is slightly less than \(\log_{10}{6}\), say \(\approx 0.763\).  
- Thus, \(\log_{10}{580} \approx 0.763 + 2 = 2.763\).  

Since 579 is slightly less than 580, \(\log_{10}{579} \approx 2.762\). This confirms \(2 < \log_{10}{579} < 3\). The consecutive integers are 2 and 3.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(a + b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are consecutive integers such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Estimate \(\log_{10}{579}\) (completed in Steps 2 and 3).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\) and \(b\) (completed in Step 3: \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b\) (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b\), where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\) from the previous steps. This will be achieved by simple addition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), compute:  
\[ a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\) are \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\). Thus, \(a + b = 5\).

\[ \boxed{5} \]
