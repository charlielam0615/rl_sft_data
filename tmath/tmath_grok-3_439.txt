**Problem Statement**: Determine the value of \(\log_{10}{579}\) and find the consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(\log_{10}{579}\) lies between them. Then, compute \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Estimate the value of \(\log_{10}{579}\).  
2. Identify the consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\).  
3. Compute \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Estimate the value of \(\log_{10}{579}\).  
How to Achieve: Since \(\log_{10}{579}\) is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to produce 579, find the nearest powers of 10. Compute \(\log_{10}{100} = 2\) and \(\log_{10}{1000} = 3\), and estimate where 579 lies between 100 and 1000. For a more precise estimate, use the approximation \(\log_{10}{579} \approx \log_{10}{580} = \log_{10}{(5.8 \times 100)} = \log_{10}{5.8} + \log_{10}{100}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \(100 = 10^2\) and \(1000 = 10^3\), we know \(\log_{10}{100} = 2\) and \(\log_{10}{1000} = 3\). As \(100 < 579 < 1000\), it follows that \(2 < \log_{10}{579} < 3\).  
To refine the estimate, approximate \(\log_{10}{579}\). Notice that \(579 \approx 580 = 5.8 \times 100\). Thus:  
\[
\log_{10}{579} \approx \log_{10}{580} = \log_{10}{(5.8 \times 100)} = \log_{10}{5.8} + \log_{10}{100} = \log_{10}{5.8} + 2.
\]  
Estimate \(\log_{10}{5.8}\). Since \(5.8 \approx 5.623 \times 1.032\) (noting \(5.623^2 \approx 31.618\), so \(\log_{10}{5.623} \approx 0.75\), and \(\log_{10}{1.032} \approx 0.0137\)), we approximate:  
\[
\log_{10}{5.8} \approx 0.763.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\log_{10}{579} \approx 0.763 + 2 = 2.763.
\]  
This suggests \(\log_{10}{579} \approx 2.763\), which is between 2 and 3.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \(\log_{10}{579}\) is between 2 and 3.  
How to Achieve: Check the bounds by computing powers of 10: confirm \(10^2 \leq 579 \leq 10^3\). For precision, compare with known logarithmic values or compute \(\log_{10}{579}\) more accurately if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Confirm the bounds:  
- \(10^2 = 100 < 579\).  
- \(10^3 = 1000 > 579\).  
Thus, \(2 = \log_{10}{100} < \log_{10}{579} < \log_{10}{1000} = 3\).  
For precision, note that \(\log_{10}{579} \approx 2.76268\) (using a calculator for verification, as allowed implicitly for precise computation). Since \(2.76268\) is between 2 and 3, the estimation is valid.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\) and compute \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Estimate \(\log_{10}{579}\) (completed: \(\log_{10}{579} \approx 2.763\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify \(a\) and \(b\) (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b\) (pending).  
Current Goal: Identify the consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\).  
From previous steps, \(\log_{10}{579} \approx 2.763\), so \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).  
How to Achieve: Use the identified integers \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\) from the previous step and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), compute:  
\[
a + b = 2 + 3 = 5.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The consecutive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a < \log_{10}{579} < b\) are \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\). Thus:  
\[
a + b = 5.
\]  
**Final Answer: 5**
