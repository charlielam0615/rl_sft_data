**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To simplify \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.  
2. Perform the multiplication in the numerator and denominator.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to the form \(a+bi\).  
4. Ensure \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, expressed as improper fractions if necessary.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rationalize the denominator of \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \(1-2i\), to eliminate the imaginary unit in the denominator.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Multiply the numerator and denominator by \(1-2i\):  
\[
\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i} \cdot \dfrac{1-2i}{1-2i} = \dfrac{(3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}.
\]  
**Numerator**:  
\[
(3+4i)(1-2i) = 3 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot (-2i) + 4i \cdot 1 + 4i \cdot (-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2.
\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(-8i^2 = -8 \cdot (-1) = 8\). Combine terms:  
\[
3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2 = 3 - 6i + 4i + 8 = 11 - 2i.
\]  
**Denominator**:  
\[
(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-2i) + 2i \cdot 1 + 2i \cdot (-2i) = 1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2.
\]  
Since \(-4i^2 = -4 \cdot (-1) = 4\), combine terms:  
\[
1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2 = 1 + 4 = 5.
\]  
Thus, the expression is:  
\[
\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}.
\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the expression \(\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\) to the form \(a+bi\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide both terms in the numerator by the denominator to express the result as a single complex number in the form \(a+bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\[
\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5} = \dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2i}{5} = \dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{-2}{5}i.
\]  
This is in the form \(a+bi\), where \(a = \dfrac{11}{5}\) and \(b = \dfrac{-2}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(\dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5}i\) is the correct simplification of \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the simplified result by the original denominator \(1+2i\) to check if it yields the original numerator \(3+4i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute:  
\[
\left( \dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5}i \right) (1 + 2i).
\]  
Distribute:  
\[
\dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 1 + \dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 2i - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 1 - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 2i = \dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{22}{áž›\]

**Step 4: Validation (Continued)**

[IMP]  
\[
\dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 1 + \dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 2i - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 1 - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 2i = \dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{22}{5}i - \dfrac{2}{5}i - \dfrac{4}{5}i^2.
\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(- \dfrac{4}{5}i^2 = - \dfrac{4}{5} \cdot (-1) = \dfrac{4}{5}\). Combine terms:  
\[
\dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{22}{5}i - \dfrac{2}{5}i + \dfrac{4}{5} = \dfrac{11 + 4}{5} + \dfrac{22 - 2}{5}i = \dfrac{15}{5} + \dfrac{20}{5}i = 3 + 4i.
\]  
This matches the original numerator \(3 + 4i\), confirming the correctness of the simplification.
