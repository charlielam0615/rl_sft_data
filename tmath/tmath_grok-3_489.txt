**Problem Statement**: Simplify the complex number expression \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\) into the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers expressed as improper fractions if necessary.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To simplify \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.  
2. Perform the multiplication in the numerator and denominator.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to the form \(a + bi\).  
4. Ensure \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, expressed as improper fractions if needed.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rationalize the denominator of \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, \(1 - 2i\), to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.

[IMP]  
Multiply \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\) by \(\dfrac{1-2i}{1-2i}\):  
\[
\dfrac{(3+4i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}
\]  
**Numerator**:  
\[
(3+4i)(1-2i) = 3 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot (-2i) + 4i \cdot 1 + 4i \cdot (-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2
\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(-8i^2 = -8 \cdot (-1) = 8\). Thus:  
\[
3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2 = 3 - 6i + 4i + 8 = 11 - 2i
\]  
**Denominator**:  
\[
(1+2i)(1-2i) = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-2i) + 2i \cdot 1 + 2i \cdot (-2i) = 1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2
\]  
Since \(-4i^2 = -4 \cdot (-1) = 4\), we have:  
\[
1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2 = 1 + 4 = 5
\]  
So, the expression becomes:  
\[
\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}
\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the expression \(\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\) into the form \(a + bi\).  
**How to Achieve**: Divide both terms in the numerator by the denominator to separate the real and imaginary parts.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite \(\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\):  
\[
\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5} = \dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2i}{5} = \dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{-2}{5}i
\]  
This is in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a = \dfrac{11}{5}\) and \(b = -\dfrac{2}{5}\). Both are real numbers expressed as improper fractions.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \(\dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5}i\) is the correct simplification.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the result by the original denominator \(1 + 2i\) to check if it yields the original numerator \(3 + 4i\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \(\left( \dfrac{11}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5}i \right) (1 + 2i)\):  
\[
\dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 1 + \dfrac{11}{5} \cdot 2i - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 1 - \dfrac{2}{5}i \cdot 2i = \dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{22}{5}i - \dfrac{2}{5}i - \dfrac{4}{5}i^2
\]  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(-\dfrac{4}{5}i^2 = -\dfrac{4}{5} \cdot (-1) = \dfrac{4}{5}\). Combine terms:  
\[
\dfrac{11}{5} + \dfrac{4}{5} + \left( \dfrac{22}{5} - \dfrac{2}{5} \right)i = \dfrac{11 + 4}{5} + \dfrac{20}{5}i = \dfrac{15}{5} + 4i = 3 + 4i
\]  
The result matches the original numerator \(3 + 4i\), confirming the solution is correct.
