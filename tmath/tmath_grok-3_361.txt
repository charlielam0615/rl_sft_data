### Problem Statement
We need to find the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) of the circle defined by the equation \(x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x\), and compute the value of \(a + b + r\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \(a + b + r\), we need to determine the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) of the circle. The given equation is not in standard circle form, so we can break this down into subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle: \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
2. Identify the center \((a, b) = (h, k)\) and radius \(r\).  
3. Compute \(a + b + r\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). This can be achieved by rearranging all terms to one side, completing the square for both \(x\) and \(y\), and simplifying to identify the center and radius.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x \]

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 + y^2 + 10x = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \]

To rewrite in standard form, complete the square for \(x\) and \(y\).  

For \(x\)-terms: \(x^2 + 10x\)  
- The coefficient of \(x\) is 10, so take half (\(5\)) and square it (\(25\)).  
- Add and subtract 25: \(x^2 + 10x = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25\).

For \(y\)-terms: \(y^2 + 12y\)  
- The coefficient of \(y\) is 12, so take half (\(6\)) and square it (\(36\)).  
- Add and subtract 36: \(y^2 + 12y = (y^2 + 12y + 36) - 36 = (y + 6)^2 - 36\).

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 6)^2 - 36 + 57 = 0 \]

Simplify the constants:  
\[ -25 - 36 + 57 = -25 - 36 + 57 = -61 + 57 = -4 \]

So:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4 \]

This is the standard form, where the center is \((-5, -6)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{4} = 2\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the standard form \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\) correctly represents the original equation and that the center \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(2\) are accurate. This can be done by expanding the standard form and comparing it to the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\):  
- \((x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25\)  
- \((y + 6)^2 = y^2 + 12y + 36\)  

So:  
\[ x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 12y + 36 = 4 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 61 = 4 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \]

This matches the equation from Step 2: \(x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0\), which was derived from the original. To further confirm, substitute back into the original:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x \]  
From the derived equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \implies x^2 + 10x = -y^2 - 12y - 57 \]  
Left side of original: \(x^2 + 12y + 57\)  
Right side: \(-y^2 - 10x = -(y^2 + 10x) = -(-12y - 57) = 12y + 57\) (using \(y^2 + 10x = -12y - 57\)).  
Thus: \(x^2 + 12y + 57 = 12y + 57 - x^2\), which requires checking consistency. Instead, since the standard form matches the derived equation exactly, the center \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(2\) are valid.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \(a + b + r\) for the circle’s center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + r\) (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b + r\) using the center \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(2\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(a + b + r\) using the center \((a, b) = (-5, -6)\) and radius \(r = 2\). This can be achieved by directly substituting these values into the expression \(a + b + r\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given:  
- Center \((a, b) = (-5, -6)\), so \(a = -5\), \(b = -6\).  
- Radius \(r = 2\).  

Compute:  
\[ a + b + r = -5 + (-6) + 2 = -5 - 6 + 2 = -11 + 2 = -9 \]

Thus, \(a + b + r = -9\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \(a + b + r = -9\) by confirming the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(rODA r\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- \(a = -5\), \(b = -6\), \(r = 2\).  
- \(a + b + r = -5 + (-6) + 2 = -9\).  

The values match the standard form equation \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\), and the arithmetic is straightforward. To ensure accuracy, check the radius: \(r^2 = 4 \implies r = \sqrt{4} = 2\), which is correct. The computation \(-5 - 6 + 2 = -9\) is arithmetically correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The value of \(a + b + r\) is \(-9\).  

\[ \boxed{-9} \]
