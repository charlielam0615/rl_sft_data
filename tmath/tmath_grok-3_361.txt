### Problem Restatement
We need to find the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) of the circle defined by the equation \(x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x\), and compute the value of \(a + b + r\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \(a + b + r\), we need to determine the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) of the circle. The given equation is not in standard circle form, so we can break this down into subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form \((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2\).  
2. Identify the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) from the standard form.  
3. Compute \(a + b + r\).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the circle’s equation in standard form.  
**How to Achieve**: Move all terms to one side, complete the square for \(x\) and \(y\), and simplify to match the form \((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x \]  

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 + y^2 + 10x = 0 \]  

Rearrange:  
\[ x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 12y + 57 = 0 \]  

Complete the square for \(x\):  
- For \(x^2 + 10x\), take the coefficient of \(x\) (which is 10), divide by 2 to get 5, and square it: \(5^2 = 25\).  
- Add and subtract 25:  
\[ x^2 + 10x = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25 \]  

Complete the square for \(y\):  
- For \(y^2 + 12y\), take the coefficient of \(y\) (12), divide by 2 to get 6, and square it: \(6^2 = 36\).  
- Add and subtract 36:  
\[ y^2 + 12y = (y^2 + 12y + 36) - 36 = (y + 6)^2 - 36 \]  

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 6)^2 - 36 + 57 = 0 \]  

Simplify the constants:  
\[ -25 - 36 + 57 = -25 - 36 + 57 = -61 + 57 = -4 \]  

So the equation becomes:  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4 \]  

This is the standard form, where the center is \((-5, -6)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{4} = 2\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the standard form equation and the derived center and radius.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute the center \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(r = 2\) back into the standard form and check if it satisfies the original equation. Alternatively, derive the standard form again or check key points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The standard form is \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\), so the center is \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(r = 2\). To validate, expand the standard form back to the general form and compare with the original equation.  

Expand \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\):  
- \((x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25\)  
- \((y + 6)^2 = y^2 + 12y + 36\)  
- So:  
\[ x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 12y + 36 = 4 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 61 = 4 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \]  

This matches the equation from Step 2: \(x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0\). Now, compare with the original:  
\[ x^2 + 12y + 57 + y^2 + 10x = 0 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \]  

The equations are identical, confirming the center \((-5, -6)\) and radius \(r = 2\) are correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute \(a + b + r\) for the circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the center \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(a + b + r\) (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b + r\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(a + b + r\).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the center \((a, b) = (-5, -6)\) and radius \(r = 2\) from the standard form to calculate \(a + b + r\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the standard form \((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\):  
- Center: \((a, b) = (-5, -6)\), so \(a = -5\), \(b = -6\).  
- Radius: \(r = \sqrt{4} = 2\).  

Compute:  
\[ a + b + r = -5 + (-6) + 2 = -5 - 6 + 2 = -11 + 2 = -9 \]  

Thus, \(a + b + r = -9\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Final Answer
The value of \(a + b + r\) is \(-9\).
