**Problem Statement**: Given that \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive numbers satisfying the equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\), find the value of \(x + y + z\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(x + y + z\) into intermediate subgoals. The system of equations involves products of variables, suggesting that solving for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) individually or finding a relationship between them is necessary. Subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations to express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).  
2. Compute \(x + y + z\) using the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\) to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Achieve this by manipulating the equations, possibly by dividing them to eliminate variables or finding a relationship between the variables.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Consider the system:  
- \(xy = 24\)  
- \(xz = 48\)  
- \(yz = 72\)  

To eliminate variables, divide the equations:  
- Divide \(xz = 48\) by \(xy = 24\):  
  \[
  \frac{xz}{xy} = \frac{48}{24} \implies \frac{z}{y} = 2 \implies z = 2y
  \]  
- Divide \(yz = 72\) by \(xy = 24\):  
  \[
  \frac{yz}{xy} = \frac{72}{24} \implies \frac{z}{x} = 3 \implies z = 3x
  \]  
- Equate the two expressions for \(z\):  
  \[
  2y = 3x \implies y = \frac{3x}{2}
  \]  

Substitute \(y = \frac{3x}{2}\) into \(xy = 24\):  
\[
x \cdot \frac{3x}{2} = 24 \implies \frac{3x^2}{2} = 24 \implies 3x^2 = 48 \implies x^2 = 16 \implies x = 4 \text{ or } x = -4
\]  
Since \(x\) is positive, \(x = 4\).  

Then, \(y = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{2} = 6\).  
And, \(z = 3x = 3 \cdot 4 = 12\).  

Verify:  
- \(xy = 4 \cdot 6 = 24\) (satisfies).  
- \(xz = 4 \cdot 12 = 48\) (satisfies).  
- \(yz = 6 \cdot 12 = 72\) (satisfies).  

Thus, \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\) by ensuring all equations are satisfied and checking for other possible solutions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The solution satisfies all given equations (as verified in Step 2). To ensure uniqueness, consider the nature of the equations. Since \(x^2 = 16\) yields \(x = \pm 4\), but \(x\) is positive, only \(x = 4\) is valid. The relationships \(y = \frac{3x}{2}\) and \(z = 3x\) are linear, leading to unique \(y\) and \(z\) for a given \(x\). Thus, no other positive solutions exist.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(x + y + z\) using the values \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[
x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22
\]  
[/IMP]
