**Problem Statement**: Given positive numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) satisfying the equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\), find the value of \(x + y + z\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(x + y + z\) into intermediate subgoals. The equations involve products of variables, suggesting that solving for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) individually or finding their sum directly is necessary. A possible approach is to manipulate the given equations to express the variables or their sum in terms of each other, potentially by dividing equations or finding relationships like \(xyz\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that satisfy \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), and \(yz = 72\), then compute \(x + y + z\). To achieve this, multiply the given equations to find \(xyz\), then use it to solve for individual variables by dividing the equations.

Multiply the given equations:  
\((xy)(xz)(yz) = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72\).  
This gives \((xyz)^2 = 24 \cdot 48 \cdot 72\).  
Calculate the right-hand side:  
\(24 \cdot 48 = 1152\),  
\(1152 \cdot 72 = 82944\).  
Thus, \((xyz)^2 = 82944\), so \(xyz = \sqrt{82944} = 288\) (since \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) are positive).  
Now, solve for each variable:  
- \(x = \frac{xyz}{yz} = \frac{288}{72} = 4\),  
- \(y = \frac{xyz}{xz} = \frac{288}{48} = 6\),  
- \(z = \frac{xyz}{xy} = \frac{288}{24} = 12\).  
Verify:  
- \(xy = 4 \cdot 6 = 24\),  
- \(xz = 4 \cdot 12 = 48\),  
- \(yz = 6 \cdot 12 = 72\).  
All equations hold. Thus, \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\).  
Compute the sum: \(x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\) by checking if it satisfies all given equations and confirms the sum \(x + y + z = 22\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-check the equations:  
- \(xy = 4 \cdot 6 = 24\), satisfies \(xy = 24\).  
- \(xz = 4 \cdot 12 = 48\), satisfies \(xz = 48\).  
- \(yz = 6 \cdot 12 = 72\), satisfies \(yz = 72\).  
The values are consistent. The sum is:  
\(x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22\).  
The solution is valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \(x + y + z\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve for \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) using the equations \(xy = 24\), \(xz = 48\), \(yz = 72\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the sum \(x + y + z\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution \(x + y + z = 22\).  
The solution \(x = 4\), \(y = 6\), \(z = 12\) satisfies all equations, and the sum is \(22\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \(x + y + z = 22\).
