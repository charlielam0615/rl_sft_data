**Problem Statement**: Piravena must travel from city A to city B, then from B to C, and finally from C back to A, with each leg of the trip made entirely by bus or airplane. The cities A, B, and C form a right-angled triangle, with distances AC = 3000 km and AB = 3250 km. The cost of traveling by bus is $0.15 per kilometer, and the cost of traveling by airplane is a $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per kilometer. Piravena begins her trip by flying from A to B. We need to determine the cost to fly from A to B.

### Step 1: Identify the goal and approach for calculating the flight cost

**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the cost of flying from A to B, a distance of 3250 km, using the airplane cost structure (a $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per kilometer). To achieve this, apply the airplane cost formula: total cost = booking fee + (cost per kilometer × distance).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The distance from A to B is given as 3250 km. The airplane cost is a $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per kilometer.  
- Cost for the distance: 3250 km × $0.10/km = $325.  
- Total cost: $100 + $325 = $425.  

Thus, the cost to fly from A to B is $425.
