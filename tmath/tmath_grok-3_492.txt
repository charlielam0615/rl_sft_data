**Problem Statement**: Piravena travels from city A to city B, then from B to C, and finally from C to A, with each leg of the trip made entirely by bus or airplane. The cities A, B, and C form a right-angled triangle, with AC = 3000 km and AB = 3250 km. The cost of traveling by bus is $0.15 per kilometer, and by airplane, it is a $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per kilometer. Piravena flies from A to B to begin her trip. We need to determine the cost of flying from A to B.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the cost of flying from A to B, given that the distance AB is 3250 km and the airplane cost is a $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per kilometer. To achieve this, we will use the airplane cost formula: Cost = $100 + 0.10 × distance (in km).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The distance from A to B is 3250 km. The cost to fly is calculated as:  
Cost = $100 + 0.10 × 3250 = $100 + 325 = $425.  
Thus, the cost to fly from A to B is $425.

**Final Answer**: The cost to fly from A to B is $425.
