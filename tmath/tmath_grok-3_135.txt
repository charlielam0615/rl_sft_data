**Problem Restatement**: Find the slope of the line given by the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the slope of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Convert the equation to slope-intercept form (\(y = mx + b\)), where \(m\) is the slope.  
2. Identify the slope from the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Convert the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\) to slope-intercept form.  
How to Achieve: Solve for \(y\) by isolating it on one side of the equation through algebraic manipulation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with \(3x + 5y = 20\).  
Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:  
\(5y = -3x + 20\).  
Divide both sides by 5:  
\(y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4\).  
The equation is now in slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m = -\frac{3}{5}\) and \(b = 4\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the slope from the slope-intercept form.  
How to Achieve: Extract the coefficient of \(x\) from the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4\), the coefficient of \(x\) is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).  
Thus, the slope \(m = -\frac{3}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the slope by checking the calculation.  
How to Achieve: Recompute the conversion to slope-intercept form and confirm the slope, or use an alternative method (e.g., slope formula with two points) to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\(3x + 5y = 20\).  
\(5y = -3x + 20\).  
\(y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4\).  
Slope is \(-\frac{3}{5}\), consistent with previous result.  
Alternative method: Find two points on the line.  
Set \(x = 0\): \(5y = 20\), \(y = 4\). Point: \((0, 4)\).  
Set \(y = 0\): \(3x = 20\), \(x = \frac{20}{3}\). Point: \(\left(\frac{20}{3}, 0\right)\).  
Slope formula: \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 4}{\frac{20}{3} - 0} = \frac{-4}{\frac{20}{3}} = -4 \cdot \frac{3}{20} = -\frac{12}{20} = -\frac{3}{5}\).  
Both methods confirm the slope is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the slope of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert the equation to slope-intercept form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the slope from the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the slope (completed).  
Current Goal: Completed (slope identified and validated).  
The slope of the line is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The slope of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\) is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).
