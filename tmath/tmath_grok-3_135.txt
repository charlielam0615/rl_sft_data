**Problem Statement**: Find the slope of the line given by the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the slope of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\), break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert the given equation into slope-intercept form (\(y = mx + b\)), where \(m\) is the slope.  
2. Identify the slope from the slope-intercept form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to convert the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\) into slope-intercept form (\(y = mx + b\)). This can be achieved by solving the equation for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5y = 20 \]  
Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:  
\[ 5y = -3x + 20 \]  
Divide through by 5:  
\[ y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4 \]  
The equation is now in slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where the slope \(m = -\frac{3}{5}\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the slope-intercept form and the identified slope are correct. This can be done by checking the conversion process and ensuring the slope matches the expected form.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute the conversion to confirm:  
\[ 3x + 5y = 20 \]  
\[ 5y = -3x + 20 \]  
\[ y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 4 \]  
The slope is \(m = -\frac{3}{5}\). To further validate, consider the standard form \(Ax + By = C\), where the slope is given by \(-\frac{A}{B}\). Here, \(A = 3\), \(B = 5\), so the slope is:  
\[ -\frac{A}{B} = -\frac{3}{5} \]  
This matches the slope from the slope-intercept form, confirming correctness.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the slope of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert the equation to slope-intercept form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the slope from the slope-intercept form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the slope calculation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: The current goal is to finalize the solution, as all subgoals have been achieved.  
The slope of the line is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).
