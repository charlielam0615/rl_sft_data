**Problem Statement**: We need to find the constant \( a \) such that the quadratic expression \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) is a perfect square of a binomial, i.e., it can be written in the form \( (px + q)^2 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for a quadratic to be a perfect square of a binomial.  
2. Express the given quadratic \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) as \( (px + q)^2 \).  
3. Equate coefficients to form equations.  
4. Solve for the constant \( a \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) as \( (px + q)^2 \) and set up equations by comparing coefficients. This involves expanding the binomial, matching terms with the given quadratic, and solving for unknowns.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
A quadratic \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) is a perfect square if it can be written as \( (px + q)^2 \). Expand the binomial:  
\[ (px + q)^2 = p^2 x^2 + 2pq x + q^2. \]  
Compare this to \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \):  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( p^2 = 9 \).  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2pq = 24 \).  
- Constant term: \( q^2 = a \).  

From \( p^2 = 9 \), we get \( p = 3 \) or \( p = -3 \).  
For \( p = 3 \), solve \( 2 \cdot 3 \cdot q = 24 \):  
\[ 6q = 24 \implies q = 4. \]  
Then, \( a = q^2 = 4^2 = 16 \).  

For \( p = -3 \), solve \( 2 \cdot (-3) \cdot q = 24 \):  
\[ -6q = 24 \implies q = -4. \]  
Then, \( a = q^2 = (-4)^2 = 16 \).  

In both cases, \( a = 16 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \( a = 16 \) makes \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) a perfect square by checking if the quadratic can be written as \( (px + q)^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 16 \) into the quadratic:  
\[ 9x^2 + 24x + 16. \]  
Check if this is \( (3x + 4)^2 \):  
\[ (3x + 4)^2 = 9x^2 + 24x + 16. \]  
This matches exactly. Alternatively, for \( p = -3 \), \( q = -4 \):  
\[ (-3x - 4)^2 = 9x^2 + 24x + 16, \]  
which also matches. Since both forms confirm the quadratic is a perfect square, \( a = 16 \) is valid.  

To further validate, check the discriminant of \( 9x^2 + 24x + 16 \):  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 24^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 16 = 576 - 576 = 0. \]  
A discriminant of zero confirms the quadratic has a double root, consistent with being a perfect square.
