**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the constant \( a \) such that the quadratic expression \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) is a perfect square trinomial, meaning it can be expressed as the square of a binomial, i.e., \( (px + q)^2 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into subgoals:  
1. Understand the form of a perfect square trinomial by expanding a binomial square \( (px + q)^2 \).  
2. Match the expanded form to \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \).  
3. Solve for the constant \( a \) by equating coefficients.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) as \( (px + q)^2 \). Achieve this by expanding \( (px + q)^2 \), equating it to the given expression, and solving for the coefficients \( p \), \( q \), and \( a \).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the binomial square:  
\[ (px + q)^2 = p^2 x^2 + 2pq x + q^2 \]  
Compare this to \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \):  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( p^2 = 9 \), so \( p = 3 \) or \( p = -3 \).  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2pq = 24 \).  
- Constant term: \( q^2 = a \).  

Solve for \( p \) and \( q \):  
If \( p = 3 \):  
\[ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot q = 24 \implies 6q = 24 \implies q = 4 \]  
Then, the constant term is:  
\[ q^2 = 4^2 = 16 \implies a = 16 \]  

Verify with \( p = -3 \):  
\[ 2 \cdot (-3) \cdot q = 24 \implies -6q = 24 \implies q = -4 \]  
Then:  
\[ q^2 = (-4)^2 = 16 \implies a = 16 \]  

In both cases, \( a = 16 \). To confirm, if \( a = 16 \), the expression becomes:  
\[ 9x^2 + 24x + 16 = (3x + 4)^2 \]  
Expand to verify:  
\[ (3x + 4)^2 = 9x^2 + 24x + 16 \]  
This matches the given expression, confirming correctness.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( a = 16 \) makes \( 9x^2 + 24x + a \) a perfect square trinomial by checking the discriminant of the quadratic, which should be zero for a perfect square.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a quadratic \( Ax^2 + Bx + C \) to be a perfect square, its discriminant must be zero:  
\[ \Delta = B^2 - 4AC = 0 \]  
Here, \( A = 9 \), \( B = 24 \), \( C = a \). Compute the discriminant:  
\[ \Delta = 24^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot a = 576 - 36a \]  
Set \( \Delta = 0 \):  
\[ 576 - 36a = 0 \implies 36a = 576 \implies a = 16 \]  
This confirms \( a = 16 \). Additionally, check if the roots are equal:  
For \( 9x^2 + 24x + 16 = 0 \), use the quadratic formula:  
\[ x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} = \frac{-24 \pm \sqrt{576 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 16}}{2 \cdot 9} = \frac{-24 \pm \sqrt{576 - 576}}{18} = \frac{-24 \pm 0}{18} = -\frac{4}{3} \]  
The discriminant is zero, yielding a double root at \( x = -\frac{4}{3} \), confirming that \( 9x^2 + 24x + 16 = (3x + 4)^2 \).
