Let’s solve the problem of finding the sum of all distinct possible areas of "cool" right triangles, where a right triangle with integer leg lengths has an area (in square units) equal to twice the sum of its leg lengths (in units). We’ll follow the meta-cognitive action framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Problem Restatement**:  
A right triangle with integer leg lengths \(a\) and \(b\) is "cool" if its area equals twice the sum of its legs. The area of a right triangle is \(\frac{1}{2}ab\), and the sum of the legs is \(a + b\). Thus, the condition is \(\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)\). We need to find all distinct possible areas of such triangles and compute their sum.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Derive the mathematical condition for a "cool" right triangle from the given definition.  
2. Find all pairs of integer leg lengths \((a, b)\) that satisfy this condition.  
3. Calculate the area for each valid pair.  
4. Identify all distinct areas.  
5. Sum the distinct areas to get the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to derive the mathematical condition for a "cool" right triangle. Achieve this by setting up the equation based on the problem’s definition that the area equals twice the sum of the legs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area of a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\) is \(\frac{1}{2}ab\). The sum of the legs is \(a + b\). The problem states that the area equals twice the sum of the legs:  
\[
\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[
ab = 4(a + b)
\]
Rearrange into a standard form:  
\[
ab - 4a - 4b = 0
\]
Add 16 to both sides to factorize:  
\[
ab - 4a - 4b + 16 = 16
\]
This can be rewritten as:  
\[
(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16
\]
Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers (as legs of a triangle), \(a - 4\) and \(b - 4\) are integers, and their product must be 16. This equation will help us find valid \((a, b)\) pairs.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find all pairs of integer leg lengths \((a, b)\) that satisfy \((a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\). Achieve this by finding all integer factor pairs of 16 and solving for \(a\) and \(b\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation is \((a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\). Let \(m = a - 4\) and \(n = b - 4\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers such that \(mn = 16\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers (legs of a triangle), \(a = m + 4 \geq 1\) implies \(m \geq -3\), and similarly \(n \geq -3\). We need all integer pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(mn = 16\).

The factor pairs of 16 (including negatives, since \(m\) and \(n\) can be negative) are:  
\[
(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1)
\]
For each pair \((m, n)\), compute \(a = m + 4\), \(b = n + 4\), and check if \(a, b > 0\):  
- \(m = 1, n = 16\): \(a = 1 + 4 = 5\), \(b = 16 + 4 = 20\). Pair: \((5, 20)\).  
- \(m = 2, n = 8\): \(a = 2 + 4 = 6\), \(b = 8 + 4 = 12\). Pair: \((6, 12)\).  
- \(m = 4, n = 4\): \(a = 4 + 4 = 8\), \(b = 4 + 4 = 8\). Pair: \((8, 8)\).  
- \(m = 8, n = 2\): \(a = 8 + 4 = 12\), \(b = 2 + 4 = 6\). Pair: \((12, 6)\).  
- \(m = 16, n = 1\): \(a = 16 + 4 = 20\), \(b = 1 + 4 = 5\). Pair: \((20, 5)\).  
- \(m = -1, n = -16\): \(a = -1 + 4 = 3\), \(b = -16 + 4 = -12\). Invalid, as \(b < 0\).  
- \(m = -2, n = -8\): \(a = -2 + 4 = 2\), \(b = -8 + 4 = -4\). Invalid, as \(b < 0\).  
- \(m = -4, n = -4\): \(a = -4 + 4 = 0\), \(b = -4 + 4 = 0\). Invalid, as \(a, b \leq 0\).  
- \(m = -8, n = -2\): \(a = -8 + 4 = -4\), \(b = -2 + 4 = 2\). Invalid, as \(a < 0\).  
- \(m = -16, n = -1\): \(a = -16 + 4 = -12\), \(b = -1 + 4 = 3\). Invalid, as \(a < 0\).

Valid pairs (considering \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) as the same triangle): \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the pairs \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), and \((8, 8)\) satisfy the "cool" triangle condition \(\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)\). Achieve this by substituting each pair into the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check each pair:  
- For \((5, 20)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 20 = 50\). Sum of legs = \(5 + 20 = 25\). Twice the sum = \(2 \cdot 25 = 50\). Satisfies.  
- For \((6, 12)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 36\). Sum of legs = \(6 + 12 = 18\). Twice the sum = \(2 \cdot 18 = 36\). Satisfies.  
- For \((8, 8)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32\). Sum of legs = \(8 + 8 = 16\). Twice the sum = \(2 \cdot 16 = 32\). Satisfies.  
All pairs satisfy the condition.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the area for each valid pair and identify all distinct areas. Achieve this by computing \(\frac{1}{2}ab\) for each pair.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate areas:  
- Pair \((5, 20)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 20 = 50\).  
- Pair \((6, 12)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 36\).  
- Pair \((8, 8)\): Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32\).  
Distinct areas: 32, 36, 50.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all distinct possible areas of cool right triangles.  
  - Subgoal 1: Derive the condition for a cool triangle (completed: \((a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find all integer pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the condition (completed: \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area for each pair (completed: 50, 36, 32).  
  - Subgoal 4: Identify distinct areas (completed: 32, 36, 50).  
  - Subgoal 5: Sum the distinct areas (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the distinct areas to obtain the final answer.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the distinct areas (32, 36, 50) to find the final answer. Achieve this by adding the areas together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the distinct areas:  
\[
32 + 36 + 50 = 118
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that 118 is the correct sum and that no other distinct areas exist. Achieve this by reviewing the factor pairs of 16 to ensure all valid \((a, b)\) pairs were considered and checking the sum.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Reconfirm factor pairs of 16: We considered all pairs \((1, 16)\), \((2, 8)\), \((4, 4)\), \((8, 2)\), \((16, 1)\), and negative pairs, yielding \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\). Negative pairs produced invalid (non-positive) \(a\) or \(b\), so no additional pairs are possible. Areas are 50, 36, 32, all distinct. Sum:  
\[
32 + 36 + 50 = 118
\]
The sum is correct, and no other areas were missed.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The sum of all distinct possible areas of cool right triangles is **118**.  
\[ \boxed{118} \]
