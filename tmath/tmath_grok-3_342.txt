**Problem Restatement**: We need to find all "cool" right triangles with integer leg lengths, where the area of the triangle equals twice the sum of the lengths of its legs. Then, compute the sum of all distinct possible areas of these triangles. A right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\) has area \(\frac{1}{2}ab\), and the sum of the legs is \(a + b\). The condition for a "cool" triangle is \(\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)\). We must find all integer pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying this, determine their areas, identify unique areas, and sum them.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Derive the equation for a "cool" right triangle based on the given condition.  
2. Solve for integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the equation.  
3. Calculate the area for each valid triangle.  
4. Identify all distinct areas.  
5. Sum the distinct areas to obtain the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Derive the equation for a "cool" right triangle.  
How to Achieve: Use the condition that the area equals twice the sum of the legs. For a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), the area is \(\frac{1}{2}ab\), and the sum of the legs is \(a + b\). Set up the equation \(\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)\) and simplify it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the given condition:  
\[
\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
\[
ab = 4(a + b)
\]
Rearrange into standard form:  
\[
ab - 4a - 4b = 0
\]
Add 16 to both sides to facilitate factoring:  
\[
ab - 4a - 4b + 16 = 16
\]
This can be rewritten as:  
\[
(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16
\]
This equation will help find integer pairs \((a, b)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find all integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \((a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\).  
How to Achieve: Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers (as they are leg lengths), find all factor pairs of 16, compute corresponding \(a\) and \(b\), and ensure they are positive. Consider both positive and negative factors since the product is positive.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The equation is:  
\[
(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16
\]
List all factor pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(m \cdot n = 16\), including negatives:  
\[
(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1)
\]
For each pair, compute \(a = m + 4\), \(b = n + 4\), and check if \(a, b > 0\):  
- \(m = 1, n = 16\): \(a = 1 + 4 = 5\), \(b = 16 + 4 = 20\). Pair: \((5, 20)\).  
- \(m = 2, n = 8\): \(a = 2 + 4 = 6\), \(b = 8 + 4 = 12\). Pair: \((6, 12)\).  
- \(m = 4, n = 4\): \(a = 4 + 4 = 8\), \(b = 4 + 4 = 8\). Pair: \((8, 8)\).  
- \(m = 8, n = 2\): \(a = 8 + 4 = 12\), \(b = 2 + 4 = 6\). Pair: \((12, 6)\).  
- \(m = 16, n = 1\): \(a = 16 + 4 = 20\), \(b = 1 + 4 = 5\). Pair: \((20, 5)\).  
- \(m = -1, n = -16\): \(a = -1 + 4 = 3\), \(b = -16 + 4 = -12\). \(b < 0\), invalid.  
- \(m = -2, n = -8\): \(a = -2 + 4 = 2\), \(b = -8 + 4 = -4\). \(b < 0\), invalid.  
- \(m = -4, n = -4\): \(a = -4 + 4 = 0\), \(b = -4 + 4 = 0\). \(a, b \leq 0\), invalid.  
- \(m = -8, n = -2\): \(a = -8 + 4 = -4\), \(b = -2 + 4 = 2\). \(a < 0\), invalid.  
- \(m = -16, n = -1\): \(a = -16 + 4 = -12\), \(b = -1 + 4 = 3\). \(a < 0\), invalid.  

Valid pairs (considering \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) as the same triangle): \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the integer pairs \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\) satisfy the original condition \(\frac{1}{2}ab = 2(a + b)\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute each pair into the original equation and check if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For \((5, 20)\):  
  Area: \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 20 = 50\).  
  Twice sum of legs: \(2 \cdot (5 + 20) = 2 \cdot 25 = 50\).  
  \(50 = 50\), valid.  
- For \((6, 12)\):  
  Area: \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 36\).  
  Twice sum of legs: \(2 \cdot (6 + 12) = 2 \cdot 18 = 36\).  
  \(36 = 36\), valid.  
- For \((8, 8)\):  
  Area: \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32\).  
  Twice sum of legs: \(2 \cdot (8 + 8) = 2 \cdot 16 = 32\).  
  \(32 = 32\), valid.  

All pairs satisfy the condition.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the area for each valid triangle and identify distinct areas.  
How to Achieve: Compute the area \(\frac{1}{2}ab\) for each pair and list unique values.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]

- \((5, 20)\): \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 20 = 50\).  
- \((6, 12)\): \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 36\).  
- \((8, 8)\): \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32\).  

Distinct areas: \(32, 36, 50\).  
[/IMP]

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]

\[
32 + 36 + 50 = 118
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the final answer by ensuring all steps are correct and no triangles were missed.  
How to Achieve: Re-check the factor pairs for \((a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\) and confirm the areas and their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-list factor pairs for 16: \((1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1)\).  
Valid pairs (as before): \((5, 20)\), \((6, 12)\), \((8, 8)\).  
Areas: \(50, 36, 32\).  
Sum: \(32 + 36 + 50 = 118\).  
No additional valid pairs found, and calculations are consistent.  
[/IMP]
