### Problem Statement
We need to find all integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2
\]

where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Our goal is to determine all integers \( n \) (positive, negative, or zero) that make this equation true.

### Step 1: Understand the equation and plan the approach

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the floor functions in terms of \( n \) to simplify the equation.  
2. Consider the behavior of the floor functions for even and odd \( n \), as the term \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) suggests a dependency on \( n \)'s parity.  
3. Test cases for positive and negative integers, and zero, to identify patterns or solutions.  
4. Solve the resulting equations for each case to find all integer \( n \).  
5. Verify solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.

### Step 2: Express the floor functions based on \( n \)'s parity

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Simplify the equation by expressing \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\) based on whether \( n \) is even or odd.  
- **How to Achieve**: Use the properties of the floor function and the fact that \( n \) can be even (\( n = 2k \)) or odd (\( n = 2k + 1 \)). Derive expressions for each case and set up equations to solve.  

[IMP]  
Let’s define \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\). For an integer \( n \):

- If \( n \) is even, let \( n = 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer. Then:
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2k}{2} \right\rfloor = k
  \]
  Compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\):
  \[
  n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \implies \frac{n^2}{4} = k^2
  \]
  Since \( k^2 \) is an integer, \(\left\lfloor k^2 \right\rfloor = k^2\). Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  k^2 - k^2 = 0 \neq 2
  \]
  This case does not satisfy the equation, so no solutions exist when \( n \) is even.

- If \( n \) is odd, let \( n = 2k + 1 \). Then:
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2k + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor k + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = k
  \]
  Compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor\):
  \[
  n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \implies \frac{n^2}{4} = k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Since \( k^2 + k \) is an integer and \( 0 < \frac{1}{4} < 1 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = k^2 + k
  \]
  The equation becomes:
  \[
  (k^2 + k) - k^2 = k = 2
  \]
  Solving \( k = 2 \), we get:
  \[
  n = 2k + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5
  \]

Thus, \( n = 5 \) is a candidate solution for odd \( n \).

### Step 3: Verify the candidate solution

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify if \( n = 5 \) satisfies the original equation.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 5 \) into \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2\) and check if it holds.

[IMP]  
For \( n = 5 \):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.5 \right\rfloor = 2
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 6.25 \right\rfloor = 6
\]
\[
6 - 2^2 = 6 - 4 = 2
\]
The equation holds for \( n = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Check for other odd \( n \)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Since \( n = 5 \) (from \( k = 2 \)) works, adjust the subgoal to test other odd \( n \) by checking other integer values of \( k \) to ensure all solutions are found.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5: Test other odd \( n \)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Test other values of \( k \) for odd \( n = 2k + 1 \) to find additional solutions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute different integer \( k \) (positive, negative, zero) into the equation derived for odd \( n \).

[IMP]  
From Step 2, for odd \( n = 2k + 1 \), we have:
\[
k = 2
\]
Test other \( k \):
- For \( k = 0 \):
  \[
  k = 0 \neq 2
  \]
- For \( k = 1 \):
  \[
  k = 1 \neq 2
  \]
- For \( k = 3 \):
  \[
  k = 3 \neq 2
  \]
- For \( k = -1 \):
  \[
  k = -1 \neq 2
  \]
Since \( k = 2 \) is the only integer satisfying \( k = 2 \), no other odd \( n \) satisfy the equation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Check negative integers and zero

[PLANNING]
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
Return to the subgoal of testing all integers by considering negative \( n \) and \( n = 0 \), as the equation may behave differently.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Test negative \( n \) and zero

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Evaluate the equation for \( n = 0 \) and negative \( n \) (both even and odd cases).  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( n = 0 \) and test negative \( n \) using the even/odd cases from Step 2.

[IMP]  
- For \( n = 0 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor = 0, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{0^2}{4} \right\rfloor = 0
  \]
  \[
  0 - 0^2 = 0 \neq 2
  \]
  No solution.

- For negative \( n \), let \( n = -m \), \( m > 0 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{-m}{2} \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil \frac{m}{2} \right\rceil
  \]
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{(-m)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{m^2}{4} \right\rfloor
  \]
  - If \( m \) is even, \( m = 2k \):
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{-m}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -k \right\rfloor = -k
    \]
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{m^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor k^2 \right\rfloor = k^2
    \]
    \[
    k^2 - (-k)^2 = k^2 - k^2 = 0 \neq 2
    \]
  - If \( m \) is odd, \( m = 2k + 1 \):
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{-m}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -\frac{2k + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -k - \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = -(k + 1)
    \]
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{m^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{(2k + 1)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = k^2 + k
    \]
    \[
    (k^2 + k) - (-(k + 1))^2 = k^2 + k - (k^2 + 2k + 1) = -k - 1
    \]
    Set equal to 2:
    \[
    -k - 1 = 2 \implies k = -3
    \]
    Then:
    \[
    m = 2(-3) + 1 = -5 \implies n = -m = 5
    \]
    This is not negative, indicating a potential oversight. Let’s correct by testing \( n = -5 \):
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{-5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -2.5 \right\rfloor = -3
    \]
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{(-5)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = 6
    \]
    \[
    6 - (-3)^2 = 6 - 9 = -3 \neq 2
    \]
    Try the odd negative case with \( k = -3 \):
    \[
    n = -(2k + 1) = -(-6 + 1) = 5
    \]
    This suggests negative odd \( n \) may reduce to positive cases. Test another \( k \), e.g., \( k = -2 \):
    \[
    -k - 1 = -(-2) - 1 = 1 \neq 2
    \]
No negative solutions satisfy the equation.

### Step 8: Review all goals and solutions

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find all integer \( n \) such that \(\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by expressing floor functions for even and odd \( n \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for odd \( n = 2k + 1 \), yielding \( n = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify \( n = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test other odd \( n \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Test even \( n \), \( n = 0 \), and negative \( n \).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm all solutions have been found.  
**Summary**:  
- Even \( n \): No solutions (\( k^2 - k^2 = 0 \)).  
- Odd \( n \): Only \( k = 2 \), so \( n = 5 \).  
- \( n = 0 \): No solution.  
- Negative \( n \): No solutions after testing.  
The only solution is \( n = 5 \).

### Step 9: Final verification

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Perform a final check by testing integers around \( n = 5 \) and negative counterparts to confirm no other solutions.  
- **How to Achieve**: Test \( n = 3, 7, -5, -7 \) explicitly.

[IMP]  
- \( n = 3 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = 1, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9}{4} \right\rfloor = 2 \implies 2 - 1^2 = 1 \neq 2
  \]
- \( n = 7 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor = 3, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{49}{4} \right\rfloor = 12 \implies 12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3 \neq 2
  \]
- \( n = -5 \): (From Step 7) \(-3 \neq 2\).  
- \( n = -7 \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{-7}{2} \right\rfloor = -4, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{49}{4} \right\rfloor = 12 \implies 12 - (-4)^2 = 12 - 16 = -4 \neq 2
  \]
No additional solutions.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The only integer value of \( n \) that satisfies the equation is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
