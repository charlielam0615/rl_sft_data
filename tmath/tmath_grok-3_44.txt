### Problem Statement
We need to find all integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2
\]

where \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function, which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

To solve the equation, break it into manageable subgoals:
1. Understand the components of the equation, particularly the floor functions.
2. Express \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) in terms of \( n \), considering whether \( n \) is even or odd.
3. Set up the equation for both cases (even and odd \( n \)) and solve for integer solutions.
4. Verify solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) based on whether \( n \) is even or odd, then formulate the equation.

**How to achieve it**: Analyze the floor functions for even and odd \( n \), substitute into the equation, and solve for \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s consider the two cases for \( n \):

**Case 1: \( n \) is even**
Suppose \( n = 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer.
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2k}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor k \right\rfloor = k
  \]
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{n^2}{4} = \frac{4k^2}{4} = k^2
  \]
  Since \( k^2 \) is an integer, \( \left\lfloor k^2 \right\rfloor = k^2 \).
- Substitute into the equation:
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = k^2 - k^2 = 0
  \]
  This gives \( 0 = 2 \), which is a contradiction. Thus, there are no solutions when \( n \) is even.

**Case 2: \( n \) is odd**
Suppose \( n = 2k + 1 \), where \( k \) is an integer.
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2k + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor k + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = k
  \]
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
  \]
  \[
  \frac{n^2}{4} = \frac{4k^2 + 4k + 1}{4} = k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Since \( k^2 + k \) is an integer and \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 < 1 \), we have:
  \[
  \left\lfloor k^2 + k + \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = k^2 + k
  \]
- Substitute into the equation:
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = (k^2 + k) - k^2 = k
  \]
  Set this equal to 2:
  \[
  k = 2
  \]
- Solve for \( n \):
  \[
  n = 2k + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5
  \]
Thus, \( n = 5 \) is a potential solution for odd \( n \).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if \( n = 5 \) satisfies the original equation and check for other possible solutions.

**How to achieve it**: Substitute \( n = 5 \) into the equation and test a few other integers (both positive and negative) to confirm all solutions.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verify \( n = 5 \)**:
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.5 \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 6.25 \right\rfloor = 6 \)
- Check the equation:
  \[
  6 - 2^2 = 6 - 4 = 2
  \]
This satisfies the equation.

**Test other integers**:
- **\( n = 3 \)** (odd):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.5 \right\rfloor = 1, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{3^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{9}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.25 \right\rfloor = 2
  \]
  \[
  2 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \neq 2
  \]
- **\( n = 7 \)** (odd):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 3.5 \right\rfloor = 3, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{7^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{49}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 12.25 \right\rfloor = 12
  \]
  \[
  12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3 \neq 2
  \]
- **\( n = 4 \)** (even):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor = 2, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{4^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{16}{4} \right\rfloor = 4
  \]
  \[
  4 - 2^2 = 4 - 4 = 0 \neq 2
  \]
- **\( n = -5 \)** (odd):
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{-5}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor -2.5 \right\rfloor = -3, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{(-5)^2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 6.25 \right\rfloor = 6
  \]
  \[
  6 - (-3)^2 = 6 - 9 = -3 \neq 2
  \]

Since the even case yielded a contradiction and testing other odd \( n \) (e.g., \( n = 3, 7, -5 \)) did not produce solutions, \( n = 5 \) appears to be the only solution.

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Find all integer values of \( n \) such that \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the floor functions and express them based on \( n \)'s parity (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the equation for even and odd \( n \) (completed; even \( n \) has no solutions, odd \( n \) yields \( n = 5 \)).
  - Sub-goal 3: Verify solutions and check for completeness (completed; \( n = 5 \) verified, other integers tested).
  - **Current goal**: Confirm that no other solutions exist and finalize the answer.

**Current Goal**: Ensure all possible integer solutions have been identified by reviewing the approach and considering any missed cases.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Backward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**

To ensure completeness, work backward from the equation \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor^2 = 2 \). Assume \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = m \) (an integer), express \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \) in terms of \( m \), and solve for \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation by setting \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = m \) and expressing \( n \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \) in terms of \( m \).

**How to achieve it**: Substitute \( m \) into the equation, derive possible \( n \), and check consistency with integer constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = m \), so:
\[
m \leq \frac{n}{2} < m + 1 \implies n \leq 2m < n + 1 \implies 2m \leq n < 2m + 2
\]
Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n = 2m \) or \( n = 2m + 1 \).

**Case 1: \( n = 2m \)** (even):
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m}{2} \right\rfloor = m \), which is consistent.
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  n^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{n^2}{4} = m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \left\lfloor m^2 \right\rfloor = m^2
  \]
- Equation:
  \[
  m^2 - m^2 = 0 \neq 2
  \]
No solutions, consistent with Step 2.

**Case 2: \( n = 2m + 1 \)** (odd):
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2m + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = m \), which is consistent.
- Compute \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor \):
  \[
  n^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{n^2}{4} = m^2 + m + \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  \[
  \left\lfloor m^2 + m + \frac{1}{4} \right\rfloor = m^2 + m
  \]
- Equation:
  \[
  (m^2 + m) - m^2 = m = 2 \implies m = 2
  \]
- Solve for \( n \):
  \[
  n = 2m + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5
  \]

This confirms \( n = 5 \). Try other \( m \):
- If \( m = 1 \):
  \[
  m = 1 \neq 2
  \]
- If \( m = 3 \):
  \[
  m = 3 \neq 2
  \]

Since \( m = 2 \) is the only integer satisfying \( m = 2 \), and the even case yields no solutions, \( n = 5 \) is the only candidate.
