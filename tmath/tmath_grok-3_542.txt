**Problem Statement**: Mark borrows $10 from Emily with a simple interest rate of 15% per day. We need to find the least integer number of days after which the amount Mark owes (principal plus interest) is at least twice the borrowed amount, i.e., at least $20.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the least integer number of days into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the simple interest formula and apply it to calculate the total amount owed after n days.  
2. Set up an inequality to find when the total amount is at least twice the borrowed amount ($20).  
3. Solve for the smallest integer n that satisfies the inequality.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the simple interest formula to express the total amount owed after n days. Use the formula A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal, r is the daily interest rate, and t is the number of days, then set up the condition for the amount to be at least $20.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The simple interest formula is A = P(1 + rt), where:  
- P = $10 (principal),  
- r = 15% per day = 0.15,  
- t = n (number of days).  

Thus, the amount owed after n days is:  
A = 10(1 + 0.15n).  

We need A ≥ 20:  
10(1 + 0.15n) ≥ 20.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality 10(1 + 0.15n) ≥ 20 for the smallest integer n. This involves algebraic manipulation to isolate n and determine the least integer satisfying the condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the inequality:  
10(1 + 0.15n) ≥ 20.  
Divide both sides by 10:  
1 + 0.15n ≥ 2.  
Subtract 1:  
0.15n ≥ 1.  
Divide by 0.15:  
n ≥ 1 / 0.15 = 100 / 15 ≈ 6.6667.  

Since n must be an integer, take the smallest integer n ≥ 6.6667, which is n = 7.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that n = 7 is the smallest integer number of days where the amount owed is at least $20, and that n = 6 does not satisfy the condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check n = 7:  
A = 10(1 + 0.15 × 7) = 10(1 + 1.05) = 10 × 2.05 = $20.50.  
Since $20.50 ≥ $20, n = 7 satisfies the condition.  

Check n = 6:  
A = 10(1 + 0.15 × 6) = 10(1 + 0.90) = 10 × 1.90 = $19.00.  
Since $19.00 < $20, n = 6 does not satisfy the condition.  

Thus, n = 7 is the smallest integer number of days.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the least integer number of days after which Mark owes at least $20.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand and apply the simple interest formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the inequality for n (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution by checking n = 7 and n = 6 (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution is complete and correct. The smallest integer n = 7 has been validated, as the amount owed is $20.50 (≥ $20) for n = 7, and $19.00 (< $20) for n = 6.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The least integer number of days after which Mark will have to pay back at least twice as much as he borrowed is 7 days.
