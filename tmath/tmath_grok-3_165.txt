**Problem Statement**: We need to determine the number of zeros in the decimal expansion of \(99,999,999^2\). The problem provides examples: \(9^2 = 81\) (0 zeros), \(99^2 = 9,801\) (1 zero), and \(999^2 = 998,001\) (2 zeros), suggesting a pattern where the number of zeros in \((10^n - 1)^2\) relates to \(n\).

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to identify the pattern and compute the number of zeros in \(99,999,999^2\).  
Subgoals:  
1. Express \(99,999,999\) mathematically to identify its form.  
2. Generalize the pattern observed in the examples (\(9^2\), \(99^2\), \(999^2\)).  
3. Derive a formula for the number of zeros in \((10^n - 1)^2\).  
4. Apply the formula for \(n = 8\) (since \(99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1\)).  
5. Verify the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \(99,999,999\) mathematically and confirm it matches the pattern in the examples. This will be achieved by recognizing that \(9 = 10^1 - 1\), \(99 = 10^2 - 1\), \(999 = 10^3 - 1\), and extending this to \(99,999,999\).  

[IMP]  
The number \(99,999,999\) has 8 digits, all nines. It can be written as:  
\[
99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1
\]
This matches the pattern in the examples:  
- \(9 = 10^1 - 1\) (for \(n = 1\)),  
- \(99 = 10^2 - 1\) (for \(n = 2\)),  
- \(999 = 10^3 - 1\) (for \(n = 3\)).  
Thus, \(99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1\), confirming it follows the form \(10^n - 1\).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to generalize the pattern by computing \((10^n - 1)^2\) and determining the number of zeros in its decimal expansion. This will be achieved by deriving the algebraic expression for \((10^n - 1)^2\) and analyzing its digits.  

[IMP]  
Compute \((10^n - 1)^2\):  
\[
(10^n - 1)^2 = (10^n - 1)(10^n - 1) = 10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1
\]
To understand the decimal expansion, rewrite:  
\[
10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1 = 10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 10^n - 10^n + 1 = (10^{2n} - 10^n) - (10^n - 1)
\]
However, a more direct approach is to compute the decimal form:  
\[
(10^n - 1)^2 = 10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1
\]
Notice the pattern in the examples:  
- For \(n = 1\): \(9^2 = (10^1 - 1)^2 = 81\), which is \(100 - 2 \cdot 10 + 1 = 10^2 - 2 \cdot 10 + 1\).  
- For \(n = 2\): \(99^2 = (10^2 - 1)^2 = 9,801 = 10^4 - 2 \cdot 10^2 + 1\).  
- For \(n = 3\): \(999^2 = (10^3 - 1)^2 = 998,001 = 10^6 - 2 \cdot 10^3 + 1\).  

The decimal expansion of \(10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1\) can be visualized:  
\[
10^{2n} = 1 \text{ followed by } 2n \text{ zeros}
\]
\[
-2 \cdot 10^n = -2 \text{ followed by } n \text{ zeros}
\]
\[
+1 = 1
\]
However, let’s compute directly:  
\[
(10^n - 1)^2 = (10^n - 1)(10^n - 1) = 10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1
\]
For \(n = 2\):  
\[
10^4 - 2 \cdot 10^2 + 1 = 10,000 - 200 + 1 = 9,801
\]
This has digits: 9 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 1 (units), confirming 1 zero.  
For \(n = 3\):  
\[
10^6 - 2 \cdot 10^3 + 1 = 1,000,000 - 2,000 + 1 = 998,001
\]
Digits: 9 (hundreds of thousands), 9 (tens of thousands), 8 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 1 (units), confirming 2 zeros.  
General form:  
\[
(10^n - 1)^2 = \underbrace{9\ldots9}_{n-1} \, 8 \, \underbrace{0\ldots0}_{n-1} \, 1
\]
The number of zeros is \(n - 1\).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the derived pattern to compute the number of zeros in \(99,999,999^2 = (10^8 - 1)^2\). This will be achieved by using the formula \(n - 1\) for the number of zeros, where \(n = 8\).  

[IMP]  
For \(99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1\), we have \(n = 8\).  
The number of zeros in \((10^n - 1)^2\) is \(n - 1\):  
\[
8 - 1 = 7
\]
Thus, \(99,999,999^2\) has 7 zeros in its decimal expansion.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the result by computing \((10^8 - 1)^2\) and counting the zeros in its decimal expansion to confirm it matches the pattern. This will be achieved by calculating the decimal form and inspecting the digits.  

[IMP]  
Compute:  
\[
99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1
\]
\[
(10^8 - 1)^2 = 10^{16} - 2 \cdot 10^8 + 1 = 10,000,000,000,000,000 - 200,000,000 + 1 = 9,999,999,800,000,001
\]
Write the number:  
\[
9,999,999,800,000,001
\]
Count the digits:  
- First 7 digits: 9,999,999 (seven 9’s).  
- 8th digit: 8.  
- Next 7 digits: 000,000,0 (seven 0’s).  
- Last digit: 1.  
Total zeros: 7, confirming the pattern \(n - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).
