### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of zeros in the expansion of \(99,999,999^2\). The problem provides examples: \(9^2 = 81\) (0 zeros), \(99^2 = 9801\) (1 zero), and \(999^2 = 998,001\) (2 zeros), suggesting a pattern where the number of zeros in \((10^n - 1)^2\) relates to \(n\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Identify the pattern in the number of zeros for \((10^n - 1)^2\) based on the given examples.
2. Express \(99,999,999\) in the form \(10^n - 1\) to apply the pattern.
3. Compute or deduce the number of zeros in \((99,999,999)^2\) using the pattern.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the pattern in the number of zeros for \((10^n - 1)^2\).
How to Achieve: Analyze the given examples (\(n=1, 2, 3\)) and compute \((10^n - 1)^2\) to confirm the pattern in the number of zeros.

[IMP]
- For \(n=1\): \(9 = 10^1 - 1\), \(9^2 = 81\). Digits: 8, 1. Zeros: 0.
- For \(n=2\): \(99 = 10^2 - 1\), \(99^2 = 9801\). Digits: 9, 8, 0, 1. Zeros: 1.
- For \(n=3\): \(999 = 10^3 - 1\), \(999^2 = 998,001\). Digits: 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 1. Zeros: 2.
- Observe: For \(n=1\), 0 zeros; \(n=2\), 1 zero; \(n=3\), 2 zeros. Hypothesize that for \((10^n - 1)^2\), the number of zeros is \(n-1\).
- Test for \(n=4\): \(9999 = 10^4 - 1\), \(9999^2 = (10^4 - 1)^2 = 10^8 - 2 \cdot 10^4 + 1 = 99,980,001\). Digits: 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1. Zeros: 3, which is \(4-1\).
The pattern holds: \((10^n - 1)^2\) has \(n-1\) zeros.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Confirm that \(99,999,999\) fits the pattern and apply it.
How to Achieve: Express \(99,999,999\) as \(10^n - 1\), determine \(n\), and use the pattern to find the number of zeros.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- \(99,999,999\) has 8 digits, all 9s, so \(99,999,999 = 10^8 - 1\), where \(n=8\).
- Per the pattern, \((10^n - 1)^2\) has \(n-1\) zeros. For \(n=8\), the number of zeros is \(8-1 = 7\).
- To verify, consider the form: \((10^8 - 1)^2 = 10^{16} - 2 \cdot 10^8 + 1 = 99,999,998,000,000,001\). Digits: two 9s, seven 0s, one 1. Zeros: 7, confirming the pattern.
