**Problem Statement**: We are given the system of equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\), and we need to find the value of the expression \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\), we first need to determine the values of \(x\) and \(y\) by solving the given system of equations. We can then substitute these values into the target expression. The subgoals are:  
1. Solve the system of equations to find \(x\) and \(y\).  
2. Substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).  
3. Compute the final value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) to find \(x\) and \(y\).  
How to Achieve: Use the elimination method to solve the system by eliminating one variable, then solve for the other variable, and substitute back to find the first variable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve the system:  
1. \(2x + y = 4\) (Equation 1)  
2. \(x + 2y = 5\) (Equation 2)  

Multiply Equation 2 by 2 to align the coefficients of \(x\):  
\[ 2(x + 2y) = 2 \cdot 5 \implies 2x + 4y = 10 \] (Equation 3)  

Now subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate \(x\):  
\[ (2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 10 - 4 \implies 3y = 6 \implies y = 2 \]  

Substitute \(y = 2\) into Equation 2:  
\[ x + 2(2) = 5 \implies x + 4 = 5 \implies x = 1 \]  

Thus, \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) satisfies both equations.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) into both original equations and check if they hold.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check Equation 1: \(2x + y = 4\)  
\[ 2(1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \] (Satisfied)  

Check Equation 2: \(x + 2y = 5\)  
\[ 1 + 2(2) = 1 + 4 = 5 \] (Satisfied)  

The solution \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\) using \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) into the expression and perform the arithmetic operations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) into \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\):  
\[ 5(1)^2 + 8(1)(2) + 5(2)^2 = 5 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 4 = 5 + 16 + 20 = 41 \]  

Thus, \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 = 41\).  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system \(2x + y = 4\), \(x + 2y = 5\) for \(x\) and \(y\). (Completed: \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\))  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\). (Completed: Result = 41)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the final value. (Completed)  

Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed. The final answer is \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 = 41\).
