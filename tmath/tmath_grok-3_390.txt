**Problem Statement**: Given the system of linear equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\), find the value of the expression \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Solve the system of equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).  
2. Substitute the values of \(x\) and \(y\) into the expression \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).  
3. Compute the final numerical value of the expression.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) to find \(x\) and \(y\). This will be achieved by using the elimination method to eliminate one variable and solve for the other, then back-substitute to find the second variable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve the system:  
1. Equations:  
   - \(2x + y = 4\) (Equation 1)  
   - \(x + 2y = 5\) (Equation 2)  

2. Multiply Equation 2 by 2 to align the coefficients of \(x\):  
   \(2(x + 2y) = 2 \cdot 5 \implies 2x + 4y = 10\) (Equation 3)  

3. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate \(x\):  
   \((2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 10 - 4\)  
   \(2x + 4y - 2x - y = 6\)  
   \(3y = 6 \implies y = 2\)  

4. Substitute \(y = 2\) into Equation 2:  
   \(x + 2 \cdot 2 = 5 \implies x + 4 = 5 \implies x = 1\)  

Thus, \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) by substituting into both original equations to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the solution in both equations:  
- For \(2x + y = 4\):  
  \(2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\), which satisfies the equation.  
- For \(x + 2y = 5\):  
  \(1 + 2 \cdot 2 = 1 + 4 = 5\), which satisfies the equation.  

The solution \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) into the expression \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\) and compute its value.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\) into \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\):  
- \(x^2 = 1^2 = 1\)  
- \(y^2 = 2^2 = 4\)  
- \(xy = 1 \cdot 2 = 2\)  

Compute:  
\(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 = 5 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 4 = 5 + 16 + 20 = 41\)  

The value of the expression is 41.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the value of \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the system of equations \(2x + y = 4\) and \(x + 2y = 5\) (completed: \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\) (completed: computed value is 41).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution (completed: solution verified).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the value of \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 = 41\) has been computed and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The value of \(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\) is 41.
