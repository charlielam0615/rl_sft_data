**Problem Statement**: Find the y-intercept point of the line given by the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\), and provide the answer as an ordered pair.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the y-intercept, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand that the y-intercept occurs where \(x = 0\).  
2. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to solve for \(y\).  
3. Express the result as an ordered pair \((0, y)\).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\) to find \(y\).  
How to Achieve: Set \(x = 0\), solve the resulting equation for \(y\), and compute the value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 0\) into \(3x + 5y = 20\):  
\[ 3(0) + 5y = 20 \]  
\[ 5y = 20 \]  
\[ y = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]  
The y-intercept occurs at \(y = 4\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express the y-intercept as an ordered pair.  
How to Achieve: Use the value of \(y\) found in the previous step and form the ordered pair \((0, y)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The y-intercept is where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 4\). Thus, the ordered pair is \((0, 4)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that the point \((0, 4)\) satisfies the original equation.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = 4\) back into \(3x + 5y = 20\) and check if the equation holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \((0, 4)\) into \(3x + 5y = 20\):  
\[ 3(0) + 5(4) = 0 + 20 = 20 \]  
The equation holds, confirming the y-intercept is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the y-intercept of \(3x + 5y = 20\) as an ordered pair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set \(x = 0\) and solve for \(y\). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the y-intercept as an ordered pair. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution. (Completed)  
Current Goal: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The y-intercept is confirmed as \((0, 4)\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The y-intercept of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\) is \((0, 4)\).
