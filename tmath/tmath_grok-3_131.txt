**Problem Statement**: Find the y-intercept point of the line given by the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\), and provide the answer as an ordered pair.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the y-intercept, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Understand that the y-intercept occurs where \(x = 0\).  
2. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\).  
3. Solve for \(y\).  
4. Express the result as an ordered pair \((0, y)\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-intercept by substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation \(3x + 5y = 20\) and solving for \(y\). This will be achieved by performing algebraic manipulation to isolate \(y\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:  
\[ 3(0) + 5y = 20 \]  
\[ 5y = 20 \]  
Divide both sides by 5:  
\[ y = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]  
The y-intercept point is \((0, 4)\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the y-intercept point \((0, 4)\) by checking if it satisfies the original equation \(3x + 5y = 20\). This will be achieved by substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 4\) back into the equation and verifying equality.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = 4\) into \(3x + 5y = 20\):  
\[ 3(0) + 5(4) = 0 + 20 = 20 \]  
Since \(20 = 20\), the point \((0, 4)\) satisfies the equation, confirming it is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the y-intercept point of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\) as an ordered pair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve for \(y\) (completed, \(y = 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express as an ordered pair (completed, \((0, 4)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed, point satisfies the equation).  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed, and the main goal is achieved.  
The y-intercept point is confirmed as \((0, 4)\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The y-intercept point of the line \(3x + 5y = 20\) is \((0, 4)\).
