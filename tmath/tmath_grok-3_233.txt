**Problem Statement**: Given the functions \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = 4x + 3 \), compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve \( f(g(f(2))) \), break down the computation into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute \( f(2) \).  
2. Use the result from step 1 as the input for \( g \), i.e., compute \( g(f(2)) \).  
3. Use the result from step 2 as the input for \( f \), i.e., compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(2) \).  
Description: Apply the function \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \) by substituting \( x = 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( f(2) \):  
\[ f(2) = 3(2) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( g(f(2)) \).  
Description: Use the result \( f(2) = 9 \) as the input for \( g(x) = 4x + 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(f(2)) = g(9) \):  
\[ g(9) = 4(9) + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).  
Description: Use the result \( g(f(2)) = 39 \) as the input for \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( f(g(f(2))) = f(39) \):  
\[ f(39) = 3(39) + 3 = 117 + 3 = 120 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(g(f(2))) \).  
Description: Recompute each step to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
1. \( f(2) = 3(2) + 3 = 9 \).  
2. \( g(9) = 4(9) + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39 \).  
3. \( f(39) = 3(39) + 3 = 117 + 3 = 120 \).  
The results match the previous computations, confirming correctness.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) \) (Completed: \( f(2) = 9 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(f(2)) \) (Completed: \( g(9) = 39 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(g(f(2))) \) (Completed: \( f(39) = 120 \)).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final result is \( f(g(f(2))) = 120 \).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: \( f(g(f(2))) = 120 \)
