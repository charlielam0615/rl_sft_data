### Problem Statement
We need to compute \( f(g(f(2))) \), where \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = 4x + 3 \). This requires evaluating the composition of functions step-by-step: first compute \( f(2) \), then apply \( g \) to that result, and finally apply \( f \) to the result of \( g \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( f(g(f(2))) \):  
1. Compute \( f(2) \).  
2. Use the result of \( f(2) \) as the input for \( g \), i.e., compute \( g(f(2)) \).  
3. Use the result of \( g(f(2)) \) as the input for \( f \), i.e., compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(2) \), where \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \), compute \( f(2) \):  
\[ f(2) = 3 \cdot 2 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \]  
So, \( f(2) = 9 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( g(f(2)) \), where \( g(x) = 4x + 3 \) and \( f(2) = 9 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 9 \) into the function \( g(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( g(x) = 4x + 3 \), compute \( g(f(2)) = g(9) \):  
\[ g(9) = 4 \cdot 9 + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39 \]  
So, \( g(f(2)) = 39 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(g(f(2))) \), where \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \) and \( g(f(2)) = 39 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( x = 39 \) into the function \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Given \( f(x) = 3x + 3 \), compute \( f(g(f(2))) = f(39) \):  
\[ f(39) = 3 \cdot 39 + 3 = 117 + 3 = 120 \]  
So, \( f(g(f(2))) = 120 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(g(f(2))) = 120 \). This will be achieved by recomputing each step to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute each step:  
1. \( f(2) = 3 \cdot 2 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \).  
2. \( g(f(2)) = g(9) = 4 \cdot 9 + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39 \).  
3. \( f(g(f(2))) = f(39) = 3 \cdot 39 + 3 = 117 + 3 = 120 \).  
The recomputed values match the previous results, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(g(f(2))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(2) = 9 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( g(f(2)) = g(9) = 39 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(g(f(2))) = f(39) = 120 \). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation. (Completed)  
**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals and the main goal have been completed.  
The final result is \( f(g(f(2))) = 120 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
\[ f(g(f(2))) = 120 \]
