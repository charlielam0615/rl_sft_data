**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( a \) such that the quadratic expression \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) is a perfect square of a binomial, i.e., it can be written in the form \( (px + q)^2 \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, we need to express \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) as \( (px + q)^2 \). Let’s break this down into subgoals:  
1. Expand the binomial \( (px + q)^2 \) to get a general quadratic expression.  
2. Compare the expanded form with \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) to set up equations for the coefficients.  
3. Solve for \( a \) by ensuring the quadratic matches the binomial square form.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Expand \( (px + q)^2 \) and compare it to \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) to find relationships between coefficients.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the binomial, equate coefficients with the given quadratic, and derive equations for \( p \), \( q \), and \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( (px + q)^2 \):  
\[ (px + q)^2 = p^2x^2 + 2pqx + q^2 \]  

Compare this to \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \):  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( p^2 = a \)  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2pq = 12 \)  
- Constant term: \( q^2 = 9 \)  

These equations will guide us to find \( a \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations from the coefficient comparison to find \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve for \( p \) and \( q \) using the equations \( 2pq = 12 \) and \( q^2 = 9 \), then use \( p^2 = a \) to find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( q^2 = 9 \):  
\[ q = \pm 3 \]  

From \( 2pq = 12 \):  
\[ pq = 6 \]  

Case 1: \( q = 3 \)  
\[ p \cdot 3 = 6 \implies p = 2 \]  
Then, \( a = p^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).  

Case 2: \( q = -3 \)  
\[ p \cdot (-3) = 6 \implies p = -2 \]  
Then, \( a = p^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 \).  

In both cases, \( a = 4 \). Let’s proceed with this value and verify in the next step.

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify if \( a = 4 \) makes \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) a perfect square of a binomial.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the quadratic, factor it, and check if it matches the form \( (px + q)^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 4 \):  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \]  

Attempt to factor:  
Notice that \( 4x^2 = (2x)^2 \), \( 9 = 3^2 \), and the middle term is \( 12x = 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 3 \). This suggests:  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x + 3)^2 \]  

Verify by expanding:  
\[ (2x + 3)^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \]  
This matches perfectly, confirming that \( a = 4 \) works.  

Let’s also check the case for \( q = -3 \), where \( p = -2 \):  
\[ (-2x - 3)^2 = (-2x - 3)(-2x - 3) = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \]  
This also holds, reinforcing that \( a = 4 \).

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( a \) such that \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) is a perfect square of a binomial.  
  - Subgoal 1: Expand \( (px + q)^2 \) and compare coefficients.  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equations for \( p \), \( q \), and \( a \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution by factoring the quadratic.  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution since verification confirms \( a = 4 \).  

All subgoals have been addressed, and the solution \( a = 4 \) satisfies the condition.
