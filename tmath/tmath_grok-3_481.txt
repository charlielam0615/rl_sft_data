### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand what it means for a quadratic to be the square of a binomial.  
2. Express the quadratic \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) as \( (mx + n)^2 \).  
3. Expand the binomial square and equate coefficients to form equations.  
4. Solve for \( a \) by comparing coefficients.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the form of the binomial square and set up equations.  
**How to Achieve**: A quadratic is the square of a binomial if it can be written as \( (mx + n)^2 \). Expand \( (mx + n)^2 \) and match coefficients with \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) to find relationships between \( a \), \( m \), and \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the binomial square:  
\[ (mx + n)^2 = m^2 x^2 + 2mn x + n^2 \]  
Compare with the given quadratic \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \):  
- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( m^2 = a \)  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2mn = 12 \)  
- Constant term: \( n^2 = 9 \)  

This gives the system of equations:  
1. \( m^2 = a \)  
2. \( 2mn = 12 \)  
3. \( n^2 = 9 \)

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the equations from the previous step, starting with the constant term to find \( n \), then use the linear term to find \( m \), and finally compute \( a \) using the quadratic term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the constant term equation:  
\[ n^2 = 9 \]  
\[ n = \pm 3 \]  

Consider both cases for \( n \):  

**Case 1: \( n = 3 \)**  
Use the linear term equation:  
\[ 2mn = 12 \]  
\[ 2m \cdot 3 = 12 \]  
\[ 6m = 12 \]  
\[ m = 2 \]  
Now, find \( a \):  
\[ m^2 = a \]  
\[ 2^2 = a \]  
\[ a = 4 \]  

**Case 2: \( n = -3 \)**  
\[ 2mn = 12 \]  
\[ 2m \cdot (-3) = 12 \]  
\[ -6m = 12 \]  
\[ m = -2 \]  
Now, find \( a \):  
\[ m^2 = a \]  
\[ (-2)^2 = a \]  
\[ a = 4 \]  

In both cases, \( a = 4 \).

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = 4 \) makes the quadratic a perfect binomial square.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the quadratic and check if the resulting expression is the square of a binomial by factoring or completing the square.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( a = 4 \):  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \]  
Check if this is a perfect square by factoring:  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 3 + 3^2 = (2x + 3)^2 \]  
Alternatively, complete the square:  
\[ 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = 4\left( x^2 + 3x + \frac{9}{4} \right) = 4\left( x + \frac{3}{2} \right)^2 \]  
Both methods confirm the expression is a binomial square, so \( a = 4 \) is valid.

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( a \) such that \( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \) is the square of a binomial.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the binomial square form (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the quadratic as \( (mx + n)^2 \) and set up equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for \( a \) using the system of equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
**Conclusion**: The value of \( a \) is 4, as it satisfies the condition for both \( n = 3 \) and \( n = -3 \), and the quadratic \( 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \) is confirmed to be \( (2x + 3)^2 \).
