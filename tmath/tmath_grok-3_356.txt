**Problem Statement**: We need to compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) \), where \( y = G(x) \) is a function whose graph is provided in red, plotted on a grid where each unit is 1. The graph is generated by the Asymptote code, and the function is defined as \( G(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 \). We will iteratively apply the function \( G \) five times, starting with \( x = 1 \).

### Step 1: Understand the function and set up the computation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) \), break down the task into iterative applications of the function \( G \). The subgoals are:
1. Define the function \( G(x) \) from the provided Asymptote code.
2. Compute \( G(1) \).
3. Compute \( G(G(1)) \).
4. Compute \( G(G(G(1))) \).
5. Compute \( G(G(G(G(1)))) \).
6. Compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) \).  
Each step involves applying the function \( G \) to the result of the previous step.

### Step 2: Define the function \( G(x) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the function \( G(x) \) based on the Asymptote code. The code provides the function \( G(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 \). We will use this to perform subsequent computations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the Asymptote code, the function is defined as:  
\[ G(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 \]  
This is a quadratic function, and we will use it for all iterative calculations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Compute \( G(1) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( G(1) \). We will substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( G(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ G(1) = \frac{(1-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{0^2}{2} - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \]  
So, \( G(1) = -3 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Compute \( G(G(1)) = G(-3) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( G(-3) \), since \( G(1) = -3 \). We will substitute \( x = -3 \) into \( G(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ G(-3) = \frac{((-3)-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{(-4)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]  
So, \( G(G(1)) = G(-3) = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Compute \( G(G(G(1))) = G(5) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( G(5) \), since \( G(-3) = 5 \). We will substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( G(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ G(5) = \frac{(5-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{4^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]  
So, \( G(G(G(1))) = G(5) = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Compute \( G(G(G(G(1)))) = G(5) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( G(5) \), since \( G(5) = 5 \). We will substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( G(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ G(5) = \frac{(5-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{4^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]  
So, \( G(G(G(G(1)))) = G(5) = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) = G(5) \)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( G(5) \), since \( G(5) = 5 \). We will substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( G(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ G(5) = \frac{(5-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{4^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]  
So, \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) = G(5) = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Review the goal hierarchy and confirm the result

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Define \( G(x) = \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( G(1) = -3 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( G(-3) = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( G(5) = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( G(5) = 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 6: Compute \( G(5) = 5 \).  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) \), which has been calculated as \( G(5) = 5 \).  
The sequence of computations shows that after reaching \( x = 5 \), the function stabilizes, as \( G(5) = 5 \). This suggests \( x = 5 \) is a fixed point of the function.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 9: Validate the computation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( G(G(G(G(G(1))))) = 5 \). We will check the calculations and confirm the fixed point behavior at \( x = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Letâ€™s recompute the sequence:  
- \( G(1) = \frac{(1-1)^2}{2} - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \).  
- \( G(-3) = \frac{((-3)-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 5 \).  
- \( G(5) = \frac{(5-1)^2}{2} - 3 = \frac{16}{2} - 3 = 5 \).  
- \( G(5) = 5 \).  
- \( G(5) = 5 \).  
The calculations are consistent. Additionally, \( G(5) = 5 \) indicates a fixed point. To confirm, solve for fixed points:  
\[ G(x) = x \implies \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} - 3 = x \implies (x-1)^2 = 2x + 6 \implies x^2 - 2x + 1 = 2x + 6 \implies x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 \implies (x-5)(x+1) = 0 \]  
Fixed points are \( x = 5 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since the sequence reached \( x = 5 \), further iterations remain at 5. The result is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ G(G(G(G(G(1))))) = 5 \]  
\[ \boxed{5} \]
