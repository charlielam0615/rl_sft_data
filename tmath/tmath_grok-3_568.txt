**Problem Statement**: Given the function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 4}{x^2 + ax + b} \), with vertical asymptotes at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \), find the sum of \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( a \) and \( b \):  
1. Determine the conditions for vertical asymptotes in a rational function.  
2. Use the given vertical asymptotes to set up equations for \( a \) and \( b \).  
3. Solve the equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
4. Compute the sum \( a + b \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the conditions for vertical asymptotes in the function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 4}{x^2 + ax + b} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. Set the denominator \( x^2 + ax + b = 0 \) and use the given asymptotes at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \). Ensure the numerator \( x + 4 \) is non-zero at these points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The denominator of \( f(x) = \frac{x + 4}{x^2 + ax + b} \) is \( x^2 + ax + b \). For vertical asymptotes at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \), the denominator must be zero at these points:  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( 1^2 + a(1) + b = 1 + a + b = 0 \).  
- At \( x = -2 \): \( (-2)^2 + a(-2) + b = 4 - 2a + b = 0 \).  

Additionally, check the numerator \( x + 4 \):  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( 1 + 4 = 5 \neq 0 \).  
- At \( x = -2 \): \( -2 + 4 = 2 \neq 0 \).  

Since the numerator is non-zero at both points, vertical asymptotes exist at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \). The equations are:  
1. \( a + b = -1 \)  
2. \( -2a + b = -4 \)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equations \( a + b = -1 \) and \( -2a + b = -4 \) to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using substitution or elimination.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, we have:  
1. \( a + b = -1 \)  
2. \( -2a + b = -4 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( b \):  
\[ (-2a + b) - (a + b) = -4 - (-1) \]  
\[ -2a + b - a - b = -4 + 1 \]  
\[ -3a = -3 \]  
\[ a = 1 \]

Substitute \( a = 1 \) into the first equation:  
\[ 1 + b = -1 \]  
\[ b = -2 \]

Thus, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -2 \) produce vertical asymptotes at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -2 \) into the denominator and check if it equals zero at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \). Confirm the numerator is non-zero at these points.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The denominator is \( x^2 + ax + b = x^2 + 1 \cdot x + (-2) = x^2 + x - 2 \).  
Factorize: \( x^2 + x - 2 = (x + 2)(x - 1) \).  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( (1 + 2)(1 - 1) = 3 \cdot 0 = 0 \).  
- At \( x = -2 \): \( (-2 + 2)(-2 - 1) = 0 \cdot (-3) = 0 \).

The numerator is \( x + 4 \):  
- At \( x = 1 \): \( 1 + 4 = 5 \neq 0 \).  
- At \( x = -2 \): \( -2 + 4 = 2 \neq 0 \).

The denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \), confirming vertical asymptotes.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum \( a + b \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the values \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -2 \) from Step 3 and calculate \( a + b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \).  
The sum is:  
\[ a + b = 1 + (-2) = -1 \]  
[/IMP]
