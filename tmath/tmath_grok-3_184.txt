**Problem Restatement**: Sarah wants to fence a rectangular area with a minimum area of 100 square feet, using the least amount of fencing material. The length of the rectangle must be 15 feet longer than its width. We need to determine the width of the rectangle in feet.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the rectangle’s dimensions based on the given relationship.  
2. Express the area and perimeter (fencing material) in terms of these variables.  
3. Set up the constraint that the area must be at least 100 square feet.  
4. Minimize the perimeter subject to this constraint.  
5. Solve for the width.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables for the rectangle’s dimensions and express the area and perimeter. Let the width be \( w \) feet. Since the length is 15 feet longer than the width, the length is \( w + 15 \). The area is \( w \cdot (w + 15) \), and the perimeter (fencing material) is \( 2w + 2(w + 15) \). These expressions will be used to set up the optimization problem.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let’s define:  
- Width = \( w \) feet  
- Length = \( w + 15 \) feet  

The area of the rectangle is:  
\[ A = w \cdot (w + 15) \]  
The problem requires the area to be at least 100 square feet:  
\[ w \cdot (w + 15) \geq 100 \]  

The perimeter (total fencing material) is:  
\[ P = 2w + 2(w + 15) = 2w + 2w + 30 = 4w + 30 \]  
Our goal is to minimize \( P \) while satisfying the area constraint.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the optimization problem by expressing the perimeter as a function of \( w \) and incorporating the area constraint. We will use the area constraint \( w \cdot (w + 15) \geq 100 \) to find the minimum perimeter \( P = 4w + 30 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To minimize the perimeter, first consider the area constraint:  
\[ w \cdot (w + 15) \geq 100 \]  
Simplify the perimeter:  
\[ P = 4w + 30 \]  
Since \( P \) is a linear function of \( w \), it decreases as \( w \) decreases. Thus, the minimum perimeter occurs at the smallest possible \( w \) that satisfies the area constraint. Set the area equal to 100 to find the boundary of the constraint:  
\[ w \cdot (w + 15) = 100 \]  
\[ w^2 + 15w = 100 \]  
\[ w^2 + 15w - 100 = 0 \]  
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = -100 \):  
\[ w = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-100)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]  
\[ w = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225 + 400}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{625}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm 25}{2} \]  
\[ w = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-40}{2} = -20 \]  
Since width cannot be negative, \( w = 5 \).  
Check if \( w = 5 \) satisfies the area constraint:  
\[ A = 5 \cdot (5 + 15) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \]  
This meets the area requirement exactly (\( \geq 100 \)).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether \( w = 5 \) feet gives the minimum perimeter while satisfying the area constraint. Check the area and perimeter at \( w = 5 \), and verify if increasing \( w \) increases the perimeter.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( w = 5 \):  
- Length = \( 5 + 15 = 20 \) feet  
- Area = \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \) square feet, which satisfies \( \geq 100 \).  
- Perimeter = \( 4 \cdot 5 + 30 = 20 + 30 = 50 \) feet.  

Test a slightly larger \( w \), say \( w = 6 \):  
- Length = \( 6 + 15 = 21 \) feet  
- Area = \( 6 \cdot 21 = 126 \) square feet, which satisfies the constraint.  
- Perimeter = \( 4 \cdot 6 + 30 = 24 + 30 = 54 \) feet.  

Since \( P = 4w + 30 \) is an increasing function of \( w \), any \( w > 5 \) increases the perimeter while still satisfying the area constraint, confirming that \( w = 5 \) minimizes the perimeter at the boundary of the area constraint.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Find the width that minimizes the perimeter while ensuring the area is at least 100 square feet and the length is 15 feet longer than the width.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables (width = \( w \), length = \( w + 15 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express area (\( w \cdot (w + 15) \geq 100 \)) and perimeter (\( P = 4w + 30 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Minimize perimeter subject to the area constraint.  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve the quadratic equation \( w^2 + 15w = 100 \).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the solution.  
Current goal: Confirm the final answer for the width.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The hierarchy of goals shows we have defined variables, set up the area and perimeter equations, solved for \( w = 5 \), and validated that this width minimizes the perimeter while meeting the area constraint. The current goal is to state the final answer. Based on the calculations, the width \( w = 5 \) feet satisfies all conditions.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The width should be 5 feet.
