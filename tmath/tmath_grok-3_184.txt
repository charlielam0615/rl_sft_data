**Problem Statement**: Sarah wants to fence a rectangular area with at least 100 square feet, using the least amount of fencing material. The length of the rectangle must be 15 feet longer than the width. We need to determine the width of the rectangle in feet.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the width that minimizes the fencing material while ensuring the area is at least 100 square feet and the length is 15 feet longer than the width.  
- Subgoal 1: Define variables for width and length based on the given relationship.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up the area constraint to meet or exceed 100 square feet.  
- Subgoal 3: Formulate the perimeter (fencing material) as a function to minimize.  
- Subgoal 4: Solve for the width that minimizes the perimeter while satisfying the area constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables for width and length and establish their relationship based on the problem statement. This involves setting up the length as 15 feet more than the width and expressing the area and perimeter in terms of these variables.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \) feet. Since the length is 15 feet longer than the width, the length is \( w + 15 \) feet.  
- The area of the rectangle is given by \( \text{Area} = w \cdot (w + 15) \), and it must be at least 100 square feet: \( w \cdot (w + 15) \geq 100 \).  
- The perimeter (total fencing material) is \( P = 2w + 2(w + 15) = 2w + 2w + 30 = 4w + 30 \).  
The goal is to minimize the perimeter \( P = 4w + 30 \) while ensuring the area constraint \( w(w + 15) \geq 100 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the area constraint \( w(w + 15) \geq 100 \) to ensure the rectangle meets the minimum area requirement. This involves solving the inequality to find feasible values of \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve the inequality for the area:  
\[ w(w + 15) \geq 100 \]  
This is a quadratic inequality:  
\[ w^2 + 15w - 100 \geq 0 \]  
Find the roots of the equation \( w^2 + 15w - 100 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = -100 \):  
\[ \text{Discriminant} = 15^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-100) = 225 + 400 = 625 \]  
\[ w = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{625}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-15 \pm 25}{2} \]  
\[ w = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-40}{2} = -20 \]  
Since width cannot be negative, discard \( w = -20 \). Test the boundary at \( w = 5 \):  
\[ \text{Area} = 5 \cdot (5 + 15) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \]  
The area is exactly 100 square feet, which satisfies \( w(w + 15) \geq 100 \). For \( w > 5 \), the area increases (e.g., at \( w = 6 \), area = \( 6 \cdot 21 = 126 \)), so \( w \geq 5 \) ensures the area constraint.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to minimize the perimeter \( P = 4w + 30 \) while ensuring \( w \geq 5 \) to satisfy the area constraint. This involves analyzing the perimeter function and finding the smallest possible \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The perimeter function is \( P = 4w + 30 \). Since this is a linear function with a positive slope, \( P \) increases as \( w \) increases. To minimize the perimeter, choose the smallest possible \( w \) that satisfies \( w \geq 5 \).  
At \( w = 5 \):  
- Perimeter: \( P = 4 \cdot 5 + 30 = 20 + 30 = 50 \) feet.  
- Area (verified): \( 5 \cdot (5 + 15) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \) square feet, which meets the requirement.  
For a slightly larger \( w \), say \( w = 6 \):  
- Perimeter: \( P = 4 \cdot 6 + 30 = 24 + 30 = 54 \) feet.  
- Area: \( 6 \cdot (6 + 15) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126 \) square feet (still valid).  
Since the perimeter increases with \( w \), the minimum perimeter occurs at the smallest \( w \), which is \( w = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the width of a rectangular area with at least 100 square feet, minimizing fencing material, with length 15 feet longer than width.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables (width \( w \), length \( w + 15 \)) — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up area constraint \( w(w + 15) \geq 100 \) — Completed (\( w \geq 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Formulate perimeter as \( P = 4w + 30 \) to minimize — Completed.  
  - Subgoal 4: Solve for width minimizing perimeter while satisfying area — Completed (\( w = 5 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the width that minimizes the perimeter. The current solution suggests \( w = 5 \) feet, with perimeter 50 feet and area 100 square feet.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if \( w = 5 \) is optimal and satisfies all constraints, ensuring no smaller perimeter is possible within the area constraint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-evaluate the solution:  
- For \( w = 5 \):  
  - Length = \( 5 + 15 = 20 \) feet.  
  - Area = \( 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \) square feet, satisfying \( \geq 100 \).  
  - Perimeter = \( 4 \cdot 5 + 30 = 50 \) feet.  
- Test a slightly smaller \( w \), e.g., \( w = 4.9 \):  
  - Length = \( 4.9 + 15 = 19.9 \) feet.  
  - Area = \( 4.9 \cdot 19.9 \approx 97.51 \) square feet, which is less than 100 (invalid).  
- The perimeter \( P = 4w + 30 \) is strictly increasing, so any \( w < 5 \) reduces the perimeter but violates the area constraint.  
Thus, \( w = 5 \) is the smallest width that satisfies all conditions.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The width should be 5 feet.
