**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Expand and simplify the given equation into a standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  
2. Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution (discriminant equals zero).  
3. Solve for \( j \) by setting the discriminant to zero.  
4. Verify the solutions to ensure they produce exactly one real root.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to expand and simplify the equation \((2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx\) into a standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). This will be achieved by expanding the left-hand side, moving all terms to one side, and combining like terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\((2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35 = 2x^2 - 3x - 35\).  

The equation becomes:  
\( 2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx \).  

Move all terms to the left-hand side:  
\( 2x^2 - 3x - 35 - (-43 + jx) = 0 \),  
\( 2x^2 - 3x - 35 + 43 - jx = 0 \),  
\( 2x^2 + (-3 - j)x + (-35 + 43) = 0 \),  
\( 2x^2 + (-j - 3)x + 8 = 0 \).  

The quadratic is now in standard form: \( 2x^2 + (-j - 3)x + 8 = 0 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the condition for the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + (-j - 3)x + 8 = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution. This will be achieved by setting the discriminant of the quadratic to zero and solving for \( j \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). The equation has exactly one real solution when \( \Delta = 0 \).  

Identify the coefficients:  
- \( a = 2 \),  
- \( b = -j - 3 \),  
- \( c = 8 \).  

Compute the discriminant:  
\( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-j - 3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 \).  
Simplify:  
\( (-j - 3)^2 = j^2 + 6j + 9 \),  
\( 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = 64 \),  
\( \Delta = j^2 + 6j + 9 - 64 = j^2 + 6j - 55 \).  

Set the discriminant to zero:  
\( j^2 + 6j - 55 = 0 \).  

Solve the quadratic equation for \( j \):  
Use the quadratic formula \( j = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = -55 \).  
Discriminant of this equation:  
\( b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-55) = 36 + 220 = 256 \).  
\( j = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{256}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm 16}{2} \).  
Solutions:  
\( j = \frac{-6 + 16}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \),  
\( j = \frac{-6 - 16}{2} = \frac{-22}{2} = -11 \).  

Thus, \( j = 5 \) or \( j = -11 \).

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \) produce exactly one real solution in the original equation. This will be achieved by substituting each \( j \) value back into the quadratic and checking the discriminant or solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check \( j = 5 \)**:  
Quadratic: \( 2x^2 + (-5 - 3)x + 8 = 2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0 \).  
Divide by 2: \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \).  
Simplify: \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \).  
Solution: \( x = 2 \) (one real solution, multiplicity 2).  
Discriminant: \( b = -8 \), \( c = 8 \), \( \Delta = (-8)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = 64 - 64 = 0 \). Confirmed.  

**Check \( j = -11 \)**:  
Quadratic: \( 2x^2 + (-(-11) - 3)x + 8 = 2x^2 + (11 - 3)x + 8 = 2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0 \).  
Divide by 2: \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 \).  
Simplify: \( (x + 2)^2 = 0 \).  
Solution: \( x = -2 \) (one real solution, multiplicity 2).  
Discriminant: \( b = 8 \), \( c = 8 \), \( \Delta = 8^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = 64 - 64 = 0 \). Confirmed.  

Both values satisfy the condition for exactly one real solution.
