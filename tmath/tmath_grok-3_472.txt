### Problem Statement
We need to find the values of \( j \) for which the equation \((2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx\) has exactly one real solution. The solution should be expressed as a list of numbers, separated by commas.

I will solve this step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R), and formatting the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for the values of \( j \) that result in exactly one real solution, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
2. Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution (discriminant \( \Delta = 0 \)).
3. Express the discriminant as a function of \( j \).
4. Solve the discriminant equation for \( j \).
5. Verify the solutions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the equation \((2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx\) in standard quadratic form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
How to Achieve: Expand the left-hand side, move all terms to one side, and combine like terms to form a quadratic equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the left-hand side:
\[
(2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x \cdot x + 2x \cdot (-5) + 7 \cdot x + 7 \cdot (-5) = 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35 = 2x^2 - 3x - 35
\]
The original equation is:
\[
2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx
\]
Move all terms to the left-hand side:
\[
2x^2 - 3x - 35 - (-43 + jx) = 0
\]
\[
2x^2 - 3x - 35 + 43 - jx = 0
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2x^2 + (-3 - j)x + (-35 + 43) = 0
\]
\[
2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0
\]
The equation is now in standard form: \( 2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal-Management System:
- Main Goal: Find values of \( j \) for which the equation has exactly one real solution.
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the condition for exactly one real solution.
  - Subgoal 3: Express the discriminant as a function of \( j \).
  - Subgoal 4: Solve the discriminant equation for \( j \).
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solutions.
Current Goal: Identify the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the condition for the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution.
How to Achieve: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), exactly one real solution occurs when the discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0 \). Identify the coefficients and set up the discriminant.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0 \):
- Coefficient \( a = 2 \)
- Coefficient \( b = -(3 + j) \)
- Coefficient \( c = 8 \)
The discriminant is:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = [-(3 + j)]^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = (3 + j)^2 - 64
\]
For exactly one real solution, set the discriminant to zero:
\[
(3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Solve the discriminant equation \( (3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0 \) for \( j \).
How to Achieve: Simplify the equation, expand the square, and solve for \( j \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve:
\[
(3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0
\]
\[
(3 + j)^2 = 64
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
3 + j = \pm \sqrt{64} = \pm 8
\]
\[
j + 3 = \pm 8
\]
Case 1:
\[
j + 3 = 8 \implies j = 8 - 3 = 5
\]
Case 2:
\[
j + 3 = -8 \implies j = -8 - 3 = -11
\]
So, \( j = 5 \) or \( j = -11 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Meta-Data: Retrieve information related to the current goal of verifying the solutions \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \), focusing on the quadratic equation and the discriminant condition.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Current Goal: Verify the solutions \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \).
Related Information:
- The quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0 \).
- The discriminant is \( \Delta = (3 + j)^2 - 64 \), and \( \Delta = 0 \) for exactly one solution.
- Solutions \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \) were derived from \( (3 + j)^2 = 64 \).
This confirms the equation and discriminant setup are consistent with the goal of verification.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \) result in exactly one real solution by checking the discriminant or solving the quadratic equation.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \) into the discriminant \( \Delta = (3 + j)^2 - 64 \) and confirm \( \Delta = 0 \). Alternatively, solve the quadratic for each \( j \) to ensure one solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the discriminant for each \( j \):
- For \( j = 5 \):
\[
\Delta = (3 + 5)^2 - 64 = 8^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0
\]
- For \( j = -11 \):
\[
\Delta = (3 + (-11))^2 - 64 = (-8)^2 - 64 = 64 - 64 = 0
\]
Since \( \Delta = 0 \) in both cases, the quadratic has exactly one real solution for \( j = 5 \) and \( j = -11 \).

For additional confirmation, solve the quadratic for \( j = 5 \):
\[
2x^2 - (3 + 5)x + 8 = 2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \implies (x - 2)^2 = 0 \implies x = 2
\]
This has one solution, \( x = 2 \).
For \( j = -11 \):
\[
2x^2 - (3 + (-11))x + 8 = 2x^2 - (-8)x + 8 = 2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 \implies (x + 2)^2 = 0 \implies x = -2
\]
This has one solution, \( x = -2 \).
Both values satisfy the condition.
