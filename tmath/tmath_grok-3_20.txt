**Problem Statement**: The equation \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \) describes the height (in feet) of a projectile launched from the ground at 80 feet per second. We need to find the time \( t \) when the projectile first reaches a height of 36 feet, expressed as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the time \( t \) when the projectile first reaches 36 feet, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set up the equation by substituting \( y = 36 \) into the given equation.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( t \).  
3. Identify the smaller \( t \)-value as the first time the height is reached.  
4. Round the answer to the nearest tenth.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up and solve the quadratic equation obtained by setting \( y = 36 \). This involves substituting \( y = 36 \) into \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \), simplifying it to a standard quadratic form, and solving for \( t \) using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 36 \) into the equation:  
\[ 36 = -16t^2 + 80t \]  
Rearrange into standard quadratic form (\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \)):  
\[ -16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0 \]  
Divide through by \(-2\) to simplify:  
\[ 8t^2 - 40t + 18 = 0 \]  
Further divide by 2:  
\[ 4t^2 - 20t + 9 = 0 \]  

Use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = -20 \), \( c = 9 \):  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-20)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 400 - 144 = 256 \)  
- \( t = \frac{-(-20) \pm \sqrt{256}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{20 \pm 16}{8} \)  
- Solutions:  
  - \( t = \frac{20 + 16}{8} = \frac{36}{8} = 4.5 \)  
  - \( t = \frac{20 - 16}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \)  

The two solutions are \( t = 0.5 \) and \( t = 4.5 \).

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the time \( t \) when the projectile first reaches 36 feet, rounded to the nearest tenth.  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up the equation by substituting \( y = 36 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation for \( t \) (completed, solutions: \( t = 0.5, 4.5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the smaller \( t \)-value as the first time (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Round the answer to the nearest tenth (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the smaller \( t \)-value as the first time the projectile reaches 36 feet.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the smaller \( t \)-value from the solutions \( t = 0.5 \) and \( t = 4.5 \), as this represents the first time the projectile reaches 36 feet, and round it to the nearest tenth.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solutions from the quadratic equation are \( t = 0.5 \) and \( t = 4.5 \). Since the projectile is launched from the ground and follows a parabolic trajectory, it reaches 36 feet first on the way up and again on the way down. Thus, the smaller value, \( t = 0.5 \), is the first time.  
Check rounding: \( t = 0.5 \) is already a decimal to the nearest tenth.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( t = 0.5 \) by substituting it back into the original equation to confirm the height is 36 feet and ensure it is the first occurrence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( t = 0.5 \) into \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \):  
\[ y = -16(0.5)^2 + 80(0.5) = -16(0.25) + 40 = -4 + 40 = 36 \]  
The height is 36 feet, confirming the solution is correct.  
To ensure itâ€™s the first occurrence, note that \( t = 4.5 \) is larger, and the projectile reaches its peak height at the vertex of the parabola:  
Vertex time: \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{80}{2 \cdot (-16)} = 2.5 \). Since \( 0.5 < 2.5 < 4.5 \), \( t = 0.5 \) occurs before the peak, confirming it is the first time.

### Final Answer
The projectile reaches 36 feet for the first time at \( t = 0.5 \) seconds.
