**Problem Statement**: The equation \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \) describes the height (in feet) of a projectile launched from the ground at 80 feet per second. We need to find the time \( t \) when the projectile reaches a height of 36 feet for the first time, with the answer expressed as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for \( t \).  
1. Set up the equation by equating the height to 36 feet: \( -16t^2 + 80t = 36 \).  
2. Simplify the equation to a standard quadratic form.  
3. Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( t \).  
4. Determine which solution corresponds to the first time the projectile reaches 36 feet.  
5. Round the answer to the nearest tenth.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set up and simplify the equation to find \( t \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( y = 36 \) into the equation \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \), move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation, and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( y = 36 \):  
\[ -16t^2 + 80t = 36 \]  
Move all terms to one side:  
\[ -16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0 \]  
Multiply through by \(-1\) to simplify:  
\[ 16t^2 - 80t + 36 = 0 \]  
Divide the entire equation by 4 to reduce coefficients:  
\[ 4t^2 - 20t + 9 = 0 \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( 4t^2 - 20t + 9 = 0 \) to find \( t \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = -20 \), and \( c = 9 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For \( 4t^2 - 20t + 9 = 0 \):  
- \( a = 4 \), \( b = -20 \), \( c = 9 \).  
- Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-20)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 400 - 144 = 256 \).  
- Quadratic formula:  
\[ t = \frac{-(-20) \pm \sqrt{256}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{20 \pm 16}{8} \]  
- Solutions:  
\[ t = \frac{20 + 16}{8} = \frac{36}{8} = 4.5 \]  
\[ t = \frac{20 - 16}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \]  
So, \( t = 0.5 \) seconds and \( t = 4.5 \) seconds.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine which \( t \) value (0.5 or 4.5) represents the first time the projectile reaches 36 feet.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the physical context of the projectileâ€™s motion. Since the equation is a parabola opening downward, the projectile reaches 36 feet on the way up and again on the way down. The smaller \( t \) value corresponds to the first occurrence.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation \( y = -16t^2 + 80t \) represents a parabolic trajectory. The vertex of the parabola occurs at:  
\[ t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{80}{2 \cdot (-16)} = 2.5 \text{ seconds} \]  
Since \( t = 0.5 \) is less than 2.5 (before the peak), it occurs on the ascent. The value \( t = 4.5 \) is after the peak, on the descent. Thus, \( t = 0.5 \) seconds is the first time the projectile reaches 36 feet.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Round the answer \( t = 0.5 \) to the nearest tenth.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the decimal value of \( t = 0.5 \) and round as required.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The value \( t = 0.5 \) is already a decimal. The tenths place is 5, with no further digits, so no rounding is needed. The answer is 0.5.

**Final Answer**: The projectile reaches 36 feet for the first time at \( t = 0.5 \) seconds.
