**Problem Restatement**: We need to express the product of the complex numbers \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and \(i^2 = -1\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Multiply the complex numbers \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) using the distributive property (FOIL method).  
2. Simplify the result by combining like terms and using \(i^2 = -1\).  
3. Ensure the final form is \(a + bi\) with integer coefficients \(a\) and \(b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) using the distributive property. This involves applying the FOIL method to compute the product and simplifying terms involving \(i\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Apply the FOIL method:  
\((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i) = 4 \cdot (-5) + 4 \cdot 5i + (-5i) \cdot (-5) + (-5i) \cdot 5i\)  
Calculate each term:  
- First: \(4 \cdot (-5) = -20\)  
- Outer: \(4 \cdot 5i = 20i\)  
- Inner: \((-5i) \cdot (-5) = 25i\)  
- Last: \((-5i) \cdot 5i = -25i^2\)  

Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(-25i^2 = -25 \cdot (-1) = 25\).  
Combine all terms:  
\(-20 + 20i + 25i - 25i^2 = -20 + 20i + 25i + 25\)  
Group like terms:  
- Real parts: \(-20 + 25 = 5\)  
- Imaginary parts: \(20i + 25i = 45i\)  
Result: \(5 + 45i\)

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(5 + 45i\) is correct by checking the multiplication and ensuring \(a\) and \(b\) are integers in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the product to confirm:  
\((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i) = 4(-5) + 4(5i) + (-5i)(-5) + (-5i)(5i) = -20 + 20i + 25i - 25i^2\)  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), \(-25i^2 = 25\).  
Combine: \(-20 + 25 + 20i + 25i = 5 + 45i\).  
The result matches. Check the form: \(a = 5\), \(b = 45\), both are integers, and the expression is in \(a + bi\) form.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to ensure alignment with the problem.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Express \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) in the form \(a + bi\) with integer \(a\) and \(b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply the complex numbers using the distributive property (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the result using \(i^2 = -1\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the result and ensure integer coefficients (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the solution \(5 + 45i\) satisfies the problem requirements, which has been achieved.

**Final Answer**: The product \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) in the form \(a + bi\) is \(5 + 45i\).
