**Problem Statement**: Express the product \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and \(i^2 = -1\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Multiply the complex numbers \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) using the distributive property (FOIL method).  
2. Simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms and using \(i^2 = -1\).  
3. Express the final result in the form \(a + bi\), ensuring \(a\) and \(b\) are integers.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) using the distributive property. This involves applying the FOIL method to compute the product and simplify terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Apply the FOIL method:  
\((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i) = 4 \cdot (-5) + 4 \cdot 5i + (-5i) \cdot (-5) + (-5i) \cdot 5i\)  
= \(-20 + 20i + 25i - 25i^2\)  
Since \(i^2 = -1\), compute \(-25i^2 = -25 \cdot (-1) = 25\).  
Combine like terms:  
Real part: \(-20 + 25 = 5\)  
Imaginary part: \(20i + 25i = 45i\)  
Thus, the product is \(5 + 45i\).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \(5 + 45i\) is in the form \(a + bi\) with \(a\) and \(b\) as integers and confirm the correctness of the multiplication.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the form: The result \(5 + 45i\) has \(a = 5\) and \(b = 45\), both integers, satisfying the problem's requirement.  
Verify the multiplication:  
Recompute using distributive property:  
\((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i) = 4(-5) + 4(5i) + (-5i)(-5) + (-5i)(5i) = -20 + 20i + 25i - 25(-1) = -20 + 25 + 45i = 5 + 45i\).  
The computation is consistent. Alternatively, compute numerically:  
Magnitude check (optional): \(|4 - 5i| = \sqrt{41}\), \(|-5 + 5i| = \sqrt{50}\), product magnitude \(|5 + 45i| = \sqrt{2050} = \sqrt{41 \cdot 50}\), which aligns.  
The result is correct.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Express \((4 - 5i)(-5 + 5i)\) in the form \(a + bi\).
