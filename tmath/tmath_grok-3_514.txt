### Problem Restatement
We are given two equations involving triangles (Δ) and circles (◯), where all triangles have the same value, and all circles have the same value:
1. Δ + ◯ + Δ + ◯ + Δ = 21
2. ◯ + Δ + ◯ + Δ + ◯ = 19
We need to find the sum of three circles, i.e., ◯ + ◯ + ◯.

Let’s denote the value of each triangle as \( T \) and the value of each circle as \( C \). The equations can be rewritten as:
1. 3T + 2C = 21
2. 2T + 3C = 19
We need to determine the value of 3C.

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for 3C, we need to find the value of C by solving the system of equations. Break this down into:
1. Set up the system of equations based on the given information.
2. Solve for T and C using algebraic methods.
3. Compute 3C as the final answer.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Set up and solve the system of equations to find C.
**How to Achieve**: Rewrite the equations in terms of T and C, then use a method like elimination or substitution to solve for C.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the problem:
- Equation 1: 3T + 2C = 21
- Equation 2: 2T + 3C = 19

To solve, use the elimination method. Multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of C equal:
- 3 × (3T + 2C) = 3 × 21 → 9T + 6C = 63
- 2 × (2T + 3C) = 2 × 19 → 4T + 6C = 38

Now subtract the second from the first:
(9T + 6C) − (4T + 6C) = 63 − 38
5T = 25
T = 5

Substitute T = 5 into Equation 2:
2(5) + 3C = 19
10 + 3C = 19
3C = 9
C = 3

Thus, the value of one circle is C = 3.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution for C by checking both equations.
**How to Achieve**: Substitute T = 5 and C = 3 into both equations to ensure they hold true.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check Equation 1: 3T + 2C = 21
3(5) + 2(3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (True)

Check Equation 2: 2T + 3C = 19
2(5) + 3(3) = 10 + 9 = 19 (True)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming T = 5 and C = 3 are correct.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of three circles.
**How to Achieve**: Use the value of C to calculate 3C.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since C = 3, the sum of three circles is:
3C = 3 × 3 = 9
