**Problem Statement**: We need to determine the sum of three circles, given that all triangles have the same value (denoted as \( \Delta \)) and all circles have the same value (denoted as \( \bigcirc \)). We are provided with two equations:
1. \( \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta = 21 \), which simplifies to \( 3\Delta + 2\bigcirc = 21 \).
2. \( \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc = 19 \), which simplifies to \( 2\Delta + 3\bigcirc = 19 \).
We need to find the value of \( \bigcirc + \bigcirc + \bigcirc = 3\bigcirc \).

**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the sum of three circles (\( 3\bigcirc \)), we need to find the value of \( \bigcirc \). The given equations involve \( \Delta \) and \( \bigcirc \), so we can set up a system of equations and solve for \( \bigcirc \). The subgoals are:  
1. Simplify the given equations.  
2. Solve the system of equations to find \( \bigcirc \).  
3. Compute \( 3\bigcirc \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify the given equations and set up a system to solve for \( \bigcirc \). We will rewrite the equations in terms of \( \Delta \) and \( \bigcirc \), then use algebraic methods (e.g., substitution or elimination) to find \( \bigcirc \).

[IMP]  
The first equation is \( \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta = 21 \), which simplifies to:  
\[ 3\Delta + 2\bigcirc = 21 \]  

The second equation is \( \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc + \Delta + \bigcirc = 19 \), which simplifies to:  
\[ 2\Delta + 3\bigcirc = 19 \]  

We now have the system:  
\[ 3\Delta + 2\bigcirc = 21 \quad (1) \]  
\[ 2\Delta + 3\bigcirc = 19 \quad (2) \]  

To solve, we can use the elimination method. Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2 to make the coefficients of \( \bigcirc \) equal:  
- Equation (1) × 3: \( 9\Delta + 6\bigcirc = 63 \quad (3) \)  
- Equation (2) × 2: \( 4\Delta + 6\bigcirc = 38 \quad (4) \)  

Subtract equation (4) from equation (3):  
\[ (9\Delta + 6\bigcirc) - (4\Delta + 6\bigcirc) = 63 - 38 \]  
\[ 5\Delta = 25 \]  
\[ \Delta = 5 \]  

Substitute \( \Delta = 5 \) into equation (2):  
\[ 2(5) + 3\bigcirc = 19 \]  
\[ 10 + 3\bigcirc = 19 \]  
\[ 3\bigcirc = 9 \]  
\[ \bigcirc = 3 \]  

Thus, the value of one circle is \( \bigcirc = 3 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if \( \Delta = 5 \) and \( \bigcirc = 3 \) satisfy both original equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the first equation: \( 3\Delta + 2\bigcirc = 21 \).  
\[ 3(5) + 2(3) = 15 + 6 = 21 \]  
This is correct.  

Check the second equation: \( 2\Delta + 3\bigcirc = 19 \).  
\[ 2(5) + 3(3) = 10 + 9 = 19 \]  
This is correct.  

The values \( \Delta = 5 \) and \( \bigcirc = 3 \) satisfy both equations, confirming the solution is valid.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of three circles, i.e., \( 3\bigcirc \), using the value of \( \bigcirc = 3 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Since \( \bigcirc = 3 \), the sum of three circles is:  
\[ 3\bigcirc = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]
