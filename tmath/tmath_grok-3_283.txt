**Problem Statement**: Find the minimum possible value for \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the minimum value of \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Recognize the equation as a quadratic function.  
2. Determine the vertex of the parabola, as the minimum value of a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) with \( a > 0 \) occurs at the vertex.  
3. Calculate the vertex’s \( x \)-coordinate using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
4. Substitute the \( x \)-coordinate into the equation to find the corresponding \( y \)-value.  
5. Verify the result to ensure it is the minimum.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation and confirm it opens upward.  
**How to Achieve**: Extract \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \) and check the sign of \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The equation is \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \). Comparing with \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \):  
- \( a = 1 \),  
- \( b = 12 \),  
- \( c = 5 \).  
Since \( a = 1 > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, confirming the vertex represents the minimum point.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex using \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 12 \) into the vertex formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \):  
- \( a = 1 \), \( b = 12 \),  
- \( x = -\frac{12}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{12}{2} = -6 \).  
The \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex is \( x = -6 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find the \( y \)-value at the vertex by substituting \( x = -6 \) into the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \) at \( x = -6 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = -6 \) into \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \):  
- \( y = (-6)^2 + 12(-6) + 5 \),  
- \( y = 36 - 72 + 5 \),  
- \( y = 36 - 72 = -36 \),  
- \( y = -36 + 5 = -31 \).  
The \( y \)-value at the vertex is \( y = -31 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( y = -31 \) at \( x = -6 \) is the minimum value.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the second derivative or evaluate \( y \) at points around \( x = -6 \) to confirm the parabola’s behavior.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic function is \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \). Compute the second derivative:  
- First derivative: \( y' = 2x + 12 \),  
- Second derivative: \( y'' = 2 \).  
Since \( y'' = 2 > 0 \), the function is concave up, confirming a minimum at the vertex.  
Alternatively, test points around \( x = -6 \):  
- At \( x = -5 \): \( y = (-5)^2 + 12(-5) + 5 = 25 - 60 + 5 = -30 \),  
- At \( x = -7 \): \( y = (-7)^2 + 12(-7) + 5 = 49 - 84 + 5 = -30 \).  
Both yield \( y = -30 \), which is greater than \( y = -31 \), confirming the minimum.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the minimum value of \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the quadratic coefficients (completed: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 12 \), \( c = 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the vertex’s \( x \)-coordinate (completed: \( x = -6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the \( y \)-value at the vertex (completed: \( y = -31 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the minimum (completed: confirmed by second derivative and test points).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the minimum value of \( y \).

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: State the minimum value of \( y \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the computed \( y \)-value from the vertex calculation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The minimum value of \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \) is \( y = -31 \), which occurs at \( x = -6 \).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The minimum possible value for \( y \) is \(-31\).
