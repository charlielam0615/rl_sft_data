**Problem Statement**: Find the minimum possible value of \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the minimum value of \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Recognize that the equation is a quadratic function, which forms a parabola.
2. Determine the direction of the parabola (upward or downward) based on the coefficient of \( x^2 \).
3. Find the vertex of the parabola, as the minimum value occurs at the vertex for a parabola opening upward.
4. Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex to obtain the minimum value.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the direction of the parabola.
How to Achieve: Check the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \). If positive, the parabola opens upward, indicating a minimum at the vertex.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation is \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \). The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, which is positive. Therefore, the parabola opens upward, and the minimum value of \( y \) occurs at the vertex.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex.
How to Achieve: For a quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Identify \( a \) and \( b \) from the equation and compute.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 12 \), and \( c = 5 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:
\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{12}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{12}{2} = -6
\]
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex to find the minimum value.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -6 \) into the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \) and compute the value of \( y \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -6 \) into the equation:
\[
y = (-6)^2 + 12(-6) + 5 = 36 - 72 + 5 = 36 - 72 = -36, \quad -36 + 5 = -31
\]
Thus, the y-coordinate of the vertex is \( y = -31 \).
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the minimum value by checking the computation and considering an alternative method.
How to Achieve: Recompute the y-value at \( x = -6 \) and use the completed square form of the quadratic to confirm the vertex.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Recompute**:
\[
y = (-6)^2 + 12(-6) + 5 = 36 - 72 + 5 = -31
\]
The recomputation confirms \( y = -31 \).

**Alternative Method (Complete the Square)**:
Rewrite \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \):
\[
y = x^2 + 12x = (x^2 + 12x + 36) - 36 + 5 = (x + 6)^2 - 31
\]
The vertex form is \( y = (x + 6)^2 - 31 \). Since \( (x + 6)^2 \geq 0 \), the minimum value of \( y \) is \(-31\) when \( x + 6 = 0 \), i.e., \( x = -6 \).

Both methods agree that the minimum value is \( y = -31 \).

Action: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the minimum value of \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Confirm the parabola opens upward (completed in Step 2).
  - Subgoal 2: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex (completed in Step 3).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex (completed in Step 4).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed in Step 5).

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.

The minimum value of \( y \) is \(-31\), achieved at \( x = -6 \).

**Final Answer**: The minimum possible value for \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \) is \(-31\).
