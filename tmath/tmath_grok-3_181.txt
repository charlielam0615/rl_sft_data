**Problem Statement**: Alice buys three burgers and two sodas for $3.20, and Bill buys two burgers and one soda for $2.00. We need to determine the cost of a burger in cents.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the cost of a burger in cents, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the cost of a burger and a soda.  
2. Set up equations based on Alice’s and Bill’s purchases.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the cost of a burger.  
4. Convert the cost to cents.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Define variables and set up equations based on the purchases.  
**How to Achieve**: Let \( b \) represent the cost of a burger in dollars and \( s \) represent the cost of a soda in dollars. Use Alice’s purchase (3 burgers, 2 sodas for $3.20) to form the equation \( 3b + 2s = 3.20 \). Use Bill’s purchase (2 burgers, 1 soda for $2.00) to form the equation \( 2b + s = 2.00 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Let \( b \) be the cost of a burger in dollars, and \( s \) be the cost of a soda in dollars.  
From Alice’s purchase: \( 3b + 2s = 3.20 \)  
From Bill’s purchase: \( 2b + s = 2.00 \)  
These equations represent the total cost of the items purchased by Alice and Bill.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find the cost of a burger.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the elimination or substitution method to solve the system of equations \( 3b + 2s = 3.20 \) and \( 2b + s = 2.00 \) for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To solve the system:  
\[ 3b + 2s = 3.20 \]  
\[ 2b + s = 2.00 \]  

Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):  
\[ 4b + 2s = 4.00 \]  

Now subtract the first equation from this:  
\[ (4b + 2s) - (3b + 2s) = 4.00 - 3.20 \]  
\[ b = 0.80 \]  

The cost of a burger is $0.80.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if \( b = 0.80 \) satisfies both equations.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( b = 0.80 \) into the second equation to find \( s \), then check both equations.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( b = 0.80 \) into \( 2b + s = 2.00 \):  
\[ 2(0.80) + s = 2.00 \]  
\[ 1.60 + s = 2.00 \]  
\[ s = 0.40 \]  

Check Alice’s equation:  
\[ 3b + 2s = 3(0.80) + 2(0.40) = 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20 \] (satisfied)  

Check Bill’s equation:  
\[ 2b + s = 2(0.80) + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \] (satisfied)  

The solution \( b = 0.80 \), \( s = 0.40 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert the cost of a burger to cents.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the cost in dollars ($0.80) by 100 to convert to cents.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The cost of a burger is $0.80.  
Convert to cents: \( 0.80 \times 100 = 80 \) cents.
