**Problem Restatement**:  
Alice buys 3 burgers and 2 sodas for $3.20, and Bill buys 2 burgers and 1 soda for $2.00. We need to determine the cost of a burger in cents.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the cost of a burger, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Define variables for the cost of a burger (b) and a soda (s) in dollars.  
2. Set up equations based on Alice’s and Bill’s purchases.  
3. Solve the system of equations to find the cost of a burger.  
4. Convert the cost from dollars to cents.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations based on the purchases. Use Alice’s purchase (3 burgers, 2 sodas for $3.20) to form the equation 3b + 2s = 3.20, and Bill’s purchase (2 burgers, 1 soda for $2.00) to form 2b + s = 2.00.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Based on the purchases:  
- Alice: 3 burgers + 2 sodas = $3.20 → 3b + 2s = 3.20  
- Bill: 2 burgers + 1 soda = $2.00 → 2b + s = 2.00  
These equations represent the total cost in dollars for each purchase.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations (3b + 2s = 3.20 and 2b + s = 2.00) to find the value of b (cost of a burger in dollars). Use substitution or elimination to solve for b.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Solve the system:  
1. 3b + 2s = 3.20  
2. 2b + s = 2.00  

Use elimination. Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of s:  
2 × (2b + s) = 2 × 2.00 → 4b + 2s = 4.00  

Now subtract the first equation from this:  
(4b + 2s) - (3b + 2s) = 4.00 - 3.20  
b = 0.80  

So, the cost of a burger is $0.80.

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution (b = 0.80) by substituting into both equations to ensure consistency. Then, convert the cost to cents.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute b = 0.80 into the second equation to find s:  
2b + s = 2.00  
2(0.80) + s = 2.00  
1.60 + s = 2.00  
s = 0.40  

Now check both equations:  
- Alice: 3b + 2s = 3(0.80) + 2(0.40) = 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20 (correct)  
- Bill: 2b + s = 2(0.80) + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 (correct)  

The solution is consistent. Convert $0.80 to cents: $0.80 × 100 = 80 cents.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the cost of a burger in cents.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables (b for burger, s for soda).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up equations (3b + 2s = 3.20, 2b + s = 2.00).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for b ($0.80).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify solution and convert to cents (80 cents).  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final answer (80 cents) and ensure all subgoals are complete.  
The solution process is complete, and the cost of a burger is 80 cents.

**Final Answer**: A burger costs 80 cents.
