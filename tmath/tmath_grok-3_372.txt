### Problem Restatement
We need to find \( f(\sqrt{29}) \), where the function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
9x + 4 & \text{if } x \text{ is an integer}, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + 5 & \text{if } x \text{ is not an integer}.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve for \( f(\sqrt{29}) \), break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Determine whether \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer.
2. Apply the appropriate case of the function based on the result.
3. Compute the value of \( f(\sqrt{29}) \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine whether \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer.
How to Achieve: Check if \( \sqrt{29} \) is a perfect square by finding the nearest integers whose squares bound 29 and evaluating if 29 is a perfect square.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To determine if \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer, note that:
- \( 5^2 = 25 < 29 \)
- \( 6^2 = 36 > 29 \)

Since 29 is not a perfect square (no integer \( n \) satisfies \( n^2 = 29 \)), \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer. It is an irrational number, approximately 5.385.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the appropriate case of the function since \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer.
How to Achieve: Use the second case of the function, \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor + 5 \), and compute the floor of \( \sqrt{29} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, use:
\[
f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor + 5
\]
Estimate \( \sqrt{29} \approx 5.385 \). The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \):
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor = \lfloor 5.385 \rfloor = 5
\]
Thus:
\[
f(\sqrt{29}) = \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10
\]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the computation of \( f(\sqrt{29}) \).
How to Achieve: Re-check the steps: confirm \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, recompute the floor, and ensure the correct function case was applied.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-verify:
- \( \sqrt{29} \) is between 5 and 6 (\( 25 < 29 < 36 \)), so it is not an integer.
- The floor of \( \sqrt{29} \approx 5.385 \) is 5.
- Since \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, \( f(\sqrt{29}) = \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).

The computation is consistent and correct.
