**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of the piecewise function \( f(x) \) at \( x = \sqrt{29} \), where the function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
9x + 4 & \text{if } x \text{ is an integer}, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + 5 & \text{if } x \text{ is not an integer}.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( f(\sqrt{29}) \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Determine whether \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer.  
2. Apply the appropriate branch of the piecewise function based on whether \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer.  
3. Compute the value of \( f(\sqrt{29}) \) using the selected branch.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine whether \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer. This can be achieved by checking if \( \sqrt{29} \) is a whole number, i.e., if 29 is a perfect square.

To determine if \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer, we check if 29 is a perfect square. The perfect squares around 29 are \( 5^2 = 25 \) and \( 6^2 = 36 \). Since \( 25 < 29 < 36 \), 29 is not a perfect square. Therefore, \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer (it is an irrational number).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the appropriate branch of the piecewise function. Since \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, use the second branch: \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor + 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, we use \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor + 5 \). We need to compute \( \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor \).  
- We know \( 5^2 = 25 \) and \( 6^2 = 36 \), so \( 5 < \sqrt{29} < 6 \).  
- Thus, \( \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor = 5 \).  
- Applying the function: \( f(\sqrt{29}) = \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of \( f(\sqrt{29}) \). Verify that \( \sqrt{29} \) is correctly identified as non-integer and that the floor function and subsequent calculation are correct.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- Reconfirm that \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer: Since 29 is not a perfect square (\( 5^2 = 25 \), \( 6^2 = 36 \)), \( \sqrt{29} \) is irrational and thus not an integer.  
- Recompute the floor: \( \sqrt{29} \approx 5.385 \), so \( \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor = 5 \).  
- Recalculate: \( f(\sqrt{29}) = 5 + 5 = 10 \).  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the result.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Compute \( f(\sqrt{29}) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine if \( \sqrt{29} \) is an integer (completed: not an integer).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the appropriate branch of the piecewise function (completed: used \( \lfloor \sqrt{29} \rfloor + 5 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the value (completed: \( f(\sqrt{29}) = 10 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed: calculations verified).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and the result is validated.  
**Summary**: The function value \( f(\sqrt{29}) = 10 \) was computed by confirming \( \sqrt{29} \) is not an integer, applying the second branch of the function, and validating the floor calculation.

**Final Answer**: \( f(\sqrt{29}) = 10 \)
