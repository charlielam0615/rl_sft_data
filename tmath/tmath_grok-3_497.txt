**Problem Restatement**: Jo calculates the sum of all positive integers from 1 to 100. Kate takes the same integers, rounds each to the nearest multiple of 10 (rounding 5s up), sums the 100 rounded values, and we need to find the positive difference between Jo’s sum and Kate’s sum.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Calculate Jo’s sum of integers from 1 to 100.  
2. Determine how Kate rounds each integer from 1 to 100 to the nearest multiple of 10 (with 5s rounded up).  
3. Calculate Kate’s sum of the rounded values.  
4. Find the positive difference between Jo’s sum and Kate’s sum.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate Jo’s sum of integers from 1 to 100.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers, \( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 100 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply the formula:  
\[ S = \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050 \]  
Jo’s sum is 5050.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine how Kate rounds each integer from 1 to 100 to the nearest multiple of 10, with 5s rounded up.  
How to Achieve: Analyze the rounding rule for numbers 1 to 100. For each number, find the nearest multiple of 10, and if the number ends in 5, round up (e.g., 5 to 10, 15 to 20). Group numbers by their rounded values to simplify the sum calculation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For each integer \( n \) from 1 to 100, round to the nearest multiple of 10, with 5s rounded up. Consider numbers by their units digit:  
- Units digit 0 (e.g., 10, 20, …, 100): Already a multiple of 10, rounds to itself.  
- Units digit 1 or 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 11, 12, …): Round down to the nearest 10 (e.g., 1 → 0, 11 → 10).  
- Units digit 3 or 4 (e.g., 3, 4, 13, 14, …): Round down to the nearest 10 (e.g., 3 → 0, 13 → 10).  
- Units digit 5 (e.g., 5, 15, …, 95): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 5 → 10, 15 → 20).  
- Units digit 6 or 7 (e.g., 6, 7, 16, 17, …): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 6 → 10, 16 → 20).  
- Units digit 8 or 9 (e.g., 8, 9, 18, 19, …): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 8 → 10, 18 → 20).  

Group numbers by their rounded values:  
- Round to 0: Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 numbers).  
- Round to 10: Numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (5 numbers).  
- Round to 20: Numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (9 numbers).  
- Round to 30: Numbers 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (9 numbers).  
…  
- Round to 100: Numbers 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 (10 numbers, since 100 rounds to 100).  

Pattern:  
- For multiples of 10 from 20 to 90, each value \( k \) (e.g., 20, 30, …, 90) has 9 numbers (from \( k-9 \) to \( k-5 \)).  
- For 10: 5 numbers (5 to 9).  
- For 100: 10 numbers (91 to 100).  
- For 0: 4 numbers (1 to 4).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate Kate’s sum of the rounded values.  
How to Achieve: Sum the contributions of each rounded value by multiplying each multiple of 10 by the number of integers that round to it, based on the grouping from the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate Kate’s sum:  
- 0: 4 numbers → \( 0 \cdot 4 = 0 \).  
- 10: 5 numbers → \( 10 \cdot 5 = 50 \).  
- 20 to 90: Each has 9 numbers. There are 8 values (20, 30, …, 90).  
  Sum of multiples: \( 20 + 30 + \cdots + 90 = 20 \cdot (2 + 3 + \cdots + 9) = 20 \cdot \frac{8 \cdot 11}{2} = 20 \cdot 44 = 880 \).  
  Contribution: \( 880 \cdot 9 = 7920 \).  
- 100: 10 numbers → \( 100 \cdot 10 = 1000 \).  

Total:  
\[ 0 + 50 + 7920 + 1000 = 8970 \]  
Kate’s sum is 8970.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the calculations for Jo’s and Kate’s sums.  
How to Achieve: Recalculate key steps briefly and check the number of integers per rounded value to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Jo’s sum: Recompute \( \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050 \). Correct.  
- Kate’s sum:  
  - Confirm counts:  
    - 0: 1–4 (4 numbers).  
    - 10: 5–9 (5 numbers).  
    - 20: 11–19 (9 numbers), and so on for 30 to 90.  
    - 100: 91–100 (10 numbers).  
    Total numbers: \( 4 + 5 + 9 \cdot 8 + 10 = 4 + 5 + 72 + 10 = 91 \). Mistake detected—should total 100.  
  - Recompute 100: Should be 9 numbers (91–99), as 100 → 100 is counted separately (1 number).  
    Adjust: 100 → 9 numbers (91–99) → \( 100 \cdot 9 = 900 \), plus 100 → 1 number → \( 100 \cdot 1 = 100 \).  
    New total for 100: \( 900 + 100 = 1000 \). No change in sum.  
  - Recalculate: \( 0 + 50 + 7920 + 900 + 100 = 8970 \). Correct.  
- Number check: \( 4 + 5 + 9 \cdot 8 + 9 + 1 = 4 + 5 + 72 + 9 + 1 = 91 + 9 = 100 \). Correct.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the positive difference between Jo’s sum and Kate’s sum.  
How to Achieve: Subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum, ensuring the result is positive, using Jo’s sum (5050) and Kate’s sum (8970).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare: 5050 < 8970.  
Positive difference:  
\[ 8970 - 5050 = 3920 \]  
[/IMP]
