**Problem Restatement**: Jo calculates the sum of all positive integers from 1 to 100. Kate takes the first 100 positive integers, rounds each to the nearest multiple of 10 (rounding 5s up), sums these rounded values, and we need to find the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into subgoals:
1. Calculate Jo's sum of integers from 1 to 100.
2. Determine the rounding rule for Kate's sum and apply it to each integer from 1 to 100.
3. Calculate Kate's sum of the rounded integers.
4. Compute the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate Jo's sum, which is the sum of positive integers from 1 to 100. Achieve this by using the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 100 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply the formula:
\[ \text{Jo's sum} = \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050 \]
So, Jo's sum is 5050.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to determine Kate's rounding rule and apply it to each integer from 1 to 100. For each integer, round to the nearest multiple of 10, rounding 5s up, and list the rounded values to prepare for summation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The rounding rule states that each integer is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, with numbers ending in 5 rounded up. Let’s analyze the numbers 1 to 100 by their units digits:
- Units digit 0 (e.g., 10, 20, …, 100): Already multiples of 10, remain unchanged.
- Units digit 1 or 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 11, 12): Round down to the nearest 10 (e.g., 1 → 0, 2 → 0, 11 → 10, 12 → 10).
- Units digit 3 or 4 (e.g., 3, 4, 13, 14): Round down to the nearest 10 (e.g., 3 → 0, 4 → 0, 13 → 10, 14 → 10).
- Units digit 5 (e.g., 5, 15, …, 95): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 5 → 10, 15 → 20, 95 → 100).
- Units digit 6 or 7 (e.g., 6, 7, 16, 17): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 6 → 10, 7 → 10, 16 → 20, 17 → 20).
- Units digit 8 or 9 (e.g., 8, 9, 18, 19): Round up to the next 10 (e.g., 8 → 10, 9 → 10, 18 → 20, 19 → 20).

Group the numbers by their rounded values:
- For 0: Numbers 1–4 (4 numbers).
- For 10: Numbers 5–9 (5 numbers).
- For each multiple of 10 from 10 to 90 (e.g., 10 for 10–14, 20 for 15–19, …, 90 for 85–89): Each gets 10 numbers (e.g., 10–14 for 10, 15–19 for 20, etc.).
- For 100: Numbers 90–100 (11 numbers).

Verify the count: 4 (for 0) + 5 (for 10) + 10 × 8 (for 20 to 90) + 11 (for 100) = 4 + 5 + 80 + 11 = 100 numbers, which is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate Kate’s sum of the rounded integers. Use the counts from the previous step to compute the sum of the rounded values.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate Kate’s sum based on the rounded values:
- 0: 4 numbers → \( 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- 10: 5 numbers → \( 5 \cdot 10 = 50 \).
- 20 to 90 (8 multiples: 20, 30, …, 90): Each has 10 numbers → \( 10 \cdot (20 + 30 + \cdots + 90) \).
  Sum of 20 to 90: Use the arithmetic series formula \( \frac{n}{2} \cdot (\text{first} + \text{last}) \), where \( n = 8 \), first = 20, last = 90:
  \[ \frac{8}{2} \cdot (20 + 90) = 4 \cdot 110 = 440 \]
  So, \( 10 \cdot 440 = 4400 \).
- 100: 11 numbers → \( 11 \cdot 100 = 1100 \).

Total Kate’s sum:
\[ 0 + 50 + 4400 + 1100 = 5550 \]
So, Kate’s sum is 5550.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to compute the positive difference between Jo’s sum and Kate’s sum. Subtract the smaller sum from the larger and take the absolute value to ensure a positive result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Jo’s sum = 5050, Kate’s sum = 5550.
Compute the difference:
\[ 5550 - 5050 = 500 \]
Since the problem asks for the positive difference, confirm:
\[ |5050 - 5550| = |5550 - 5050| = 500 \]
Thus, the positive difference is 500.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the calculations for Jo’s sum, Kate’s sum, and the difference to ensure correctness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Jo’s sum**: Recalculate using the formula:
  \[ \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050 \]
  Correct.
- **Kate’s sum**: Recompute key parts. For 20 to 90, the series 20, 30, …, 90 has 8 terms:
  \[ \text{Sum} = \frac{8}{2} \cdot (20 + 90) = 440 \]
  \[ 10 \cdot 440 = 4400 \]
  Total: \( 0 + 50 + 4400 + 1100 = 5550 \). Correct.
- **Difference**: \( 5550 - 5050 = 500 \). Correct.
- **Rounding check**: For numbers like 5 → 10, 95 → 100, confirm “5s up” is applied correctly, which it is.

All calculations are consistent.
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

Goal hierarchy based on recent planning:
- Main goal: Find the positive difference between Jo’s sum and Kate’s sum.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate Jo’s sum (completed: 5050).
