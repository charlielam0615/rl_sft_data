**Problem Statement**: A ball is dropped from a height of 10 feet and bounces back to half the distance it fell each time. We need to determine the number of bounces required for the ball’s maximum height to first be less than 1 foot.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the number of bounces needed for the ball’s height to be less than 1 foot.  
- Subgoal 1: Model the ball’s height after each bounce.  
- Subgoal 2: Set up a condition to find when the height is less than 1 foot.  
- Subgoal 3: Solve for the number of bounces.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the ball’s height after each bounce. Since the ball bounces back to half the distance it fell, and the first drop is from 10 feet, we can define the height after each bounce as a geometric sequence where each height is half the previous one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The ball starts at 10 feet and bounces to half the distance it fell. After the first drop (considered bounce 0), it reaches 10 feet. After the first bounce, it reaches \(10 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 5\) feet. After the second bounce, it reaches \(5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2.5\) feet, and so on. The height after \(n\) bounces can be modeled as:  
\[ h_n = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \]  
This represents the maximum height after the \(n\)-th bounce.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the condition for when the height is less than 1 foot and solve for the number of bounces. Using the height model \( h_n = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \), we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( h_n < 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set up the inequality:  
\[ 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n < 1 \]  
Divide both sides by 10:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n < \frac{1}{10} \]  
Since \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 2^{-n}\), rewrite the inequality:  
\[ 2^{-n} < 0.1 \]  
Take the reciprocal (reversing the inequality):  
\[ 2^n > 10 \]  
Take the base-2 logarithm:  
\[ n > \log_2(10) \]  
Since \(\log_2(10) \approx 3.3219\), the smallest integer \( n \) satisfying \( n > 3.3219 \) is \( n = 4 \).  
Let’s verify:  
- After 3 bounces: \( h_3 = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 1.25 \) feet (not less than 1 foot).  
- After 4 bounces: \( h_4 = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = 0.625 \) feet (less than 1 foot).  
Thus, the ball first reaches a height less than 1 foot after 4 bounces.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking the height calculations and ensuring the number of bounces is correct. We will recompute the heights and confirm the smallest \( n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recompute the heights:  
- Bounce 0 (initial drop): \( h_0 = 10 \) feet.  
- Bounce 1: \( h_1 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 5 \) feet.  
- Bounce 2: \( h_2 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \) feet.  
- Bounce 3: \( h_3 = 2.5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1.25 \) feet.  
- Bounce 4: \( h_4 = 1.25 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.625 \) feet.  
The condition \( h_n < 1 \) is first satisfied at \( n = 4 \), as \( 0.625 < 1 \), while \( 1.25 \geq 1 \). The calculation confirms that after 4 bounces, the height is less than 1 foot for the first time.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Determine the number of bounces for the ball’s maximum height to be less than 1 foot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the ball’s height after each bounce (completed: \( h_n = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up a condition for height less than 1 foot (completed: \( 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n < 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Solve for the number of bounces (completed: \( n = 4 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: verified heights and confirmed \( n = 4 \)).  
**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, and no further subgoals are needed.  
The solution is that the ball first reaches a maximum height less than 1 foot after **4 bounces**.
