**Problem Statement**: A ball is dropped from a height of 10 feet and bounces back to half the distance it fell each time. We need to determine after how many bounces the ball's maximum height first becomes less than 1 foot.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Model the ball's bounce height after each bounce.  
2. Derive a formula for the height after n bounces.  
3. Find the smallest n where the height is less than 1 foot.  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the ball's bounce height and derive a formula. Since the ball bounces to half the distance it fell, the height after each bounce is halved. Starting from 10 feet, we’ll express the height after n bounces as a geometric sequence and find n such that the height is less than 1 foot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The initial height is 10 feet. After the first bounce, the ball falls 10 feet and bounces to 10/2 = 5 feet. After the second bounce, it falls 5 feet and bounces to 5/2 = 2.5 feet. This forms a geometric sequence where each bounce height is half the previous one:  
- Height after n bounces: \( h_n = 10 \cdot (1/2)^n \).  
We need \( h_n < 1 \):  
\[ 10 \cdot (1/2)^n < 1 \]  
Divide by 10:  
\[ (1/2)^n < 0.1 \]  
Since \( (1/2)^n = 2^{-n} \), we have:  
\[ 2^{-n} < 0.1 \]  
Take the reciprocal:  
\[ 2^n > 10 \]  
Approximate \( 2^n > 10 \):  
- \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( 2^4 = 16 \).  
Thus, \( n > \log_2(10) \approx 3.3219 \).  
The smallest integer n is 4.  
Check:  
- For n = 3: \( h_3 = 10 \cdot (1/2)^3 = 10 \cdot 1/8 = 1.25 \) feet.  
- For n = 4: \( h_4 = 10 \cdot (1/2)^4 = 10 \cdot 1/16 = 0.625 \) feet.  
The height first falls below 1 foot after 4 bounces.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find after how many bounces the ball’s height is less than 1 foot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Model the bounce height (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive a formula for height after n bounces (completed: \( h_n = 10 \cdot (1/2)^n \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the smallest n where height < 1 foot (completed: n = 4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution (n = 4). Recalculate the heights for bounces 3 and 4 to confirm the ball’s height first drops below 1 foot after 4 bounces, and check the mathematical derivation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
- Bounce 3: \( h_3 = 10 \cdot (1/2)^3 = 10 \cdot 0.125 = 1.25 \) feet (above 1 foot).  
- Bounce 4: \( h_4 = 10 \cdot (1/2)^4 = 10 \cdot 0.0625 = 0.625 \) feet (below 1 foot).  
Verify inequality:  
\[ 10 \cdot (1/2)^n < 1 \implies 2^n > 10 \implies n > \log_2(10) \approx 3.3219 \]  
n = 4 is the smallest integer satisfying this.  
The derivation is consistent, and calculations confirm the height is first less than 1 foot after 4 bounces.

### Final Answer
The ball first reaches a maximum height less than 1 foot after **4 bounces**.
