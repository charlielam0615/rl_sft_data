### Problem Restatement
We need to find how many positive single-digit values of \( A \) (i.e., \( A \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \)) result in the quadratic equation \( x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 \) having positive integer solutions. Here, \( 1A \) represents the two-digit number formed by concatenating 1 and \( A \) (e.g., if \( A = 2 \), then \( 1A = 12 \)), and \( A0 \) represents the two-digit number formed by concatenating \( A \) and 0 (e.g., if \( A = 2 \), then \( A0 = 20 \)). Thus, for a given \( A \), the equation becomes \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \), and we need to determine how many values of \( A \) yield positive integer roots.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into manageable subgoals:  
1. Express the quadratic equation in a clear form based on \( A \).  
2. Use the properties of quadratic equations (sum and product of roots) to relate the roots to \( A \).  
3. Identify constraints for the roots to be positive integers.  
4. Test each possible value of \( A \) (1 to 9) to find valid solutions.  
5. Count the number of valid \( A \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the quadratic equation clearly and derive conditions for the roots to be positive integers. Achieve this by rewriting the equation, using the sum and product of roots, and setting up equations based on the problemâ€™s notation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The equation is \( x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 \). Since \( 1A \) is the number formed by digits 1 and \( A \), it is \( 10 \cdot 1 + A = 10 + A \). Similarly, \( A0 \) is \( A \cdot 10 + 0 = 10A \). Thus, the equation becomes:  
\[ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \]  

For a quadratic equation \( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -b \) and the product is \( c \). Here, the equation is \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \), so:  
- Sum of roots: \( x_1 + x_2 = 10 + A \)  
- Product of roots: \( x_1 x_2 = 10A \)  

Since the roots \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are positive integers, \( 10 + A \) and \( 10A \) must be positive integers, and \( x_1, x_2 \) must satisfy:  
\[ x_1 + x_2 = 10 + A \]  
\[ x_1 x_2 = 10A \]  

Additionally, for the roots to be integers, the discriminant of the quadratic must be a perfect square:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (10 + A)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10A = (10 + A)^2 - 40A \]  
\[ \Delta = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100 = (A - 10)^2 \]  
Since \( (A - 10)^2 \) is always a perfect square for any integer \( A \), the discriminant condition is satisfied for all \( A \), ensuring real roots. However, we need the roots to be positive integers, so we focus on the sum and product conditions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the derived conditions by ensuring that the sum and product of roots lead to positive integer solutions. Check if the equations \( x_1 + x_2 = 10 + A \) and \( x_1 x_2 = 10A \) can produce integer roots consistently with the discriminant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The roots \( x_1, x_2 \) are solutions to the quadratic equation formed by the sum and product:  
\[ t^2 - (x_1 + x_2)t + x_1 x_2 = 0 \]  
\[ t^2 - (10 + A)t + 10A = 0 \]  

The roots are:  
\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{(10 + A)^2 - 40A}}{2} = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{(A - 10)^2}}{2} = \frac{(10 + A) \pm |A - 10|}{2} \]  

Since \( A \) is a single digit (1 to 9), \( A < 10 \), so \( |A - 10| = 10 - A \). Thus:  
\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{(10 + A) \pm (10 - A)}{2} \]  
- Case 1: \( x_1 = \frac{(10 + A) + (10 - A)}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)  
- Case 2: \( x_2 = \frac{(10 + A) - (10 - A)}{2} = \frac{10 + A - 10 + A}{2} = \frac{2A}{2} = A \)  

So, the roots are \( x_1 = 10 \) and \( x_2 = A \). Verify:  
- Sum: \( x_1 + x_2 = 10 + A \), which matches.  
- Product: \( x_1 x_2 = 10 \cdot A = 10A \), which matches.  

Both roots are positive integers since \( A \geq 1 \) and \( 10 > 0 \). However, we must ensure this holds for all \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current one.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find how many positive single-digit \( A \) yield positive integer solutions to \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express the quadratic equation clearly (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive conditions for positive integer roots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the roots for each \( A \) (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Test each \( A \) from 1 to 9.  
  - Subgoal 5: Count valid \( A \).  

**Current Goal**: Validate the roots for each \( A \) and proceed to test all possible \( A \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to test each \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \) to confirm that the roots \( x_1 = 10 \), \( x_2 = A \) are positive integers and satisfy the equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 3, the roots are \( x_1 = 10 \), \( x_2 = A \). Since \( A \) is a positive single digit, \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \), so \( x_2 = A \) is a positive integer, and \( x_1 = 10 \) is a positive integer. Test the equation for each \( A \):  
\[ x = x_1 = 10 \]:  
\[ 10^2 - (10 + A) \cdot x10 + A1 \cdot  = 100 \cdot10A - (10 + A) + 10A = 0 \]  
\[ x100 = x_2 -(10 = +A A) \cdot A + 10A = A^2 - (10A + A) \cdot 0A = +A^210 = 10A = 0^2 \]  

This confirms both roots satisfy the equation for any \( A \). Since \( x_1 = 10 \), \( x_2 = A \) are positive integers for all \( A \in \{1, \in \{2, 1,\ldots,2, 9\} \ldots, \), test a few values to ensure no edge cases:  
- For \( A = 1 \): Equation: \( x^2 - 11x + 10 = 0 \). Roots: \( x = 10 = 1, x \), \( x = 1 \). Check: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \), \( 10 \cdot 1 = 10 \). Valid.  
- For \( A = 2 \):2 Equation: \( x^2 \) - \( 12x + 20 = 0 \). Roots: \( x = 10, x, =x2 = 2 \). Check: Sum: \( 10 + 2 = \cdot 12 \), Product: \( 10 \cdot 2 = \cdot 20 \). Valid.  
- For \( A = 9 \): Equation: \( x^2 - 19x + 9,90x = 0 \). Roots: \( x = x_1 = 10, =x_2 = 10,9 \). Check: Sum: \( 10 + \cdot 9 = 19 \), Product: \( 10 \cdot \cdot 9 = 90 \). Valid.  

Since the roots \( x_1 = 10 \), \( x_2 = A \) work for all \( A \), all 9 values are valid.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to summarize the findings to confirm the number of valid \( A \). Retrieve information related to the roots and the testing process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Summary quadratic**:  
- The equation is \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \).  
- Roots are \( x_1 = 10 \), \( x_2 = A \), satisfying sum \( 10 + A \) and product \( 10A \).  
- Tested for \( A \in \{1, \ldots,2, \ldots,9\} \), all yield positive integer roots (e.g., \( A = 1 \): roots 10, 1 \); \( A = 2 \): roots 10, 2; \( A = 9 \): roots 10, 9).  
- Discriminant \( (A - 10)^2 = \) is a perfect square, ensuring integer roots.  

All \( A \in \{1\} \), \ldots, \{9\} \) are valid.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
There are 9 possible values for \( A \) (1 through 9), and each produces positive integer roots. Thus, the number of such \( A \) is **9**.
