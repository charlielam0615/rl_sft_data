### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of positive single-digit values of \( A \) (i.e., \( A \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \)) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 \) has positive integer solutions. Here, \( 1A \) represents the two-digit number formed by concatenating 1 and \( A \) (e.g., if \( A = 2 \), then \( 1A = 12 \)), and \( A0 \) represents the two-digit number formed by concatenating \( A \) and 0 (e.g., if \( A = 2 \), then \( A0 = 20 \)).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Interpret the equation by expressing \( 1A \) and \( A0 \) in terms of \( A \).  
2. Use the quadratic formula to find conditions for the roots to be positive integers.  
3. Identify constraints on \( A \) (positive single-digit integer).  
4. Test each possible \( A \) to count valid solutions.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Express the quadratic equation in terms of \( A \) and derive the conditions for its roots to be positive integers.  
- **How to Achieve:** Rewrite \( 1A \) as \( 10 + A \) and \( A0 \) as \( 10A \). Substitute into the equation, apply the quadratic formula, and ensure the discriminant is a perfect square and roots are positive integers.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation is \( x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0 \). Since \( 1A \) is the number formed by concatenating 1 and \( A \), it is \( 10 + A \) (e.g., for \( A = 2 \), \( 1A = 12 \)). Similarly, \( A0 \) is \( 10A \) (e.g., for \( A = 2 \), \( A0 = 20 \)). Thus, the equation becomes:

\[ x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \]

For a quadratic equation \( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the roots are given by:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -(10 + A) \), \( c = 10A \). The roots are:

\[ x = \frac{(10 + A) \pm \sqrt{(10 + A)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10A}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10 + A \pm \sqrt{(10 + A)^2 - 40A}}{2} \]

For the roots to be positive integers, the discriminant \( (10 + A)^2 - 40A \) must be a perfect square, say \( k^2 \), and \( \frac{10 + A \pm k}{2} \) must be positive integers. Compute the discriminant:

\[ (10 + A)^2 - 40A = 100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = A^2 - 20A + 100 = (A - 10)^2 \]

Since \( (A - 10)^2 \) is a perfect square for any integer \( A \), let:

\[ k = |A - 10| \]

Since \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \), \( A < 10 \), so \( k = 10 - A \). The roots are:

\[ x = \frac{10 + A \pm (10 - A)}{2} \]

Calculate the two roots:

- \( x_1 = \frac{10 + A + (10 - A)}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
- \( x_2 = \frac{10 + A - (10 - A)}{2} = \frac{10 + A - 10 + A}{2} = \frac{2A}{2} = A \)

Thus, the roots are \( x = 10 \) and \( x = A \), both positive integers since \( A \geq 1 \).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the roots \( x = 10 \) and \( x = A \) satisfy the equation and meet the problemâ€™s conditions for all \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( x = A \) into the equation \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \) and check if both hold. Confirm \( A \) is a single-digit positive integer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = 10 \):

\[ 10^2 - (10 + A) \cdot 10 + 10A = 100 - 100 - 10A + 10A = 100 - 100 = 0 \]

This holds for any \( A \).

Substitute \( x = A \):

\[ A^2 - (10 + A) \cdot A + 10A = A^2 - 10A - A^2 + 10A = -10A + 10A = 0 \]

This also holds for any \( A \). Since \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \), both roots are positive integers, and \( A \) is a single-digit positive integer. Thus, all \( A \) from 1 to 9 are valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Organize and review the hierarchy of goals, highlighting the current one.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Find the number of positive single-digit \( A \) such that \( x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0 \) has positive integer solutions.
  - Subgoal 1: Express the equation in terms of \( A \).
  - Subgoal 2: Derive conditions for positive integer roots.
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions for all \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \).
  - Subgoal 4 (Current): Count the number of valid \( A \).

**Current Goal:** Count the number of valid \( A \). Since all \( A \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 9\} \) satisfy the conditions (9 values), the answer is 9.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
There are **9** such \( A \) values.
