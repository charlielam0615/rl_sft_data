What to recall: The original equation, its structure, and any potential simplification strategies.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The original equation is:

$$
\sqrt{4+\sqrt{8+4c}}+ \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+c}} = 2+2\sqrt{2}
$$

This equation involves nested square roots and a variable $ c $, with the right-hand side being a numerical expression. The left-hand side is more complex and will require algebraic manipulation or substitution to simplify. Observing the structure, both terms on the left-hand side involve square roots of expressions that include square roots themselves. This suggests the possibility of substituting parts of the equation to reduce its complexity. The numerical value on the right-hand side, $ 2+2\sqrt{2} $, is a fixed constant and can serve as a benchmark for verifying potential solutions for $ c $. Any simplification should aim to isolate $ c $ or reduce the nested expressions for further progress.

1. Let $ x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} $ and $ y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} $, so the equation becomes $ x + y = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} $.  
2. Express $ x $ and $ y $ in terms of $ c $, and simplify the expressions if possible.  
3. Use substitution or elimination to find a value for $ c $ that satisfies the equation.  
4. Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equation.

Goal of this step: Express $ y $ in terms of $ x $ or vice versa based on the simplified form of the equation.

[IMP]
From the original equation:  
$$
x + y = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
$$  
we can express $ y $ as:  
$$
y = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - x
$$  
Now we aim to substitute this expression for $ y $ into the definition of $ y $, which is:  
$$
y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}}
$$  
We also know that $ x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} $. Squaring both sides of $ x $:  
$$
x^2 = 2 + \sqrt{2 + c}
$$  
Solving for $ \sqrt{2 + c} $:  
$$
\sqrt{2 + c} = x^2 - 2
$$  
Squaring again to solve for $ c $:  
$$
2 + c = (x^2 - 2)^2
$$  
$$
c = (x^2 - 2)^2 - 2
$$  
We now have $ c $ in terms of $ x $. Next, we aim to find a specific value for $ x $ by analyzing the equation $ x + y = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} $ and substituting $ y $ into the definition for $ y $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the expression for $ c $ in terms of $ x $ into $ y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} $ to find a relationship between $ x $ and $ y $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We already have $ c = (x^2 - 2)^2 - 2 $. Substitute this into $ y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4c}} $:  

$$
y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{8 + 4((x^2 - 2)^2 - 2)}}
$$  

Simplify the inner expression step-by-step:  
$$
8 + 4((x^2 - 2)^2 - 2) = 8 + 4(x^2 - 2)^2 - 8 = 4(x^2 - 2)^2
$$  

So the expression for $ y $ becomes:  
$$
y = \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{4(x^2 - 2)^2}}
$$  

$$
\sqrt{4(x^2 - 2)^2} = 2|x^2 - 2|
$$  

Since $ x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} $, and all square roots are non-negative, $ x^2 \geq 2 $, so $ x^2 - 2 \geq 0 $, and thus $ |x^2 - 2| = x^2 - 2 $. Therefore:  
$$
y = \sqrt{4 + 2(x^2 - 2)} = \sqrt{4 + 2x^2 - 4} = \sqrt{2x^2}
$$  

$$
y = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot x
$$  

Now we have:  
$$
y = \sqrt{2}x
$$  

Recall the original equation:  
$$
x + y = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
$$  

Substitute $ y = \sqrt{2}x $:  
$$
x + \sqrt{2}x = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
$$  

$$
x(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 2 + 2\sqrt{2}
$$  

Divide both sides by $ 1 + \sqrt{2} $:  
$$
x = \frac{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
$$  

Rationalize the denominator:  
$$
x = \frac{(2 + 2\sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}
$$  

$$
x = \frac{(2 + 2\sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}{1 - 2} = \frac{(2 + 2\sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}{-1}
$$  

$$
x = -(2 + 2\sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2}) = -(2(1 - \sqrt{2}) + 2\sqrt{2}(1 - \sqrt{2}))
$$  

$$
x = -(2 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} - 2\cdot2) = -(2 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} - 4)
$$  

$$
x = -(2 - 4) = -(-2) = 2
$$  

So $ x = 2 $. Recall:  
$$
x = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}} \Rightarrow 2 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + c}}
$$  

Square both sides:  
$$
4 = 2 + \sqrt{2 + c} \Rightarrow \sqrt{2 + c} = 2
$$  

Square again:  
$$
2 + c = 4 \Rightarrow c = 2
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution c = 2 by substituting it back into the original equation and verifying all algebraic steps.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Substitute c = 2 into the original equation:
   LHS: √(4 + √(8 + 4*2)) + √(2 + √(2 + 2))  
   Simplify inner terms:
   - 8 + 4*2 = 16 ⇒ √16 = 4 ⇒ 4 + 4 = 8 ⇒ √8 = 2√2  
   - 2 + 2 = 4 ⇒ √4 = 2 ⇒ 2 + 2 = 4 ⇒ √4 = 2  
   LHS = 2√2 + 2  
   RHS = 2 + 2√2  
   Since addition is commutative, 2√2 + 2 = 2 + 2√2 ⇒ LHS = RHS ✅  

2. Verify algebraic derivation of y = √2 x:  
   Starting from c = (x² - 2)² - 2, substitution into y's expression correctly simplifies to y = √2 x through:  
   - 4(x² - 2)² under square root → 2|x² - 2|  
   - Non-negativity of x² - 2 ensures |x² - 2| = x² - 2  
   - Final simplification to √2 x is valid ✅  

3. Solve x(1 + √2) = 2 + 2√2:  
   Rationalization step:  
   (2 + 2√2)/(1 + √2) × (1 - √2)/(1 - √2) = -2(1 - √2) = 2  
   This matches x = 2, which when squared gives √(2 + √(2 + c)) = 2 ⇒ c = 2 ✅  

All critical steps validate without contradiction. The solution satisfies the original equation and maintains algebraic consistency throughout.
