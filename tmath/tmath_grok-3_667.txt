### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it into forward-looking subgoals:  
1. Compute \( 11! \) and \( 12! \).  
2. Calculate the sum \( 11! + 12! \).  
3. Find the prime factorization of the sum.  
4. Identify the largest prime factor from the factorization.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute \( 11! \) and \( 12! \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the definition of factorial to calculate \( 11! = 1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 11 \) and \( 12! = 1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 12 \). Recognize that \( 12! = 12 \times 11! \) to simplify calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate \( 11! \):  
\( 11! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 \times 7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11 = 39,916,800 \).  

Calculate \( 12! \):  
\( 12! = 12 \times 11! = 12 \times 39,916,800 = 479,001,600 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Calculate the sum \( 11! + 12! \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Add the values of \( 11! \) and \( 12! \) obtained in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( 11! = 39,916,800 \), \( 12! = 479,001,600 \).  
\( 11! + 12! = 39,916,800 + 479,001,600 = 518,918,400 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the largest prime divisor of \( 518,918,400 \), proceed with these subgoals:  
1. Simplify the expression \( 11! + 12! \) algebraically to identify common factors.  
2. Use the simplified form to compute the prime factorization.  
3. Extract the largest prime factor.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Simplify \( 11! + 12! \) algebraically.  
- **How to Achieve:** Express \( 12! = 12 \times 11! \), then factor the sum to identify common terms.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\( 12! = 12 \times 11! \).  
\( 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \times 11! = 11! (1 + 12) = 11! \times 13 \).  
Thus, \( 11! + 12! = 13 \times 11! \).  
Since \( 13 \) is prime, it is a factor of the sum. Now, express in terms of prime factors by incorporating \( 11! \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the prime factorization of \( 11! \times 13 \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Calculate the prime factorization of \( 11! = 1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 11 \), include the factor \( 13 \), and combine all prime factors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Prime factorization of \( 11! \):  
\( 11! = 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \).  
Break down each number:  
- \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \),  
- \( 9 = 3^2 \),  
- \( 8 = 2^3 \),  
- \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \),  
- \( 4 = 2^2 \).  

Collect all prime factors:  
- **Prime 2**: From \( 2, 4 = 2^2, 6 = 2 \times 3, 8 = 2^3, 10 = 2 \times 5 \). Exponents: \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 \). So, \( 2^8 \).  
- **Prime 3**: From \( 3, 6 = 2 \times 3, 9 = 3^2 \). Exponents: \( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \). So, \( 3^4 \).  
- **Prime 5**: From \( 5, 10 = 2 \times 5 \). Exponents: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \). So, \( 5^2 \).  
- **Prime 7**: From \( 7 \). Exponent: \( 1 \). So, \( 7^1 \).  
- **Prime 11**: From \( 11 \). Exponent: \( 1 \). So, \( 11^1 \).  

Thus, \( 11! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 11^1 \).  
Include \( 13 \):  
\( 11! \times 13 = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 11^1 \times 13^1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the prime factorization.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compute the numerical value of \( 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 11^1 \times 13^1 \) and compare it to \( 518,918,400 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate:  
- \( 2^8 = 256 \),  
- \( 3^4 = 81 \),  
- \( 5^2 = 25 \),  
- \( 7^1 = 7 \),  
- \( 11^1 = 11 \),  
- \( 13^1 = 13 \).  

Step-by-step:  
- \( 256 \times 81 = 20,736 \),  
- \( 20,736 \times 25 = 518,400 \),  
- \( 518,400 \times 7 = 3,628,800 \),  
- \( 3,628,800 \times 11 = 39,916,800 \),  
- \( 39,916,800 \times 13 = 518,918,400 \).  

The result matches \( 11! + 12! = 518,918,400 \), confirming the factorization is correct.

Prime factors: \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \).
