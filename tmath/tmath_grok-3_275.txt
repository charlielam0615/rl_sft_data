**Problem Restatement**: The equation of a line is given as \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. We need to find the product \( mb \). The line is depicted in an Asymptote diagram, passing through points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\), on a grid where each square is 1 unit by 1 unit.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find \( mb \), we need to determine \( m \) (slope) and \( b \) (y-intercept) of the line. Subgoals:  
1. Calculate the slope \( m \) using the points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\).  
2. Find the y-intercept \( b \) using the equation \( y = mx + b \) and one of the points.  
3. Compute the product \( mb \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the slope \( m \). Use the formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \) with points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Let \((x_1, y_1) = (-3, -5)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (2, 5)\).  
\[ m = \frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)} = \frac{5 + 5}{2 + 3} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]  
The slope \( m = 2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the y-intercept \( b \). Substitute \( m = 2 \) and one point, e.g., \((2, 5)\), into \( y = mx + b \) to solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using point \((2, 5)\):  
\[ 5 = 2 \cdot 2 + b \]  
\[ 5 = 4 + b \]  
\[ b = 5 - 4 = 1 \]  
The y-intercept \( b = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the product \( mb \). Multiply the slope \( m = 2 \) by the y-intercept \( b = 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ mb = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]  
The product \( mb = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution. Check if the line \( y = 2x + 1 \) passes through both points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\), and confirm the product \( mb \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- For \((-3, -5)\):  
  \[ y = 2 \cdot (-3) + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5 \]  
  This matches the y-coordinate.  
- For \((2, 5)\):  
  \[ y = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]  
  This matches the y-coordinate.  
- Confirm \( mb \):  
  \[ m = 2, b = 1 \implies mb = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]  
The calculations are consistent, and the line equation is correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find \( mb \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate slope \( m \) [Completed: \( m = 2 \)].  
  - Subgoal 2: Find y-intercept \( b \) [Completed: \( b = 1 \)].  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( mb \) [Completed: \( mb = 2 \)].  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution [Completed].  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
The solution \( mb = 2 \) has been reached and verified.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( mb = 2 \)
