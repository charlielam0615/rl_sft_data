**Problem Restatement**: The task is to find the product \( mb \) for the line shown in the Asymptote diagram, where the lineâ€™s equation is \( y = mx + b \). The diagram shows a grid with each square being 1 unit by 1 unit, and the line passes through points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\). The axes are drawn with the x-axis from \(-5\) to \(5\) and the y-axis from \(-5\) to \(5\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( mb \), we need to determine the slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \) of the line. We can break this into subgoals:  
1. Identify two points on the line from the Asymptote code.  
2. Calculate the slope \( m \) using the two points.  
3. Find the y-intercept \( b \) using one point and the slope.  
4. Compute the product \( mb \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify two points on the line.  
How to Achieve: The Asymptote code specifies the line as `draw((-3,-5) -- (2,5))`, indicating the line passes through points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the Asymptote code, the line is drawn from \((-3, -5)\) to \((2, 5)\). Thus, the two points on the line are \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Calculate the slope \( m \).  
How to Achieve: Use the slope formula \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \) with the points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\):  
\[ m = \frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)} = \frac{5 + 5}{2 + 3} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]  
The slope \( m = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Find the y-intercept \( b \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute the slope \( m = 2 \) and one point, e.g., \((2, 5)\), into the line equation \( y = mx + b \) and solve for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using point \((2, 5)\) and \( m = 2 \):  
\[ 5 = 2 \cdot 2 + b \]  
\[ 5 = 4 + b \]  
\[ b = 5 - 4 = 1 \]  
The y-intercept \( b = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the product \( mb \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply the slope \( m = 2 \) by the y-intercept \( b = 1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ mb = m \cdot b = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]  
The product \( mb = 2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution.  
How to Achieve: Check if the line equation \( y = 2x + 1 \) passes through both points \((-3, -5)\) and \((2, 5)\), and confirm the product \( mb \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For point \((-3, -5)\):  
\[ y = 2 \cdot (-3) + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5 \]  
Matches \((-3, -5)\).  
For point \((2, 5)\):  
\[ y = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]  
Matches \((2, 5)\).  
The equation is correct. Recompute \( mb \):  
\[ m = 2, b = 1 \implies mb = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]  
The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( mb \) for the line \( y = mx + b \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify two points on the line (completed: \((-3, -5)\), \((2, 5)\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the slope \( m \) (completed: \( m = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the y-intercept \( b \) (completed: \( b = 1 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( mb \) (completed: \( mb = 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the solution (completed).  
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).  
The final answer is \( mb = 2 \).

**Final Answer**: \( mb = 2 \)
