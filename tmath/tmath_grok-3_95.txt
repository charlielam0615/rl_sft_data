### Problem Restatement
We need to find the product \( ab \) for real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the equations:
1. \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \)
2. \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \)

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( ab \).  
1. Simplify the given equations using properties of exponents to express them in terms of the same base.  
2. Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
3. Compute the product \( ab \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Simplify the given equations using exponent rules.  
- **How to Achieve:** Rewrite \( 81 \) and \( 125 \) as powers of \( 3 \) and \( 5 \), respectively, to express both equations with consistent bases, then equate the exponents.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- For the first equation: \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \). Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), we have \( 81^{b+2} = (3^4)^{b+2} = 3^{4(b+2)} \). Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  3^a = 3^{4(b+2)}
  \]
  Equating exponents (since the base is the same):
  \[
  a = 4(b + 2)
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  a = 4b + 8
  \]

- For the second equation: \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \). Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), we have \( 125^b = (5^3)^b = 5^{3b} \). Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  5^{3b} = 5^{a-3}
  \]
  Equating exponents:
  \[
  3b = a - 3
  \]
  Rearrange:
  \[
  a = 3b + 3
  \]

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Find \( ab \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equations (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( ab \).  

**Current Goal:** Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Use the simplified equations \( a = 4b + 8 \) and \( a = 3b + 3 \) to form a system, set them equal, and solve for \( b \), then find \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have the system:
\[
a = 4b + 8
\]
\[
a = 3b + 3
\]
Set the expressions for \( a \) equal:
\[
4b + 8 = 3b + 3
\]
Subtract \( 3b \) from both sides:
\[
b + 8 = 3
\]
Subtract 8:
\[
b = -5
\]
Substitute \( b = -5 \) into \( a = 3b + 3 \):
\[
a = 3(-5) + 3 = -15 + 3 = -12
\]
Thus, \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate the solution by checking if \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) satisfies both original equations.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) into \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \) and \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- First equation: \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \).  
  Left: \( 3^{-12} = \frac{1}{3^{12}} = \frac{1}{531441} \).  
  Right: \( 81^{b+2} = 81^{-5+2} = 81^{-3} = (3^4)^{-3} = 3^{-12} = \frac{1}{3^{12}} = \frac{1}{531441} \).  
  Both sides match.

- Second equation: \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \).  
  Left: \( 125^{-5} = (5^3)^{-5} = 5^{-15} = \frac{1}{5^{15}} \).  
  Right: \( 5^{a-3} = 5^{-12-3} = 5^{-15} = \frac{1}{5^{15}} \).  
  Both sides match.

The solution \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) is valid.

### Step 6

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Compute the product \( ab \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Multiply \( a = -12 \) and \( b = -5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
ab = (-12) \cdot (-5) = 60
\]
