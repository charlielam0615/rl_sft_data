**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the product \( ab \) for real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the equations \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \) and \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( ab \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Simplify the given equations using properties of exponents to express them in terms of the same base.  
2. Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
3. Compute the product \( ab \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify the given equations using properties of exponents.  
How to Achieve: Rewrite \( 81 \) and \( 125 \) as powers of \( 3 \) and \( 5 \), respectively, to express both equations with consistent bases, making it easier to equate exponents.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Rewrite the first equation \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \):  
Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), we have \( 81^{b+2} = (3^4)^{b+2} = 3^{4(b+2)} \).  
Thus, \( 3^a = 3^{4(b+2)} \). Equating exponents (since the bases are the same), we get:  
\[ a = 4(b + 2) = 4b + 8. \]  

Rewrite the second equation \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \):  
Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), we have \( 125^b = (5^3)^b = 5^{3b} \).  
Thus, \( 5^{3b} = 5^{a-3} \). Equating exponents, we get:  
\[ 3b = a - 3. \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current one.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( ab \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equations using properties of exponents (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \) (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the product \( ab \).  

Current Goal: Solve the system of equations \( a = 4b + 8 \) and \( 3b = a - 3 \) to find \( a \) and \( b \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve the system of equations \( a = 4b + 8 \) and \( 3b = a - 3 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute one equation into the other to eliminate one variable, solve for the remaining variable, and then find the other variable.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
From the first equation, we have \( a = 4b + 8 \).  
Substitute \( a = 4b + 8 \) into the second equation \( 3b = a - 3 \):  
\[ 3b = (4b + 8) - 3 = 4b + 5. \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 3b - 4b = 5 \implies -b = 5 \implies b = -5. \]  
Now substitute \( b = -5 \) into \( a = 4b + 8 \):  
\[ a = 4(-5) + 8 = -20 + 8 = -12. \]  
So, \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the values \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) satisfy both original equations.  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) into \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \) and \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \) and check if both hold true.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the first equation \( 3^a = 81^{b+2} \):  
Left side: \( 3^{-12} = \frac{1}{3^{12}} = \frac{1}{531441} \).  
Right side: \( b + 2 = -5 + 2 = -3 \), so \( 81^{-3} = \frac{1}{81^3} \). Since \( 81 = 3^4 \), \( 81^3 = (3^4)^3 = 3^{12} \), thus \( \frac{1}{81^3} = \frac{1}{3^{12}} = \frac{1}{531441} \).  
Both sides match.  

Check the second equation \( 125^b = 5^{a-3} \):  
Left side: \( 125^{-5} = \frac{1}{125^5} \). Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), \( 125^5 = (5^3)^5 = 5^{15} \), so \( \frac{1}{125^5} = \frac{1}{5^{15}} \).  
Right side: \( a - 3 = -12 - 3 = -15 \), so \( 5^{-15} = \frac{1}{5^{15}} \).  
Both sides match.  

The solution \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \) satisfies both equations.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the product \( ab \).  
How to Achieve: Multiply the values of \( a \) and \( b \) obtained from the solution.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have \( a = -12 \), \( b = -5 \).  
Compute:  
\[ ab = (-12) \cdot (-5) = 60. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \( ab \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the given equations using properties of exponents (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the product \( ab \) (completed).  

Current Goal: None, as all goals are completed. The product \( ab = 60 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: \( ab = 60 \).
