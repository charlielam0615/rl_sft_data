**Problem Statement**: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

2. Recall the formula for the discriminant.
3. Apply the formula using the coefficients to compute the discriminant.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\).

**How to Achieve**: Compare the given quadratic equation to the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation is \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\). In standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):
- Coefficient of \(x^2\): \(a = 3\)
- Coefficient of \(x\): \(b = -7\)
- Constant term: \(c = -12\)
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Recall the formula for the discriminant of a quadratic equation.

**How to Achieve**: Use the standard formula for the discriminant of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), which is \(D = b^2 - 4ac\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The discriminant of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by the formula:
\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Compute the discriminant using the coefficients \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\) and the formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the discriminant formula and perform the arithmetic calculations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the discriminant formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\):
- \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)
- Compute \(b^2 = (-7)^2 = 49\)
- Compute \(4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = -144\)
- Compute \(D = b^2 - 4ac = 49 - (-144) = 49 + 144 = 193\)

The discriminant is \(193\).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Verify the correctness of the discriminant calculation.

**How to Achieve**: Recalculate the discriminant using the coefficients and formula to ensure accuracy, checking each arithmetic step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recompute the discriminant:
- Coefficients: \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)
- Discriminant formula: \(D = b^2 - 4ac\)
- \(b^2 = (-7)^2 = 49\)
- \(4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = -144\)
- \(D = 49 - (-144) = 49 + 144 = 193\)

The recalculation confirms the discriminant is \(193\), consistent with the previous result.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the discriminant of \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\)
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the coefficients (\(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)) [Completed]
  - Subgoal 2: Recall the discriminant formula (\(D = b^2 - 4ac\)) [Completed]
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the discriminant (\(D = 193\)) [Completed]
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the computation (\(D = 193\) confirmed) [Completed]

**Current Goal**: The main goal of finding the discriminant has been achieved, with the discriminant calculated as \(193\) and validated.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The discriminant of the quadratic equation \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\) is \(193\).
