**Problem Statement**: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of finding the discriminant into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the quadratic equation's coefficients.  
2. Recall the formula for the discriminant.  
3. Apply the formula using the coefficients.  
4. Compute the result.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the quadratic equation's coefficients. This will be achieved by comparing the given equation \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\) to the standard quadratic form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The quadratic equation is \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\). Comparing to \(ax^2 + bx + c\), the coefficients are:  
- \(a = 3\)  
- \(b = -7\)  
- \(c = -12\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to recall the formula for the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The core content is the standard form of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c\), and the discriminant formula will be retrieved based on this.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The discriminant of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is given by the formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\). This formula is standard for finding the discriminant, which determines the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the discriminant formula using the coefficients identified earlier (\(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)). This will be achieved by substituting these values into the formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\) and computing the result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the discriminant formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\):  
- \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)  
- \(b^2 = (-7)^2 = 49\)  
- \(4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = 4 \cdot (-36) = -144\)  
- \(D = 49 - (-144) = 49 + 144 = 193\)  
The discriminant is 193.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the discriminant calculation by rechecking the coefficients and recomputing the formula to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck coefficients: \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\) gives \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\).  
Recompute:  
- \(b^2 = (-7)^2 = 49\)  
- \(4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-12) = -144\)  
- \(D = 49 - (-144) = 49 + 144 = 193\)  
The calculation is consistent, confirming the discriminant is 193.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the discriminant of \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify coefficients (completed: \(a = 3\), \(b = -7\), \(c = -12\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Recall discriminant formula (completed: \(D = b^2 - 4ac\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply formula (completed: \(D = 193\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate result (completed: confirmed \(D = 193\)).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved.  
The discriminant of the quadratic equation is 193.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The discriminant of \(3x^2 - 7x - 12\) is 193.
