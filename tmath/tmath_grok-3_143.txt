**Problem Statement**: Given \( a > 0 \), \( f(g(a)) = 8 \), where \( f(x) = x^2 + 8 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 - 4 \), find the value of \( a \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( a \).  
1. Substitute \( g(a) \) into \( f(x) \) to express \( f(g(a)) \).  
2. Set up the equation \( f(g(a)) = 8 \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( a \).  
4. Verify that solutions satisfy \( a > 0 \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express \( f(g(a)) \) and set up the equation. This will be achieved by computing \( g(a) \), substituting it into \( f(x) \), and setting the result equal to 8.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Given \( g(x) = x^2 - 4 \), compute \( g(a) \):  
\[ g(a) = a^2 - 4 \]  
Given \( f(x) = x^2 + 8 \), compute \( f(g(a)) \):  
\[ f(g(a)) = f(a^2 - 4) = (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 \]  
Set up the equation:  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \( (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \) for \( a \). This will be achieved by simplifying the equation and solving for \( a \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Simplify the equation:  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \]  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 = 0 \]  
Since the square of a number is zero only if the number itself is zero:  
\[ a^2 - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ a^2 = 4 \]  
\[ a = \pm 2 \]  
Since \( a > 0 \), select:  
\[ a = 2 \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( a = 2 \) satisfies \( f(g(a)) = 8 \). This will be achieved by substituting \( a = 2 \) into \( g(x) \), then into \( f(x) \), and checking if the result equals 8.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(2) \):  
\[ g(2) = 2^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  
Compute \( f(g(2)) \):  
\[ f(0) = 0^2 + 8 = 8 \]  
Since \( f(g(2)) = 8 \), the solution \( a = 2 \) is valid.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( a > 0 \) such that \( f(g(a)) = 8 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Express \( f(g(a)) \) using the given functions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up and solve the equation \( f(g(a)) = 8 \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution satisfies \( a > 0 \) and the equation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.  
The solution \( a = 2 \) satisfies all conditions.

**Final Answer**:  
\[ a = 2 \]
