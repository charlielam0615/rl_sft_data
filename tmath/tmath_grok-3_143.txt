**Problem Restatement**:  
Given \( a > 0 \), \( f(g(a)) = 8 \), where \( f(x) = x^2 + 8 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 - 4 \), find the value of \( a \).

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( a \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express \( f(g(a)) \) using the given functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).  
2. Set up the equation \( f(g(a)) = 8 \).  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( a \).  
4. Ensure the solution satisfies \( a > 0 \).

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Express \( f(g(a)) \) and set up the equation.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( g(a) \) into \( f(x) \) using the definitions \( f(x) = x^2 + 8 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 - 4 \), then set the result equal to 8.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(a) \):  
\[ g(a) = a^2 - 4 \]  

Substitute into \( f(x) \):  
\[ f(g(a)) = f(a^2 - 4) = (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 \]  

Set up the equation:  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \) for \( a \).  
**How to Achieve**: Simplify the equation and solve for \( a \), ensuring \( a > 0 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Simplify:  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8 \]  
\[ (a^2 - 4)^2 = 0 \]  

Since the square of a number is zero only if the number itself is zero:  
\[ a^2 - 4 = 0 \]  
\[ a^2 = 4 \]  
\[ a = \pm 2 \]  

Since \( a > 0 \), select:  
\[ a = 2 \]

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = 2 \) satisfies \( f(g(a)) = 8 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 2 \) into \( g(x) \), then \( f(x) \), and check if the result equals 8.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compute \( g(2) \):  
\[ g(2) = 2^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 \]  

Compute \( f(g(2)) \):  
\[ f(0) = 0^2 + 8 = 8 \]  

The result satisfies \( f(g(2)) = 8 \).
