### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( b \) such that the inverse function of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \) is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( b \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the inverse function of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
2. Set the computed inverse equal to the given inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).  
3. Solve for \( b \) by equating the two expressions and simplifying.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the inverse function of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \). To achieve this, set \( y = f(x) \), swap \( x \) and \( y \), and solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).

[IMP]  
Letâ€™s compute the inverse:  
1. Start with \( y = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
2. Swap \( x \) and \( y \): \( x = \frac{1}{2y + b} \).  
3. Solve for \( y \):  
   - Multiply both sides by \( 2y + b \): \( x(2y + b) = 1 \).  
   - Expand: \( 2xy + bx = 1 \).  
   - Isolate \( y \): \( 2xy = 1 - bx \), so \( y = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \).  
Thus, the inverse is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set the computed inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \) equal to the given inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \) and solve for \( b \). This involves equating the numerators since the denominators are identical.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Equate the two inverse functions:  
\[ \frac{1 - bx}{2x} = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \]  
Since the denominators are the same (\( 2x \)), equate the numerators:  
\[ 1 - bx = 1 - 2x \]  
Solve for \( b \):  
- Subtract 1 from both sides: \( -bx = -2x \).  
- Divide by \( -x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)): \( b = 2 \).  
Thus, \( b = 2 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( b = 2 \) produces the given inverse function. Substitute \( b = 2 \) into the computed inverse and check if it matches \( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( b = 2 \) into the inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \):  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \]  
This matches the given inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \), confirming the solution is correct.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( b \) such that \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \) for \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute the inverse of \( f(x) \). (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Equate the computed inverse to the given inverse and solve for \( b \). (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution. (Completed in Step 4)  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the problem as all subgoals are completed.  
**Conclusion**: The value of \( b \) is 2.
