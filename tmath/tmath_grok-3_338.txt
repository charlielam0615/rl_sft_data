**Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( b \) such that the inverse function of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \) is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( b \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Derive the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
2. Set the derived inverse equal to the given inverse \( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).  
3. Solve for \( b \) by equating the two expressions and simplifying.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Derive the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
**How to Achieve**: To find the inverse, swap \( x \) and \( y \) in \( y = \frac{1}{2x + b} \), then solve for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with \( y = \frac{1}{2x + b} \).  
Swap \( x \) and \( y \):  
\[ x = \frac{1}{2y + b} \]  
Solve for \( y \):  
Multiply both sides by \( 2y + b \):  
\[ x (2y + b) = 1 \]  
\[ 2xy + bx = 1 \]  
Isolate terms involving \( y \):  
\[ 2xy = 1 - bx \]  
\[ y = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \]  
Thus, the inverse function is:  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set the derived inverse \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - bx}{2x} \) equal to the given inverse \( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \) and solve for \( b \).  
**How to Achieve**: Equate the two expressions and solve the resulting equation for \( b \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the derived inverse equal to the given inverse:  
\[ \frac{1 - bx}{2x} = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \]  
Since the denominators are identical, equate the numerators:  
\[ 1 - bx = 1 - 2x \]  
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
\[ -bx = -2x \]  
Divide both sides by \(-x\) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):  
\[ b = 2 \]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( b = 2 \) makes \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( b = 2 \) into the derived inverse and check if it matches the given inverse. Additionally, verify by composing \( f \) and \( f^{-1} \) to ensure \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( b = 2 \) into the derived inverse:  
\[ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \]  
This matches the given inverse \( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \), confirming correctness.  

For further validation, check the composition \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \):  
Given \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \), compute \( f(f^{-1}(x)) \):  
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2x + 2} \] (since \( b = 2 \))  
\[ f\left( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \right) = \frac{1}{2 \left( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \right) + 2} \]  
Simplify the denominator:  
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} + 2 = \frac{1 - 2x}{x} + \frac{2x}{x} = \frac{1 - 2x + 2x}{x} = \frac{1}{x} \]  
So:  
\[ f\left( \frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = x \]  
The composition holds, confirming \( b = 2 \) is correct.
