### Problem Statement
We need to find the radius \( r \) of a circle inscribed within three mutually externally tangent circles with radii \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \). The formula provided is:

\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}}.
\]

We will compute \( r \) by substituting \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \) into the formula and simplifying step-by-step, following the meta-cognitive action framework.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( r \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Substitute \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \) into the formula.  
2. Compute the first part: \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \).  
3. Compute the terms inside the square root: \( \frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc} \).  
4. Evaluate the square root and multiply by 2.  
5. Sum the results to find \( \frac{1}{r} \).  
6. Invert to obtain \( r \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \). Achieve this by substituting \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = 36 \), calculating each term, and summing them.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute the values:  
\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{9}, \quad \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{36}.
\]
Find a common denominator (LCM of 4, 9, 36 is 36):  
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{4}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{36}.
\]
Sum:  
\[
\frac{9}{36} + \frac{4}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{9 + 4 + 1}{36} = \frac{14}{36} = \frac{7}{18}.
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute \( \frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc} \). Achieve this by calculating each term with \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = 36 \), and summing them.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compute each term:  
\[
\frac{1}{ab} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 9} = \frac{1}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{ac} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 36} = \frac{1}{144}, \quad \frac{1}{bc} = \frac{1}{9 \cdot 36} = \frac{1}{324}.
\]
Find a common denominator (LCM of 36, 144, 324 is 1296):  
\[
\frac{1}{36} = \frac{36}{1296}, \quad \frac{1}{144} = \frac{9}{1296}, \quad \frac{1}{324} = \frac{4}{1296}.
\]
Sum:  
\[
\frac{36}{1296} + \frac{9}{1296} + \frac{4}{1296} = \frac{36 + 9 + 4}{1296} = \frac{49}{1296}.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to evaluate \( 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}} \). Use the result from Step 3, take the square root, and multiply by 2.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 3, we have:  
\[
\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc} = \frac{49}{1296}.
\]
Compute the square root:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{49}{1296}} = \frac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1296}} = \frac{7}{36}.
\]
Multiply by 2:  
\[
2 \cdot \frac{7}{36} = \frac{14}{36} = \frac{7}{18}.
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to compute \( \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}} \). Sum the results from Steps 2 and 4.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2: \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{7}{18} \).  
From Step 4: \( 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}} = \frac{7}{18} \).  
Sum:  
\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{7}{18} + \frac{7}{18} = \frac{7 + 7}{18} = \frac{14}{18} = \frac{7}{9}.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to find \( r \) by inverting \( \frac{1}{r} \). Use the result from Step 5.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 5: \( \frac{1}{r} = \frac{7}{9} \).  
Invert to find \( r \):  
\[
r = \frac{9}{7}.
\]
Convert to decimal for comparison with the Asymptote code (optional):  
\[
\frac{9}{7} \approx 1.2857.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the computed \( r = \frac{9}{7} \approx 1.2857 \) by comparing it with the Asymptote code’s \( r = 1.86308 \) and rechecking calculations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The Asymptote code provides \( r = 1.86308 \), while our calculation gives \( r = \frac{9}{7} \approx 1.2857 \). The discrepancy suggests a potential issue. Let’s verify the formula and calculations.  
The formula used is standard for the radius of the incircle of three mutually externally tangent circles (Soddy-Gossett theorem). Recheck Step 5:  
\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{7}{18} + \frac{7}{18} = \frac{14}{18} = \frac{7}{9}, \quad r = \frac{9}{7}.
\]
Calculations are consistent. The Asymptote code’s radii (\( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = 12 \)) differ from the problem’s (\( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), \( c = 36 \)), indicating the code may represent a different configuration. Thus, \( r = \frac{9}{7} \) is correct for the given problem.

### Step 8

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current state.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the radius \( r \) of the incircle.
