**Problem Statement**: We need to find the radius \( r \) of a circle inscribed within three mutually externally tangent circles with radii \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \). The formula provided is:

\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}}
\]

We will solve this by applying the meta-cognitive action set, selecting one action per step, and structuring the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute \( r \):  
1. Compute the reciprocal terms \( \frac{1}{a} \), \( \frac{1}{b} \), and \( \frac{1}{c} \).  
2. Calculate the terms inside the square root: \( \frac{1}{ab} \), \( \frac{1}{ac} \), and \( \frac{1}{bc} \).  
3. Sum the terms under the square root and take its square root, then multiply by 2.  
4. Sum all components to find \( \frac{1}{r} \).  
5. Invert to find \( r \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the reciprocal terms \( \frac{1}{a} \), \( \frac{1}{b} \), and \( \frac{1}{c} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \) into the reciprocal expressions and calculate their values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute the given values:  
- \( \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \)  
- \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.111111 \)  
- \( \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{36} \approx 0.027778 \)  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the terms inside the square root: \( \frac{1}{ab} \), \( \frac{1}{ac} \), and \( \frac{1}{bc} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the given radii \( a = 4 \), \( b = 9 \), and \( c = 36 \) to compute each term by multiplying the respective reciprocals or dividing appropriately.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute each term:  
- \( ab = 4 \cdot 9 = 36 \), so \( \frac{1}{ab} = \frac{1}{36} \approx 0.027778 \)  
- \( ac = 4 \cdot 36 = 144 \), so \( \frac{1}{ac} = \frac{1}{144} \approx 0.006944 \)  
- \( bc = 9 \cdot 36 = 324 \), so \( \frac{1}{bc} = \frac{1}{324} \approx 0.003086 \)  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Sum the terms under the square root, take the square root, and multiply by 2.  
**How to Achieve**: Add \( \frac{1}{ab} \), \( \frac{1}{ac} \), and \( \frac{1}{bc} \), compute the square root of the sum, and multiply by 2.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the terms:  
\[ \frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc} \approx 0.027778 + 0.006944 + 0.003086 = 0.037808 \]  
Take the square root:  
\[ \sqrt{0.037808} \approx 0.194441 \]  
Multiply by 2:  
\[ 2 \cdot 0.194441 \approx 0.388882 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( \frac{1}{r} \) by summing all components.  
**How to Achieve**: Add the reciprocal terms \( \frac{1}{a} \), \( \frac{1}{b} \), \( \frac{1}{c} \), and the result from the square root term.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the components:  
\[ \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}} \]  
\[ \approx 0.25 + 0.111111 + 0.027778 + 0.388882 \approx 0.777771 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( r \) by inverting \( \frac{1}{r} \).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the reciprocal of the computed \( \frac{1}{r} \approx 0.777771 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
\[ r = \frac{1}{0.777771} \approx 1.28575 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the computed value of \( r \approx 1.28575 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the result with the Asymptote code’s value (\( r = 1.86308 \)) and recheck calculations for accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The computed \( r \approx 1.28575 \) differs from the Asymptote code’s \( r = 1.86308 \). Let’s recompute key steps to identify potential errors:  
- Reciprocals: \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \), \( \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.111111 \), \( \frac{1}{36} \approx 0.027778 \). Sum: \( 0.25 + 0.111111 + 0.027778 = 0.388889 \).  
- Square root terms: \( \frac{1}{36} \approx 0.027778 \), \( \frac{1}{144} \approx 0.006944 \), \( \frac{1}{324} \approx 0.003086 \). Sum: \( 0.037808 \).  
- Square root: \( \sqrt{0.037808} \approx 0.194441 \), so \( 2 \cdot 0.194441 \approx 0.388882 \).  
- Total: \( 0.388889 + 0.388882 \approx 0.777771 \).  
- Invert: \( r = \frac{1}{0.777771} \approx 1.28575 \).  

Calculations are consistent, suggesting the Asymptote code’s \( r = 1.86308 \) may reflect a different configuration or error. The formula matches the problem’s context, so \( r \approx 1.28575 \) is likely correct.

### Step 8: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Compute the radius \( r \) of the inscribed circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute reciprocal terms \( \frac{1}{a} \), \( \frac{1}{b} \), \( \frac{1}{c} \) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate terms \( \frac{1}{ab} \), \( \frac{1}{ac} \), \( \frac{1}{bc} \) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Sum terms under the square root, compute the square root, and multiply by 2 (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum all components to find \( \frac{1}{r} \) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Invert to find \( r \) (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the result (Completed).  

**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer

The radius of the inscribed circle is approximately \( r \approx 1.28575 \).

**Note**: The Asymptote code suggests \( r = 1.86308 \), but the calculations using the provided formula consistently yield \( r \approx 1.28575 \). This discrepancy may indicate a different geometric configuration in the Asymptote code or an error in its value. Given the formula’s direct application, \( r \approx 1.28575 \) is the computed solution.
