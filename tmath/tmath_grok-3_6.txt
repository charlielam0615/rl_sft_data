**Problem Restatement**: I need to find the value of \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \) for the function \( f(x) \), which is defined as \( x/2 \) if \( x \) is even, and \( 3x+1 \) if \( x \) is odd. This requires applying the function \( f \) four times starting from \( x = 1 \).

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps by calculating the result of applying the function \( f \) step by step, starting from the innermost application, \( f(1) \), and moving outward to \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \). My subgoals will be to compute each nested function application sequentially.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(1) \).  
How to Achieve: Check if 1 is even or odd, then apply the corresponding rule from the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since 1 is odd, I apply the rule \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).  
So, \( f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4 \).

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(4) \).  
How to Achieve: Check if 4 is even or odd, then apply the corresponding rule from the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since 4 is even, I apply the rule \( f(x) = x/2 \).  
So, \( f(4) = 4/2 = 2 \).

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(2) \).  
How to Achieve: Check if 2 is even or odd, then apply the corresponding rule from the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since 2 is even, I apply the rule \( f(x) = x/2 \).  
So, \( f(2) = 2/2 = 1 \).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(1) \).  
How to Achieve: Check if 1 is even or odd, then apply the corresponding rule from the function definition.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since 1 is odd, I apply the rule \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).  
So, \( f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4 \).

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) = 4 \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(4) = 2 \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(2) = 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(1) = 4 \).  
Current Goal: Finalize the result of \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \), which is 4.
