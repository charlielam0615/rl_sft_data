### Problem Statement
We need to compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \), where the function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases} 
x/2 & \text{if } x \text{ is even}, \\
3x + 1 & \text{if } x \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]
Starting with \( x = 1 \), we apply the function \( f \) four times iteratively and determine the final result.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals by applying the function \( f \) step-by-step, starting from \( x = 1 \), and computing each application until \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(1) \), the first application of the function. Since 1 is odd, apply the rule \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 1 \), which is odd:
\[
f(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(1)) = f(4) \). Since 4 is even, apply the rule \( f(x) = x/2 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 4 \), which is even:
\[
f(4) = 4 / 2 = 2
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(f(4)) = f(2) \). Since 2 is even, apply the rule \( f(x) = x/2 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 2 \), which is even:
\[
f(2) = 2 / 2 = 1
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(1) \). Since 1 is odd, apply the rule \( f(x) = 3x + 1 \).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( x = 1 \), which is odd:
\[
f(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \).
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( f(1) \). (Completed: \( f(1) = 4 \))
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f(4) \). (Completed: \( f(4) = 2 \))
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \( f(f(f(1))) = f(2) \). (Completed: \( f(2) = 1 \))
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(1) \). (Completed: \( f(1) = 4 \))

**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(f(f(f(1)))) \), which has been calculated as 4.

The sequence of computations is:
- Start with \( x = 1 \).
- \( f(1) = 4 \).
- \( f(4) = 2 \).
- \( f(2) = 1 \).
- \( f(1) = 4 \).

Thus, \( f(f(f(f(1)))) = 4 \).

### Final Answer
\[
f(f(f(f(1)))) = 4
\]
