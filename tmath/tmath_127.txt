Goal of this step: Determine the form of the monic polynomial $ f(x) $ of degree 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A monic polynomial of degree 2 has the form $ f(x) = x^2 + bx + c $, where $ a = 1 $ because it is monic.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the given condition $ f(0) = 4 $ to form an equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = 0 $ into the polynomial $ f(x) = x^2 + bx + c $:  
$$ f(0) = 0^2 + b(0) + c = c $$  
Given $ f(0) = 4 $, we conclude:  
$$ c = 4 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the given condition $ f(1) = 10 $ to form an equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $ x = 1 $ into the polynomial $ f(x) = x^2 + bx + c $:  
$$ f(1) = 1^2 + b(1) + c = 1 + b + c $$  
Given $ f(1) = 10 $, we substitute $ c = 4 $ into the equation:  
$$ 1 + b + 4 = 10 $$  
$$ b + 5 = 10 $$  
$$ b = 5 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Write the final expression for $ f(x) $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous steps, we have $ a = 1 $, $ b = 5 $, and $ c = 4 $.  
Thus, the polynomial is:  
$$ f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 $$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that the derived polynomial $ f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 $ satisfies all given constraints and that the solution process is logically sound.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Verification of f(0) = 4**:  
   Substitute $ x = 0 $ into $ f(x) $:  
   $ f(0) = (0)^2 + 5(0) + 4 = 0 + 0 + 4 = 4 $.  
   This matches the given condition.  

2. **Verification of f(1) = 10**:  
   Substitute $ x = 1 $ into $ f(x) $:  
   $ f(1) = (1)^2 + 5(1) + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 $.  
   This matches the given condition.  

3. **Verification of monic degree-2 form**:  
   The polynomial $ x^2 + 5x + 4 $ has leading coefficient $ a = 1 $ (monic) and degree 2.  

4. **Logical consistency of coefficient derivation**:  
   - From $ f(0) = 4 $, we directly obtained $ c = 4 $.  
   - Substituting $ c = 4 $ into $ f(1) = 10 $ yielded $ 1 + b + 4 = 10 \Rightarrow b = 5 $.  
   These steps are algebraically valid and produce a unique solution.  

All conditions are satisfied, and the solution process is free of errors.
