**Problem Statement**: A rectangular cow pasture is enclosed on three sides by a fence, with the fourth side being a 400-foot-long barn wall. The fence costs $5 per foot, and the total cost is $1,200. We need to find the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area of the pasture, rounded to the nearest foot.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically:  
1. Define variables for the pasture’s dimensions.  
2. Set up an equation for the fence cost to express one variable in terms of another.  
3. Formulate the area function to maximize.  
4. Use calculus to find the critical points of the area function.  
5. Determine the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area.  
6. Round the result to the nearest foot.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to define variables and set up the cost equation. Define the length of the side parallel to the barn as \( w \) (width) and the length of the two perpendicular sides as \( l \) (length). Use the cost constraint ($1,200 for three sides at $5 per foot) to relate \( w \) and \( l \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let \( w \) be the length of the side parallel to the barn, and \( l \) be the length of each of the two sides perpendicular to the barn. The pasture is enclosed by two sides of length \( l \) and one side of length \( w \). The total fencing length is \( 2l + w \).  
Given the fence costs $5 per foot and the total cost is $1,200:  
\[ 5(2l + w) = 1,200 \]  
Divide through by 5:  
\[ 2l + w = 240 \]  
Solve for \( w \):  
\[ w = 240 - 2l \]  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to formulate the area function. Use the variables \( w \) and \( l \), and express the area in terms of \( l \) using the cost constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area \( A \) of the rectangular pasture is:  
\[ A = w \cdot l \]  
Substitute \( w = 240 - 2l \) from the cost constraint:  
\[ A = l \cdot (240 - 2l) = 240l - 2l^2 \]  
This gives the area as a function of \( l \):  
\[ A(l) = 240l - 2l^2 \]  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to maximize the area function \( A(l) = 240l - 2l^2 \). Use calculus to find the critical points by taking the derivative, setting it to zero, and solving for \( l \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A(l) = 240l - 2l^2 \) with respect to \( l \):  
\[ A'(l) = 240 - 4l \]  
Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:  
\[ 240 - 4l = 0 \]  
\[ 4l = 240 \]  
\[ l = 60 \]  
To confirm this is a maximum, check the second derivative:  
\[ A''(l) = -4 \]  
Since \( A''(l) < 0 \), the critical point at \( l = 60 \) is a maximum.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to find the length of the side parallel to the barn (\( w \)) using the critical value of \( l = 60 \). Substitute \( l = 60 \) into the cost constraint equation to compute \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the cost constraint equation \( w = 240 - 2l \):  
\[ w = 240 - 2 \cdot 60 = 240 - 120 = 120 \]  
So, the length of the side parallel to the barn is \( w = 120 \) feet.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to validate the solution. Check if the dimensions satisfy the cost constraint and confirm the area is maximized by evaluating the area at the critical point and boundaries.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check cost constraint**:  
Fencing length: \( 2l + w = 2 \cdot 60 + 120 = 120 + 120 = 240 \) feet.  
Cost: \( 5 \cdot 240 = 1,200 \), which matches the given cost.  
**Check area maximization**:  
Area at \( l = 60 \):  
\[ A = 240l - 2l^2 = 240 \cdot 60 - 2 \cdot 60^2 = 14,400 - 7,200 = 7,200 \text{ square feet} \]  
Test boundary points (e.g., \( l = 10 \), \( l = 110 \)):  
- If \( l = 10 \), then \( w = 240 - 2 \cdot 10 = 220 \), so \( A = 10 \cdot 220 = 2,200 \).  
- If \( l = 110 \), then \( w = 240 - 2 \cdot 110 = 20 \), so \( A = 110 \cdot 20 = 2,200 \).  
The area at \( l = 60 \) (7,200 square feet) is greater than at the boundaries, confirming the maximum.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the pasture’s area, rounded to the nearest foot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables (\( w \) for width, \( l \) for length).  
  - Subgoal 2: Set up cost equation (\( 2l + w = 240 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Formulate area function (\( A(l) = 240l - 2l^2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Maximize area using calculus (\( l = 60 \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( w \) (\( w = 120 \)).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate solution (cost and area checks).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the solution by confirming the length of the side parallel to the barn.  
The length \( w = 120 \) feet satisfies all constraints and maximizes the area.

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Current goal is to provide the final answer, ensuring it is rounded to the nearest foot as requested. Since \( w = 120 \) is already an integer, no rounding is needed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area of the pasture is 120 feet.

**Final Answer**: The length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area of the pasture is **120 feet**.
