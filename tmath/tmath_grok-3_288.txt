### Problem Statement
We need to find the length of the side of a rectangular cow pasture that is parallel to a barn, where the barn forms one side of the rectangle (400 feet long), and the other three sides are enclosed by a fence costing $5 per foot with a total fence cost of $1,200. The goal is to maximize the area of the pasture and report the length of the side parallel to the barn to the nearest foot.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to maximize the pasture's area and find the length of the side parallel to the barn.

1. Define variables for the pasture's dimensions.
2. Use the fence cost to determine the total fencing length.
3. Express the area as a function of the dimensions.
4. Maximize the area using calculus or geometric optimization.
5. Solve for the length of the side parallel to the barn and round to the nearest foot.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define variables and set up equations based on the fence cost and pasture dimensions. Define the length of the side parallel to the barn as \( w \) (width) and the two perpendicular sides as \( l \) (length). Use the total fence cost ($1,200 at $5 per foot) to find the total fencing length and relate it to \( w \) and \( l \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Let:
- \( w \) = width of the pasture (side parallel to the barn, in feet).
- \( l \) = length of each side perpendicular to the barn (in feet).

The barn forms one side (400 feet), so the fenced sides are:
- One side of length \( w \).
- Two sides of length \( l \).

Total fencing length = \( w + 2l \).

Fence cost = $5 per foot, total cost = $1,200:  
\[
5(w + 2l) = 1,200
\]
\[
w + 2l = \frac{1,200}{5} = 240 \text{ feet}
\]
\[
w + 2l = 240
\]

The area of the rectangular pasture is:  
\[
A = w \cdot l
\]

Express \( w \) in terms of \( l \):  
\[
w = 240 - 2l
\]

Substitute into the area function:  
\[
A = (240 - 2l) \cdot l = 240l - 2l^2
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to maximize the area \( A = 240l - 2l^2 \). Since this is a quadratic function in \( l \), find the vertex to determine the value of \( l \) that maximizes the area, then compute the corresponding \( w \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The area function is:  
\[
A(l) = 240l - 2l^2
\]
This is a quadratic function (\( -2l^2 + 240l \)), where the coefficient of \( l^2 \) is negative, so the parabola opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex.

For a quadratic function \( al^2 + bl + c \), the vertex is at:  
\[
l = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = -2 \), \( b = 240 \), \( c = 0 \):  
\[
l = -\frac{240}{2(-2)} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Find \( w \):  
\[
w = 240 - 2l = 240 - 2 \cdot 60 = 240 - 120 = 120
\]

The width (side parallel to the barn) is \( w = 120 \) feet.

Verify the area:  
\[
A = w \cdot l = 120 \cdot 60 = 7,200 \text{ square feet}
\]

To confirm the maximum, check the second derivative:  
\[
A(l) = 240l - 2l^2
\]
\[
A'(l) = 240 - 4l
\]
\[
A''(l) = -4
\]
Since \( A''(l) < 0 \), the function has a maximum at \( l = 60 \).

Alternatively, test boundary points:  
- If \( l = 0 \), \( w = 240 \), \( A = 240 \cdot 0 = 0 \).  
- If \( w = 0 \), \( 2l = 240 \), \( l = 120 \), \( A = 0 \cdot 120 = 0 \).  
The vertex at \( l = 60 \) yields the largest area.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: Validate the solution by checking if the fencing length satisfies the cost constraint and ensures the dimensions are feasible (positive and consistent with the barn's length).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the fencing length:  
\[
w + 2l = 120 + 2 \cdot 60 = 120 + 120 = 240 \text{ feet}
\]
Cost:  
\[
240 \cdot 5 = 1,200
\]
The cost matches the given $1,200.

Check dimensions:  
- Width \( w = 120 \) feet (parallel to the barn).  
- Length of perpendicular sides \( l = 60 \) feet.  
- Barn length = 400 feet, and \( w = 120 \leq 400 \), which is feasible (the pasture can be part of the barn's side).

The solution is consistent with the problem constraints.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal to provide context for the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the pasture's area, rounded to the nearest foot.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define variables and set up equations for fencing and area.  
  - Subgoal 2: Express the area as a function of one variable and maximize it.  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution against the cost and geometric constraints.  
  - Subgoal 4 (Current): Confirm the final answer and ensure it meets the problem's requirements.

**Current Goal**: Confirm the length of the side parallel to the barn (\( w = 120 \) feet) and ensure it is rounded to the nearest foot.

The calculated width \( w = 120 \) feet is already an integer, so no rounding is needed. The area is maximized at 7,200 square feet, and all constraints are satisfied.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area of the pasture is 120 feet.
