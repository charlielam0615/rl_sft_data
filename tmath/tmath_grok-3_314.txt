**Problem Statement:** Find all points where the parabolas defined by the equations \( y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \) and \( y = x^2 + 11 \) intersect, and list the points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the intersection points.  
- Subgoal 1: Set the equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points.  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation to obtain the \( x \)-values.  
- Subgoal 3: Compute the corresponding \( y \)-values for each \( x \)-value.  
- Subgoal 4: Order the intersection points by increasing \( x \)-coordinate and format the output.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Set the equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points.  
- **How to Achieve:** Equate \( 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11 \), simplify to form a quadratic equation, and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11 \]  
Subtract \( x^2 + 11 \) from both sides:  
\[ 3x^2 + 4x - 5 - x^2 - 11 = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0 \]  
Divide through by 2:  
\[ x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = -8 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-8)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 32}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 6}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \]  
The \( x \)-coordinates are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the \( x \)-coordinates by substituting \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \) into both equations to ensure they yield the same \( y \)-value.  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute each \( x \)-value into both parabola equations and check if the \( y \)-values match.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( x = -4 \):  
- First parabola: \( y = 3(-4)^2 + 4(-4) - 5 = 3 \cdot 16 - 16 - 5 = 48 - 16 - 5 = 27 \).  
- Second parabola: \( y = (-4)^2 + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27 \).  
The \( y \)-values match (\( y = 27 \)).  

For \( x = 2 \):  
- First parabola: \( y = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 + 8 - 5 = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15 \).  
- Second parabola: \( y = (2)^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15 \).  
The \( y \)-values match (\( y = 15 \)).  

The solutions are valid, with intersection points at \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \).

  - Subgoal 2: Solve the quadratic equation for \( x \)-values (Completed: \( x = -4, 2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute corresponding \( y \)-values (Completed: Points are \( (-4, 27) \), \( (2, 15) \)).  
  - **Subgoal 4 (Current):** Order the intersection points by increasing \( x \)-coordinate and format the output.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Order the intersection points by increasing \( x \)-coordinate and format as required.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the points \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \) in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The intersection points are \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \). Ordered by increasing \( x \)-coordinate:  
\[ (-4, 27); (2, 15) \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[ (-4, 27); (2, 15) \]
