**Problem Restatement**: Find all points where the parabolas defined by the equations \( y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \) and \( y = x^2 + 11 \) intersect, and list these points in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the intersection points of the two parabolas, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Set the equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points.  
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \( x \).  
3. Compute the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates for each \( x \).  
4. Order the intersection points by increasing \( x \)-coordinate.  
5. Format the output as requested.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Set the equations equal to find the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points.  
**How to Achieve**: Equate \( 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11 \), simplify to form a quadratic equation, and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Set the equations equal:  
\[ 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11 \]  
Subtract \( x^2 + 11 \) from both sides:  
\[ 3x^2 + 4x - 5 - x^2 - 11 = 0 \]  
Simplify:  
\[ 2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0 \]  
Divide through by 2 to simplify:  
\[ x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 \]  
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = -8 \):  
\[ x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-8)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 32}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 6}{2} \]  
\[ x = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \]  
The \( x \)-coordinates are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates for \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \) into one of the parabola equations (use \( y = x^2 + 11 \) for simplicity) to find the \( y \)-coordinates.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute into \( y = x^2 + 11 \):  
For \( x = -4 \):  
\[ y = (-4)^2 + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27 \]  
Point: \( (-4, 27) \).  

For \( x = 2 \):  
\[ y = 2^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15 \]  
Point: \( (2, 15) \).  

Verify using the other equation \( y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \):  
For \( x = -4 \):  
\[ y = 3(-4)^2 + 4(-4) - 5 = 3 \cdot 16 - 16 - 5 = 48 - 16 - 5 = 27 \]  
Matches: \( (-4, 27) \).  

For \( x = 2 \):  
\[ y = 3 \cdot 2^2 + 4 \cdot 2 - 5 = 3 \cdot 4 + 8 - 5 = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15 \]  
Matches: \( (2, 15) \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the intersection points are correct and complete.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 \) has exactly two solutions, and check that the points satisfy both equations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 \) is a second-degree polynomial, so it has at most two real roots. The discriminant is positive (\( \sqrt{36} = 6 \)), indicating exactly two real solutions, which are \( x = -4 \) and \( x = 2 \). The \( y \)-coordinates were calculated and verified in Step 3 to satisfy both equations, confirming the points \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \). No other intersections are possible since the parabolas intersect at exactly two points.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Order the intersection points by increasing \( x \)-coordinate and format as requested.  
**How to Achieve**: List the points \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \) in order of increasing \( x \)-coordinate, separated by semicolons.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The points are \( (-4, 27) \) and \( (2, 15) \). Ordering by increasing \( x \)-coordinate (\( -4 < 2 \)):  
\[ (-4, 27); (2, 15) \]  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**:  
\[ (-4, 27); (2, 15) \]
