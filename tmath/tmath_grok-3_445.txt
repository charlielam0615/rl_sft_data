**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen integer \( p \) from 1 to 10 (inclusive) satisfies the equation \( pq - 4p - 2q = 2 \) for some integer \( q \). The probability should be expressed as a common fraction, where the total number of possible outcomes is 10 (since \( p \) ranges from 1 to 10).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the given equation to express \( q \) in terms of \( p \).  
2. Determine for which values of \( p \) (from 1 to 10) there exists an integer \( q \) that satisfies the equation.  
3. Calculate the probability as the number of valid \( p \) values divided by the total number of possible \( p \) values (10).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \( pq - 4p - 2q = 2 \) to solve for \( q \) in terms of \( p \), ensuring \( q \) is an integer for a given \( p \). This will help identify valid \( p \) values. To achieve this, manipulate the equation algebraically to isolate \( q \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ pq - 4p - 2q = 2 \]

Rearrange to isolate terms involving \( q \):  
\[ pq - 2q = 4p + 2 \]

Factor \( q \) on the left-hand side:  
\[ q(p - 2) = 4p + 2 \]

Solve for \( q \):  
\[ q = \frac{4p + 2}{p - 2} \]

For \( q \) to be an integer, the denominator \( p - 2 \) must divide the numerator \( 4p + 2 \) evenly, and \( p \neq 2 \) (since \( p = 2 \) makes the denominator zero, which is undefined).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine for which integers \( p \) from 1 to 10, the expression \( q = \frac{4p + 2}{p - 2} \) yields an integer \( q \). This involves testing each \( p \) from 1 to 10 and checking if \( 4p + 2 \) is divisible by \( p - 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test each \( p \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \):

- **p = 1**:  
  Denominator: \( 1 - 2 = -1 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(1) + 2 = 6 \).  
  \( q = \frac{6}{-1} = -6 \).  
  Since \( -6 \) is an integer, \( p = 1 \) is valid.

- **p = 2**:  
  Denominator: \( 2 - 2 = 0 \).  
  \( q = \frac{4(2) + 2}{0} = \frac{10}{0} \), which is undefined.  
  No integer \( q \), so \( p = 2 \) is not valid.

- **p = 3**:  
  Denominator: \( 3 - 2 = 1 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(3) + 2 = 14 \).  
  \( q = \frac{14}{1} = 14 \).  
  Since 14 is an integer, \( p = 3 \) is valid.

- **p = 4**:  
  Denominator: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(4) + 2 = 18 \).  
  \( q = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).  
  Since 9 is an integer, \( p = 4 \) is valid.

- **p = 5**:  
  Denominator: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(5) + 2 = 22 \).  
  \( q = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.333 \).  
  Not an integer, so \( p = 5 \) is not valid.

- **p = 6**:  
  Denominator: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(6) + 2 = 26 \).  
  \( q = \frac{26}{4} = 6.5 \).  
  Not an integer, so \( p = 6 \) is not valid.

- **p = 7**:  
  Denominator: \( 7 - 2 = 5 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(7) + 2 = 30 \).  
  \( q = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).  
  Since 6 is an integer, \( p = 7 \) is valid.

- **p = 8**:  
  Denominator: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(8) + 2 = 34 \).  
  \( q = \frac{34}{6} \approx 5.666 \).  
  Not an integer, so \( p = 8 \) is not valid.

- **p = 9**:  
  Denominator: \( 9 - 2 = 7 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(9) + 2 = 38 \).  
  \( q = \frac{38}{7} \approx 5.428 \).  
  Not an integer, so \( p = 9 \) is not valid.

- **p = 10**:  
  Denominator: \( 10 - 2 = 8 \).  
  Numerator: \( 4(10) + 2 = 42 \).  
  \( q = \frac{42}{8} = 5.25 \).  
  Not an integer, so \( p = 10 \) is not valid.

Valid \( p \): \{1, 3, 4, 7\}.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the values \( p = \{1, 3, 4, 7\} \) satisfy the original equation \( pq - 4p - 2q = 2 \) with their corresponding integer \( q \) values. This ensures no errors in the calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify each valid \( p \):

- **p = 1, q = -6**:  
  \( 1 \cdot (-6) - 4 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot (-6) = -6 - 4 + 12 = 2 \).  
  Satisfies the equation.

- **p = 3, q = 14**:  
  \( 3 \cdot 14 - 4 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot 14 = 42 - 12 - 28 = 2 \).  
  Satisfies the equation.

- **p = 4, q = 9**:  
  \( 4 \cdot 9 - 4 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 9 = 36 - 16 - 18 = 2 \).  
  Satisfies the equation.

- **p = 7, q = 6**:  
  \( 7 \cdot 6 - 4 \cdot 7 - 2 \cdot 6 = 42 - 28 - 12 = 2 \).  
  Satisfies the equation.

All values are correct.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the probability as the number of valid \( p \) values (where an integer \( q \) exists) divided by the total number of possible \( p \) values (10). Express the result as a common fraction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Number of valid \( p \): 4 (\{1, 3, 4, 7\}).  
Total possible \( p \): 10.  
Probability:  
\[ \frac{\text{Number of valid } p}{\text{Total } p} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \].  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability is \( \frac{2}{5} \).
