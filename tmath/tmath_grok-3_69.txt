### Problem Statement
We need to find all values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \), where the function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
9x + 16 & \text{if } x < 2, \\
2x - 14 & \text{if } x \geq 2.
\end{cases}
\]
Then, compute the sum of all possible values of \( x \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \), we need to consider both cases of the piecewise function since the definition changes at \( x = 2 \). The subgoals are:
1. Solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the case \( x < 2 \), i.e., solve \( 9x + 16 = -2 \).
2. Solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the case \( x \geq 2 \), i.e., solve \( 2x - 14 = -2 \).
3. Verify the solutions against the domain constraints of each case.
4. Sum all valid values of \( x \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve \( 9x + 16 = -2 \) for the case \( x < 2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \) in the equation and check if the solution satisfies \( x < 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation \( 9x + 16 = -2 \):
\[
9x + 16 = -2
\]
Subtract 16 from both sides:
\[
9x = -2 - 16 = -18
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
x = \frac{-18}{9} = -2
\]
Check the domain constraint: \( x = -2 < 2 \), which is satisfied. Thus, \( x = -2 \) is a valid solution for the first case.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve \( 2x - 14 = -2 \) for the case \( x \geq 2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \) in the equation and check if the solution satisfies \( x \geq 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Solve the equation \( 2x - 14 = -2 \):
\[
2x - 14 = -2
\]
Add 14 to both sides:
\[
2x = -2 + 14 = 12
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]
Check the domain constraint: \( x = 6 \geq 2 \), which is satisfied. Thus, \( x = 6 \) is a valid solution for the second case.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all possible solutions have been found and are valid.  
**How to Achieve**: Ensure both cases of the piecewise function have been addressed and check for any additional solutions or edge cases, such as at \( x = 2 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We have solved for both cases:
- Case 1 (\( x < 2 \)): \( x = -2 \), which satisfies \( x < 2 \).
- Case 2 (\( x \geq 2 \)): \( x = 6 \), which satisfies \( x \geq 2 \).

Since the function is piecewise with two distinct linear expressions and the domains are mutually exclusive (\( x < 2 \) and \( x \geq 2 \)), no other cases exist. The transition point \( x = 2 \) falls under the second case (\( x \geq 2 \)). Letâ€™s verify at \( x = 2 \):
\[
f(2) = 2(2) - 14 = 4 - 14 = -10 \neq -2
\]
Thus, \( x = 2 \) is not a solution. No other solutions are possible since each piece is a linear function (with one solution each).

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all possible values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( 9x + 16 = -2 \) for \( x < 2 \) (completed: \( x = -2 \)).
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( 2x - 14 = -2 \) for \( x \geq 2 \) (completed: \( x = 6 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions against domain constraints (completed: both solutions valid).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum all valid values of \( x \) (pending).

**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of all valid \( x \)-values.

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute the sum of all possible values of \( x \).  
**How to Achieve**: Add the valid solutions \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 6 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The valid solutions are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 6 \). Compute their sum:
\[
-2 + 6 = 4
\]
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The sum of all possible values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \) is \( 4 \).
