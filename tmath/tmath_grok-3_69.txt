**Problem Statement**: We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) = \begin{cases} 9x + 16 & \text{if } x < 2, \\ 2x - 14 & \text{if } x \ge 2 \end{cases} \), and we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the sum of all possible values of \( x \) where \( f(x) = -2 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the first piece of the function where \( x < 2 \).  
2. Solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the second piece where \( x \ge 2 \).  
3. Verify which solutions satisfy the respective domain conditions.  
4. Sum the valid solutions for \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the first piece, \( 9x + 16 = -2 \), where \( x < 2 \). This involves solving the linear equation and checking if the solution satisfies the condition \( x < 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation \( 9x + 16 = -2 \):  
\[ 9x = -2 - 16 \]  
\[ 9x = -18 \]  
\[ x = -2 \]  
Check the domain: Since \( x = -2 < 2 \), this solution is valid for the first piece.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve \( f(x) = -2 \) for the second piece, \( 2x - 14 = -2 \), where \( x \ge 2 \). This involves solving the linear equation and checking if the solution satisfies the condition \( x \ge 2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Solve the equation \( 2x - 14 = -2 \):  
\[ 2x = -2 + 14 \]  
\[ 2x = 12 \]  
\[ x = 6 \]  
Check the domain: Since \( x = 6 \ge 2 \), this solution is valid for the second piece.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the sum of all possible values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( 9x + 16 = -2 \) for \( x < 2 \) (completed, solution: \( x = -2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \( 2x - 14 = -2 \) for \( x \ge 2 \) (completed, solution: \( x = 6 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions against domain conditions (completed, both solutions valid).  
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the valid solutions for \( x \) (current goal).  
**Current Goal**: Sum the valid solutions \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 6 \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the sum of the valid solutions \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 6 \). This involves adding the values together.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Sum the solutions:  
\[ -2 + 6 = 4 \]

**Final Answer**: The sum of all possible values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -2 \) is \( \boxed{4} \).
