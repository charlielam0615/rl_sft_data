**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \) given \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = 23 \), break the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} \) in terms of \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \).  
2. Derive a relationship using algebraic identities.  
3. Solve for \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Express \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} \) in terms of \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \).  
How to Achieve: Use the algebraic identity for the square of a sum to relate \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \) to \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider the expression \( \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 \). Expanding this:  
\[ \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = x^4 + 2 \cdot x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^4} = x^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^4}. \]  
Thus:  
\[ x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 - 2. \]  
Given \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = 23 \), substitute:  
\[ \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 - 2 = 23. \]  
\[ \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = 25. \]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Solve for \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \) using the equation \( \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = 25 \).  
How to Achieve: Take the square root of both sides and consider the possible values, ensuring they are valid for the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \( \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = 25 \), take the square root:  
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \pm \sqrt{25} = \pm 5. \]  
Since \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \) is a sum of two non-negative terms (as \( x^2 \geq 0 \) and \( \frac{1}{x^2} \geq 0 \)), the value must be non-negative. Thus:  
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5. \]  
The negative root \( -5 \) is not possible since \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \geq 2 \) (by the AM-GM inequality: \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \geq 2 \sqrt{x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{x^2}} = 2 \)).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the solution \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5 \).  
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5 \) back into the derived equation and check consistency with the given condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From Step 2, we have:  
\[ \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} + 2. \]  
If \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5 \):  
\[ \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \right)^2 = 5^2 = 25. \]  
\[ x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = 25 - 2 = 23. \]  
This matches the given condition \( x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4} = 23 \), confirming the solution is correct.
