### Problem Restatement
We need to find the product of the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\) and express it in the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\), where \(a, b, c, d\) are real numbers. Then, we compute the value of \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Multiply the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\) to obtain a polynomial.  
2. Rewrite the resulting polynomial in the standard form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\).  
3. Identify the coefficients \(a, b, c, d\).  
4. Compute the expression \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Multiply the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\).  
How to Achieve: Use the distributive property to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial, then combine like terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distribute each term:  
- \(3x^2 \cdot 7 = 21x^2\)  
- \(3x^2 \cdot (-2x) = -6x^3\)  
- \(-5x \cdot 7 = -35x\)  
- \(-5x \cdot (-2x) = 10x^2\)  
- \(4 \cdot 7 = 28\)  
- \(4 \cdot (-2x) = -8x\)  

Combine all terms:  
\(-6x^3 + 21x^2 + 10x^2 - 35x - 8x + 28\)  

Combine like terms:  
- \(x^3\): \(-6x^3\)  
- \(x^2\): \(21x^2 + 10x^2 = 31x^2\)  
- \(x\): \(-35x - 8x = -43x\)  
- Constant: \(28\)  

Resulting polynomial: \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\)  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the polynomial multiplication is correct.  
How to Achieve: Check the multiplication by selecting a value for \(x\), compute the product \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\), and compare with the result \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test with \(x = 1\):  
- Left side: \((3(1)^2 - 5(1) + 4)(7 - 2(1)) = (3 - 5 + 4)(7 - 2) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10\)  
- Right side: \(-6(1)^3 + 31(1)^2 - 43(1) + 28 = -6 + 31 - 43 + 28 = 10\)  

Since both sides equal 10, the polynomial \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\) is likely correct.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the coefficients \(a, b, c, d\) from the polynomial and compute \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\).  
How to Achieve: Extract coefficients from the standard form \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\), assign them to \(a, b, c, d\), and calculate the expression.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\):  
- \(a = -6\) (coefficient of \(x^3\))  
- \(b = 31\) (coefficient of \(x^2\))  
- \(c = -43\) (coefficient of \(x\))  
- \(d = 28\) (constant term)  

Compute:  
\[ 8a + 4b + 2c + d = 8(-6) + 4(31) + 2(-43) + 28 \]  
- \(8(-6) = -48\)  
- \(4(31) = 124\)  
- \(2(-43) = -86\)  
- \(28 = 28\)  

Sum: \(-48 + 124 - 86 + 28 = 18\)  
[/IMP]

Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\) for the product \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\) in the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Multiply the polynomials (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Rewrite in standard form (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify coefficients \(a, b, c, d\) (completed in Step 4).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\) (completed in Step 4).  

Current Goal: None, as all subgoals are completed.
