**Problem Restatement**: We need to find the product of the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\) and express it in the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\). Then, compute the value of \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\), where \(a, b, c, d\) are the coefficients of the resulting polynomial.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Multiply the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\) to obtain a polynomial.  
2. Express the result in the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\) by identifying coefficients \(a, b, c, d\).  
3. Compute \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\) using the coefficients.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to multiply the polynomials \((3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)\). This will be achieved by distributing each term of the first polynomial across the second polynomial, collecting like terms, and simplifying the result.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Distribute each term of \(3x^2 - 5x + 4\) over \(7 - 2x\):  
- \(3x^2 \cdot 7 = 21x^2\)  
- \(3x^2 \cdot (-2x) = -6x^3\)  
- \(-5x \cdot 7 = -35x\)  
- \(-5x \cdot (-2x) = 10x^2\)  
- \(4 \cdot 7 = 28\)  
- \(4 \cdot (-2x) = -8x\)  

Combine all terms:  
\(-6x^3 + 21x^2 + 10x^2 - 35x - 8x + 28\)  

Collect like terms:  
- \(x^3\): \(-6x^3\)  
- \(x^2\): \(21x^2 + 10x^2 = 31x^2\)  
- \(x\): \(-35x - 8x = -43x\)  
- Constant: \(28\)  

Resulting polynomial: \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\)

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the polynomial multiplication by checking the result \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\). This will be achieved by expanding the polynomials using an alternative method (e.g., multiplying term-by-term in a different order) or substituting a value to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, multiply in a different order, treating \((7 - 2x)(3x^2 - 5x + 4)\):  
- \(7 \cdot 3x^2 = 21x^2\)  
- \(7 \cdot (-5x) = -35x\)  
- \(7 \cdot 4 = 28\)  
- \(-2x \cdot 3x^2 = -6x^3\)  
- \(-2x \cdot (-5x) = 10x^2\)  
- \(-2x \cdot 4 = -8x\)  

Combine: \(-6x^3 + 21x^2 + 10x^2 - 35x - 8x + 28 = -6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\)  

Alternatively, substitute \(x = 1\):  
- Left: \((3(1)^2) - 5(1) + 4)(7 - 2(1)) = (3 - 5 + 4)(7 - 2) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10\)  
- Right: \(-6(1)^3) + 31(1)^2 - 43(1) + 28 = -6 + 31 - 43 + 28 = 10\)  

The results match, confirming the polynomial is correct.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the coefficients \(a, b, c, d\) from the polynomial \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\) and compute \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\). This will be achieved by extracting the polynomialâ€™s coefficients and substituting them into the expression.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\), the coefficients are:  
- \(a = -6\) (coefficient of \(x^3\))  
- \(b = 31\) (coefficient of \(x^2\))  
- \(c = -43\) (coefficient of \(x\))  
- \(d = 28\) (constant term)  

Compute:  
\[ 8a + 8 \cdot (-6) = -48\]  
\[ 4b + 4 \cdot 31) = 124\]  
\[ 2c + 2 \cdot (-43) = -86\]  
\[ d = 28\]  

Sum: \[-48 + 124 - 86 + 28 = 18\]  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the computation of \(8a + 4b + 2c + d\). This will be achieved by rechecking the coefficients and recalculating the expression to ensure accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck coefficients: \(-6x^3 + 31x^2 - 43x + 28\) gives \(a = -6\), \(b = 31\), \(c = -43\), \(d = 28\).  
Recalculate:  
- \(8(-6) = -48\)  
- \(4(31) = 124\)  
- \(2(-43) = -86\)  
- \(28 = 28\)  

Sum: \[-48 + 124 - 86 + 28 = 124 - 48 = 76; 76 - 86 = -10; -10 + 28 = 18\]  
The result matches, confirming correctness.
