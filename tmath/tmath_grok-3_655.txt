**Problem Restatement**: We need to calculate the expected worth of flipping an unfair coin, where the probability of landing on heads is \(\frac{3}{4}\), and tails is \(\frac{1}{4}\). A heads flip yields a gain of $3, while a tails flip results in a loss of $8. The final answer should be a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the expected worth of a coin flip, break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Define the expected value formula for the coin flip.  
2. Identify the probabilities and outcomes for heads and tails.  
3. Compute the expected value using the formula.  
4. Round the result to the nearest hundredth.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to define the expected value formula for the coin flip. The expected value \(E\) of a random variable is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability, i.e., \(E = \sum (x_i \cdot P(x_i))\), where \(x_i\) is the outcome and \(P(x_i)\) is its probability. We will apply this formula to the coin flip problem.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expected value \(E\) for the coin flip is defined as:  
\[ E = (\text{value of heads} \cdot \text{probability of heads}) + (\text{value of tails} \cdot \text{probability of tails}) \]  
This formula will be used to compute the expected worth based on the given probabilities and outcomes.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the probabilities and outcomes for heads and tails. We will extract the given values: probability of heads is \(\frac{3}{4}\), probability of tails is \(\frac{1}{4}\), heads yields $3, and tails results in a loss of $8 (i.e., -$8).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- Probability of heads: \(\frac{3}{4}\), outcome: +$3.  
- Probability of tails: \(\frac{1}{4}\), outcome: -$8.  

[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the expected value using the formula \(E = (\text{value of heads} \cdot \text{probability of heads}) + (\text{value of tails} \cdot \text{probability of tails})\). Substitute the values: \(3 \cdot \frac{3}{4} + (-8) \cdot \frac{1}{4}\).  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the expected value:  
\[ E = \left(3 \cdot \frac{3}{4}\right) + \left(-8 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\right) \]  
\[ = \left(3 \cdot 0.75\right) + \left(-8 \cdot 0.25\right) \]  
\[ = 2.25 - 2 \]  
\[ = 0.25 \]  
The expected value is $0.25.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Calculate the expected worth of a coin flip, rounded to the nearest hundredth.  
  - Subgoal 1: Define the expected value formula (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify probabilities and outcomes (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the expected value (completed, result: $0.25).  
  - Subgoal 4: Round the result to the nearest hundredth (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Round the expected value to the nearest hundredth.  

[/REVIEW]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to round the expected value ($0.25) to the nearest hundredth. Since the hundredth place is the second decimal place, we will check if $0.25 needs rounding.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The expected value is $0.25. The hundredth place is 2, and the next digit (5) does not require rounding up (since it is less than 5 when considering further digits, which are absent). Thus, $0.25 remains $0.25 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.  

[/IMP]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the computation of the expected value and the rounding. Recalculate the expected value and confirm the rounding to ensure accuracy.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recalculate:  
\[ E = \left(3 \cdot \frac{3}{4}\right) + \left(-8 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{8}{4} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]  
The calculation is correct. For rounding, $0.25 has two decimal places, and no further digits require adjustment, so the rounded value is $0.25. The result is valid.  

[/IMP]

**Final Answer**

The expected worth of a coin flip is $0.25.
