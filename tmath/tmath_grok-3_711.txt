**Problem Restatement**: I have 5 books, including two identical copies of a math book, with the other three books being unique. I need to determine the number of distinct arrangements of these books on a shelf.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Understand the total number of books and their properties (identical vs. unique).
2. Calculate the number of distinct arrangements, accounting for the identical books.
3. Validate the calculation method.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the total number of books and their properties.
How to Achieve: Count the books and note that two are identical math books, while the other three are distinct.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
There are 5 books in total. Two are identical copies of a math book, and the other three are unique (e.g., Book A, Book B, Book C).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for permutations of a multiset, which accounts for identical items: \( \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( n_i \) are the frequencies of identical items.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Total books \( n = 5 \). There are two identical math books (frequency 2), and three unique books (frequency 1 each).
The number of distinct arrangements is:
\[
\frac{5!}{2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{120}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 60
\]
So, there are 60 distinct arrangements.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the calculation method.
How to Achieve: Consider an alternative approach (e.g., treating the identical books as distinct and adjusting) to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Alternative approach: If all 5 books were distinct, there would be \( 5! = 120 \) arrangements. Since the two math books are identical, divide by \( 2! = 2 \) to account for their indistinguishability:
\[
\frac{120}{2} = 60
\]
This matches the previous result, confirming the calculation.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of distinct arrangements of 5 books (2 identical, 3 unique).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the total number of books and their properties (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the calculation method (completed).
Current Goal: None (all subgoals completed).
The solution is 60 distinct arrangements.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 60 ways to arrange the 5 books on the shelf.
