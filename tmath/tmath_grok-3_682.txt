**Problem Restatement**: Determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes, where each box can contain zero or more balls.

To solve this, I will use the meta-cognitive action set (M), selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) subsets, and structure the response with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Understand the problem constraints: indistinguishable balls and boxes, and boxes can be empty.  
2. Identify a mathematical approach to count the distributions, likely using partitions or combinatorial methods.  
3. Compute the number of valid distributions based on the chosen method.  
4. Verify the solution to ensure correctness.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the mathematical approach to count the distributions of 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.  
How to Achieve: Recognize that since both balls and boxes are indistinguishable, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 5 (the number of balls) into up to 3 non-negative integers (representing the number of balls in each box), where the order of the integers does not matter due to indistinguishable boxes. This is equivalent to finding the number of partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To count the distributions, I interpret the problem as finding the number of partitions of 5 (the number of balls) into at most 3 parts (since there are 3 boxes). In number theory, a partition of a number \( n \) into \( k \) parts is a way of writing \( n \) as a sum of \( k \) positive integers, where the order of summands does not matter. Here, since boxes can be empty, we consider partitions of 5 into 1, 2, or 3 non-negative parts.

The partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts (allowing zeros for empty boxes) correspond to solutions of \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5 \), where \( x_i \geq 0 \) are non-negative integers (number of balls in each box), and the boxes are indistinguishable, so solutions are counted without regard to order.

To compute, list the partitions of 5 into at most 3 non-negative parts:  
- 5 (one box gets 5, others 0): \( 5 + 0 + 0 \)  
- 4 + 1 + 0  
- 3 + 2 + 0  
- 3 + 1 + 1  
- 2 + 2 + 1  

Since boxes are indistinguishable, each partition is counted once regardless of permutations. Let’s list them systematically:  
- \( 5 + 0 + 0 \): One way (5 in one box, others empty).  
- \( 4 + 1 + 0 \): One way (4 in one box, 1 in another, 0 in the third).  
- \( 3 + 2 + 0 \): One way (3 in one box, 2 in another, 0 in the third).  
- \( 3 + 1 + 1 \): One way (3 in one box, 1 in each of the other two).  
- \( 2 + 2 + 1 \): One way (2 in two boxes, 1 in one box).  

There are 5 distinct partitions, suggesting 5 ways to distribute the balls.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand problem constraints (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the mathematical approach (partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts, completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the number of valid distributions (in progress, 5 partitions identified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution to ensure correctness (pending).  
Current Goal: Compute the number of valid distributions (continuing to confirm the count).  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy shows we have identified the approach (partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts) and computed 5 partitions. The current focus is ensuring the computation covers all possible distributions. The listed partitions—\( 5+0+0 \), \( 4+1+0 \), \( 3+2+0 \), \( 3+1+1 \), \( 2+2+1 \)—represent all ways to sum to 5 with at most 3 non-negative integers, accounting for indistinguishable boxes. No additional partitions seem missing, but verification is needed next.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the correctness of the computed number of distributions (5 partitions).  
How to Achieve: Cross-check the partitions by systematically generating them and compare with a known combinatorial method, such as the partition function \( p(n, k) \), which counts partitions of \( n \) into at most \( k \) parts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, I confirm the partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts. The partitions listed are:  
- \( 5 + 0 + 0 \)  
- \( 4 + 1 + 0 \)  
- \( 3 + 2 + 0 \)  
- \( 3 + 1 + 1 \)  
- \( 2 + 2 + 1 \)  

Alternatively, use the partition function \( p(n, k) \), where \( p(n, k) \) is the number of partitions of \( n \) into at most \( k \) parts. This can be computed as \( p(5, 3) \), the number of ways to write 5 as a sum of at most 3 non-negative integers, which equals the number of partitions of 5 into 1, 2, or 3 parts (including zeros).

Using the partition function:  
- \( p(5, 1) = 1 \) (only \( 5 \))  
- \( p(5, 2) = 3 \) (partitions: \( 5+0 \), \( 4+1 \), \( 3+2 \))  
- \( p(5, 3) = p(5, 2) + \text{partitions with exactly 3 parts} \)  

Partitions with exactly 3 parts (all non-zero, but we adjust for zeros):  
- \( 3 + 1 + 1 \)  
- \( 2 + 2 + 1 \)  

Since boxes can be empty, we sum:  
- \( p(5, 1) = 1 \) (5)  
- \( p(5, 2) = 3 \) (5+0, 4+1, 3+2)  
- Partitions with 3 parts: \( 3+1+1 \), \( 2+2+1 \) (2 ways).  

Total: \( 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \), matching the earlier count.

Alternatively, use the “stars and bars” theorem adjusted for indistinguishable boxes. For distinguishable boxes, the number of solutions to \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5 \), \( x_i \geq 0 \), is \( \binom{5+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \). For indistinguishable boxes, we take unique partitions, which we’ve listed as 5, confirming the count.

The number of partitions \( p(5, 3) = 5 \), as computed in number theory tables, validates the result.

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
List all goals in a nested format, highlighting the current goal:  
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand problem constraints (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the mathematical approach (partitions of 5 into at most 3 parts, completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the number of valid distributions (5 partitions, completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution to ensure correctness (validated using partition function and listing, completed).  
Current Goal: Finalize the solution by confirming the answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy confirms all subgoals are completed. The computation yielded 5 partitions, validated by listing all partitions (\( 5+0+0 \), \( 4+1+0 \), \( 3+2+0 \), \( 3+1+1 \), \( 2+2+1 \)) and cross-checked with the partition function \( p(5, 3) = 5 \). The solution accounts for indistinguishable balls and boxes, and no additional partitions were found. The answer is consistent across methods.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 5 ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.
