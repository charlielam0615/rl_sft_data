**Problem Statement**: Simplify the complex number expression \( 2(3 - i) + i(2 + i) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of simplifying \( 2(3 - i) + i(2 + i) \) into subgoals:  
1. Distribute the coefficients in each term: compute \( 2(3 - i) \) and \( i(2 + i) \).  
2. Combine the results by adding the real and imaginary parts.  
3. Simplify the final expression into the standard form \( a + bi \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( 2(3 - i) \).  
Description: Distribute the coefficient 2 to both terms inside the parentheses.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( 2(3 - i) \):  
\( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \), \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2i \).  
Result: \( 6 - 2i \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \( i(2 + i) \).  
Description: Distribute the coefficient \( i \) to both terms inside the parentheses, using \( i^2 = -1 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute \( i(2 + i) \):  
\( i \cdot 2 = 2i \), \( i \cdot i = i^2 = -1 \).  
Result: \( 2i - 1 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Add the results \( 6 - 2i \) and \( 2i - 1 \).  
Description: Combine the real and imaginary parts separately.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Add \( (6 - 2i) + (2i - 1) \):  
Real parts: \( 6 + (-1) = 5 \).  
Imaginary parts: \( -2i + 2i = 0 \).  
Result: \( 5 + 0i = 5 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the simplified result \( 5 \).  
Description: Recompute the expression to confirm correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\( 2(3 - i) = 6 - 2i \).  
\( i(2 + i) = 2i - 1 \).  
Sum: \( (6 - 2i) + (2i - 1) = 6 - 1 - 2i + 2i = 5 \).  
The result \( 5 \) is consistent.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \( 2(3 - i) + i(2 + i) \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \( 2(3 - i) \). (Completed: \( 6 - 2i \))  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute \( i(2 + i) \). (Completed: \( 2i - 1 \))  
  - Subgoal 3: Add results. (Completed: \( 5 \))  
Current Goal: Main goal completed.  
The simplified expression is \( 5 \).

**Final Answer**: \( 5 \)
