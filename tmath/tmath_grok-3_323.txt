### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the area enclosed by the region. The equation resembles a circle’s equation, so the subgoals are:  
1. Rewrite the equation in standard form to identify the shape and its properties (center and radius).  
2. Confirm the shape is a circle and determine its radius.  
3. Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a circle.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rewrite the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y = 0 \) in standard form to identify the shape and its properties.  
**How to Achieve**: Complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms to transform the equation into the standard form of a circle, \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y = 0 \]

Group the \( x \)- and \( y \)-terms:  
\[ (x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 + 8y) = 0 \]

Complete the square for \( x \):  
\[ x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9 \]  
(Since \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \), and \( 3^2 = 9 \).)

Complete the square for \( y \):  
\[ y^2 + 8y = (y + 4)^2 - 16 \]  
(Since \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \), and \( 4^2 = 16 \).)

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 4)^2 - 16 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 - 25 = 0 \]  
\[ (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25 \]

This is the standard form of a circle with center \( (-3, -4) \) and radius \( r = \sqrt{25} = 5 \).

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the equation \( (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25 \) correctly represents the original equation and confirms the shape is a circle.  
**How to Achieve**: Expand the standard form back to check if it matches the original equation and confirm the radius is positive, indicating a valid circle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Expand \( (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25 \):  
\[ (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 \]  
\[ (y + 4)^2 = y^2 + 8y + 16 \]

So:  
\[ x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 + 8y + 16 = 25 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y + 25 = 25 \]  
\[ x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y = 0 \]

This matches the original equation, confirming correctness. The radius \( r = 5 \) is positive, so the equation describes a circle.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the area enclosed by the region defined by \( x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y = 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form (completed: \( (x + 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 25 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Confirm the shape is a circle and determine its radius (completed: circle with radius 5).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area using the circle’s area formula (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of the circle.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the area of the circle with radius 5.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the area of a circle, \( A = \pi r^2 \), with \( r = 5 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The radius of the circle is \( r = 5 \). The area is:  
\[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 5^2 = 25\pi \]

Thus, the area enclosed by the region is \( 25\pi \) square units.

### Final Answer
The area enclosed by the region defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 + 6x + 8y = 0 \) is \( 25\pi \) square units.
