**Problem Restatement:** We are given the equation of a circle, \(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\), and we need to determine the area of a square in which this circle is inscribed. The square has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the problem into smaller, manageable subgoals to solve it systematically. First, I need to rewrite the given equation of the circle into standard form to identify its center and radius. Then, I will determine the dimensions of the square based on the circle's diameter since the circle is inscribed in the square. Finally, I will calculate the area of the square.

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the circle's equation into standard form.  
Description: I will rearrange the terms of the given equation \(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\) to form the standard equation of a circle, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), by completing the square for both x and y terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Starting with the given equation:  
\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\)  
Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:  
\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\)  
Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:  
\(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0\)  
Now, complete the square for the x terms:  
\(x^2 - 6x = (x - 3)^2 - 9\)  
And for the y terms:  
\(y^2 + 2y = (y + 1)^2 - 1\)  
Substitute these back into the equation:  
\((x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - 10 = 0\)  
Simplify:  
\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 20 = 0\)  
\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\)  
Thus, the standard form of the circle's equation is \((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\), with center at (3, -1) and radius \(r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\).

**Step 3:**

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Find the area of the square in which the circle is inscribed.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the circle's equation into standard form (Completed: Center at (3, -1), radius \(2\sqrt{5}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the dimensions of the square based on the circle's diameter.  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the area of the square.  
Current Goal: Determine the dimensions of the square based on the circle's diameter.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Determine the dimensions of the square.  
Description: Since the circle is inscribed in the square and the square has sides parallel to the x-axis, the diameter of the circle should equal the side length of the square. I will calculate the diameter from the radius and use it to find the side length of the square.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The radius of the circle is \(2\sqrt{5}\), so the diameter is:  
\(2 \times 2\sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5}\)  
Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle equals the side length of the square. Therefore, the side length of the square is \(4\sqrt{5}\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Calculate the area of the square.  
Description: Using the side length of the square determined as \(4\sqrt{5}\), I will compute the area by squaring the side length.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The side length of the square is \(4\sqrt{5}\).  
The area of the square is:  
\((4\sqrt{5})^2 = 16 \times 5 = 80\)  
Thus, the area of the square is 80 square units.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the solution.  
Description: I will check if the circle is indeed inscribed in the square by verifying that the circle touches all four sides of the square, given the side length and the circle's center and radius.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The square has a side length of \(4\sqrt{5}\), and since its sides are parallel to the x-axis, I assume it is aligned with the axes for simplicity. Given the center of the circle at (3, -1) and radius \(2\sqrt{5}\), I will determine the bounds of the circle:  
- Leftmost point: \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{5}\)  
- Rightmost point: \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{5}\)  
- Topmost point: \(y = -1 + 2\sqrt{5}\)  
- Bottommost point: \(y = -1 - 2\sqrt{5}\)  
The width and height of the circle (diameter) are both \(4\sqrt{5}\), matching the side length of the square. If the square is positioned such that it extends from \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{5}\) to \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{5}\) and from \(y = -1 - 2\sqrt{5}\) to \(y = -1 + 2\sqrt{5}\), the circle would touch all four sides of the square, confirming it is inscribed. Therefore, the side length and area calculation seem consistent.

**Final Answer:**  
The area of the square is 80 square units.
