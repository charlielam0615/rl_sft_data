### Problem Restatement
We need to find the area of a square that inscribes a circle defined by the equation \(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\). The square has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis, and the circle is inscribed inside it, meaning the circle touches all four sides of the square.

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to reach the solution:  
1. Rewrite the circle's equation in standard form to identify its center and radius.  
2. Determine the geometric relationship between the inscribed circle and the square, given that the square has sides parallel to the x-axis.  
3. Calculate the side length of the square based on the circle's radius.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the circle's equation in standard form to find its center and radius. This will be achieved by simplifying the given equation, completing the square for \(x\) and \(y\), and transforming it into the form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[ 2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20 \]

Rearrange all terms to one side:  
\[ 2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0 \]

Divide through by 2 to simplify:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0 \]

Complete the square for \(x\):  
\[ x^2 - 6x = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9 \]

Complete the square for \(y\):  
\[ y^2 + 2y = (y^2 + 2y + 1) - 1 = (y + 1)^2 - 1 \]

Substitute back into the equation:  
\[ (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - 10 = 0 \]

Simplify:  
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 9 - 1 - 10 = 0 \]  
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20 \]

This is the standard form of the circle's equation, where the center is \((3, -1)\) and the radius is:  
\[ r^2 = 20 \implies r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the area of the square inscribing the circle.  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the circle's equation in standard form (completed: center \((3, -1)\), radius \(2\sqrt{5}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the geometric relationship between the circle and the square.  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the side length of the square.  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the area of the square.  

**Current Goal**: Determine the geometric relationship between the inscribed circle and the square.

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the geometric relationship between the circle and the square. Since the circle is inscribed in the square and the square has sides parallel to the x-axis, the circle touches all four sides of the square. The side length of the square must equal the diameter of the circle, as the circle's diameter spans the square's width (or height).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The circle has radius \( r = 2\sqrt{5} \). The diameter of the circle is:  
\[ \text{Diameter} = 2r = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5} \]

Since the circle is inscribed in the square and the square has sides parallel to the x-axis, the circle touches the square at four points (e.g., top, bottom, left, right). The distance between opposite sides of the square (e.g., top and bottom) equals the circle's diameter. Thus, the side length of the square is:  
\[ s = \text{Diameter} = 4\sqrt{5} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the side length of the square. Verify that the side length \( s = 4\sqrt{5} \) is consistent with the circle being inscribed in the square by checking the geometric constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
For a circle inscribed in a square with sides parallel to the x-axis, the circle's diameter must equal the square's side length. The circle with center \((3, -1)\) and radius \(2\sqrt{5}\) has a diameter of \(4\sqrt{5}\). Imagine the square with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_1 + s, y_1)\), \((x_1, y_1 + s)\), and \((x_1 + s, y_1 + s)\). The circle touches the square at points like \((3, -1 + 2\sqrt{5})\) (top), \((3, -1 - 2\sqrt{5})\) (bottom), \((3 + 2\sqrt{5}, -1)\) (right), and \((3 - 2\sqrt{5}, -1)\) (left). The vertical distance between the top and bottom points is:  
\[ (-1 + 2\sqrt{5}) - (-1 - 2\sqrt{5}) = 2\sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5} \]  
Similarly, the horizontal distance between left and right points is \(4\sqrt{5}\). This confirms the side length \( s = 4\sqrt{5} \).

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the area of the square. Using the side length \( s = 4\sqrt{5} \), calculate the area as \( s^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The side length of the square is \( s = 4\sqrt{5} \). The area of the square is:  
\[ \text{Area} = s^2 = (4\sqrt{5})^2 = 16 \cdot 5 = 80 \]
