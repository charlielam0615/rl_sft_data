### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the minimum value of the quadratic function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of function and its properties (e.g., quadratic, opens upward/downward).  
2. Determine the vertex of the parabola, as the vertex gives the minimum for a parabola opening upward.  
3. Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the vertex formula or calculus.  
4. Verify the result by checking the function's behavior or computing the minimum value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of function and its properties. Achieve this by analyzing the quadratic function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \), noting its coefficients and determining whether it opens upward or downward.

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 3 \). Since \( a = 2 > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, indicating that the vertex represents the minimum point.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \). Achieve this by using the vertex formula for a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \), we have \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -12 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-12}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]  
Thus, the x-coordinate of the vertex is \( x = 3 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( x = 3 \) gives the minimum value of \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \). Achieve this by computing the function value at \( x = 3 \) and optionally checking values around \( x = 3 \) to confirm the minimum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \):  
\[ f(3) = 2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 3 = 2 \cdot 9 - 36 + 3 = 18 - 36 + 3 = -15 \]  
To confirm, test nearby points, e.g., \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 4 \):  
- At \( x = 2 \): \( f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 12(2) + 3 = 8 - 24 + 3 = -13 \)  
- At \( x = 4 \): \( f(4) = 2(4)^2 - 12(4) + 3 = 32 - 48 + 3 = -13 \)  
Since \( f(2) = -13 > -15 \) and \( f(4) = -13 > -15 \), the function value at \( x = 3 \) is lower, confirming \( x = 3 \) gives the minimum.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of function and its properties (completed: quadratic, opens upward).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the vertex of the parabola (completed: vertex at \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex (completed: \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the result (completed: minimum at \( x = 3 \), \( f(3) = -15 \)).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) that gives the minimum value of \( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \) is \( x = 3 \).
