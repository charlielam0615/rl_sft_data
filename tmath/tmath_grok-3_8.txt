**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the value of \( x \) that gives the minimum value of the quadratic function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of function and its properties.  
2. Determine the method to find the minimum point (e.g., vertex of a parabola or calculus).  
3. Calculate the \( x \)-value of the minimum.  
4. Verify the result.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of function and its properties. Since \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \) is a quadratic function, recognize that it is a parabola. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) (2) is positive, so the parabola opens upward, indicating a minimum at the vertex. The vertex can be found using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are coefficients from the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c \).

[IMP]  
The function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \) is a quadratic function in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 3 \). Since \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, confirming that the vertex represents the minimum point. The vertexâ€™s \( x \)-coordinate is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the \( x \)-value of the minimum using the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Substitute \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -12 \) into the formula and compute the result.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \):  
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = -12 \).  
- \( x = -\frac{-12}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \).  
Thus, the \( x \)-value of the minimum is \( x = 3 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that \( x = 3 \) gives the minimum value. This can be done by computing the second derivative to confirm a local minimum or by evaluating the function at \( x = 3 \) and nearby points to check if the value is indeed the smallest.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, use the second derivative test:  
- Compute the first derivative: \( f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 - 12x + 3) = 4x - 12 \).  
- Set \( f'(x) = 0 \): \( 4x - 12 = 0 \implies x = 3 \), confirming the critical point.  
- Compute the second derivative: \( f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(4x - 12) = 4 \).  
- Since \( f''(3) = 4 > 0 \), the function has a local minimum at \( x = 3 \).  

Alternatively, evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \) and nearby points:  
- At \( x = 3 \): \( f(3) = 2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 3 = 2 \cdot 9 - 36 + 3 = 18 - 36 + 3 = -15 \).  
- At \( x = 2 \): \( f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 12(2) + 3 = 8 - 24 + 3 = -13 \).  
- At \( x = 4 \): \( f(4) = 2(4)^2 - 12(4) + 3 = 32 - 48 + 3 = -13 \).  
Since \( f(3) = -15 \) is less than \( f(2) = -13 \) and \( f(4) = -13 \), \( x = 3 \) yields the minimum value.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the function as a quadratic with a minimum at the vertex (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the vertex using \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) (completed, \( x = 3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the minimum (completed via second derivative test and function evaluation).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution as the verification is complete.  
The value \( x = 3 \) has been calculated and verified as the point where the function achieves its minimum value.

**Final Answer**: The value of \( x \) that gives the minimum value of \( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \) is \( x = 3 \).
