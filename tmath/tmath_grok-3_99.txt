### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the expression under the fourth root using exponent rules.  
2. Simplify the expression to separate factors that can be taken out of the fourth root.  
3. Express the result in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\).  
4. Compute \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the expression \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\) using exponent rules.  
How to Achieve: Use the property of roots that \(\sqrt[4]{x} = x^{1/4}\) and the product rule for exponents to express the radicand as a single expression under the fourth root.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\). Using the property of roots, we can write:  
\[
\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3} = (2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{1/4}.
\]  
Applying the exponent rule \((x \cdot y)^n = x^n \cdot y^n\), this becomes:  
\[
(2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{1/4} = (2^7)^{1/4} \cdot (3^3)^{1/4}.
\]  
Using the rule \((x^m)^n = x^{m \cdot n}\), we get:  
\[
(2^7)^{1/4} = 2^{7/4}, \quad (3^3)^{1/4} = 3^{3/4}.
\]  
Thus, the expression is:  
\[
2^{7/4} \cdot 3^{3/4}.
\]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify \(2^{7/4} \cdot 3^{3/4}\) to separate factors that can be taken out of the fourth root.  
How to Achieve: Split the exponents into integer and fractional parts to identify terms that can be removed from the fourth root, using the fact that \(x^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{x^m}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \(2^{7/4}\), express the exponent:  
\[
\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{3}{4}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
2^{7/4} = 2^{4/4 + 3/4} = 2^{4/4} \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^1 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}.
\]  
Since \(2^{3/4} = \sqrt[4]{2^3}\), we have:  
\[
2^{7/4} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3}.
\]  
For \(3^{3/4}\), the exponent is already in the form:  
\[
3^{3/4} = \sqrt[4]{3^3}.
\]  
Combine the terms:  
\[
2^{7/4} \cdot 3^{3/4} = (2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3}) \cdot \sqrt[4]{3^3}.
\]  
Using the property \(\sqrt[4]{x} \cdot \sqrt[4]{y} = \sqrt[4]{x \cdot y}\), the expression becomes:  
\[
2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3^3} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3 \cdot 3^3}.
\]  
So, we have:  
\[
2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3 \cdot 3^3}.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check if \(2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3 \cdot 3^3}\) is in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\) and fully simplified.  
How to Achieve: Verify that the radicand \(2^3 \cdot 3^3\) has no factors that are perfect fourth powers, and confirm that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The expression is \(2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3 \cdot 3^3}\). Compute the radicand:  
\[
2^3 \cdot 3^3 = 8 \cdot 27 = 216.
\]  
Check if 216 contains factors that are perfect fourth powers:  
- Prime factorization of 216:  
\[
216 = 2^3 \cdot 3^3.
\]  
- A perfect fourth power has exponents divisible by 4. Here, the exponents are 3 for both 2 and 3, which are not divisible by 4. Thus, no factors of \(2^3 \cdot 3^3\) are perfect fourth powers.  
The expression is in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\), where:  
\[
a = 2, \quad b = 2^3 \cdot 3^3 = 216.
\]  
Both \(a = 2\) and \(b = 216\) are positive integers, and the radicand cannot be simplified further.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).  
How to Achieve: Use the values \(a = 2\) and \(b = 216\) to calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
\[
a + b = 2 + 216 = 218.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\) into the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\) and compute \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the expression using exponent rules (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify to separate factors outside the fourth root (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(a + b\) (completed).  
Current Goal: The main goal is completed, with the result \(a + b = 218\).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:  
\[
a + b = 218
\]
