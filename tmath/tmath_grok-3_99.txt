**Problem Restatement**: We need to simplify the expression \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\) into the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, and then find the value of \(a + b\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the expression inside the fourth root using exponent rules.  
2. Simplify the expression by applying the fourth root.  
3. Express the result in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\).  
4. Identify \(a\) and \(b\), and compute \(a + b\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Rewrite the expression \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\) using exponent rules.  
How to Achieve: Express the fourth root as a fractional exponent and combine the terms inside the root using the property of exponents.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The fourth root is equivalent to raising to the power of \(\frac{1}{4}\). Thus:  
\[
\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3} = (2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}}.
\]  
Using the exponent rule \((x \cdot y)^n = x^n \cdot y^n\), we get:  
\[
(2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = (2^7)^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot (3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}}.
\]  
Apply the rule \((x^m)^n = x^{m \cdot n}\):  
\[
(2^7)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{7 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{7}{4}}, \quad (3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{3 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = 3^{\frac{3}{4}}.
\]  
So, the expression becomes:  
\[
2^{\frac{7}{4}} \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{4}}.
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Simplify \(2^{\frac{7}{4}} \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{4}}\) to the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\).  
How to Achieve: Split the exponents into integer and fractional parts, express fractional parts as fourth roots, and combine terms to match the required form.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Rewrite the exponents:  
- For \(2^{\frac{7}{4}}\):  
  \[
  \frac{7}{4} = 1 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{3}{4}.
  \]  
  So,  
  \[
  2^{\frac{7}{4}} = 2^{\frac{4}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = 2^1 \cdot 2^{\frac{3}{4}} = 2 \cdot (2^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}.
  \]  
- For \(3^{\frac{3}{4}}\):  
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
  \]  
  So,  
  \[
  3^{\frac{3}{4}} = (3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{3^3} = \sqrt[4]{27}.
  \]  

Combine the terms:  
\[
2^{\frac{7}{4}} \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{4}} = (2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}) \cdot \sqrt[4]{27}.
\]  
Since the bases of the fourth roots are different, combine the radicands:  
\[
\sqrt[4]{8} \cdot \sqrt[4]{27} = \sqrt[4]{8 \cdot 27}.
\]  
Calculate \(8 \cdot 27\):  
\[
8 \cdot 27 = 216.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8} \cdot \sqrt[4]{27} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{216}.
\]  
So, the expression is:  
\[
2 \sqrt[4]{216}.
\]  
This is in the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\), with \(a = 2\) and \(b = 216\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify that \(2 \sqrt[4]{216}\) is fully simplified and matches the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\).  
How to Achieve: Check if \(b = 216\) can be simplified further (e.g., by factoring out perfect fourth powers) and confirm \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Factorize \(216\) to check for perfect fourth powers:  
\[
216 = 2^3 \cdot 3^3.
\]  
Check for fourth powers:  
- \(2^3 = 2^{3}\), not a fourth power (need \(2^4 = 16\)).  
- \(3^3 = 3^{3}\), not a fourth power (need \(3^4 = 81\)).  
- Combinations like \((2^2)^4 = 16\), \((3^2)^4 = 6561\), etc., do not divide \(216\).  

Since no perfect fourth powers (other than \(1\)) can be factored out, \(\sqrt[4]{216}\) is in its simplest form.  
Confirm:  
- \(a = 2\), a positive integer.  
- \(b = 216\), a positive integer.  
- The expression \(2 \sqrt[4]{216}\) matches \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\).  

The simplification is valid.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
Track Goals: Update and list the hierarchy of goals, reflecting the current state, and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Simplify \(\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3}\) into \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\) and find \(a + b\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the expression using exponent rules (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Simplify the expression to the form \(a \sqrt[4]{b}\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the simplification (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(a + b\) (current goal).  

Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute \(a + b\) using the simplified expression \(2 \sqrt[4]{216}\).  
How to Achieve: Identify \(a = 2\), \(b = 216\), and calculate their sum.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the simplified expression \(2 \sqrt[4]{216}\):  
- \(a = 2\).  
- \(b = 216\).  

Calculate:  
\[
a + b = 2 + 216 = 218.
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Validate the final answer \(a + b = 218\).  
How to Achieve: Recompute the simplification and sum to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute:  
\[
\sqrt[4]{2^7 \cdot 3^3} = (2^7 \cdot 3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{7}{4}} \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{4}}.
\]  
- \(2^{\frac{7}{4}} = 2^1 \cdot 2^{\frac{3}{4}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}\).  
- \(3^{\frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{3^3} = \sqrt[4]{27}\).  
- Combine: \(2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8} \cdot \sqrt[4]{27} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8 \cdot 27} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{216}\).  

So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 216\).  
Recalculate:  
\[
a + b = 2 + 216 = 218.
\]  
The result is consistent. To further confirm, consider an alternative approach:  
Factor \(2^7 \cdot 3^3 = 2^4 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 3^3\).  
\[
\sqrt[4]{2^4 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 3^3} = (2^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot (2^3 \cdot 3^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{2^3 \cdot 3^3} = 2 \cdot \sqrt[4]{216}.
\]  
This confirms \(a = 2\), \(b = 216\), and \(a + b = 218\).  
The answer is correct.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: \(a + b = 218\).
