### Problem Statement
We need to find the least possible value of the function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To find the least possible value of the quadratic function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the type of function and its properties.
2. Determine the critical point (vertex) of the function, as the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex if the parabola opens upward.
3. Calculate the y-value at the vertex to find the least possible value.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the type of function and its properties.
How to Achieve: Analyze the given function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) to confirm it is a quadratic function, determine the coefficient of \( x^2 \) to check if the parabola opens upward or downward, and verify that the minimum value can be found at the vertex.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = 21 \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (\( a = 1 \)) is positive, the parabola opens upward, indicating that the vertex represents the minimum point of the function.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the x-coordinate of the vertex.
How to Achieve: Use the vertex formula for a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Substitute the values of \( a \) and \( b \) to compute the x-coordinate.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 10 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:
\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{10}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{10}{2} = -5
\]
The vertex occurs at \( x = -5 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Calculate the y-value at the vertex to find the least possible value.
How to Achieve: Substitute \( x = -5 \) into the function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) to compute the corresponding y-value.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( x = -5 \) into the function:
\[
y = (-5)^2 + 10(-5) + 21 = 25 - 50 + 21 = 25 - 50 + 21 = -4
\]
The y-value at the vertex is \( y = -4 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the calculated y-value is the minimum.
How to Achieve: Confirm that the parabola opens upward (already established) and check the calculation by completing the square to express the function in vertex form, ensuring the vertex is at \( x = -5 \) and \( y = -4 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To verify, complete the square for \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \):
\[
y = x^2 + 10x + 21
\]
Take the coefficient of \( x \), which is 10, divide by 2 to get 5, and square it to get 25:
\[
y = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 + 21 = (x + 5)^2 - 4
\]
The vertex form \( y = (x + 5)^2 - 4 \) shows the vertex at \( x = -5 \), \( y = -4 \). Since \( (x + 5)^2 \geq 0 \), the minimum value of \( y \) occurs when \( (x + 5)^2 = 0 \), giving \( y = -4 \). This confirms the earlier calculation.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the least possible value of \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \).
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of function and its properties (completed: quadratic, opens upward).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the x-coordinate of the vertex (completed: \( x = -5 \)).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the y-value at the vertex (completed: \( y = -4 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the minimum value (completed: confirmed via completing the square).
Current Goal: Conclude the solution as all subgoals are completed.
The least possible value of \( y \) is \( -4 \), achieved at \( x = -5 \).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The least possible value of \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) is \( -4 \).
