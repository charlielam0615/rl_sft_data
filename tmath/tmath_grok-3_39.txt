**Problem Restatement**: Find the least possible value of the function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To find the least possible value of the quadratic function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of function and its properties.  
2. Determine the vertex of the quadratic function, as it gives the minimum value for a parabola opening upward.  
3. Calculate the y-value at the vertex.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of function and its properties. Since \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) is a quadratic function, check the coefficient of \( x^2 \) to determine if the parabola opens upward or downward, confirming whether the vertex is a minimum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The function \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = 21 \). Since \( a = 1 > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, meaning the vertex represents the minimum value of \( y \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the vertex of the quadratic function. For a quadratic \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Compute this and then find the corresponding y-value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \). The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{10}{2 \cdot 1} = -5 \]  
Now, substitute \( x = -5 \) into the function to find the y-value:  
\[ y = (-5)^2 + 10(-5) + 21 = 25 - 50 + 21 = -4 \]  
The vertex is at \( (-5, -4) \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the vertex calculation and confirm it gives the least possible value. Verify the computation by completing the square to express the function in vertex form and check the y-value.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Complete the square for \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \):  
\[ y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \]  
\[ y = (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 + 21 \]  
\[ y = (x + 5)^2 - 4 \]  
The vertex form confirms the vertex at \( x = -5 \), \( y = -4 \). Since the term \( (x + 5)^2 \geq 0 \), the minimum value of \( y \) occurs when \( (x + 5)^2 = 0 \), yielding \( y = -4 \). This matches the previous calculation.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the least possible value of \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the type of function and its properties (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the vertex of the quadratic function (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the y-value at the vertex (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the vertex calculation (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution by stating the least possible value of \( y \).  
The least possible value of \( y \), based on the vertex calculation and validation, is \( -4 \).

**Final Answer**: The least possible value of \( y = x^2 + 10x + 21 \) is \( -4 \).
