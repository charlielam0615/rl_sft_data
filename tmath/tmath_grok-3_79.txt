**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rationalize the denominator of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}}\).  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate square roots. Since the denominator is a sum of three square roots, we need to find an expression (likely involving conjugates) that rationalizes it, possibly by pairing terms and applying the difference of squares.

To rationalize \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}}\), consider the denominator \(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}\). A direct conjugate is complex due to three terms, so let’s try to simplify by grouping. Let’s denote the denominator as \(x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}\). We aim to make the denominator rational.

One approach is to pair terms, e.g., \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{7}\). Let’s try multiplying by a form that might simplify. A possible conjugate could involve adjusting the signs, such as \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) - \sqrt{7}\) or other combinations. Let’s test rationalizing by considering the structure of the denominator.

Instead, let’s try to manipulate the expression by multiplying numerator and denominator by a term that simplifies the denominator. A known strategy for sums of square roots is to use a conjugate-like expression. Let’s hypothesize the denominator can be rationalized by multiplying by an expression like \((\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) - \sqrt{2}\) or a product of conjugates.

Try multiplying by \((\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) - \sqrt{2}\):  
Denominator becomes:  
\[(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})((\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) - \sqrt{2})\]  
Compute:  
\[ = (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2})\]  
\[ = (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) - (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{2})\]  
First part:  
\[(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) = \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{3}\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3}\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7}\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}\sqrt{7}\]  
\[ = \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{14} + 3 + \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} + 7 = \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{14} + 2\sqrt{21} + 10\]  
Second part:  
\[(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{2}) = 2 + \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{14}\]  
So:  
\[(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{14} + 2\sqrt{21} + 10) - (2 + \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{14}) = 2\sqrt{21} + 8\]  
The denominator is \(2\sqrt{21} + 8\), which is not rational. This suggests the conjugate choice may need adjustment.

Let’s try a different approach by considering the product of conjugates. Define \(a = \sqrt{2}\), \(b = \sqrt{3}\), \(c = \sqrt{7}\), so the denominator is \(a + b + c\). We need \((a + b + c)(x) = \text{rational}\). Let’s try multiplying by \((b + c) - a = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2}\):  
Denominator:  
\[(a + b + c)((b + c) - a) = (b + c)^2 - a^2 = (b^2 + 2bc + c^2) - a^2 = 3 + 2\sqrt{21} + 7 - 2 = 8 + 2\sqrt{21}\]  
Numerator: \(1 \cdot (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2}\).  
So:  
\[\frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2}}{8 + 2\sqrt{21}}\]  
The denominator still has \(\sqrt{21}\). Let’s rationalize further by multiplying by the conjugate of \(8 + 2\sqrt{21}\), which is \(8 - 2\sqrt{21}\):  
Denominator:  
\[(8 + 2\sqrt{21})(8 - 2\sqrt{21}) = 8^2 - (2\sqrt{21})^2 = 64 - 4 \cdot 21 = 64 - 84 = -20\]  
Since \(F\) must be positive, use \(-20 \cdot (-1) = 20\), adjusting the numerator by \(-1\).  
Numerator:  
\[(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2})(8 - 2\sqrt{21}) = \sqrt{3} \cdot 8 + \sqrt{7} \cdot 8 - \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 2\sqrt{21} - \sqrt{7} \cdot 2\sqrt{21} + \sqrt{2} \cdot 2\sqrt{21}\]  
\[ = 8\sqrt{3} + 8\sqrt{7} - 8\sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{63} - 2\sqrt{147} + 2\sqrt{42}\]  
Since \(\sqrt{63} = 3\sqrt{7}\), \(\sqrt{147} = \sqrt{49 \cdot 3} = 7\sqrt{3}\), \(\sqrt{42} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{6}\sqrt{7}\), we get:  
\[-2\sqrt{63} = -6\sqrt{7}\], \[-2\sqrt{147} = -14\sqrt{3}\], \[+2\sqrt{42} = 2\sqrt{6}\sqrt{7}\]  
Combine:  
\[-8\sqrt{2} + (8\sqrt{3} - 14\sqrt{3}) + (8\sqrt{7} - 6\sqrt{7}) + 2\sqrt{6}\sqrt{7} = -8\sqrt{2} - 6\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{42}\]  
Adjust for \(-1\):  
\[-( -8\sqrt{2} - 6\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{42} ) = 8\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{42}\]  
So:  
\[\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{42}}{20}\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the denominator is rational and the expression is in the required form.  
**How to Achieve**: Multiply the original denominator by the expressions used to check if we obtain a rational number, and ensure the numerator matches the form \(A\sqrt{2} + B\sqrt{3} + C\sqrt{7} + D\sqrt{E}\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the denominator:  
\[(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2})(8 - 2\sqrt{21})\]  
From Step 2:  
\[(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{2}) = 8 + 2\sqrt{21}\]  
Then:  
\[(8 + 2\sqrt{21})(8 - 2\sqrt{21}) = -20\]  
Adjusting by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(-1\), we get denominator \(20\), which is rational and positive.  
Numerator form: \(8\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{42}\). Here, \(\sqrt{42} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 7}\), which is in simplest radical form (\(E = 42\)). The fraction is:  
\[\frac{8\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{42}}{20}\]  
Check GCD of coefficients and denominator: 8, 6, 2, 2, and 20 have GCD 2. Dividing through:  
\[\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{42}}{10}\]  
Verify GCD again: 4, 3, 1, 1, 10 have GCD 1, so the fraction is in lowest terms.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Rationalize the denominator and compute \(A + B + C + D + E + F\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rationalize the denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Express in the form \(\frac{A\sqrt{2} + B\sqrt{3} + C\sqrt{7} + D\sqrt{E}}{F}\) (completed: \(A=4\), \(B=3\), \(C=-1\), \(D=-1\), \(E=42\), \(F=10\)).

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Compute \(A + B + C + D + E + F\).  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the coefficients from the expression \(\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{42}}{10}\), assign \(E\) as the number under the radical, and sum the values.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the expression:  
- \(A = 4\)  
- \(B = 3\)  
- \(C = -1\) (coefficient of \(\sqrt{7}\))  
- \(D = -1\) (coefficient of \(\sqrt{42}\))  
- \(E = 42\) (since \(\sqrt{42}\), and 42 is the number under the radical)  
- \(F = 10\)  
Compute:  
\[A + B + C + D + E + F = 4 + 3 + (-1) + (-1) + 42 + 10 = 4 + 3 - 1 - 1 + 42 + 10 = 57\]
