**Problem Restatement**: Find the value of \( c \) in the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \), given that the parabola passes through the points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( c \).  
- Subgoal 1: Use the given points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \) to create equations by substituting into \( y = x^2 + bx + c \).  
- Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to determine \( b \) and \( c \).  
- Subgoal 3: Isolate \( c \) as the final answer.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Create equations using the points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 2, y = 3 \) and \( x = 4, y = 3 \) into the parabola equation to form two equations in terms of \( b \) and \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Substitute \( (2, 3) \):  
\( 3 = 2^2 + b(2) + c \)  
\( 3 = 4 + 2b + c \)  
Equation 1: \( 2b + c = -1 \).

Substitute \( (4, 3) \):  
\( 3 = 4^2 + b(4) + c \)  
\( 3 = 16 + 4b + c \)  
Equation 2: \( 4b + c = -13 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( b \) and \( c \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the equations \( 2b + c = -1 \) and \( 4b + c = -13 \) to eliminate one variable and solve for the other, then find \( c \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
System of equations:  
1. \( 2b + c = -1 \)  
2. \( 4b + c = -13 \)

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( c \):  
\( (4b + c) - (2b + c) = -13 - (-1) \)  
\( 2b = -12 \)  
\( b = -6 \).

Substitute \( b = -6 \) into Equation 1:  
\( 2(-6) + c = -1 \)  
\( -12 + c = -1 \)  
\( c = 11 \).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if \( c = 11 \) (and \( b = -6 \)) satisfies the original conditions.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( b = -6 \) and \( c = 11 \) into the parabola equation and confirm it passes through \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Parabola equation: \( y = x^2 - 6x + 11 \).  
Check \( (2, 3) \):  
\( y = 2^2 - 6(2) + 11 = 4 - 12 + 11 = 3 \).  
Satisfies.

Check \( (4, 3) \):  
\( y = 4^2 - 6(4) + 11 = 16 - 24 + 11 = 3 \).  
Satisfies.

The solution is valid.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.
