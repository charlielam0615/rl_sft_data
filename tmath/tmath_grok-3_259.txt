### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( c \) in the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \), given that the parabola passes through the points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding \( c \) into intermediate subgoals. Since the parabola passes through the given points, we can substitute the coordinates into the equation to form a system of equations. Solving this system will help determine \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up equations using the given points. Achieve this by substituting \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \) into the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \) to create two equations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Substitute \( (2, 3) \):  
\( 3 = 2^2 + b \cdot 2 + c \)  
\( 3 = 4 + 2b + c \)  
Equation 1: \( 2b + c = -1 \)

Substitute \( (4, 3) \):  
\( 3 = 4^2 + b \cdot 4 + c \)  
\( 3 = 16 + 4b + c \)  
Equation 2: \( 4b + c = -13 \)
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the system of equations from the previous step to find \( c \). Achieve this by eliminating one variable (e.g., \( c \)) through subtraction and solving for the remaining variable, then substituting back to find \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
System of equations:  
1. \( 2b + c = -1 \)  
2. \( 4b + c = -13 \)

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( c \):  
\( (4b + c) - (2b + c) = -13 - (-1) \)  
\( 4b + c - 2b - c = -13 + 1 \)  
\( 2b = -12 \)  
\( b = -6 \)

Substitute \( b = -6 \) into Equation 1:  
\( 2(-6) + c = -1 \)  
\( -12 + c = -1 \)  
\( c = -1 + 12 \)  
\( c = 11 \)
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( c = 11 \) (with \( b = -6 \)) by checking if the parabola \( y = x^2 - 6x + 11 \) passes through both points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check \( (2, 3) \):  
\( y = 2^2 - 6 \cdot 2 + 11 = 4 - 12 + 11 = 3 \)  
Satisfies the point.

Check \( (4, 3) \):  
\( y = 4^2 - 6 \cdot 4 + 11 = 16 - 24 + 11 = 3 \)  
Satisfies the point.

Both points are satisfied, so the solution is valid.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal, which is to confirm the final value of \( c \).
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find \( c \) in the parabola equation \( y = x^2 + bx + c \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Set up equations using the points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the system of equations to find \( b \) and \( c \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the solution by substituting back into the equation.  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final value of \( c \), which is \( c = 11 \).  
The solution has been computed and validated, completing the main goal.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The value of \( c \) is \( 11 \).
