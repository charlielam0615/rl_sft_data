### Problem Restatement
We need to find all values of \( c \) that satisfy the compound inequality:
\[
\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c).
\]
The solution should be expressed in interval notation, with any fractions simplified.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the compound inequality into two separate inequalities to solve them individually, then find their intersection:
1. \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\)
2. \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\)
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the first inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\). This will be achieved by isolating \( c \) through algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\):
- Subtract \( c \) from both sides:
  \[
  \frac{c}{3} - c \leq 2
  \]
- Rewrite \( c \) as \(\frac{3c}{3}\):
  \[
  \frac{c}{3} - \frac{3c}{3} \leq 2
  \]
- Combine terms:
  \[
  \frac{c - 3c}{3} = \frac{-2c}{3} \leq 2
  \]
- Multiply both sides by 3 (since 3 is positive, the inequality direction remains):
  \[
  -2c \leq 6
  \]
- Divide by \(-2\) (since \(-2\) is negative, reverse the inequality):
  \[
  c \geq -3
  \]
So, the solution to the first inequality is \( c \geq -3 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the second inequality \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\). This will be achieved by isolating \( c \) through algebraic manipulation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To solve \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\):
- Distribute on the right:
  \[
  2 + c < -2 - 2c
  \]
- Add \( 2c \) to both sides:
  \[
  2 + c + 2c < -2
  \]
  \[
  2 + 3c < -2
  \]
- Subtract 2 from both sides:
  \[
  3c < -4
  \]
- Divide by 3:
  \[
  c < -\frac{4}{3}
  \]
So, the solution to the second inequality is \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Solve the compound inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) and express the solution in interval notation.
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\). (Completed: \( c \geq -3 \))
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\). (Completed: \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \))
  - Subgoal 3: Find the intersection of the solutions and express in interval notation. (Current goal)

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the intersection of \( c \geq -3 \) and \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \) and express the result in interval notation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The solutions are:
- From the first inequality: \( c \geq -3 \)
- From the second inequality: \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \)

Combine these:
\[
-3 \leq c < -\frac{4}{3}
\]
In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)
\]
The fraction \(-\frac{4}{3}\) is already simplified.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \(\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\) by testing boundary and intermediate values in the original compound inequality.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test values in \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\):
- **Boundary: \( c = -3 \)**  
  Left: \(\frac{-3}{3} = -1\), Right: \(2 + (-3) = -1\), Check: \(-1 \leq -1\) (True)  
  Right side: \(-2(1 + (-3)) = -2(-2) = 4\), Check: \(-1 < 4\) (True)  
  Satisfies both.
- **Boundary: \( c = -\frac{4}{3} \)**  
  Left: \(\frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{3} = -\frac{4}{9} \approx -0.444\), Right: \(2 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\), Check: \(-0.444 \leq 0.667\) (True)  
  Right side: \(-2\left(1 - \frac{4}{3}\right) = -2\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\), Check: \(\frac{2}{3} < \frac{2}{3}\) (False, since strict inequality)  
  Does not satisfy the strict inequality.
- **Inside: \( c = -2 \)**  
  Left: \(\frac{-2}{3} \approx -0.667\), Right: \(2 - 2 = 0\), Check: \(-0.667 \leq 0\) (True)  
  Right side: \(-2(1 - 2) = -2(-1) = 2\), Check: \(0 < 2\) (True)  
  Satisfies both.
- **Outside: \( c = -1 \)**  
  Left: \(\frac{-1}{3} \approx -0.333\), Right: \(2 - 1 = 1\), Check: \(-0.333 \leq 1\) (True)  
  Right side: \(-2(1 - 1) = 0\), Check: \(1 < 0\) (False)  
  Does not satisfy.

The solution \( c \in \left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right) \) is consistent.

### Final Answer
The values of \( c \) that satisfy the inequality are:
\[
\boxed{\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)}
\]
