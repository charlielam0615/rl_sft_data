### Problem Restatement
We need to find all values of \( c \) that satisfy the compound inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\). The solution should be expressed in interval notation, with any fractions simplified.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the compound inequality:  
1. Solve the left inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\).  
2. Solve the right inequality \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\).  
3. Find the intersection of the solutions to both inequalities.  
4. Express the final solution in interval notation with simplified fractions.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the left inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\). To achieve this, isolate \( c \) on one side by performing algebraic manipulations, ensuring all steps maintain the inequality's direction.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\):  
- Subtract \( c \) from both sides:  
  \(\frac{c}{3} - c \leq 2\).  
- Rewrite \( c \) as \(\frac{3c}{3}\):  
  \(\frac{c}{3} - \frac{3c}{3} \leq 2\).  
- Combine:  
  \(\frac{c - 3c}{3} = \frac{-2c}{3} \leq 2\).  
- Multiply both sides by 3 (positive, so the inequality direction remains):  
  \(-2c \leq 6\).  
- Divide by \(-2\) (negative, so reverse the inequality):  
  \( c \geq -3 \).  
Thus, the solution to the left inequality is \( c \geq -3 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the right inequality \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\). To achieve this, isolate \( c \) on one side using algebraic manipulations, preserving the strict inequality.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Solve \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\):  
- Distribute on the right:  
  \(2 + c < -2 - 2c\).  
- Add \( 2c \) to both sides:  
  \(2 + c + 2c < -2\).  
  \(2 + 3c < -2\).  
- Subtract 2 from both sides:  
  \(3c < -4\).  
- Divide by 3:  
  \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \).  
Thus, the solution to the right inequality is \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal:  
- Main goal: Find all \( c \) satisfying \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\) (completed: \( c \geq -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) (completed: \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \)).  
  - **Current subgoal**: Find the intersection of \( c \geq -3 \) and \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The solutions from previous steps are:  
- From Step 2: \( c \geq -3 \).  
- From Step 3: \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \).  
The current goal is to combine these to find the values of \( c \) that satisfy both inequalities simultaneously.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the intersection of \( c \geq -3 \) and \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \). To achieve this, combine the two inequalities and express the result in interval notation, ensuring fractions are simplified.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Combine the inequalities:  
- \( c \geq -3 \) means \( c \) is at least \(-3\).  
- \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \) means \( c \) is strictly less than \(-\frac{4}{3}\).  
- Since \(-\frac{4}{3} \approx -1.333\), which is greater than \(-3\), the intersection is:  
  \( c \geq -3 \) and \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \), or equivalently, \(-3 \leq c < -\frac{4}{3}\).  
In interval notation, this is:  
\[ \left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right) \].  
The fraction \(-\frac{4}{3}\) is already in its simplest form (numerator and denominator have no common factors).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \(\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\) by testing values inside, outside, and at the boundaries of the interval to ensure the compound inequality holds.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test values in the compound inequality \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\):  
- **Inside the interval**: Choose \( c = -2 \) (since \(-3 \leq -2 < -\frac{4}{3}\)).  
  - Left: \(\frac{-2}{3} = -\frac{2}{3} \approx -0.667\), and \(2 + (-2) = 0\). Check: \(-0.667 \leq 0\) (true).  
  - Right: \(2 + (-2) = 0\), and \(-2(1 + (-2)) = -2(-1) = 2\). Check: \(0 < 2\) (true).  
  - Satisfied.  
- **Boundary**: Choose \( c = -3 \).  
  - Left: \(\frac{-3}{3} = -1\), and \(2 + (-3) = -1\). Check: \(-1 \leq -1\) (true).  
  - Right: \(2 + (-3) = -1\), and \(-2(1 + (-3)) = -2(-2) = 4\). Check: \(-1 < 4\) (true).  
  - Satisfied (since \(\leq\) allows equality on the left).  
- **Boundary**: Choose \( c = -\frac{4}{3} \).  
  - Left: \(\frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{3} = -\frac{4}{9} \approx -0.444\), and \(2 + \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = 2 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\). Check: \(-0.444 \leq 0.667\) (true).  
  - Right: \(2 + \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}\), and \(-2\left(1 + \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)\right) = -2\left(1 - \frac{4}{3}\right) = -2\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}\). Check: \(\frac{2}{3} < \frac{2}{3}\) (false, since strict inequality).  
  - Not satisfied (expected, since \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \)).  
- **Outside**: Choose \( c = 0 \).  
  - Left: \(\frac{0}{3} = 0\), and \(2 + 0 = 2\). Check: \(0 \leq 2\) (true).  
  - Right: \(2 + 0 = 2\), and \(-2(1 + 0) = -2\). Check: \(2 < -2\) (false).  
  - Not satisfied.  
The solution \(\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\) holds, as values within the interval satisfy both inequalities, and boundary/outer values behave as expected.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm completion:  
- Main goal: Find all \( c \) satisfying \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) in interval notation.  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c\) (completed: \( c \geq -3 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve \(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) (completed: \( c < -\frac{4}{3} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the intersection (completed: \(\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: solution verified).  
  - **Current subgoal**: Confirm the final answer in interval notation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The solution \(\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\) satisfies the compound inequality, as confirmed by solving both parts and validating with test points. The fraction \(-\frac{4}{3}\) is simplified, and the interval notation is standard.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The values of \( c \) that satisfy \(\frac{c}{3} \leq 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\) are:
\[ \boxed{\left[-3, -\frac{4}{3}\right)} \]
