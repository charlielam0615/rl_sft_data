### Problem Restatement
We need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 cooks from a group of 8 people, where any of the 8 people can be selected as a cook. This is a combination problem since the order of selection does not matter.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Identify the mathematical concept for choosing 2 people from 8 without regard to order.
2. Apply the appropriate formula to calculate the number of combinations.
3. Validate the result to ensure correctness.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the mathematical concept for choosing 2 people from 8 without regard to order.
How to Achieve: Recognize that choosing 2 cooks from 8 people where order does not matter is a combination problem, represented by the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people and k is the number to choose.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the problem involves selecting 2 cooks from 8 people and the order of selection is irrelevant, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n = 8 (total people) and k = 2 (cooks to choose).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Apply the combination formula to calculate C(8, 2).
How to Achieve: Substitute n = 8 and k = 2 into the combination formula, compute the factorials, and simplify the expression to find the number of ways to choose 2 cooks.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the combination formula C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!):
- 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
- 2! = 2 × 1 = 2
- (8-2)! = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
- C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! × 6!) = (8 × 7 × 6!) / (2 × 1 × 6!)
- The 6! terms cancel out, leaving (8 × 7) / (2 × 1) = 56 / 2 = 28.
Thus, there are 28 ways to choose 2 cooks from 8 people.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the result to ensure correctness.
How to Achieve: Recalculate C(8, 2) using an alternative method, such as listing a few combinations or using the simplified combination formula, and check if the result matches.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, use the simplified combination formula for C(n, k) = (n × (n-1)) / (k × (k-1)):
- For C(8, 2): (8 × 7) / (2 × 1) = 56 / 2 = 28.
This matches the previous result. Alternatively, consider that C(8, 2) represents choosing 2 people from 8, which can be cross-checked with known combination values or a binomial coefficient table, confirming 28 is correct.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 cooks from 8 people.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the mathematical concept (combination) — Completed.
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the combination formula — Completed.
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result — Completed.
Current Goal: The main goal has been achieved, as the number of ways (28) has been calculated and validated.

### Final Answer
There are 28 ways to choose 2 cooks from a group of 8 people.
