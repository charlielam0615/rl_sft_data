**Problem Restatement**: I have 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats, each available in the same 6 colors (one item of each type per color). I want to determine the number of possible outfits, where an outfit consists of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat, and I refuse to wear an outfit where all three items are the same color.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to compute the number of valid outfits.  
1. Calculate the total number of possible outfits (combinations of shirts, pants, and hats).  
2. Calculate the number of invalid outfits (where all three items are the same color).  
3. Subtract the number of invalid outfits from the total to get the number of valid outfits.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outfits. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of choices for each item type (shirts, pants, hats).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since there are 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats, the total number of possible outfits is:  
6 × 6 × 6 = 216 outfits.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of invalid outfits, where all three items (shirt, pants, and hat) are the same color. This occurs when all three items are chosen from the same color. Since there are 6 colors, we count the number of ways to choose one color for all three items.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
There are 6 colors, and for each color, there is exactly one outfit where the shirt, pants, and hat are all that color (e.g., all red, all blue, etc.). Thus, the number of invalid outfits is:  
6 (one for each color).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of valid outfits by subtracting the number of invalid outfits from the total number of outfits. This uses the results from the previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Total outfits = 216 (from Step 2).  
Invalid outfits = 6 (from Step 3).  
Valid outfits = 216 − 6 = 210.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking the logic and ensuring the subtraction accounts for all constraints. We verify that the total outfits and invalid outfits were computed correctly and that the subtraction aligns with the problem’s requirement (no outfits with all three items of the same color).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Check total outfits**: 6 shirts × 6 pants × 6 hats = 6³ = 216, which is correct.  
- **Check invalid outfits**: There are 6 colors, and for each color, there is one outfit where all items are that color (e.g., red shirt, red pants, red hat). Thus, 6 invalid outfits is correct.  
- **Check subtraction**: 216 − 6 = 210, which satisfies the condition of excluding outfits where all items are the same color.  
The calculations are consistent and align with the problem’s constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the number of valid outfits (completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total outfits (completed: 216 outfits).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate invalid outfits (completed: 6 outfits).  
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract invalid from total to get valid outfits (completed: 210 outfits).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations (completed: verified correctness).  
**Current Goal**: None, as the main goal is achieved, and validation is complete.  
The final answer is 210 valid outfits.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 210 choices for outfits where the shirt, pants, and hat are not all the same color.
