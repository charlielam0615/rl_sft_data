### Problem Restatement
I have 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats, each in the same 6 distinct colors (one item of each type per color). I want to determine the number of possible outfits (combinations of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat) where not all three items are the same color.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:
1. Calculate the total number of possible outfits without restrictions.
2. Calculate the number of outfits where all three items are the same color.
3. Subtract the number of restricted outfits from the total to get the number of valid outfits.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the total number of possible outfits without restrictions. Achieve this by multiplying the number of choices for each item type (shirts, pants, hats).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total outfits = Number of shirts × Number of pants × Number of hats = 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the number of outfits where all three items are the same color. Since each item type has one item per color, count the number of colors, as all three items must match one of the 6 colors.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are 6 colors, and for each color, there is exactly one outfit where the shirt, pants, and hat are that color. Thus, the number of outfits where all three items are the same color is 6.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to calculate the number of valid outfits by subtracting the number of outfits where all three items are the same color from the total number of outfits.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Valid outfits = Total outfits − Outfits where all items are the same color = 216 − 6 = 210.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Meta-data: The current goal is to validate the calculated number of valid outfits. Check the logic by ensuring the calculations align with the problem constraints and consider an alternative approach to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The total outfits (216) is correct since 6 × 6 × 6 = 216. The number of same-color outfits (6) is correct because there are 6 colors, and for each, only one outfit has all items matching that color. Subtraction gives 210.

To confirm, consider an alternative: For each shirt color (6 choices), select pants and hats such that not both are the same color as the shirt. However, the subtraction method is simpler and sufficient. The result satisfies the constraint that outfits where all items are the same color are excluded.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal hierarchy:
- Main goal: Calculate the number of valid outfits where not all three items are the same color.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate total outfits (completed: 216).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate outfits where all items are the same color (completed: 6).
  - Subgoal 3: Subtract to find valid outfits (completed: 210).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).

Current goal: None (problem solved).
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The number of choices for outfits where not all three items are the same color is **210**.
