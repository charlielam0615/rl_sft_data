### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation:  
1. Simplify the given equation by eliminating the fractions.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
3. Verify that the solution is a positive real number and satisfies the original equation.  
4. Ensure the solution is the only positive real number by analyzing the equation’s behavior.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Simplify the given equation by eliminating the fractions.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-multiply the fractions \(\frac{x-4}{9} = \frac{4}{x-9}\) to form a single equation without denominators, ensuring \( x \neq 9 \) to avoid division by zero.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Starting with the equation \(\frac{x-4}{9} = \frac{4}{x-9}\), cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:  
\[(x-4)(x-9) = 9 \cdot 4\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[(x-4)(x-9) = 36\]  
Expand the left-hand side:  
\[x^2 - 9x - 4x + 36 = 36\]  
\[x^2 - 13x + 36 = 36\]  
Subtract 36 from both sides:  
\[x^2 - 13x = 0\]  
Factorize:  
\[x(x - 13) = 0\]  
The solutions are:  
\[x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 13\]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the solutions \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \) in the original equation, ensuring they are positive real numbers and that no other solutions exist.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \) into the original equation \(\frac{x-4}{9} = \frac{4}{x-9}\) to verify they satisfy it, and check for domain restrictions (\( x \neq 9 \)). Analyze the equation to confirm there are no other positive real solutions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**Check \( x = 0 \)**:  
Left-hand side: \(\frac{0-4}{9} = \frac{-4}{9}\)  
Right-hand side: \(\frac{4}{0-9} = \frac{4}{-9} = -\frac{4}{9}\)  
Since \(-\frac{4}{9} = -\frac{4}{9}\), \( x = 0 \) satisfies the equation. However, \( x = 0 \) is not a positive real number, so it does not meet the problem’s requirement.  

**Check \( x = 13 \)**:  
Left-hand side: \(\frac{13-4}{9} = \frac{9}{9} = 1\)  
Right-hand side: \(\frac{4}{13-9} = \frac{4}{4} = 1\)  
Since \(1 = 1\), \( x = 13 \) satisfies the equation, and \( x = 13 \) is a positive real number.  

**Domain Check**: The denominator \( x - 9 = 0 \) when \( x = 9 \), so \( x = 9 \) is not allowed. Neither \( x = 0 \) nor \( x = 13 \) equals 9, so both are valid in terms of the domain.  

**Check for Other Solutions**: The equation \( x^2 - 13x = 0 \) is quadratic, so it has at most two roots, which are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \). Since \( x = 0 \) is not positive, \( x = 13 \) is the only positive real solution candidate. To confirm, consider the function:  
\[ f(x) = \frac{x-4}{9} - \frac{4}{x-9} \]  
We need \( f(x) = 0 \). The quadratic equation derived earlier indicates two roots, and no other real roots are possible for a quadratic. Thus, no other positive real solutions exist.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the only positive real number \( x \) that satisfies \(\frac{x-4}{9} = \frac{4}{x-9}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify the equation by eliminating fractions (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Solve the resulting equation for \( x \) (completed, solutions: \( x = 0, 13 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Verify solutions are positive and satisfy the original equation (completed, \( x = 13 \) is positive and valid, \( x = 0 \) is not positive).  
  - Subgoal 4: Ensure the solution is the only positive real number (completed, confirmed \( x = 13 \) is unique).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the solution since all subgoals are completed.

### Final Answer
The only positive real number \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\frac{x-4}{9} = \frac{4}{x-9}\) is \( x = 13 \).
