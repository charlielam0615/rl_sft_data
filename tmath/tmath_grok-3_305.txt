### Problem Statement
Find the only positive real number \( x \) that satisfies the equation:

\[
\frac{x - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{x - 9}
\]

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the equation:
1. Set up the equation by equating the given fractions.
2. Eliminate the denominators to form a simpler equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).
4. Verify that the solution is a positive real number and satisfies the original equation.
5. Ensure the solution does not make any denominator zero (i.e., check for domain restrictions).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Set up the equation and eliminate the denominators to form a simpler equation.

**How to Achieve**: Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators \( 9 \) and \( x - 9 \) to clear the fractions, ensuring \( x \neq 9 \) to avoid division by zero.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start with the given equation:

\[
\frac{x - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{x - 9}
\]

To eliminate the denominators, multiply both sides by \( 9 (x - 9) \):

\[
9 (x - 9) \cdot \frac{x - 4}{9} = 9 (x - 9) \cdot \frac{4}{x - 9}
\]

Simplify each side:

- Left side: The \( 9 \) in the numerator cancels with the \( 9 \) in the denominator:

\[
(x - 9)(x - 4)
\]

- Right side: The \( x - 9 \) in the numerator cancels with the \( x - 9 \) in the denominator:

\[
9 \cdot 4 = 36
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 9)(x - 4) = 36
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Solve the equation \( (x - 9)(x - 4) = 36 \) for \( x \).

**How to Achieve**: Expand the equation, rearrange it into standard quadratic form, and solve using the quadratic formula or factoring, if possible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expand the left-hand side:

\[
(x - 9)(x - 4) = x^2 - 4x - 9x + 36 = x^2 - 13x + 36
\]

The equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 13x + 36 = 36
\]

Subtract 36 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
x^2 - 13x + 36 - 36 = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 13x = 0
\]

Factorize:

\[
x (x - 13) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 13
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Check the validity of the solutions \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \) by substituting them back into the original equation and ensuring they are positive real numbers and do not violate domain restrictions.

**How to Achieve**: Substitute each solution into \( \frac{x - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{x - 9} \), verify equality, and check that \( x \neq 9 \) (since \( x - 9 = 0 \) would make the denominator zero).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The domain requires \( x \neq 9 \). Both \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \) satisfy this condition.

- For \( x = 0 \):

\[
\text{Left side: } \frac{0 - 4}{9} = \frac{-4}{9}
\]

\[
\text{Right side: } \frac{4}{0 - 9} = \frac{4}{-9} = -\frac{4}{9}
\]

Since \( -\frac{4}{9} = -\frac{4}{9} \), the equation holds for \( x = 0 \). However, \( x = 0 \) is not a positive real number.

- For \( x = 13 \):

\[
\text{Left side: } \frac{13 - 4}{9} = \frac{9}{9} = 1
\]

\[
\text{Right side: } \frac{4}{13 - 9} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

Since \( 1 = 1 \), the equation holds for \( x = 13 \). Also, \( x = 13 \) is a positive real number.

### Step 5: Track Goals

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**

Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
1. Solve the equation \( \frac{x - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{x - 9} \) for the only positive real number \( x \).
   - Subgoal: Set up and simplify the equation by eliminating denominators (completed).
   - Subgoal: Solve the resulting quadratic equation (completed).
   - Subgoal: Validate solutions and ensure they are positive and satisfy domain restrictions (completed).
   - Subgoal: Confirm the final solution meets all criteria (current goal).

**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( x = 13 \) is the only positive real number that satisfies the equation, and ensure no other solutions exist.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Validation

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( x = 13 \) is the only positive real solution and check for any other possible solutions.

**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the quadratic equation and consider the behavior of the original equation to ensure no other positive real solutions exist.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 13x = 0 \) yielded \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \). Since \( x = 0 \) is not positive, we focus on \( x = 13 \). To ensure no other solutions, consider the original equation’s behavior. Define the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x - 4}{9} - \frac{4}{x - 9}
\]

We need \( f(x) = 0 \). From the simplified equation:

\[
(x - 9)(x - 4) = 36
\]

We solved this as a quadratic, but let’s confirm by analyzing the function or re-solving if necessary. Rewrite the equation:

\[
x^2 - 13x + 36 = 36
\]

\[
x^2 - 13x = 0
\]

The roots are consistent. To be thorough, test the function \( f(x) \) at other points or analyze its behavior (e.g., via derivatives or graphing), but since the equation reduced to a quadratic, it has at most two roots. The domain excludes \( x = 9 \), and we’ve tested both solutions.

Alternatively, consider the original equation’s structure. Cross-multiplying led to a quadratic, and quadratics have at most two real roots. Since \( x = 0 \) is not positive and \( x = 13 \) is valid, no other positive real solutions are expected.

### Step 7: Recall Info

[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final solution by recalling relevant information from previous steps.

**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the solutions obtained, their validation, and the requirement for a positive real number.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
- From Step 3: Solving \( (x - 9)(x - 4) = 36 \) resulted in \( x^2 - 13x = 0 \), with solutions \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 13 \).
- From Step 4: Validation showed \( x = 0 \) satisfies the equation but is not positive, while \( x = 13 \) is positive and satisfies \( \frac{13 - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{13 - 9} = 1 \).
- From Step 6: The quadratic nature of the equation suggests at most two real roots, and the domain restriction \( x \neq 9 \) was satisfied. No other positive solutions were indicated.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer

Based on the steps, the only positive real number that satisfies \( \frac{x - 4}{9} = \frac{4}{x - 9} \) is \( x = 13 \).

\[
\boxed{13}
\]
