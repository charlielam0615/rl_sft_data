**Problem Restatement**: The Cookie Monster has a cookie defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y \). He wants to determine if it is lunch-sized or snack-sized by finding its radius.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the radius, break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Recognize the equation as a circle and rewrite it in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
2. Complete the square for \(x\) and \(y\) terms to find the center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\).  
3. Extract the radius from the standard form.

### Step 2: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \(x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y\) in standard circle form by completing the square. This involves rearranging terms, grouping \(x\) and \(y\), and adjusting constants to derive \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y \]

Move all terms to one side:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - x - 3y - 6.5 = 0 \]

Rearrange and group like terms:  
\[ (x^2 - x) + (y^2 - 3y) = 6.5 \]

Complete the square for \(x\):  
\[ x^2 - x = (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4} \]  
(Since \(-\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\)).

Complete the square for \(y\):  
\[ y^2 - 3y = y^2 - 3y + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{9}{4} \]  
(Since \(\frac{-3}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}\), and \((-\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{9}{4}\)).

Substitute back:  
\[ \left( (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{9}{4} \right) = 6.5 \]

Combine constants:  
\[ (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{9}{4} = 6.5 \]  
\[ (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{10}{4} = 6.5 \]  
\[ (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \]  
\[ (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{13}{2} + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

The equation is now:  
\[ (x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 = 9 \]  
This is the standard form, with radius \( r = \sqrt{9} = 3 \).

### Step 3: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the standard form \((x - \frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \frac{3}{2})^2 = 9\) and radius \(r = 3\) by substituting the center and checking consistency with the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The center is \((\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2})\), and radius \(r = \sqrt{9} = 3\). Substitute the center into the original equation to confirm:  
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y \]

Left side:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 6.5 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{9}{4} - \frac{26}{4} = \frac{10}{4} - \frac{26}{4} = -\frac{16}{4} = -4 \]

Right side:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} + 3 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Since \(-4 \neq 5\), test a point on the circle, e.g., \(x = \frac{1}{2} + 3 = \frac{7}{2}\), \(y = \frac{3}{2}\):  
\[ \left(\frac{7}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]  
This satisfies the standard form. Now check the original equation:  
Left:  
\[ \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 6.5 = \frac{49}{4} + \frac{9}{4} - \frac{26}{4} = \frac{58}{4} - \frac{26}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]  
Right:  
\[ \frac{7}{2} + 3 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]  
Since \(8 = 8\), the point satisfies the original equation, confirming the standard form is correct.

### Final Answer
The radius of the cookie is 3 units. Without specific criteria for "lunch-sized" or "snack-sized," the Cookie Monster can use the radius \(r = 3\) to decide based on his preferences.
