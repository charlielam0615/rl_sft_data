### Problem Statement
We need to find the sum of the series \(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \cdots + 1024\). 

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of finding the sum into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the pattern in the series.
2. Determine the number of terms in the series.
3. Derive a formula for the sum of the series.
4. Compute the sum using the formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the pattern in the series.
How to Achieve: Observe the sequence \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 1024\) and determine if it follows a recognizable pattern, such as a geometric sequence.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sequence is \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 1024\). Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2:
- \(1 \times 2 = 2\),
- \(2 \times 2 = 4\),
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and so on.

Thus, the series is a geometric sequence with:
- First term \(a = 1\),
- Common ratio \(r = 2\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the number of terms in the series.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence, \(a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}\), where \(a_n = 1024\), \(a = 1\), and \(r = 2\). Solve for \(n\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The \(n\)-th term of the geometric sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = 1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}.
\]
Set \(a_n = 1024\):
\[
2^{n-1} = 1024.
\]
Since \(1024 = 2^{10}\), we have:
\[
2^{n-1} = 2^{10} \implies n-1 = 10 \implies n = 11.
\]
Thus, there are 11 terms in the series: \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Derive a formula for the sum of the series.
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with first term \(a\), common ratio \(r\), and \(n\) terms:
\[
S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}.
\]
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For a geometric series with first term \(a = 1\), common ratio \(r = 2\), and number of terms \(n = 11\), the sum is:
\[
S_n = 1 \cdot \frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{2^n - 1}{1} = 2^n - 1.
\]
Thus, the formula for the sum is:
\[
S_{11} = 2^{11} - 1.
\]
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the sum using the formula.
How to Achieve: Substitute \(n = 11\) into the formula \(S_n = 2^n - 1\) and calculate the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the formula \(S_{11} = 2^{11} - 1\):
\[
2^{11} = 2048,
\]
\[
S_{11} = 2048 - 1 = 2047.
\]
Thus, the sum of the series is \(2047\).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Check the validity of the computed sum.
How to Achieve: Manually add the terms \(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024\) to confirm the result matches \(2047\).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the sum manually:
\[
1 + 2 = 3,
\]
\[
3 + 4 = 7,
\]
\[
7 + 8 = 15,
\]
\[
15 + 16 = 31,
\]
\[
31 + 32 = 63,
\]
\[
63 + 64 = 127,
\]
\[
127 + 128 = 255,
\]
\[
255 + 256 = 511,
\]
\[
511 + 512 = 1023,
\]
\[
1023 + 1024 = 2047.
\]
The manual sum is \(2047\), which matches the computed result.
