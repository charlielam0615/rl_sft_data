**Problem Restatement**: We need to find positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the equation \(ab - 6a + 5b = 373\) is satisfied, and we want to minimize the absolute difference \(|a - b|\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into manageable subgoals:  
1. Rewrite the given equation to express one variable in terms of the other.  
2. Ensure \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and satisfy the equation.  
3. Compute \(|a - b|\) for valid pairs \((a, b)\).  
4. Identify the pair that minimizes \(|a - b|\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rewrite the equation \(ab - 6a + 5b = 373\) to express one variable (e.g., \(b\)) in terms of the other (\(a\)) and ensure integer solutions. This can be achieved by rearranging the equation into a form like \(b = \frac{\text{something}}{\text{something}}\) and ensuring the denominator divides the numerator for \(b\) to be an integer.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the equation:  
\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \]  
Rearrange to isolate terms involving \(b\):  
\[ ab + 5b = 373 + 6a \]  
Factor \(b\):  
\[ b(a + 5) = 373 + 6a \]  
Solve for \(b\):  
\[ b = \frac{373 + 6a}{a + 5} \]  
For \(b\) to be a positive integer, \(a + 5\) must divide \(373 + 6a\). Additionally, since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, \(a \geq 1\), and \(b \geq 1\), so:  
\[ \frac{373 + 6a}{a + 5} \geq 1 \implies 373 + 6a \geq a + 5 \implies 373 + 5a \geq 5 \implies 5a \geq -368 \]  
Since \(a \geq 1\), this is always satisfied. We need \(a + 5\) to be a divisor of \(373 + 6a\).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the expression \(b = \frac{373 + 6a}{a + 5}\) by ensuring \(b\) is a positive integer. This requires \(a + 5\) to divide \(373 + 6a\). We will test this by finding values of \(a\) such that the division yields an integer \(b\), and check if the resulting pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the original equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To ensure \(b = \frac{373 + 6a}{a + 5}\) is an integer, let \(d = a + 5\), where \(d\) is a positive integer (since \(a \geq 1\), \(d \geq 6\)). Then:  
\[ a = d - 5 \]  
Substitute into the expression for \(b\):  
\[ b = \frac{373 + 6(d - 5)}{d} = \frac{373 + 6d - 30}{d} = \frac{343 + 6d}{d} = \frac{343}{d} + 6 \]  
For \(b\) to be an integer, \(\frac{343}{d}\) must be an integer, meaning \(d\) must be a divisor of 343. Since \(343 = 7^3\), the positive divisors of 343 are:  
\[ 1, 7, 49, 343 \]  
Since \(d = a + 5 \geq 6\), we exclude \(d = 1\). Thus, possible values of \(d\) are 7, 49, 343. Compute corresponding \(a\) and \(b\):  
- For \(d = 7\):  
  \[ a = 7 - 5 = 2 \]  
  \[ b = \frac{343}{7} + 6 = 49 + 6 = 55 \]  
  Check: \(ab - 6a + 5b = 2 \cdot 55 - 6 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 55 = 110 - 12 + 275 = 373\). Valid.  
  \[ |a - b| = |2 - 55| = 53 \]  
- For \(d = 49\):  
  \[ a = 49 - 5 = 44 \]  
  \[ b = \frac{343}{49} + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13 \]  
  Check: \(44 \cdot 13 - 6 \cdot 44 + 5 \cdot 13 = 572 - 264 + 65 = 373\). Valid.  
  \[ |a - b| = |44 - 13| = 31 \]  
- For \(d = 343\):  
  \[ a = 343 - 5 = 338 \]  
  \[ b = \frac{343}{343} + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \]  
  Check: \(338 \cdot 7 - 6 \cdot 338 + 5 \cdot 7 = 2366 - 2028 + 35 = 373\). Valid.  
  \[ |a - b| = |338 - 7| = 331 \]  
Pairs: \((a, b) = (2, 55), (44, 13), (338, 7)\).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Minimize \(|a - b|\) for positive integers \(a, b\) satisfying \(ab - 6a + 5b = 373\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Rewrite the equation to express \(b\) in terms of \(a\).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find integer solutions for \(a\) and \(b\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute \(|a - b|\) for valid pairs and identify the minimum.  
**Current Goal**: Identify the pair \((a, b)\) that minimizes \(|a - b|\).  
From the previous step, the valid pairs and their differences are:  
- \((2, 55)\): \(|2 - 55| = 53\)  
- \((44, 13)\): \(|44 - 13| = 31\)  
- \((338, 7)\): \(|338 - 7| = 331\)  
The smallest \(|a - b|\) is 31 for the pair \((44, 13)\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify if there are other possible integer solutions by considering the equation with \(a\) and \(b\) swapped (i.e., check symmetry or alternative derivations) to ensure all pairs are found, and confirm the minimal \(|a - b|\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Consider the equation symmetrically by solving for \(a\) in terms of \(b\):  
\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \]  
Rearrange:  
\[ ab - 6a = 373 - 5b \]  
\[ a(b - 6) = 373 - 5b \]  
\[ a = \frac{373 - 5b}{b - 6} \]  
For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(b - 6\) must divide \(373 - 5b\), and \(b \geq 7\) (since \(b - 6 \geq 1\)). Let \(d = b - 6\), so \(b = d + 6\), and:  
\[ a = \frac{373 - 5(d + 6)}{d} = \frac{373 - 5d - 30}{d} = \frac{343 - 5d}{d} = \frac{343}{d} - 5 \]  
For \(a\) to be an integer, \(d\) must divide 343, and \(a \geq 1\). Test divisors of 343 (\(d = 1, 7, 49, 343\)):  
- \(d = 1\): \(a = \frac{343}{1} - 5 = 338\), \(b = 1 + 6 = 7\). Pair: \((338, 7)\), \(|a - b| = 331\).  
- \(d = 7\): \(a = \frac{343}{7} - 5 = 49 - 5 = 44\), \(b = 7 + 6 = 13\). Pair: \((44, 13)\), \(|a - b| = 31\).  
- \(d = 49\): \(a = \frac{343}{49} - 5 = 7 - 5 = 2\), \(b = 49 + 6 = 55\). Pair: \((2, 55)\), \(|a - b| = 53\).  
- \(d = 343\): \(a = \frac{343}{343} - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4\), not positive, so invalid.  
The pairs match those found earlier, confirming \((2, 55), (44, 13), (338, 7)\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize the minimal \(|a - b|\) by comparing the differences from all valid pairs and selecting the smallest.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the valid pairs:  
- \((2, 55)\): \(|a - b| = 53\)  
- \((44, 13)\): \(|a - b| = 31\)  
- \((338, 7)\): \(|a - b| = 331\)  
The minimal \(|a - b|\) is 31, achieved when \(a = 44\) and \(b = 13\).  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**: The minimal possible value of \(|a - b|\) is 31.
