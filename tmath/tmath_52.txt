[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Multiplying both sides of the equation by $ r + 4 $, we get:  
$$
\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} \cdot (r + 4) = (2r + 7) \cdot (r + 4)
$$  
The left-hand side simplifies to $ r^2 - 3r - 17 $. On the right-hand side, we expand $ (2r + 7)(r + 4) $:  
$$
(2r + 7)(r + 4) = 2r^2 + 8r + 7r + 28 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28
$$  
So, the equation becomes:  
$$
r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28

[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We solve the quadratic equation $ r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0 $ using the quadratic formula:  
$$
r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  
For this equation, $ a = 1 $, $ b = 18 $, and $ c = 45 $. Substituting these into the formula:  
$$
r = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 - 4(1)(45)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{324 - 180}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2}
$$  
$$
r = \frac{-18 \pm 12}{2}
$$  
This gives two solutions:  
$$
r = \frac{-18 + 12}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
$$  
$$
r = \frac{-18 - 12}{2} = \frac{-30}{2} = -15

[VERIFY]
1. **Domain Consideration**: The original equation is undefined at $ r = -4 $. The solutions $ r = -3 $ and $ r = -15 $ are valid as they do not conflict with this restriction.

2. **Multiplication Step**:  
   Multiplying both sides by $ r + 4 $ yields $ r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28 $.  
   This step is correct because $ (2r + 7)(r + 4) = 2r^2 + 15r + 28 $.

3. **Simplification**:  
   Moving all terms to one side: $ -r^2 - 18r - 45 = 0 $.  
   Multiplying by $-1$ gives $ r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0 $.  
   This is algebraically valid and simplifies the equation correctly.

4. **Quadratic Solution**:  
   Using the quadratic formula:  
   $$
   r = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 - 4(1)(45)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm 12}{2}
   $$  
   The calculations for $ r = -3 $ and $ r = -15 $ are correct.

5. **Validation of Solutions**:  
   Substituting $ r = -3 $ and $ r = -15 $ into the original equation confirms both satisfy it.  
   For $ r = -3 $:  
   $$
   \frac{(-3)^2 - 3(-3) - 17}{-3 + 4} = \frac{9 + 9 - 17}{1} = 1, \quad 2(-3) + 7 = 1
   $$  
   For $ r = -15 $:  
   $$
   \frac{(-15)^2 - 3(-15) - 17}{-15 + 4} = \frac{225 + 45 - 17}{-11} = -23, \quad 2(-15) + 7 = -23
   $$  
   Both solutions are valid.

6. **Positive Difference Calculation**:  
   $$
   |(-3) - (-15)| = |12| = 12
   $$  
   This is correct.

All steps are logically consistent, algebraically valid, and solutions are verified. No errors detected.

Our final answer is that the **positive difference** between the two solutions is $ 12 $. Let's verify this by tracing the logic backward.

1. **Final Result**: The positive difference between the solutions is $ 12 $.

     $$  
   - This is consistent with the quadratic we solved.

   - Both solutions are valid and consistent with the original equation.

[VERIFY]
1. **Algebraic Manipulation**:  
   - The original equation is $\frac{r^2 - 3r - 17}{r + 4} = 2r + 7$.  
   - Multiplying both sides by $r + 4$ (valid for $r \ne -4$) gives $r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28$.  
   - Rearranging terms: $-r^2 - 18r - 45 = 0$, which simplifies to $r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0$.  
   - **Verification**: The expansion of $(2r + 7)(r + 4)$ is $2r^2 + 8r + 7r + 28 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28$, confirming the correctness of this step.  

2. **Solving the Quadratic**:  
   - The quadratic $r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0$ is solved using the quadratic formula:  
     $$
     r = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 - 4(1)(45)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{324 - 180}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2}.
     $$  
   - This yields $r = -3$ and $r = -15$.  
   - **Verification**: The discriminant calculation and arithmetic are correct.  

3. **Solution Validity in the Original Equation**:  
   - For $r = -3$:  
     Left-hand side (LHS): $\frac{(-3)^2 - 3(-3) - 17}{-3 + 4} = \frac{9 + 9 - 17}{1} = 1$.  
     Right-hand side (RHS): $2(-3) + 7 = 1$.  
     **Match confirmed**.  
   - For $r = -15$:  
     LHS: $\frac{(-15)^2 - 3(-15) - 17}{-15 + 4} = \frac{225 + 45 - 17}{-11} = \frac{253}{-11} = -23$.  
     RHS: $2(-15) + 7 = -23$.  
     **Match confirmed**.  

4. **Domain Consideration**:  
   - The original equation is undefined at $r = -4$, but neither solution is $-4$.  
   - **No domain violations**.  

5. **Positive Difference Calculation**:  
   - The two solutions are $-3$ and $-15$.  
   - Their difference is $|-3 - (-15)| = |12| = 12$.  
   - **Consistent with the final answer**.  

All steps are logically consistent, and the final answer is supported by rigorous verification. No errors are identified.
