Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ y $ in terms of $ x $ from the equation $ 3x + 5y = 20 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the equation:
$$
3x + 5y = 20
$$
Subtract $ 3x $ from both sides to isolate the term with $ y $:
$$
5y = -3x + 20
$$
Divide every term by 5 to solve for $ y $:
$$
y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the slope $ m $ from the rearranged equation $ y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The equation is now in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + b $, where the coefficient of $ x $ is the slope $ m $. From the equation:
$$
y = \frac{-3}{5}x + 4
$$
It is clear that the slope $ m $ is $ \frac{-3}{5} $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the algebraic manipulation and identification of the slope.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Original equation: 3x + 5y = 20
2. Subtracting 3x: 5y = -3x + 20 – This step is valid as it maintains equality.
3. Dividing by 5: y = (-3/5)x + 4 – Correct division applied to all terms.
4. Slope identification: The coefficient of x in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) directly corresponds to m. Here, -3/5 is correctly identified as the slope.
5. Cross-check using substitution:
   - When x = 0: y = 4 (matches 3(0) + 5(4) = 20)
   - When x = 5: y = (-3/5)(5) + 4 = 1 (matches 3(5) + 5(1) = 20)
All operations and conclusions are mathematically valid and consistent. No errors detected.
