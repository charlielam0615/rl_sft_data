**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To simplify the complex fraction \(\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i}\), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.  
2. Perform the multiplication in the numerator and denominator.  
3. Simplify the resulting expression to the form \(a + bi\).

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator of \(\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i}\). This can be achieved by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, \(2 - 3i\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The denominator is \(2 + 3i\). Its complex conjugate is \(2 - 3i\). Multiply both the numerator and denominator by \(2 - 3i\):

\[
\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i} \cdot \frac{2 - 3i}{2 - 3i} = \frac{(1 - i)(2 - 3i)}{(2 + 3i)(2 - 3i)}.
\]

**Numerator**: Compute \((1 - i)(2 - 3i)\):  
\[
(1 - i)(2 - 3i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-3i) + (-i) \cdot 2 + (-i) \cdot (-3i) = 2 - 3i - 2i + 3i^2.
\]
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3\). Thus:  
\[
2 - 3i - 2i - 3 = 2 - 5i - 3 = -1 - 5i.
\]

**Denominator**: Compute \((2 + 3i)(2 - 3i)\):  
\[
(2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot (-3i) + 3i \cdot 2 + 3i \cdot (-3i) = 4 - 6i + 6i - 9i^2.
\]
Since \(i^2 = -1\), we have \(-9i^2 = -9(-1) = 9\). Thus:  
\[
4 - 6i + 6i + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13.
\]

So, the fraction becomes:  
\[
\frac{-1 - 5i}{13} = -\frac{1}{13} - \frac{5}{13}i.
\]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the simplified expression \(-\frac{1}{13} - \frac{5}{13}i\) is correct by checking the calculations and ensuring the result is in the form \(a + bi\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate, recompute the key steps:  
- **Numerator check**: \((1 - i)(2 - 3i) = 2 - 3i - 2i + 3i^2 = 2 - 5i - 3 = -1 - 5i\). Correct.  
- **Denominator check**: \((2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = 4 - 6i + 6i - 9i^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\). Correct.  
- **Simplification**: \(\frac{-1 - 5i}{13} = -\frac{1}{13} - \frac{5}{13}i\), which is in the form \(a + bi\).  

The calculations are consistent, and the denominator is real, confirming the correctness of the result.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Simplify \(\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i}\) to the form \(a + bi\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Perform multiplication in numerator and denominator (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Simplify to the form \(a + bi\) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed).  

**Current Goal**: The main goal is achieved, as the expression has been simplified to \(-\frac{1}{13} - \frac{5}{13}i\), and validation confirms its correctness.

**Final Answer**:  
The simplified form of \(\frac{1 - i}{2 + 3i}\) is:  
\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{1}{13} - \dfrac{5}{13}i}
