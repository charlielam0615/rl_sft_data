### Problem Statement
Simplify the expression \( 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \).

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the simplification process into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Remove the parentheses by distributing the negative sign.  
2. Combine like terms (coefficients of \( x^2 \), \( x \), and constants).  
3. Present the simplified expression in standard polynomial form.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the parentheses in the expression \( 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \) by distributing the negative sign across the terms inside the parentheses. This will prepare the expression for combining like terms.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Distribute the negative sign:  
\[ -(6 - 2x - 3x^2) = -6 + 2x + 3x^2 \]  
Rewrite the expression:  
\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 + (-6 + 2x + 3x^2) = 3x^2 + 3x^2 + 2x + 2x + 1 - 6 \]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine like terms in the expression \( 3x^2 + 3x^2 + 2x + 2x + 1 - 6 \) to simplify it further. This involves adding coefficients of similar terms (\( x^2 \), \( x \), and constants).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Combine like terms:  
- For \( x^2 \)-terms: \( 3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2 \)  
- For \( x \)-terms: \( 2x + 2x = 4x \)  
- For constants: \( 1 - 6 = -5 \)  
The expression becomes:  
\[ 6x^2 + 4x - 5 \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the simplified expression \( 6x^2 + 4x - 5 \) by checking the simplification steps. This involves re-evaluating the distribution and combination of terms to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the simplification:  
Original expression: \( 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \)  
Distribute: \( -(6 - 2x - 3x^2) = -6 + 2x + 3x^2 \)  
Full expression: \( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 + 3x^2 + 2x - 6 \)  
Combine:  
- \( x^2 \)-terms: \( 3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2 \)  
- \( x \)-terms: \( 2x + 2x = 4x \)  
- Constants: \( 1 - 6 = -5 \)  
Result: \( 6x^2 + 4x - 5 \), which matches the previous result.  
To further validate, test with a value, e.g., \( x = 1 \):  
Original: \( 2(1) + 3(1)^2 + 1 - (6 - 2(1) - 3(1)^2) = 2 + 3 + 1 - (6 - 2 - 3) = 6 - 1 = 5 \)  
Simplified: \( 6(1)^2 + 4(1) - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 5 \). The values match.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
