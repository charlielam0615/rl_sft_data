### Problem Restatement
Simplify the expression: \( 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To simplify the expression, break down the task into intermediate subgoals:
1. Distribute the negative sign across the terms inside the parentheses.
2. Combine like terms by grouping coefficients of \( x^2 \), \( x \), and constants.
3. Present the simplified polynomial in standard form.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Distribute the negative sign across the terms inside the parentheses.
Description: Rewrite \( -(6 - 2x - 3x^2) \) by applying the negative sign to each term within the parentheses to prepare for combining like terms.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Distribute the negative sign:
\( -(6 - 2x - 3x^2) = -6 + 2x + 3x^2 \).

The expression becomes:
\( 3x^2 + 2x + 1 + (-6 + 2x + 3x^2) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Combine like terms in the expression.
Description: Group and sum the coefficients of \( x^2 \), \( x \), and constant terms to simplify the polynomial.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expression: \( 3x^2 + 3x^2 + 2x + 2x + 1 - 6 \).

- \( x^2 \)-terms: \( 3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2 \).
- \( x \)-terms: \( 2x + 2x = 4x \).
- Constants: \( 1 - 6 = -5 \).

Simplified expression: \( 6x^2 + 4x - 5 \).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the simplified expression.
Description: Substitute a test value into the original and simplified expressions to confirm equivalence.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test with \( x = 1 \):

Original expression:
\( 2(1) + 3(1)^2 + 1 - (6 - 2(1) - 3(1)^2) = 2 + 3 + 1 - (6 - 2 - 3) = 6 - 1 = 5 \).

Simplified expression:
\( 6(1)^2 + 4(1) - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 5 \).

Since both yield 5, the simplification is correct.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
