### Problem Restatement
A super ball is dropped from 100 feet and rebounds half the distance it falls each time it bounces. We need to calculate the total distance the ball travels when it hits the ground for the fourth time. This includes the distance the ball falls and rises after each bounce, up to and including the fourth impact with the ground.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the distance the ball falls on the initial drop.
2. Determine the rebound height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the distance fallen and risen for each subsequent bounce up to the fourth impact.
4. Sum all distances (falling and rising) until the ball hits the ground the fourth time.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Calculate the initial fall distance.
Description: The ball is dropped from 100 feet, so we need to record this initial falling distance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The ball falls 100 feet on the initial drop. Thus, the distance traveled so far is:
- Initial fall: 100 feet
Total distance = 100 feet
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)

Current Goal: Calculate the rebound height and distances for each bounce.
Description: After each fall, the ball rebounds half the distance it fell. Compute the fall and rise distances for each bounce up to the fourth impact.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **First bounce**:
  - Fall: 100 feet (initial drop, already counted).
  - Rebound: 100 × 1/2 = 50 feet (rises 50 feet).
  - Total distance so far: 100 + 50 = 150 feet.

- **Second bounce**:
  - Fall: 50 feet (falls from 50 feet).
  - Rebound: 50 × 1/2 = 25 feet (rises 25 feet).
  - Total distance: 150 + 50 + 25 = 225 feet.

- **Third bounce**:
  - Fall: 25 feet (falls from 25 feet).
  - Rebound: 25 × 1/2 = 12.5 feet (rises 12.5 feet).
  - Total distance: 225 + 25 + 12.5 = 262.5 feet.

- **Fourth impact**:
  - Fall: 12.5 feet (falls from 12.5 feet).
  - Total distance: 262.5 + 12.5 = 275 feet.

The ball hits the ground the fourth time after falling 12.5 feet from the third rebound. The total distance includes all falls and rebounds up to this point.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)

Current Goal: Verify the calculated distances and ensure the fourth impact is correctly interpreted.
Description: Check the sequence of falls and rebounds, confirm the total distance, and ensure the problem’s requirement (distance until the fourth ground impact) is met.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The problem asks for the distance traveled when the ball hits the ground the fourth time. The sequence is:
- Initial fall: 100 feet (first impact).
- First bounce: Rise 50 feet, fall 50 feet (second impact).
- Second bounce: Rise 25 feet, fall 25 feet (third impact).
- Third bounce: Rise 12.5 feet, fall 12.5 feet (fourth impact).

Distances:
- Falls: 100 + 50 + 25 + 12.5 = 187.5 feet.
- Rises: 50 + 25 + 12.5 = 87.5 feet.
- Total: 187.5 + 87.5 = 275 feet.

The calculation includes the fall to the fourth impact but excludes the rebound after the fourth impact, as the ball has not yet risen. The sequence and summation are consistent with the problem’s conditions.

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate the total distance the ball travels when it hits the ground the fourth time.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the initial fall distance (completed: 100 feet).
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the rebound height and distances for each bounce (completed: first bounce rise 50 feet, fall 50 feet; second bounce rise 25 feet, fall 25 feet; third bounce rise 12.5 feet, fall 12.5 feet).
  - Subgoal 3: Sum all distances up to the fourth impact (completed: 275 feet).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the calculations and interpretation (completed: sequence and total verified).

Current Goal: The current goal is to confirm the final answer, as all subgoals have been addressed.

### Final Answer
The ball travels **275 feet** when it hits the ground for the fourth time.
