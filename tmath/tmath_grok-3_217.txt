### Problem Statement
We need to calculate the total distance traveled by a super ball dropped from 100 feet, which rebounds half the distance it falls each time it bounces, until it hits the ground for the fourth time. The total distance includes the initial fall and the distances traveled during subsequent bounces (both upward and downward) until the ball contacts the ground on the fourth bounce.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Calculate the distance of the initial fall.
2. For each bounce (1st, 2nd, 3rd), compute the upward rebound distance and the downward fall distance.
3. Sum all distances (initial fall, rebounds, and falls) until the ball hits the ground the fourth time.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Calculate the distance of the initial fall.
- How to Achieve: The ball is dropped from 100 feet, so the initial fall distance is 100 feet.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The ball falls 100 feet initially.
Total distance so far: 100 feet.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Calculate the distance for the first bounce (upward and downward).
- How to Achieve: The ball rebounds half the distance it fell (100 feet), so it rises 50 feet. It then falls 50 feet to hit the ground the second time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Upward distance after first bounce: 100 / 2 = 50 feet.
- Downward distance before second ground hit: 50 feet.
- Total distance for first bounce: 50 + 50 = 100 feet.
- Cumulative total distance: 100 (initial) + 100 (first bounce) = 200 feet.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Calculate the distance for the second bounce (upward and downward).
- How to Achieve: The ball rebounds half the distance it fell (50 feet), so it rises 25 feet. It then falls 25 feet to hit the ground the third time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Upward distance after second bounce: 50 / 2 = 25 feet.
- Downward distance before third ground hit: 25 feet.
- Total distance for second bounce: 25 + 25 = 50 feet.
- Cumulative total distance: 200 + 50 = 250 feet.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Calculate the distance for the third bounce (upward and downward) until the fourth ground hit.
- How to Achieve: The ball rebounds half the distance it fell (25 feet), so it rises 12.5 feet. It then falls 12.5 feet to hit the ground the fourth time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Upward distance after third bounce: 25 / 2 = 12.5 feet.
- Downward distance before fourth ground hit: 12.5 feet.
- Total distance for third bounce: 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 feet.
- Cumulative total distance: 250 + 25 = 275 feet.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Calculate total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the ground the fourth time.
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate initial fall distance (completed: 100 feet).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate first bounce distances (completed: 100 feet).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate second bounce distances (completed: 50 feet).
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate third bounce distances until fourth ground hit (completed: 25 feet).
  - Subgoal 5: Sum all distances (pending).

Current Goal: Sum all distances to find the total.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Sum all distances to find the total distance traveled.
- How to Achieve: Add the initial fall distance and the distances from all bounces (up and down) until the fourth ground hit.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Initial fall: 100 feet.
- First bounce: 50 (up) + 50 (down) = 100 feet.
- Second bounce: 25 (up) + 25 (down) = 50 feet.
- Third bounce: 12.5 (up) + 12.5 (down) = 25 feet.
- Total distance: 100 + 100 + 50 + 25 = 275 feet.

The ball has traveled 275 feet when it hits the ground the fourth time.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
- Current Goal: Verify the total distance calculation.
- How to Achieve: Recalculate the distances and check for consistency, ensuring all bounces up to the fourth ground hit are included.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculation:
- Initial fall: 100 feet.
- First bounce: Rebound = 100 / 2 = 50 feet (up), fall = 50 feet (down). Total = 100 feet.
- Second bounce: Rebound = 50 / 2 = 25 feet (up), fall = 25 feet (down). Total = 50 feet.
- Third bounce: Rebound = 25 / 2 = 12.5 feet (up), fall = 12.5 feet (down). Total = 25 feet.
- Sum: 100 + 100 + 50 + 25 = 275 feet.

The calculation is consistent. The total distance is confirmed as 275 feet.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The super ball has traveled **275 feet** when it hits the ground the fourth time.
