### Problem Statement
We need to find the distance between the vertices \( A \) and \( B \) of two quadratic functions. The vertex \( A \) belongs to the parabola defined by \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \), and the vertex \( B \) belongs to the parabola defined by \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \). The distance between two points in the coordinate plane is calculated using the distance formula: \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find the distance between vertices \( A \) and \( B \):  
1. Find the vertex \( A \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \).  
2. Find the vertex \( B \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \).  
3. Calculate the distance between points \( A \) and \( B \) using the distance formula.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the vertex \( A \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \). To achieve this, convert the quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square or use the vertex formula for a quadratic \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where the vertex is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), and compute the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), \( c = 3 \).  
The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1} = 1 \]  
Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the equation to find the y-coordinate:  
\[ y = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2 \]  
Thus, vertex \( A \) is at \( (1, 2) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the vertex \( B \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \). Use the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) and compute the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate by substituting back into the equation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the quadratic \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \), identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = 10 \).  
The x-coordinate of the vertex is:  
\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 \]  
Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the equation to find the y-coordinate:  
\[ y = (-2)^2 + 4 \cdot (-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6 \]  
Thus, vertex \( B \) is at \( (-2, 6) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the coordinates of vertices \( A \) and \( B \). Recheck the vertex calculations for both parabolas to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate vertex \( A \) for \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \):  
\[ x = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1} = 1 \]  
\[ y = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2 \]  
Confirmed: \( A = (1, 2) \).  

Recalculate vertex \( B \) for \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \):  
\[ x = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 \]  
\[ y = (-2)^2 + 4 \cdot (-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6 \]  
Confirmed: \( B = (-2, 6) \).  
The coordinates are consistent with previous calculations.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the distance between vertices \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \). Use the distance formula \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \) to compute the distance.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the distance formula with \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \):  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{((-2) - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
The distance between \( A \) and \( B \) is 5 units.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the distance between vertices \( A \) and \( B \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find vertex \( A \) of \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \) (completed: \( A = (1, 2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find vertex \( B \) of \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \) (completed: \( B = (-2, 6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the distance between \( A \) and \( B \) (completed: distance = 5).  
**Current Goal**: Verify the final distance calculation to ensure correctness.  
All subgoals have been addressed, and the main goal is completed with the distance calculated as 5 units.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the distance calculation between \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \). Recalculate the distance using the distance formula to confirm the result.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recalculate the distance:  
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{((-2) - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]  
The distance is confirmed to be 5 units.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The distance between the vertices \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \) is **5 units**.
