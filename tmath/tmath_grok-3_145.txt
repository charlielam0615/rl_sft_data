### Problem Restatement
We need to find the distance between the vertices \( A \) and \( B \) of two parabolas. The first parabola is defined by the equation \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \), and the second by \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \). The vertex of a parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), and we can compute the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate by substituting this \( x \)-value into the equation. After finding the coordinates of vertices \( A \) and \( B \), we calculate the Euclidean distance between them.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the vertex \( A \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \).  
**How to Achieve**: For a parabola \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the vertex occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Substitute this \( x \)-value into the equation to find the \( y \)-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), \( c = 3 \).  
- Compute the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex:  
  \[
  x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
  \]  
- Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the equation to find the \( y \)-coordinate:  
  \[
  y = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2
  \]  
Thus, the vertex \( A \) is at \( (1, 2) \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the vertex \( B \) of the parabola \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the vertex formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) and substitute into the equation to find the \( y \)-coordinate.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For the parabola \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = 10 \).  
- Compute the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex:  
  \[
  x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot 1} = -\frac{4}{2} = -2
  \]  
- Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the equation to find the \( y \)-coordinate:  
  \[
  y = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6
  \]  
Thus, the vertex \( B \) is at \( (-2, 6) \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the distance between vertices \( A \) and \( B \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Find the vertex \( A \) of \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \) (Completed: Vertex \( A = (1, 2) \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find the vertex \( B \) of \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \) (Completed: Vertex \( B = (-2, 6) \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate the distance between \( A \) and \( B \) (Current).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the distance between \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \).

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the distance between vertices \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the Euclidean distance formula for points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Given \( A (1, 2) \) and \( B (-2, 6) \):  
- Compute the differences:  
  \[
  x_2 - x_1 = -2 - 1 = -3, \quad y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
  \]  
- Apply the distance formula:  
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
  \]  
The distance between \( A \) and \( B \) is 5 units.

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the distance calculation and ensure all steps are correct.  
**How to Achieve**: Recheck the vertex coordinates and recompute the distance to confirm accuracy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recompute vertex \( A \): For \( y = x^2 - 2x + 3 \), \( x = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1} = 1 \), \( y = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 3 = 2 \). Confirmed: \( A = (1, 2) \).  
- Recompute vertex \( B \): For \( y = x^2 + 4x + 10 \), \( x = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 \), \( y = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 10 = 4 - 8 + 10 = 6 \). Confirmed: \( B = (-2, 6) \).  
- Recompute distance:  
  \[
  \sqrt{(-2 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
  \]  
The calculations are consistent, confirming the distance is 5 units.

### Final Answer
The distance between the vertices \( A \) and \( B \) is 5 units.
