**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Understand the condition for the quadratic to factor into two binomials with integer coefficients.  
2. Express the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) in the form \( (x + m)(x + n) \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers.  
3. Derive conditions on \( b \) based on the factorization.  
4. Find the smallest positive integer \( b \) that satisfies these conditions.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to express the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) as \( (x + m)(x + n) \) and determine the conditions on \( b \). To achieve this, expand the binomial product \( (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn \), compare it to \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \), and identify the relationships \( m + n = b \) and \( mn = 2008 \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Expanding \( (x + m)(x + n) \), we get:  
\[ x^2 + (m + n)x + mn \]  
Comparing with \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \), we obtain:  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( m + n = b \)  
- Constant term: \( mn = 2008 \)  

Thus, \( m \) and \( n \) are integers whose sum is \( b \) and product is 2008. We need to find integer pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 2008 \) and compute \( b = m + n \), then identify the smallest positive \( b \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find integer pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 2008 \) and compute \( b = m + n \). To achieve this, factorize 2008 into pairs of integers (positive and negative) and calculate the sum \( b \) for each pair, focusing on positive sums.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
First, factorize 2008:  
\[ 2008 \div 2 = 1004 \]  
\[ 1004 \div 2 = 502 \]  
\[ 502 \div 2 = 251 \]  
Since 251 is a prime number (not divisible by any integer from 2 to \( \sqrt{251} \approx 15.84 \)), we have:  
\[ 2008 = 2^3 \cdot 251 \]  

The positive factor pairs of 2008 are:  
\[ (1, 2008), (2, 1004), (4, 502), (8, 251), (251, 8), (502, 4), (1004, 2), (2008, 1) \]  

Since \( mn = 2008 \), we also consider negative pairs (as \( m \) and \( n \) can be negative):  
\[ (-1, -2008), (-2, -1004), (-4, -502), (-8, -251), (-251, -8), (-502, -4), (-1004, -2), (-2008, -1) \]  

For each pair \( (m, n) \), compute \( b = m + n \):  
- Positive pairs:  
  - \( (1, 2008) \): \( b = 1 + 2008 = 2009 \)  
  - \( (2, 1004) \): \( b = 2 + 1004 = 1006 \)  
  - \( (4, 502) \): \( b = 4 + 502 = 506 \)  
  - \( (8, 251) \): \( b = 8 + 251 = 259 \)  
  - \( (251, 8) \): \( b = 251 + 8 = 259 \)  
  - \( (502, 4) \): \( b = 502 + 4 = 506 \)  
  - \( (1004, 2) \): \( b = 1004 + 2 = 1006 \)  
  - \( (2008, 1) \): \( b = 2008 + 1 = 2009 \)  

- Negative pairs:  
  - \( (-1, -2008) \): \( b = -1 - 2008 = -2009 \)  
  - \( (-2, -1004) \): \( b = -2 - 1004 = -1006 \)  
  - \( (-4, -502) \): \( b = -4 - 502 = -506 \)  
  - \( (-8, -251) \): \( b = -8 - 251 = -259 \)  
  - \( (-251, -8) \): \( b = -251 - 8 = -259 \)  
  - \( (-502, -4) \): \( b = -502 - 4 = -506 \)  
  - \( (-1004, -2) \): \( b = -1004 - 2 = -1006 \)  
  - \( (-2008, -1) \): \( b = -2008 - 1 = -2009 \)  

Possible positive \( b \) values are: 259, 506, 1006, 2009.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) factors correctly for the smallest positive \( b \). Test the smallest \( b = 259 \) by checking if the quadratic factors into binomials with integer coefficients.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For \( b = 259 \), use the pair \( (m, n) = (8, 251) \) (since \( 8 \cdot 251 = 2008 \) and \( 8 + 251 = 259 \)):  
\[ x^2 + 259x + 2008 = (x + 8)(x + 251) \]  
Expand to verify:  
\[ (x + 8)(x + 251) = x^2 + 251x + 8x + 8 \cdot 251 = x^2 + 259x + 2008 \]  
The factorization is correct.  

Check other positive \( b \) values to confirm 259 is the smallest:  
- \( b = 506 \): Pair \( (4, 502) \), \( 4 \cdot 502 = 2008 \), \( 4 + 502 = 506 \).  
  \[ (x + 4)(x + 502) = x^2 + 506x + 2008 \] (Correct)  
- \( b = 1006 \): Pair \( (2, 1004) \), \( 2 \cdot 1004 = 2008 \), \( 2 + 1004 = 1006 \).  
  \[ (x + 2)(x + 1004) = x^2 + 1006x + 2008 \] (Correct)  
- \( b = 2009 \): Pair \( (1, 2008) \), \( 1 \cdot 2008 = 2008 \), \( 1 + 2008 = 2009 \).  
  \[ (x + 1)(x + 2008) = x^2 + 2009x + 2008 \] (Correct)  

Since 259 < 506 < 1006 < 2009, the smallest positive \( b \) is 259.

### Final Answer
The smallest positive integer \( b \) for which \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) factors into a product of two binomials with integer coefficients is \( 259 \).  
For example, with \( b = 259 \), the quadratic factors as \( (x + 8)(x + 251) \), since \( 8 \cdot 251 = 2008 \) and \( 8 + 251 = 259 \).  

\[ \boxed{259} \]
