### Problem Statement
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( b \) such that the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) can be factored into a product of two binomials with integer coefficients, i.e., \( (x + m)(x + n) \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers, and the resulting quadratic has a positive integer \( b \).

### Step 1: Understand the Factoring Condition
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of finding the smallest positive integer \( b \) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Express the quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) in factored form as \( (x + m)(x + n) \).  
2. Determine the conditions on \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \) and \( n \) are integers and satisfy the coefficients of the quadratic.  
3. Find the smallest positive \( b \) by considering possible values of \( m \) and \( n \).  
4. Verify the solution by factoring the polynomial with the smallest \( b \).

### Step 2: Set Up the Factoring Equations
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Express \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) as \( (x + m)(x + n) \) and derive the conditions for \( m \) and \( n \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Expand the factored form \( (x + m)(x + n) \), match coefficients with \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \), and solve for \( m \) and \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Expanding \( (x + m)(x + n) \):  
\[ (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn \]  
Comparing with \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \):  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( m + n = b \)  
- Constant term: \( mn = 2008 \)  

Thus, we need integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that:  
\[ m + n = b \]  
\[ mn = 2008 \]  
Our goal is to find the smallest positive integer \( b \), so we need \( m + n \) to be positive and minimized.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Identify Possible Values for \( m \) and \( n \)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To find the smallest positive \( b \), we need to:  
1. Find all integer pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 2008 \).  
2. Compute \( b = m + n \) for each pair.  
3. Identify the pair that yields the smallest positive \( b \).  
4. Ensure the pair allows the quadratic to factor into binomials with integer coefficients.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Factorize 2008 to Find \( m \) and \( n \)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Find all integer pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 2008 \).  
- **How to Achieve**: Compute the prime factorization of 2008, list all factor pairs (positive and negative), and calculate \( b = m + n \) for each pair.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
First, factorize 2008:  
\[ 2008 \div 2 = 1004 \]  
\[ 1004 \div 2 = 502 \]  
\[ 502 \div 2 = 251 \]  
Since 251 is prime (not divisible by any prime less than \( \sqrt{251} \approx 15.84 \), i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13), we have:  
\[ 2008 = 2^3 \cdot 251 \]  

The positive factor pairs of 2008 are:  
\[ (1, 2008), (2, 1004), (4, 502), (8, 251), (251, 8), (502, 4), (1004, 2), (2008, 1) \]  

Since \( mn = 2008 \), we must also consider negative pairs, as \( m \) and \( n \) are integers:  
\[ (-1, -2008), (-2, -1004), (-4, -502), (-8, -251), (-251, -8), (-502, -4), (-1004, -2), (-2008, -1) \]  

Now, compute \( b = m + n \) for each pair:  
- Positive pairs:  
  - \( (1, 2008) \): \( b = 1 + 2008 = 2009 \)  
  - \( (2, 1004) \): \( b = 2 + 1004 = 1006 \)  
  - \( (4, 502) \): \( b = 4 + 502 = 506 \)  
  - \( (8, 251) \): \( b = 8 + 251 = 259 \)  
  - \( (251, 8) \): \( b = 251 + 8 = 259 \)  
  - \( (502, 4) \): \( b = 502 + 4 = 506 \)  
  - \( (1004, 2) \): \( b = 1004 + 2 = 1006 \)  
  - \( (2008, 1) \): \( b = 2008 + 1 = 2009 \)  

- Negative pairs:  
  - \( (-1, -2008) \): \( b = -1 - 2008 = -2009 \)  
  - \( (-2, -1004) \): \( b = -2 - 1004 = -1006 \)  
  - \( (-4, -502) \): \( b = -4 - 502 = -506 \)  
  - \( (-8, -251) \): \( b = -8 - 251 = -259 \)  
  - \( (-251, -8) \): \( b = -251 - 8 = -259 \)  
  - \( (-502, -4) \): \( b = -502 - 4 = -506 \)  
  - \( (-1004, -2) \): \( b = -1004 - 2 = -1006 \)  
  - \( (-2008, -1) \): \( b = -2008 - 1 = -2009 \)  

Since we need the smallest positive \( b \), we focus on positive \( b \) values:  
\[ 259, 506, 1006, 2009 \]  
The smallest positive \( b \) is 259, corresponding to \( (m, n) = (8, 251) \) or \( (251, 8) \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Verify the Smallest \( b \)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Verify that \( b = 259 \) allows \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) to factor into two binomials with integer coefficients.  
- **How to Achieve**: Substitute \( b = 259 \) into the quadratic, factor it using \( m = 8 \), \( n = 251 \), and check the resulting binomials.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( b = 259 \), the quadratic is:  
\[ x^2 + 259x + 2008 \]  
Using \( m = 8 \), \( n = 251 \):  
\[ (x + 8)(x + 251) = x^2 + 251x + 8x + 8 \cdot 251 = x^2 + 259x + 2008 \]  
Since \( 8 \cdot 251 = 2008 \) and \( 8 + 251 = 259 \), the factorization is correct:  
\[ x^2 + 259x + 2008 = (x + 8)(x + 251) \]  
Both binomials \( (x + 8) \) and \( (x + 251) \) have integer coefficients, satisfying the condition.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Confirm the Smallest \( b \)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm the current goal:  
- **Main Goal**: Find the smallest positive integer \( b \) for which \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) factors into two binomials with integer coefficients.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Express the quadratic as \( (x + m)(x + n) \) and set up equations \( m + n = b \), \( mn = 2008 \).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Find all integer pairs \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 2008 \).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Compute \( b = m + n \) and identify the smallest positive \( b \).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Verify the factorization for the smallest \( b \).  
- **Current Goal**: Confirm that \( b = 259 \) is the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
The hierarchy of goals shows we have:  
1. Set up the factoring conditions: \( m + n = b \), \( mn = 2008 \).  
2. Found all factor pairs of 2008, including negative pairs.  
3. Calculated \( b = m + n \) and identified \( b = 259 \) as the smallest positive value.  
4. Verified that \( b = 259 \) allows the quadratic to factor as \( (x + 8)(x + 251) \).  
To ensure \( b = 259 \) is the smallest, note that other positive \( b \) values (506, 1006, 2009) are larger. Negative \( b \) values are not considered since the problem specifies a positive integer \( b \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Consider Alternative Pairs
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Ensure no smaller positive \( b \) exists by reviewing factor pairs.  
- **Core Content**: Factor pairs of 2008 and their corresponding \( b = m + n \).
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
From Step 4, the factor pairs of 2008 yield:  
- Positive \( b \): 259, 506, 1006, 2009.  
- Negative \( b \): -259, -506, -1006, -2009.  
No positive \( b \) smaller than 259 was found. The factorization of 2008 (\( 2^3 \cdot 251 \)) ensures all pairs were considered, as we included both positive and negative integers. No other pairs produce a smaller positive \( b \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8: Final Verification
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current Goal**: Double-check the factorization and confirm no smaller \( b \) exists.  
- **How to Achieve**: Recompute the discriminant to ensure factorability and test smaller \( b \) values if necessary.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The quadratic \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) factors into integer-coefficient binomials if it has integer roots, i.e., the discriminant must be a perfect square:  
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2008 = b^2 - 8032 \]  
For \( b = 259 \):  
\[ \Delta = 259^2 - 8032 = 67081 - 8032 = 59049 = 243^2 \]  
Since the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic is factorable. The roots are:  
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} = \frac{-259 \pm 243}{2} \]  
- \( x_1 = \frac{-259 + 243}{2} = \frac{-16}{2} = -8 \)  
- \( x_2 = \frac{-259 - 243}{2} = \frac{-502}{2} = -251 \)  
Thus, the factorization is \( (x - (-8))(x - (-251)) = (x + 8)(x + 251) \), as before.  

To ensure no smaller \( b \), test values like \( b = 258 \):  
\[ \Delta = 258^2 - 8032 = 66564 - 8032 = 58532 \]  
Check if 58532 is a perfect square: \( 242^2 = 58564 \), so \( 58532 = 58564 - 32 \), not a perfect square. Similarly, for smaller \( b \), the discriminant rarely yields a perfect square due to the large constant 8032. Thus, \( b = 259 \) is likely the smallest.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The smallest positive integer \( b \) for which \( x^2 + bx + 2008 \) factors into a product of two binomials with integer coefficients is:  
\[ \boxed{259} \]  

The quadratic factors as \( (x + 8)(x + 251) \).
