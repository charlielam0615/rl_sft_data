**Problem Statement**: Find the number of integers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve the inequality and identify integer solutions.  
- Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \) to find the range of \( x \).  
- Subgoal 2: Identify all integers within the solution range.  
- Subgoal 3: Count the number of integers.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Take the square root of both sides, considering the absolute value, and solve for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start with the inequality:  
\[ (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \]  
Since the square is non-negative, take the square root of both sides:  
\[ \sqrt{(x + 3)^2} \leq \sqrt{1} \]  
\[ |x + 3| \leq 1 \]  
This implies:  
\[ -1 \leq x + 3 \leq 1 \]  
Subtract 3 from all parts:  
\[ -1 - 3 \leq x \leq 1 - 3 \]  
\[ -4 \leq x \leq -2 \]  
The solution to the inequality is \( x \in [-4, -2] \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify all integers within the solution range \( [-4, -2] \).  
**How to Achieve**: List all integers that satisfy \( -4 \leq x \leq -2 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The range \( [-4, -2] \) includes all real numbers from \(-4\) to \(-2\), inclusive. The integers in this interval are:  
\[ x = -4, -3, -2 \]  
These are the integers that satisfy \( -4 \leq x \leq -2 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Count the number of integers.  
**How to Achieve**: Count the integers identified in the previous step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The integers are \(-4\), \(-3\), and \(-2\).  
Count: There are 3 integers.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of integers that satisfy \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \) (Completed: Solution is \( x \in [-4, -2] \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify integers in \( [-4, -2] \) (Completed: Integers are \(-4, -3, -2\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count the number of integers (Completed: 3 integers).  
**Current Goal**: Completed (Count the number of integers).  
The final answer is 3 integers.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 3 integers that satisfy the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).
