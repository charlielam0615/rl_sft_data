**Problem Restatement**: Find the number of integers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve the inequality and find the integer solutions.  
1. Solve the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \) to find the range of real numbers for \( x \).  
2. Identify the integers within this range.  
3. Count the number of integers.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \) to find the range of real numbers for \( x \). This will be achieved by taking the square root of both sides and solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To solve \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \):  
- Since the expression is a square, it is non-negative, and we can take the square root of both sides.  
- \( \sqrt{(x + 3)^2} \leq \sqrt{1} \) gives \( |x + 3| \leq 1 \).  
- This implies \( -1 \leq x + 3 \leq 1 \).  
- Subtract 3 from all parts: \( -1 - 3 \leq x \leq 1 - 3 \), so \( -4 \leq x \leq -2 \).  
Thus, the solution for \( x \) is the interval \( [-4, -2] \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the integers within the range \( [-4, -2] \). This will be achieved by listing all integers that satisfy \( -4 \leq x \leq -2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The interval \( [-4, -2] \) includes all numbers from \( -4 \) to \( -2 \), inclusive. The integers in this range are:  
- \( x = -4 \)  
- \( x = -3 \)  
- \( x = -2 \)  
Thus, the integers are \( -4, -3, -2 \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the number of integers found in the previous step. This will be achieved by counting the listed integers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The integers that satisfy the inequality are \( -4, -3, -2 \). There are 3 integers.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the solution by verifying that the integers \( -4, -3, -2 \) satisfy the inequality and that no other integers do. This will be achieved by substituting the integers into the inequality and testing integers outside the range.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the integers \( -4, -3, -2 \):  
- For \( x = -4 \): \( (-4 + 3)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 \leq 1 \). Satisfies.  
- For \( x = -3 \): \( (-3 + 3)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \leq 1 \). Satisfies.  
- For \( x = -2 \): \( (-2 + 3)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \leq 1 \). Satisfies.  

Test integers outside the range:  
- For \( x = -5 \): \( (-5 + 3)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 > 1 \). Does not satisfy.  
- For \( x = -1 \): \( (-1 + 3)^2 = 2^2 = 4 > 1 \). Does not satisfy.  

The solution \( x = -4, -3, -2 \) is valid, and no other integers satisfy the inequality.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Management System**:  
- Main Goal: Find the number of integers that satisfy \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve the inequality to find the range of real numbers (Completed: \( [-4, -2] \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify integers in the range (Completed: \( -4, -3, -2 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Count the integers (Completed: 3 integers).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (Completed: Solution verified).  

**Current Goal**: None, as all subgoals are completed. The final answer is 3 integers.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: There are 3 integers that satisfy the inequality \( (x + 3)^2 \leq 1 \).
