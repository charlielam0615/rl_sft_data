**Problem Restatement**: Find the greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\).

---

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the problem, break it into subgoals:  
1. Compute the value of \(-\frac{15}{4}\).  
2. Identify the greatest integer less than this value (the floor function or the integer just below it).  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Compute the value of \(-\frac{15}{4}\).  
How to Achieve: Divide 15 by 4 and apply the negative sign.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compute \(-\frac{15}{4}\):  
\(\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\), so \(-\frac{15}{4} = -3.75\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\).  
How to Achieve: Find the largest integer that is strictly less than \(-3.75\), which is the integer immediately below it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The number \(-3.75\) lies between \(-3\) and \(-4\). The integers less than \(-3.75\) are \(-4, -5, -6, \ldots\). The greatest among them is \(-4\).  
Alternatively, the floor function \(\lfloor -3.75 \rfloor = -4\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(-3.75\), and since \(-3.75\) is not an integer, the greatest integer strictly less is \(-4\).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Verify the result that the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\) is \(-4\).  
How to Achieve: Check that \(-4\) is less than \(-3.75\) and that no larger integer satisfies this condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check: \(-4 < -3.75\) is true since \(-4 = -4.0\) and \(-4.0 < -3.75\).  
Next, test the next larger integer, \(-3\): \(-3 = -3.0\), and \(-3.0 > -3.75\), so \(-3\) is not less than \(-3.75\).  
Thus, \(-4\) is the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\).

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Goal Hierarchy:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Compute \(-\frac{15}{4}\) (completed: result is \(-3.75\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\) (completed: result is \(-4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed: \(-4\) is correct).  
Current Goal: Completed main goal.  
The greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\) is \(-4\).  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\) is \(-4\).
