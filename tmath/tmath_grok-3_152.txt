**Problem Statement**: Find the greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Convert \(-\frac{15}{4}\) to a decimal to understand its value.  
2. Identify the greatest integer less than this decimal (the floor function).  
3. Confirm the result aligns with the definition of the greatest integer less than a number.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Convert \(-\frac{15}{4}\) to a decimal.  
**How to Achieve**: Divide \(-15\) by \(4\) to obtain the decimal representation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Perform the division: \(-15 \div 4 = -3.75\). Thus, \(-\frac{15}{4} = -3.75\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\).  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the floor function, which gives the largest integer less than or equal to \(-3.75\), and adjust if necessary to ensure it is strictly less than \(-3.75\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The floor function for a number \(x\) gives \(\lfloor x \rfloor\), the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). For \(-3.75\), the integers to consider are \(-3\), \(-4\), etc. Since \(-3.75 < -3\), the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\) is \(-4\), as \(-4 < -3.75\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Convert \(-\frac{15}{4}\) to a decimal (completed: \(-3.75\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Identify the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\) (completed: \(-4\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Confirm the result (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the result aligns with the definition of the greatest integer less than a number.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \(-4\) is the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\).  
**How to Achieve**: Verify that \(-4 < -3.75\) and that no integer greater than \(-4\) (e.g., \(-3\)) is less than \(-3.75\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check: \(-4 < -3.75\) (true, since \(-4 = -4.0\) and \(-4.0 < -3.75\)).  
Check the next integer: \(-3 > -3.75\) (true, since \(-3 > -3.75\)).  
Thus, \(-4\) is the greatest integer less than \(-3.75\).  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greatest integer less than \(-\frac{15}{4}\) is \(-4\).
