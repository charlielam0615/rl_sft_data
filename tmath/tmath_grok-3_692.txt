**Problem Statement**: Determine the number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president from a club of 20 members (10 boys and 10 girls), where the president and vice-president must be of different genders.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the possible gender combinations for the president and vice-president (boy-girl or girl-boy).
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose a president and vice-president for each combination.
3. Sum the results to get the total number of valid selections.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the possible gender combinations for the president and vice-president. This can be achieved by listing the valid combinations where the president and vice-president are of different genders.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are two valid gender combinations:
- President is a boy, and vice-president is a girl.
- President is a girl, and vice-president is a boy.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to choose a president and vice-president for the combination where the president is a boy and the vice-president is a girl. This involves selecting one boy from 10 boys for president and one girl from 10 girls for vice-president.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For president (boy): There are 10 boys, so there are 10 choices.
For vice-president (girl): There are 10 girls, so there are 10 choices.
Total ways for this combination: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to choose a president and vice-president for the combination where the president is a girl and the vice-president is a boy. This involves selecting one girl from 10 girls for president and one boy from 10 boys for vice-president.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For president (girl): There are 10 girls, so there are 10 choices.
For vice-president (boy): There are 10 boys, so there are 10 choices.
Total ways for this combination: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a president and vice-president of different genders.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify possible gender combinations (completed: boy-girl and girl-boy).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate ways for president (boy), vice-president (girl) (completed: 100 ways).
  - Subgoal 3: Calculate ways for president (girl), vice-president (boy) (completed: 100 ways).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum the results to get the total number of ways (pending).
**Current Goal**: Sum the results of the two gender combinations to find the total number of ways.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sum the number of ways from the two gender combinations (boy-girl and girl-boy) to find the total number of ways to choose a president and vice-president.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Total ways = Ways for (boy president, girl vice-president) + Ways for (girl president, boy vice-president)
= \( 100 + 100 = 200 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculation by checking if the approach correctly accounts for all possible selections and adheres to the condition that the president and vice-president must be of different genders.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The calculation considered both gender combinations (boy-girl and girl-boy). Each combination yields \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) ways, and their sum is \( 100 + 100 = 200 \). The approach ensures that the president and vice-president are always of different genders, and since the roles are distinct (order matters), no additional constraints are violated. The calculation is consistent with combinatorial principles.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: There are 200 ways to choose a president and a vice-president from the club such that they are of different genders.
