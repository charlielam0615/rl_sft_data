### Problem Statement
We need to find the value of \( f(2) \) for a linear function \( f(x) \) that satisfies the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) and the condition \( f(1) = 4 \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find \( f(2) \).  
1. Assume \( f(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( f(x) = mx + b \).  
2. Determine the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \).  
3. Use the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) to set up a relationship between coefficients.  
4. Use the given condition \( f(1) = 4 \) to find specific values for the coefficients.  
5. Compute \( f(2) \) using the derived function.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Derive the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \) for the assumed linear function \( f(x) = mx + b \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve for the inverse by setting \( y = mx + b \), swapping \( x \) and \( y \), and solving for \( y \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Assume \( f(x) = mx + b \). Then:  
- Set \( y = mx + b \).  
- Swap variables: \( x = my + b \).  
- Solve for \( y \):  
  \( x = my + b \implies my = x - b \implies y = \frac{x - b}{m} \).  
Thus, the inverse is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m} \), provided \( m \neq 0 \).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Use the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) to establish a relationship between coefficients.  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( f(x) = mx + b \) and \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m} \) into the functional equation and simplify.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Substitute into \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \):  
- Left side: \( f(x) = mx + b \).  
- Right side: \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m} \), so \( 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 = 4 \cdot \frac{x - b}{m} + 6 = \frac{4(x - b)}{m} + 6 \).  
Equate both sides:  
\[ mx + b = \frac{4(x - b)}{m} + 6 \]  
Multiply through by \( m \) to clear the denominator:  
\[ m(mx + b) = 4(x - b) + 6m \]  
Expand:  
\[ m^2 x + mb = 4x - 4b + 6m \]  
Equate coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms:  
- Coefficient of \( x \): \( m^2 = 4 \implies m = \pm 2 \).  
- Constant terms: \( mb = -4b + 6m \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve for \( m \) and \( b \) using the constant term equation and the condition \( f(1) = 4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Solve the constant term equation \( mb = -4b + 6m \) for both cases (\( m = 2 \) and \( m = -2 \)), then apply \( f(1) = 4 \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
**Case 1: \( m = 2 \)**  
Substitute \( m = 2 \) into \( mb = -4b + 6m \):  
\[ 2b = -4b + 6 \cdot 2 \implies 2b = -4b + 12 \implies 6b = 12 \implies b = 2 \]  
So, \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \).  
Check with \( f(1) = 4 \):  
\[ f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 4 \] (satisfies the condition).  

**Case 2: \( m = -2 \)**  
Substitute \( m = -2 \):  
\[ -2b = -4b + 6 \cdot (-2) \implies -2b = -4b - 12 \implies 2b = -12 \implies b = -6 \]  
So, \( f(x) = -2x - 6 \).  
Check with \( f(1) = 4 \):  
\[ f(1) = -2 \cdot 1 - 6 = -2 - 6 = -8 \neq 4 \] (does not satisfy).  

Thus, \( m = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify the solution by checking if \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \) satisfies the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Compute \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \), substitute into the functional equation, and confirm consistency.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \):  
- Find inverse: Set \( y = 2x + 2 \implies x = 2y + 2 \implies 2y = x - 2 \implies y = \frac{x - 2}{2} \).  
  So, \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 2}{2} \).  
- Check functional equation:  
  Left side: \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \).  
  Right side: \( 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 = 4 \cdot \frac{x - 2}{2} + 6 = 2(x - 2) + 6 = 2x - 4 + 6 = 2x + 2 \).  
  \[ 2x + 2 = 2x + 2 \] (holds for all \( x \)).  
The function satisfies the equation.

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Compute \( f(2) \) using the derived function \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
\[ f(x) = 2x + 2 \implies f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
