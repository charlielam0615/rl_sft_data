### Problem Restatement
We need to find the value of \( f(2) \) for a linear function \( f(x) \) that satisfies the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) and the condition \( f(1) = 4 \). Since \( f(x) \) is linear, it can be expressed as \( f(x) = mx + b \), and we must determine \( m \) and \( b \) to compute \( f(2) \).

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:
1. Express \( f(x) \) as a linear function, \( f(x) = mx + b \).
2. Determine the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \).
3. Use the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) to set up equations involving \( m \) and \( b \).
4. Use the given condition \( f(1) = 4 \) to create an additional equation.
5. Solve the system of equations to find \( m \) and \( b \).

### Step 2: Reach Goal

**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Express \( f(x) \) and \( f^{-1}(x) \), and set up the functional equation.

**How to Achieve**: Assume \( f(x) = mx + b \). Find the inverse \( f^{-1}(x) \) by solving \( y = mx + b \) for \( x \). Then, substitute \( f(x) \) and \( f^{-1}(x) \) into the given equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \) to form an equation in terms of \( m \) and \( b \).

Assume \( f(x) = mx + b \). To find the inverse, set \( y = f(x) = mx + b \), and solve for \( x \):

\[
y = mx + b \implies mx = y - b \implies x = \frac{y - b}{m} \quad (m \neq 0).
\]

Thus, the inverse function is:

\[
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m}.
\]

Now, substitute into the functional equation \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \):

\[
f(x) = mx + b,
\]

\[
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m},
\]

\[
4f^{-1}(x) + 6 = 4 \cdot \frac{x - b}{m} + 6 = \frac{4(x - b)}{m} + 6.
\]

So, the functional equation becomes:

\[
mx + b = \frac{4(x - b)}{m} + 6.
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \( m \):

\[
m(mx + b) = 4(x - b) + 6m.
\]

Expand both sides:

\[
m^2 x + mb = 4x - 4b + 6m.
\]

For this equation to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( x \) and the constant terms must be equal. Equate the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms:

- **Coefficient of \( x \)**:

\[
m^2 = 4 \implies m = \pm 2.
\]

- **Constant terms**:

\[
mb = -4b + 6m.
\]

We now have two cases based on \( m = 2 \) or \( m = -2 \).

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Use the condition \( f(1) = 4 \) and the constant term equation to solve for \( m \) and \( b \).

**How to Achieve**: Substitute \( m = 2 \) and \( m = -2 \) into the constant term equation and the condition \( f(1) = 4 \) to form a system of equations. Solve for \( b \) and check consistency.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the condition \( f(1) = 4 \):

\[
f(x) = mx + b \implies f(1) = m \cdot 1 + b = m + b = 4.
\]

So, we have:

\[
m + b = 4. \quad (1)
\]

From the constant terms in Step 2:

\[
mb = -4b + 6m. \quad (2)
\]

**Case 1: \( m = 2 \)**

Substitute \( m = 2 \) into equations (1) and (2):

- Equation (1):

\[
2 + b = 4 \implies b = 2.
\]

- Equation (2):

\[
2b = -4b + 6 \cdot 2 \implies 2b = -4b + 12 \implies 6b = 12 \implies b = 2.
\]

Both equations are consistent, giving \( b = 2 \). Thus, for \( m = 2 \):

\[
f(x) = 2x + 2.
\]

**Case 2: \( m = -2 \)**

Substitute \( m = -2 \) into equations (1) and (2):

- Equation (1):

\[
-2 + b = 4 \implies b = 6.
\]

- Equation (2):

\[
(-2)b = -4b + 6(-2) \implies -2b = -4b - 12 \implies 2b = -12 \implies b = -6.
\]

This is inconsistent (\( b = 6 \) vs. \( b = -6 \)). Thus, \( m = -2 \) is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the function is:

\[
f(x) = 2x + 2.
\]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**

**Current Goal**: Verify that \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \) satisfies the functional equation and the given condition.

**How to Achieve**: Compute \( f^{-1}(x) \) for \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \), substitute into \( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \), and check if the equation holds. Also, verify \( f(1) = 4 \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \), find the inverse:

\[
y = 2x + 2 \implies 2x = y - 2 \implies x = \frac{y - 2}{2} \implies f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 2}{2}.
\]

Check the functional equation:

\[
4f^{-1}(x) + 6 = 4 \cdot \frac{x - 2}{2} + 6 = 2(x - 2) + 6 = 2x - 4 + 6 = 2x + 2.
\]

\[
f(x) = 2x + 2.
\]

Since \( 2x + 2 = 2x + 2 \), the functional equation holds.

Verify the given condition:

\[
f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 4.
\]

This matches \( f(1) = 4 \), so the solution is consistent.
