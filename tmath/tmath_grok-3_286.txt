**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the inequality \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \), break down the goal into subgoals:  
1. Solve the quadratic equation \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \) to find the boundary points.  
2. Determine the intervals where the inequality \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) holds.  
3. Identify the greatest value of \( a \) from the solution set.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the quadratic equation \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \) to find the roots, which will serve as boundary points for the inequality. This can be achieved by factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Rewrite the quadratic: \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \).  
We need to find two numbers that multiply to 21 and add to \(-10\). Testing pairs:  
- \(-3\) and \(-7\): \((-3) \cdot (-7) = 21\), \(-3 + (-7) = -10\).  

Thus, factorize:  
\[ a^2 - 10a + 21 = (a - 3)(a - 7) = 0. \]  
Roots are \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the intervals where \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) holds, using the roots \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \). This can be achieved by analyzing the sign of the quadratic expression across the intervals defined by the roots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = (a - 3)(a - 7) \) has roots at \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \). Since the coefficient of \( a^2 \) is positive (1), the parabola opens upward, so the expression is non-positive (\(\leq 0\)) between the roots, including the endpoints.  

Test intervals defined by the roots \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \):  
- **Interval 1**: \( a < 3 \). Choose \( a = 2 \):  
  \[ (2 - 3)(2 - 7) = (-1)(-5) = 5 > 0. \]  
- **Interval 2**: \( 3 < a < 7 \). Choose \( a = 5 \):  
  \[ (5 - 3)(5 - 7) = (2)(-2) = -4 \leq 0. \]  
- **Interval 3**: \( a > 7 \). Choose \( a = 8 \):  
  \[ (8 - 3)(8 - 7) = (5)(1) = 5 > 0. \]  
- **Boundary points**: At \( a = 3 \), \( (3 - 3)(3 - 7) = 0 \); at \( a = 7 \), \( (7 - 3)(7 - 7) = 0 \). Both satisfy \(\leq 0\).  

Thus, the inequality holds for \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the greatest value of \( a \) such that \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Solve \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \) (completed: roots are \( a = 3 \), \( a = 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine intervals where \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) (completed: \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Identify the greatest value of \( a \) (current goal).  

**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest value of \( a \) from the solution set \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \).  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the greatest value of \( a \) from the solution set \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \). This can be achieved by examining the upper bound of the interval.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The solution set is \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \). The greatest value of \( a \) in this interval is the upper bound, \( a = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that \( a = 7 \) is the greatest value satisfying \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \). This can be achieved by checking the inequality at \( a = 7 \) and confirming no larger value satisfies it.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check at \( a = 7 \):  
\[ 7^2 - 10 \cdot 7 + 21 = 49 - 70 + 21 = 0 \leq 0. \]  
The inequality holds.  

Test a value slightly greater, e.g., \( a = 7.1 \):  
\[ 7.1^2 - 10 \cdot 7.1 + 21 = 50.41 - 71 + 21 = 0.41 > 0. \]  
The inequality does not hold for \( a > 7 \).  

Thus, \( a = 7 \) is the greatest value satisfying the inequality.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The greatest value of \( a \) such that \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) is \( 7 \).
