**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the inequality \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \), break down the problem into subgoals:  
1. Solve the quadratic equation \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \) to find the roots, which define the boundary points of the inequality.  
2. Determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero.  
3. Identify the greatest value of \( a \) within these intervals.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Solve the quadratic equation \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \) to find the roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) for the equation \( a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0 \), where the variable is \( a \), and coefficients are \( A = 1 \), \( B = -10 \), \( C = 21 \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply the quadratic formula:  
\[ a = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 21}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 84}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm 4}{2} \]  
Roots are:  
\[ a = \frac{10 + 4}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{10 - 4}{2} = 3 \]  
The roots of the equation are \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \).

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Determine the intervals where \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the quadratic \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \) has a positive leading coefficient (\( A = 1 \)), the parabola opens upward. The expression is less than or equal to zero between the roots (inclusive). Test the interval between the roots \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 7 \), and include the roots since the inequality includes equality.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The quadratic can be factored using the roots:  
\[ a^2 - 10a + 21 = (a - 3)(a - 7) \]  
For \( (a - 3)(a - 7) \leq 0 \), the product is negative or zero when \( a \) is between the roots, including the endpoints:  
- At \( a = 3 \): \( (3 - 3)(3 - 7) = 0 \cdot (-4) = 0 \leq 0 \)  
- At \( a = 7 \): \( (7 - 3)(7 - 7) = 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \leq 0 \)  
- Test \( a = 5 \) (between 3 and 7): \( (5 - 3)(5 - 7) = 2 \cdot (-2) = -4 \leq 0 \)  
- Test \( a = 2 \) (left of 3): \( (2 - 3)(2 - 7) = (-1) \cdot (-5) = 5 > 0 \)  
- Test \( a = 8 \) (right of 7): \( (8 - 3)(8 - 7) = 5 \cdot 1 = 5 > 0 \)  
Thus, the solution to \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) is \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \).

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the greatest value of \( a \) within the interval \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Since the inequality holds for \( a \in [3, 7] \), the greatest value of \( a \) is the upper bound of this interval.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The interval where \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \) is \( 3 \leq a \leq 7 \). The greatest value of \( a \) in this interval is \( a = 7 \).  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( a = 7 \) is the greatest value satisfying \( a^2 - 10a + 21 \leq 0 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Check the value at \( a = 7 \), and test a value slightly greater than 7 to confirm the inequality does not hold beyond the interval.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- At \( a = 7 \):  
\[ 7^2 - 10 \cdot 7 + 21 = 49 - 70 + 21 = -0 = 0 \leq 0 \]  
The inequality holds.  
- At \( a = 7.1 \):  
\[ 7.1^2 - 10 \cdot 7.1 + 21 = 50.41 - 71 + 21 = 0.41 > 0 \]  
The inequality does not hold for \( a > 7 \).  
This confirms that \( a = 7 \) is the greatest value satisfying the inequality.
