### Problem Statement
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of solving \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides.  
2. Solve the resulting equation for the expression inside the cube root.  
3. Isolate and solve for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Eliminate the cube root in \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\).  
- **How to Achieve:** Cube both sides of the equation to remove the cube root, simplifying the equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Starting with \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\), cube both sides:  
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}}\right)^3 = (-4)^3
\]
This simplifies to:  
\[
3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64
\]  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Solve the equation \(3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64\) for \( x \).  
- **How to Achieve:** Isolate the term involving \( x \), then solve the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From \(3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64\), subtract 3 from both sides:  
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = -64 - 3 = -67
\]  
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):  
\[
\frac{1}{x} = 67
\]  
Take the reciprocal of both sides:  
\[
x = \frac{1}{67}
\]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify the solution \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) satisfies the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\).  
- **How to Achieve:** Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) into the original equation and check if the left-hand side equals \(-4\).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) into \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}}\):  
\[
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{67}} = 67
\]  
\[
3 - \frac{1}{x} = 3 - 67 = -64
\]  
\[
\sqrt[3]{-64} = \sqrt[3]{(-4)^3} = -4
\]  
The left-hand side equals \(-4\), matching the right-hand side. The solution is valid.  
[/IMP]
