**Problem Statement**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of solving \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\) into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Isolate the cube root expression.  
2. Eliminate the cube root by raising both sides to the third power.  
3. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).  
4. Verify the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to isolate the cube root expression and eliminate it by cubing both sides. This involves raising both sides of \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\) to the third power to remove the cube root, then simplifying the resulting equation.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with the given equation:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4
\]  
Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:  
\[
\left( \sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} \right)^3 = (-4)^3
\]  
This simplifies to:  
\[
3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve the equation \(3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64\) for \( x \). This involves isolating the term involving \( x \), then solving for \( x \).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Start with:  
\[
3 - \frac{1}{x} = -64
\]  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = -64 - 3
\]  
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = -67
\]  
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):  
\[
\frac{1}{x} = 67
\]  
Take the reciprocal of both sides:  
\[
x = \frac{1}{67}
\]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the solution \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) by substituting it back into the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{x}} = -4\) and checking if it holds.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) into the original equation:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{3 - \frac{1}{\frac{1}{67}}}
\]  
Simplify the inner expression:  
\[
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{67}} = 67
\]  
So:  
\[
3 - \frac{1}{\frac{1}{67}} = 3 - 67 = -64
\]  
Now compute the cube root:  
\[
\sqrt[3]{-64} = \sqrt[3]{(-4)^3} = -4
\]  
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side:  
\[
-4 = -4
\]  
The solution \( x = \frac{1}{67} \) is valid.
