**Problem Restatement**: Find the sum of the series \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Recognize the series as a geometric series.  
2. Identify the first term and common ratio.  
3. Determine the number of terms.  
4. Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
5. Compute the final sum.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Recognize the series as a geometric series.  
How to Achieve: Analyze the terms \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\) to confirm they form a geometric series by checking if each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The terms are \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{9}\), \(\frac{1}{27}\), \(\frac{1}{81}\). Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \(\frac{1}{3}\):  
- \(\frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\),  
- \(\frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\),  
- \(\frac{1}{81} = \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\).  
This confirms the series is geometric with a common ratio of \(\frac{1}{3}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Identify the first term and common ratio.  
How to Achieve: Extract the first term from the series and confirm the common ratio from the pattern observed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The first term is \(\frac{1}{3}\). The common ratio, as determined in Step 2, is \(\frac{1}{3}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Determine the number of terms.  
How to Achieve: Count the terms given in the series \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The series has four terms: \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\), \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\). Thus, the number of terms \(n = 4\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Apply the geometric series sum formula.  
How to Achieve: Use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\), where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For the series:  
- First term \(a = \frac{1}{3}\),  
- Common ratio \(r = \frac{1}{3}\),  
- Number of terms \(n = 4\).  
The sum is:  
\[ S_4 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} \]  
Calculate the numerator:  
\[ \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{81} \]  
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{81} = \frac{80}{81} \]  
Calculate the denominator:  
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \]  
So:  
\[ S_4 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{\frac{80}{81}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{80}{81} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{80}{162} = \frac{40}{81} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Check the validity of the computed sum.  
How to Achieve: Manually sum the terms \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{27} + \frac{1}{81}\) and compare with the formula result.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compute the sum manually:  
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{27}{81}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{9}{81}, \quad \frac{1}{27} = \frac{3}{81}, \quad \frac{1}{81} = \frac{1}{81} \]  
\[ \frac{27 + 9 + 3 + 1}{81} = \frac{40}{81} \]  
This matches the result from the formula, confirming the sum is \(\frac{40}{81}\).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review)

[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\) is \(\frac{40}{81}\).
