**Problem Restatement**: Calculate the sum of the geometric series \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the type of series and its parameters (first term, common ratio, number of terms).  
2. Apply the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series.  
3. Compute the numerical result.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the type of series and its parameters. This will be achieved by analyzing the given terms to confirm it is a geometric series, determining the first term (\(a\)), common ratio (\(r\)), and number of terms (\(n\)).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The given series is \(\frac{1}{3} + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\).  
- **First term (\(a\))**: \(\frac{1}{3}\).  
- **Common ratio (\(r\))**: Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \(\frac{1}{3}\), so \(r = \frac{1}{3}\).  
- **Number of terms (\(n\))**: There are 4 terms (\(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{27}, \frac{1}{81}\)).  
This confirms the series is geometric with \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), \(r = \frac{1}{3}\), and \(n = 4\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series. Using the parameters identified (\(a = \frac{1}{3}\), \(r = \frac{1}{3}\), \(n = 4\)), apply the formula \(S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\) to compute the sum.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:  
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]  
Substitute the values:  
- \(a = \frac{1}{3}\),  
- \(r = \frac{1}{3}\),  
- \(n = 4\).  

Calculate:  
- \(r^n = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{81}\),  
- \(1 - r^n = 1 - \frac{1}{81} = \frac{80}{81}\),  
- \(1 - r = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\).  

Thus:  
\[ S_4 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{\frac{80}{81}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{80}{81} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{80}{162} = \frac{40}{81}. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the correctness of the computed sum \(\frac{40}{81}\). This will be achieved by manually calculating the sum of the terms and comparing it to the result from the formula.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Calculate the sum manually:  
- \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{27}{81}\),  
- \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} = \frac{9}{81}\),  
- \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27} = \frac{3}{81}\),  
- \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{81}\).  

Sum:  
\[ \frac{27}{81} + \frac{9}{81} + \frac{3}{81} + \frac{1}{81} = \frac{27 + 9 + 3 + 1}{81} = \frac{40}{81}. \]  

The manual calculation matches the result from the formula, confirming the sum is \(\frac{40}{81}\).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Calculate the sum of \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the series type and parameters (completed: geometric series, \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), \(r = \frac{1}{3}\), \(n = 4\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Apply the geometric series sum formula (completed: result is \(\frac{40}{81}\)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result (completed: manual sum matches \(\frac{40}{81}\)).  

**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, solution achieved).  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the series is \(\frac{40}{81}\).
