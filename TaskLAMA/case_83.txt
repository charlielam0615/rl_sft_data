**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a worm bed with a wooden box.  
  - Subgoal 1: Pick a shady spot (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 2: Measure the area.  
  - Subgoal 3: Dig a hole of the required size.  
  - Subgoal 4: Make a box frame with wood.  
  - Subgoal 5: Place the box frame in the dug place.  
  - Subgoal 6: Place torn newsprint into the worm bed box.  
  - Subgoal 7: Add some dirt.  
  - Subgoal 8: Include peat moss.  
  - Subgoal 9: Add worms into the worm bed.  
**Current Goal**: Pick a shady spot for the worm bed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pick a shady spot for the worm bed. This will be achieved by evaluating the available outdoor area to identify a location that is consistently shaded, protected from direct sunlight, and suitable for a worm bed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To pick a shady spot, assess the outdoor area during different times of the day to identify a location with consistent shade, such as under a tree or near a building. Ensure the spot is level, accessible, and protected from heavy rain or flooding. Select a spot that meets these criteria to proceed with measuring the area.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to measure the area of the chosen shady spot. This will be achieved by using a tape measure to determine the dimensions needed for the worm bed box.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Use a tape measure to measure the length and width of the shady spot, aiming for a size suitable for a worm bed (e.g., 3 feet by 2 feet). Record the measurements to determine the size of the hole and the wooden box frame. Ensure the measurements account for the box fitting comfortably in the spot.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the measurements of the area to ensure they are accurate and suitable for the worm bed. This will be achieved by rechecking the measurements and confirming the spotâ€™s suitability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Recheck the recorded measurements using the tape measure to confirm accuracy. Verify that the chosen spot remains shady and is large enough to accommodate the planned box size. Adjust the measurements if any discrepancies are found or if the spot is unsuitable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dig a hole of the required size based on the validated measurements. This will be achieved by using a shovel to dig a hole that matches the dimensions of the wooden box frame.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using a shovel, dig a hole in the shady spot to match the measured dimensions (e.g., 3 feet by 2 feet) and a depth suitable for the box frame (e.g., 6-8 inches). Ensure the hole is level and free of rocks or debris to allow the box to sit securely.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a box frame with wood. This will be achieved by assembling wooden planks into a rectangular frame that fits the dug hole.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Gather wooden planks, nails, and a hammer. Cut the planks to match the measured dimensions (e.g., two 3-foot planks and two 2-foot planks for the sides). Assemble them into a rectangular frame by nailing the corners together, ensuring the frame is sturdy and fits the dug hole.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the box frame in the dug hole. This will be achieved by carefully positioning the wooden frame into the prepared hole.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carefully lower the assembled wooden box frame into the dug hole, ensuring it sits level and flush with the ground. Adjust the hole if necessary to achieve a secure fit. Confirm the frame is stable before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a worm bed with a wooden box.  
  - Subgoal 1: Pick a shady spot (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Measure the area (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Dig a hole of the required size (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Make a box frame with wood (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Place the box frame in the dug place (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Place torn newsprint into the worm bed box (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 7: Add some dirt.  
  - Subgoal 8: Include peat moss.  
  - Subgoal 9: Add worms into the worm bed.  
**Current Goal**: Place torn newsprint into the worm bed box.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place torn newsprint into the worm bed box. This will be achieved by shredding newspaper and layering it inside the wooden frame.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Collect old newspapers and tear them into small strips. Spread the torn newsprint evenly across the bottom of the wooden box frame to create a bedding layer approximately 2-3 inches thick. Ensure the newsprint is free of glossy or colored paper, as these may be harmful to worms.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add some dirt to the worm bed box. This will be achieved by adding a layer of garden soil over the newsprint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Gather garden soil and spread a thin layer (about 1-2 inches) over the torn newsprint in the box. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged, as worms require a damp environment. Mix the soil lightly with the newsprint to create a suitable base.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to include peat moss in the worm bed. This will be achieved by adding a layer of peat moss over the dirt to enhance moisture retention.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Obtain peat moss and spread a 1-inch layer over the dirt in the worm bed box. Lightly mix it with the soil and newsprint to ensure even distribution. Moisten the peat moss slightly to maintain a damp environment suitable for worms.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add worms to the worm bed. Retrieve information related to the worm bed setup to ensure all prior steps have been completed correctly to support the worms.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information**:  
- A shady spot was selected to protect worms from direct sunlight (Step 3).  
- The area was measured and a hole was dug to fit the wooden box frame (Steps 4, 6).  
- A wooden box frame was constructed and placed securely in the hole (Steps 7, 8).  
- Torn newsprint, dirt, and peat moss were added to create a suitable bedding environment (Steps 10, 11, 12).  
All prior steps have been completed, ensuring the worm bed is ready for worms.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add worms to the worm bed. This will be achieved by introducing composting worms into the prepared bed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Purchase or obtain composting worms (e.g., red wigglers). Gently place the worms on top of the peat moss layer in the worm bed box. Add a small amount of food scraps (e.g., vegetable peels) to encourage the worms to settle. Cover the bed with a breathable lid or burlap to maintain moisture and darkness.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
