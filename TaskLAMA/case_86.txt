--- Case 86 ---
### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to apply for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan using the Lendio application, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) framework. The plan must be executed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, until all substeps are completed.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of applying for a PPP loan into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The substeps are:  
1. Install Lendio application  
2. Open Lendio app  
3. Create a Lendio account  
4. Access your PPP application  
5. Verify existing company information  
6. Validate identity documents  
7. Verify payroll documents  
8. Fill the basic details  
9. Check all the details  
10. Submit your application  

These subgoals must follow the dependencies, e.g., installing the app must precede opening it, and so forth. The first subgoal is to install the Lendio application.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to install the Lendio application. This will be achieved by downloading and installing the Lendio app from a relevant app store (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store) on the user’s device.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Search for the Lendio app in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, depending on the device. Download and install the app following the standard installation process for the device’s operating system. Ensure the device has sufficient storage and a stable internet connection.
