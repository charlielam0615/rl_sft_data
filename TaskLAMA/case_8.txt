--- Case 8 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for installing SmartCore Ultra flooring in a bedroom, following the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The plan must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework, selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The substeps and their dependencies must be followed to ensure a logical sequence, and the plan should continue until all steps are completed.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of installing SmartCore Ultra flooring into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Measure the floor in the bedroom.  
2. Clean the space.  
3. Choose the starting point.  
4. Place the first plank to the corner.  
5. Use spacers to maintain the gap along the walls.  
6. Slice the planks needed to fit in the space.  
7. Place the planks according to the design.  
8. Make sure to attach the spacers properly.  
These subgoals follow the dependency chain, where each step must be completed before the next.  
[/PLANNING]

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Install SmartCore Ultra flooring in the bedroom.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the floor in the bedroom.  
  - Subgoal 2: Clean the space.  
  - Subgoal 3: Choose the starting point.  
  - Subgoal 4: Place the first plank to the corner.  
  - Subgoal 5: Use spacers to maintain the gap along the walls.  
  - Subgoal 6: Slice the planks needed to fit in the space.  
  - Subgoal 7: Place the planks according to the design.  
  - Subgoal 8: Make sure to attach the spacers properly.  
**Current Goal:** Measure the floor in the bedroom.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to measure the floor in the bedroom. This will be achieved by using a tape measure to determine the dimensions of the room and calculating a 10% overage for material needs.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To measure the floor, use a tape measure to record the length and width of the bedroom. Multiply these dimensions to calculate the square footage. Add 10% to the total to account for cuts and waste, ensuring enough SmartCore Ultra flooring is purchased. For example, if the room is 12 ft by 10 ft, the area is 120 sq ft, and with 10% overage, plan for 132 sq ft of flooring. Record these measurements for reference in later steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the measurements taken in the previous step. This will be achieved by rechecking the dimensions and confirming the calculations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the bedroom’s dimensions using the tape measure to ensure accuracy. Verify the length and width measurements match the initial recordings. Recalculate the square footage and overage to confirm the required flooring amount. If discrepancies are found, adjust the measurements and update the material estimate accordingly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to clean the space. This will be achieved by removing furniture, sweeping, and ensuring the subfloor is level and free of debris.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Remove all furniture and obstacles from the bedroom. Sweep or vacuum the floor to remove dust and debris. Inspect the subfloor for uneven areas or damage, and use a leveling compound if necessary to ensure a smooth surface for the SmartCore Ultra flooring installation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to choose the starting point. This will be achieved by selecting a corner that ensures the planks align with the room’s longest wall for aesthetic and structural consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Identify the longest wall in the bedroom to align the planks parallel to it, as this typically provides the best visual effect. Choose a starting corner along this wall, preferably one with minimal obstructions like doorways or vents. Use a chalk line to mark a straight guideline from this corner to ensure accurate plank placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Install SmartCore Ultra flooring in the bedroom.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the floor in the bedroom (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Clean the space (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Choose the starting point (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Place the first plank to the corner.  
  - Subgoal 5: Use spacers to maintain the gap along the walls.  
  - Subgoal 6: Slice the planks needed to fit in the space.  
  - Subgoal 7: Place the planks according to the design.  
  - Subgoal 8: Make sure to attach the spacers properly.  
**Current Goal:** Place the first plank to the corner.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to place the first plank to the corner. This will be achieved by aligning the first SmartCore Ultra plank along the chalk line in the chosen starting corner.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Position the first SmartCore Ultra plank in the selected corner, ensuring its edge aligns with the chalk line. Verify that the plank’s tongue or groove (depending on the product’s locking system) faces the correct direction for subsequent planks. Press the plank firmly to ensure it sits flat against the subfloor.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to use spacers to maintain the gap along the walls. This will be achieved by placing spacers between the plank and the wall to ensure a consistent expansion gap.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place 1/4-inch spacers between the first plank and the adjacent walls to maintain an expansion gap, as SmartCore Ultra flooring requires this space to accommodate temperature-related expansion and contraction. Ensure spacers are placed at regular intervals (every 12–18 inches) along the wall to keep the gap consistent.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to slice the planks needed to fit in the space. Retrieve information about the room’s measurements to guide the cutting process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The measurements from Step 3 indicate the bedroom’s dimensions (e.g., 12 ft by 10 ft, requiring 132 sq ft of flooring with overage). These measurements are critical for determining the size and number of planks to cut, especially for the last row or around obstacles like doorways.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to slice the planks needed to fit in the space. This will be achieved by measuring and cutting planks to fit the remaining areas of the room using a utility knife or saw.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the room’s measurements, measure the space where planks need to be cut to fit, such as at the end of a row or around obstacles. Mark the planks with a pencil and straightedge, then use a utility knife or jigsaw to cut the SmartCore Ultra planks to the required size. Ensure cuts are precise to maintain tight seams and a professional finish.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to place the planks according to the design. This will be achieved by laying subsequent planks, connecting them via the locking system, and following the chosen pattern.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Continue laying planks row by row, connecting each plank to the previous one using the SmartCore Ultra locking system (e.g., tongue-and-groove or click-lock). Stagger the seams between rows by at least 6 inches for structural stability and aesthetic appeal. Use a tapping block and mallet to ensure tight connections between planks.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to make sure to attach the spacers properly. This will be achieved by checking and securing spacers along the walls to maintain the expansion gap throughout the installation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect all spacers along the walls to ensure they are still in place and maintaining a consistent 1/4-inch gap. Adjust or replace any spacers that have shifted during plank installation. Once all planks are laid, remove the spacers carefully to avoid disturbing the flooring.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals are completed.  
[/PLANNING]
