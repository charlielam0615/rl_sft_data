**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for checking an O2 sensor using a clamp meter. The task involves following specific substeps in a defined order based on temporal dependencies, under the assumption that the process is performed with a clamp meter. The substeps include ensuring the exhaust system is cold, setting up the clamp meter, positioning it on the sensor wires, starting the engine, monitoring the readings, and verifying if the readings fall within the acceptable range of 0.25 to 1.5 amperes.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
In this step, I will break down the overall goal of "checking the O2 sensor with a clamp meter" into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will follow the sequence of tasks as outlined:  
1. Ensure the exhaust system on the engine is cold.  
2. Turn the clamp meter on to DC current/DC amperage mode.  
3. Place the clamp around either of the oxygen sensor heater power wires.  
4. Turn the engine on.  
5. Monitor the reading on the clamp meter.  
6. Verify that the reading is between 0.25 and 1.5 amperes.  
These subgoals are structured to align with the temporal dependencies provided, ensuring each step is performed in the correct order.

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Ensure the exhaust system on the engine is cold.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To ensure the exhaust system on the engine is cold, I will first check if the engine has been in use recently. If it has, I will wait for at least 30-60 minutes or until the exhaust components are cool to the touch. This step is critical for safety and to prevent damage to the clamp meter or inaccurate measurements due to heat interference. I will physically inspect the exhaust system by cautiously touching it (with appropriate protection if necessary) to confirm it is at a safe temperature before moving to the next step.
