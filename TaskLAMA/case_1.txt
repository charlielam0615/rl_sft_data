--- Case 1 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to create a detailed plan for building an octagon picnic table using cedar wood, following the provided substeps and dependencies, and adhering to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework. The plan must respect the temporal dependencies between substeps and use cedar wood as specified in the assumptions. The substeps are:

1. Take the length of the octagon picnic table to build.
2. Prepare the cedar wood top base.
3. Attach the support for the top.
4. Slice the cedar wood legs.
5. Attach the legs to the cedar wood top base.
6. Make the seat support frame.
7. Add the bench seats.
8. Sand the surface of the cedar octagon picnic table.

The dependencies ensure that certain steps are completed before others, as outlined. I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, using the [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and ensuring the plan is complete and consistent with the given information.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building an octagon picnic table into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The main goal is to construct the table, which requires completing all substeps in an order that respects the dependencies. Subgoals include determining the table’s dimensions, preparing materials, assembling components, and finishing the table. The first subgoal is to determine the table’s length, as it is a prerequisite for other steps.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the length of the octagon picnic table. This will be achieved by selecting a standard size suitable for a picnic table, considering typical dimensions for an octagon table (e.g., diameter or side length) and ensuring it meets practical needs for seating and stability.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To determine the length, a standard octagon picnic table typically has a diameter of about 7 to 8 feet to comfortably seat 8 people. For this plan, assume a diameter of 7.5 feet (90 inches), with each side of the octagon approximately 31 inches (calculated using the formula for the side length of a regular octagon: \( s = D \cdot \sin(45^\circ/2) \), where \( D \) is the diameter). This size ensures adequate seating and is feasible for cedar wood construction. Record the side length as 31 inches and the diameter as 90 inches for use in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build an octagon picnic table using cedar wood.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the length of the table (completed: diameter = 90 inches, side length = 31 inches).  
  - Subgoal 2: Prepare the cedar wood top base (pending).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach the support for the top (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Slice the cedar wood legs (pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach the legs to the top base (pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Make the seat support frame (pending).  
  - Subgoal 7: Add the bench seats (pending).  
  - Subgoal 8: Sand the surface of the table (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Prepare the cedar wood top base.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the cedar wood top base. This will be achieved by cutting cedar wood boards to form the octagonal tabletop, using the dimensions determined (side length = 31 inches, diameter = 90 inches), and ensuring precise cuts for a uniform shape.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using cedar wood, cut eight boards to form the octagonal tabletop. Each board should be cut to account for the 31-inch side length, with 45-degree angles at the ends to form the octagon when joined. Use 2x6 cedar boards, arranging them to cover the 90-inch diameter. Approximately 10–12 boards (each 90 inches long) will be needed to span the diameter, trimmed to form the octagonal shape. Secure the boards temporarily with clamps, trace the octagon outline using a template or jig, and cut using a circular saw. Sand the edges lightly to ensure smooth joints.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify the validity of the cedar wood top base preparation. This will be achieved by checking the dimensions, shape, and stability of the cut boards to ensure they form a proper octagon suitable for the table.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Measure the assembled tabletop to confirm the diameter is 90 inches and each side is approximately 31 inches. Verify that the angles between sides are 135 degrees (internal angle of a regular octagon). Check that the boards are securely aligned and the surface is flat. If any discrepancies are found (e.g., uneven sides or gaps), adjust by recutting or sanding the affected boards. Ensure the cedar wood is free of defects like cracks or warps that could affect structural integrity.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
The next steps involve attaching the support for the top and slicing the cedar wood legs, which can be done concurrently as they both depend on the top base being prepared. Break down these steps into subgoals: (1) design and attach a support frame under the tabletop to ensure stability, and (2) cut cedar wood to create legs of appropriate length and angle to support the table.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the support for the top. This will be achieved by constructing a cedar wood frame beneath the tabletop to provide structural support, using cross-braces and securing them with screws.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Construct a support frame using 2x4 cedar boards. Create a square frame (approximately 60x60 inches) to fit within the octagon’s diameter, with diagonal cross-braces for added stability. Attach the frame to the underside of the tabletop using 3-inch wood screws, ensuring the frame is centered (15 inches from the outer edge on all sides). Pre-drill holes to prevent wood splitting. Verify the frame is level and securely fastened, distributing weight evenly across the tabletop.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to slice the cedar wood legs. This will be achieved by cutting cedar wood to create eight legs, each at a length and angle suitable for supporting the octagon tabletop at a standard picnic table height.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use 4x4 cedar posts for the legs. Cut eight legs, each 30 inches long, with a 10-degree angle at the top to attach flush to the underside of the tabletop, ensuring the table height is approximately 30 inches (standard picnic table height). The bottom of each leg should be cut flat to rest on the ground. Sand the cut edges to remove splinters and ensure uniformity. Label each leg for consistent placement around the octagon.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the support frame and legs. This will be achieved by checking the stability of the support frame and ensuring the legs are cut to the correct length and angle for attachment.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the support frame by applying pressure to the tabletop to ensure it does not flex or wobble. Confirm the frame is securely attached with no loose screws. For the legs, measure each to verify they are 30 inches long with a 10-degree angle at the top. Dry-fit one leg to the tabletop to check the angle fits flush against the support frame. Adjust any legs that do not align properly by recutting or sanding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the legs to the cedar wood top base. This will be achieved by securing the eight legs to the support frame and tabletop, ensuring stability and proper alignment.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Position the eight legs evenly around the octagon, approximately 45 degrees apart, attaching each leg to the support frame and tabletop underside. Use 3-inch wood screws and metal brackets for added strength. Pre-drill holes to avoid splitting the cedar. Ensure each leg is vertical using a level, and confirm the table stands evenly on a flat surface. Tighten all screws and check for wobbling; adjust if necessary by shimming or tightening connections.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 7: Add the bench seats (pending).  
  - Subgoal 8: Sand the surface of the table (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Make the seat support frame.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make the seat support frame. This will be achieved by constructing cedar wood frames to support the bench seats, attaching them to the legs at a standard bench height.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use 2x4 cedar boards to build eight rectangular seat support frames, one attached to each leg. Each frame should extend outward from the leg, forming a bench base approximately 16 inches wide and 12 inches high (standard bench height). Connect each frame to the leg using 3-inch screws and metal braces, ensuring the frame is level. Cross-brace each frame diagonally for stability. Position the frames to align with the octagon’s sides, ensuring even spacing for the benches.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add the bench seats. This will be achieved by cutting and attaching cedar wood boards to the seat support frames to form the benches.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Cut 2x6 cedar boards to form bench seats, with each bench approximately 24 inches long to provide ample seating space. For each of the eight seat support frames, attach two to three boards side by side to cover the 16-inch width of the frame. Secure the boards to the frames with 2.5-inch wood screws, pre-drilling to prevent splitting. Ensure the boards are flush and evenly spaced, with a small gap (about 1/8 inch) between boards for drainage. Sand the bench surfaces lightly for comfort.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the seat support frames and bench seats. This will be achieved by checking the stability and alignment of the frames and ensuring the bench seats are securely attached and comfortable.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Test the seat support frames by applying weight to ensure they can hold at least 300 pounds each without flexing. Verify that all frames are level and securely attached to the legs. For the bench seats, confirm that the boards are evenly spaced, securely fastened, and free of sharp edges. Sit on each bench to test comfort and stability, adjusting any loose screws or uneven boards as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sand the surface of the cedar octagon picnic table. This will be achieved by sanding all exposed surfaces (tabletop and benches) to ensure a smooth, splinter-free finish.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use an orbital sander with 120-grit sandpaper to sand the tabletop and bench seats, focusing on edges and surfaces to remove splinters and rough spots. Progress to 220-grit sandpaper for a smoother finish. Ensure all surfaces are even and free of defects. Wipe down the table with a damp cloth to remove dust. Optionally, apply a cedar-safe sealant to protect the wood, following manufacturer instructions for drying time.  
[/IMP]
