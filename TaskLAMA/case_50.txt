**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clear debris from the driveway. This will be achieved by using tools like a broom, leaf blower, or shop vacuum to remove loose dirt, leaves, and other debris from the driveway surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a stiff-bristled broom to sweep away loose dirt and leaves. For finer particles, employ a leaf blower or shop vacuum to ensure the driveway is clean and free of debris, preparing it for the next step of pressure washing.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the driveway is free of debris. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the surface and ensuring no loose dirt, leaves, or other materials remain.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Walk across the driveway and inspect all areas, especially cracks and corners, to confirm that no debris is present. If any debris is found, repeat the sweeping or vacuuming process until the surface is clean.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wet the driveway using a pressure washer. This will be achieved by using a pressure washer to thoroughly clean the driveway surface, ensuring it is ready for crack filling.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Connect a pressure washer to a water source and set it to a medium pressure setting to avoid damaging the concrete. Systematically spray the entire driveway, focusing on cracks to remove any remaining dirt or loose particles. Ensure the surface is uniformly wet.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine concrete and water. This will be achieved by mixing a concrete repair compound with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions to create a suitable repair material.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In a clean bucket, measure the recommended amount of concrete repair compound (e.g., a quick-setting concrete mix). Add water as per the product instructions, typically a 4:1 ratio of powder to water. Stir with a trowel or mixing tool until the mixture is smooth and lump-free, suitable for filling cracks.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill the cracks in the driveway. This will be achieved by applying the prepared concrete mix into the cracks using a trowel or caulking gun.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a trowel or caulking gun to apply the concrete mix into the cracks, ensuring they are completely filled. Smooth the surface of the filled cracks with the trowel to create a level finish with the surrounding concrete. Remove any excess material to avoid buildup.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the cracks are properly filled. This will be achieved by inspecting the filled cracks to ensure they are level and fully packed with the concrete mix.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visually inspect each filled crack to confirm the concrete mix is level with the driveway surface and no gaps remain. Press gently with a trowel to test the firmness of the fill. If any cracks are underfilled or uneven, apply additional concrete mix and smooth as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply surface cleaner to the slab using a rubber squeegee. This will be achieved by spreading a concrete surface cleaner over the driveway to enhance its appearance and prepare for texturing.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Pour a concrete surface cleaner (e.g., a degreaser or sealant prep solution) onto the driveway. Use a rubber squeegee to spread the cleaner evenly across the slab, focusing on areas around the filled cracks. Ensure full coverage for a uniform finish.  
[/IMP]

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create surface texture to prevent the concrete from becoming slippery. This will be achieved by using a broom or texturing tool to add a non-slip texture to the driveway surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
While the surface cleaner is still wet, use a stiff-bristled broom to sweep across the driveway in a consistent pattern, creating a light texture. Alternatively, use a concrete texturing tool to imprint a non-slip pattern. Ensure the texture is uniform to prevent slipperiness when the surface is wet.  
[/IMP]
