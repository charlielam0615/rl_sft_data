**Problem Statement**: Create a comprehensive plan to start a house cleaning business in Texas, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step. Each step must adhere to the specified format, including [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks based on the action’s category, and respect the temporal dependencies between tasks.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of starting a house cleaning business in Texas into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The substeps are: select an entity type, examine required forms, register the business in Texas, obtain necessary permissions, get the required license, understand tax obligations, ensure property coverage, recruit workers, and promote the business. The dependencies indicate a sequential order where each step must be completed before the next, starting with selecting an entity type.

[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select an entity type for the house cleaning business in Texas.  
**How to Achieve**: Research the types of business entities available in Texas (e.g., sole proprietorship, LLC, corporation) and choose one based on liability protection, tax implications, and operational needs.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To select an entity type, consider the following options in Texas:
- **Sole Proprietorship**: Simple to set up, no formal registration required, but offers no liability protection.
- **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: Provides liability protection, flexible tax options, and moderate setup complexity.
- **Corporation**: Offers strong liability protection but involves more regulations and costs.
Given the nature of a house cleaning business, which involves potential liability (e.g., property damage) and moderate startup costs, an LLC is often suitable. It balances liability protection with simplicity. Therefore, choose to form an LLC for the business.

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal-Management System**:
- Main Goal: Start a house cleaning business in Texas.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an entity type (Completed: Chosen LLC).
  - Subgoal 2: Examine the forms required (Pending).
  - Subgoal 3: Get the business registered in Texas (Pending).
  - Subgoal 4: Obtain necessary permissions (Pending).

  - Subgoal 9: Promote the business (Pending).
**Current Goal**: Examine the forms required (next step, dependent on selecting entity type).

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Examine the forms required for starting an LLC for a house cleaning business in Texas.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the necessary forms for registering an LLC in Texas by consulting the Texas Secretary of State’s website and other relevant resources.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To form an LLC in Texas, the following forms are typically required:
- **Form 205 (Certificate of Formation)**: Filed with the Texas Secretary of State to officially create the LLC. It includes the LLC’s name, purpose, registered agent, and management structure.
- **Form 304 (Application for Registration of a Registered Agent)**: If the registered agent is an entity, this form may be needed.
- Additional considerations: Check for local county or city forms, such as an Assumed Name Certificate (DBA) if operating under a different name. These forms can be found on the Texas Secretary of State’s website (sos.texas.gov).

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Get the business registered in Texas as an LLC.  
**How to Achieve**: Complete and submit the required forms (e.g., Form 205) to the Texas Secretary of State, pay the filing fee, and ensure compliance with naming and registered agent requirements.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To register the LLC:
1. Complete **Form 205 (Certificate of Formation)** with:
   - LLC name (must include “LLC” and be unique, verifiable via the Texas Secretary of State’s SOSDirect portal).
   - Purpose statement (e.g., “provide house cleaning services”).
   - Registered agent’s name and Texas address.
   - Management structure (member-managed or manager-managed).
2. Submit the form online or by mail to the Texas Secretary of State.
3. Pay the filing fee (approximately $300 as of 2025, confirm on sos.texas.gov).
4. Obtain a Certificate of Filing upon approval, confirming the LLC’s registration.

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the dependencies indicate that both “Obtain necessary permissions” and “Get the required license” depend on registering the business and examining forms, adjust the subgoals to prioritize obtaining the required license next, as it may influence permissions.

[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Get the required license for the house cleaning business in Texas.  
**How to Achieve**: Research whether a specific license is required for house cleaning services in Texas and obtain any necessary local permits.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
In Texas, house cleaning businesses typically do not require a state-specific occupational license. However:
- Check local regulations in the city/county of operation (e.g., Austin, Houston) for business permits or home occupation permits.
- If using specific cleaning chemicals, verify compliance with environmental regulations (e.g., Texas Commission on Environmental Quality).
- Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS for tax purposes, which is free and can be done online at irs.gov.
No specific state license is required, but local permits may apply based on the business’s location.

[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Obtain necessary permissions for the house cleaning business.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm any additional permits or certifications needed, such as local business permits or bonding, based on the LLC registration and local regulations.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To obtain necessary permissions:
1. Contact the local city or county clerk’s office (e.g., for Austin, visit austintexas.gov) to apply for a general business permit if required.
2. Consider obtaining a surety bond to cover potential damages during cleaning services, which enhances client trust.
3. Verify compliance with local zoning laws if operating from a home office.
4. Ensure the LLC’s registered status is active via the Texas Secretary of State.
No additional state-level permissions are typically required beyond registration and local permits.

[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal-Management System**:
- Main Goal: Start a house cleaning business in Texas.
  - Subgoal 1: Select an entity type (Completed: Chosen LLC).
  - Subgoal 2: Examine the forms required (Completed: Identified Form 205, etc.).
  - Subgoal 3: Get the business registered in Texas (Completed: LLC registered).
  - Subgoal 4: Get the required license (Completed: No state license needed, local permits pending).

  - Subgoal 6: Understand the tax obligations (Pending).
  - Subgoal 7: Make sure to have property coverage (Pending).
  - Subgoal 8: Recruit the workers (Pending).
  - Subgoal 9: Promote the business (Pending).
**Current Goal**: Understand the tax obligations (next step, dependent on permissions).

[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Understand the tax obligations for the house cleaning business in Texas.  
**How to Achieve**: Research federal and state tax requirements for an LLC in Texas, including sales tax, franchise tax, and payroll taxes.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Tax obligations for an LLC house cleaning business in Texas include:
- **Federal Taxes**: Use the EIN to file federal income taxes. LLCs are typically pass-through entities, so profits are reported on personal tax returns unless electing corporate taxation (consult irs.gov).
- **Texas Franchise Tax**: LLCs must file a franchise tax report annually if revenue exceeds the no-tax-due threshold (approximately $1.23 million in 2025, verify at comptroller.texas.gov).
- **Sales Tax**: If selling taxable cleaning services or products, obtain a Texas Sales and Use Tax Permit from the Texas Comptroller’s office and collect/remit sales tax.
- **Payroll Taxes**: If hiring employees, withhold federal and state payroll taxes and comply with reporting requirements (e.g., Form 941, unemployment taxes).
Consult a tax professional to ensure compliance.

[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure property coverage for the house cleaning business.  
**How to Achieve**: Obtain appropriate insurance, such as general liability and bonding, to protect against risks like property damage or theft claims.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To ensure property coverage:
1. Purchase **General Liability Insurance** to cover damages or injuries caused during cleaning (e.g., breaking a client’s vase). Providers like The Hartford or Progressive offer policies tailored for small businesses.
2. Obtain a **Surety Bond** (e.g., a janitorial bond) to protect clients against employee theft or negligence. Bonds are available through insurance brokers or companies like SuretyBonds.com.
3. Consider **Workers’ Compensation Insurance** if hiring employees, required in Texas for businesses with employees (check with the Texas Department of Insurance).
4. Verify coverage limits (e.g., $1 million per occurrence for liability) to match business needs.
Contact an insurance agent for quotes and policy details.

[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Recruit workers for the house cleaning business.  
**How to Achieve**: Develop a hiring process to recruit reliable cleaners, including job postings, interviews, and background checks.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To recruit workers:
1. Create job postings on platforms like Indeed or local job boards, specifying requirements (e.g., experience, reliability, physical stamina).
2. Conduct interviews to assess candidates’ skills and customer service attitude.
3. Perform background checks to ensure trustworthiness, especially since workers will enter clients’ homes (use services like Checkr).
4. Offer competitive wages (e.g., $15–$20/hour in Texas, based on market rates) and outline benefits (if any).
5. Develop a training program to ensure consistent cleaning standards and safety protocols.
Start with 1–2 employees and scale as demand grows.

[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-Data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of promoting the business, focusing on prior steps that inform marketing strategies (e.g., entity type, licensing, insurance).

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Current Goal**: Promote the business.  
**Recalled Information**:
- The business is an LLC, providing credibility for marketing materials (Step 2).
- No specific state license is required, but local permits and bonding enhance client trust (Steps 7, 8).
- General liability insurance and a surety bond are in place, which can be highlighted in promotions to assure clients of professionalism and security (Step 11).
- Workers are recruited and trained, ensuring service quality for marketing claims (Step 12).
This information supports creating a marketing strategy that emphasizes reliability, professionalism, and trustworthiness.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Promote the house cleaning business in Texas.  
**How to Achieve**: Develop a marketing plan that includes online and local strategies to attract clients, leveraging the business’s LLC status, bonding, and insurance.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To promote the business:
1. Create a professional website using platforms like Wix or Squarespace, highlighting the LLC status, bonded and insured services, and customer testimonials.
2. Use social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) to post before-and-after cleaning photos and offer promotions (e.g., 10% off first cleaning).
3. List the business on local directories like Yelp and Google My Business to improve visibility.
4. Distribute flyers in local neighborhoods and partner with real estate agents or property managers for referrals.
5. Consider paid ads on Google or social media targeting local homeowners (budget $100–$200/month initially).
6. Emphasize unique selling points: bonded, insured, trained staff, and eco-friendly cleaning options if applicable.
Monitor campaign performance and adjust based on client acquisition.
