--- Case 67 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for applying a polyurethane finish to floors at home using a brush. The plan must adhere to the given substeps, assumptions, and temporal dependencies between tasks. The process involves choosing the type of polyurethane, preparing the floor by removing the previous finish, sanding, and cleaning, and then applying multiple coats with appropriate drying time. I will use the meta-cognitive action set to structure the planning process step by step until the plan is fully completed.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of "Apply polyurethane finish to floors" into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will follow the logical sequence of tasks to ensure proper preparation and application. My forward subgoals are:  
1. Choose between oil-based and water-based polyurethane.  
2. Remove the previous finish.  
3. Sand the floor.  
4. Wipe away the dust.  
5. Apply the first coat using a brush.  
6. Sand the floor once more.  
7. Apply the next coat.  
8. Dry the floor.  
These subgoals respect the temporal dependencies provided, ensuring each step is completed in the correct order.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Choose between oil-based and water-based polyurethane  
How to Achieve: Research the pros and cons of each type to make an informed decision based on durability, drying time, odor, and ease of application, considering the home environment.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To choose between oil-based and water-based polyurethane, I will evaluate both options. Oil-based polyurethane is known for its durability and rich, warm finish but has a strong odor and longer drying time. Water-based polyurethane dries faster, has less odor, and is easier to clean up, though it may not be as durable for high-traffic areas. Given that this is a home application, I prioritize ease of use and lower odor. Therefore, I decide to use water-based polyurethane for this project.

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Remove the previous finish  
How to Achieve: Use appropriate tools and chemicals to strip off the existing finish from the floor, ensuring the surface is ready for sanding.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To remove the previous finish, I will first gather the necessary tools and materials, such as a chemical stripper suitable for the existing finish, a scraper, and protective gear (gloves, mask, and goggles). I will apply the stripper evenly across the floor following the manufacturer’s instructions, allowing it to sit for the recommended time to loosen the old finish. Then, I will use a scraper to remove the softened finish, working in small sections to ensure thorough removal. Finally, I will clean the floor with a solvent or water (as per the stripper instructions) to remove any residue, preparing it for the next step of sanding.

Current Goal: Sand the floor  
How to Achieve: Use a floor sander to smooth the surface of the floor, ensuring it is even and ready for the polyurethane application.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To sand the floor, I will rent or use a drum sander or orbital sander suitable for hardwood floors. I will start with a coarse-grit sandpaper (around 36-40 grit) to remove any remaining finish or rough spots, working in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. I will then progress to medium-grit (60-80 grit) and finally fine-grit (100-120 grit) sandpaper for a smooth finish. I will ensure to sand evenly across the entire floor, paying attention to edges and corners using a handheld sander if necessary. Throughout the process, I will wear a dust mask and ensure proper ventilation to minimize dust inhalation.

**Step 9:**

Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Wipe away the dust  
How to Achieve: Clean the floor thoroughly to remove all sanding dust, ensuring a clean surface for the polyurethane application.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To wipe away the dust, I will first use a shop vacuum to remove the majority of the sanding dust from the floor surface, edges, and corners. Then, I will dampen a microfiber cloth or mop with water (ensuring it’s not too wet to avoid warping the wood) and wipe down the entire floor to pick up any remaining fine dust particles. Alternatively, I can use a tack cloth for a final pass to ensure no dust is left behind. I will let the floor dry completely before proceeding to the next step of applying the first coat.

How to Achieve: Apply a thin, even layer of water-based polyurethane using a brush, following the wood grain for a smooth finish.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To apply the first coat, I will use a high-quality synthetic bristle brush suitable for water-based polyurethane. I will stir the polyurethane gently (avoiding shaking to prevent bubbles) and start applying it in a small section, working along the grain of the wood. I will use long, even strokes to avoid streaks and ensure a thin coat to prevent pooling or uneven drying. I will work in small areas, maintaining a wet edge to avoid lap marks, and ventilate the room by opening windows or using fans. After covering the entire floor, I will let the first coat dry for the recommended time (usually 2-4 hours for water-based polyurethane) as per the product instructions.

How to Achieve: Lightly sand the floor with fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections from the first coat before applying the next coat.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To sand the floor once more, I will use a fine-grit sandpaper (220 grit) or a sanding screen with a pole sander or hand sander. I will lightly sand the entire floor to remove any bubbles, dust nibs, or brush marks from the first coat, ensuring not to sand through to the bare wood. I will work gently and evenly across the surface, focusing on creating a smooth base for the next coat. After sanding, I will vacuum the floor and wipe it down with a damp cloth or tack cloth to remove all dust particles before proceeding to the next step.

How to Achieve: Allow the final coat of polyurethane to dry completely, following the manufacturer’s recommended drying and curing times before using the floor.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To dry the floor, I will ensure the room remains well-ventilated by keeping windows open and using fans if necessary to promote air circulation. I will avoid walking on the floor or placing any objects on it during the drying period. According to the manufacturer’s instructions for water-based polyurethane, I will let the floor dry for at least 24 hours before light foot traffic and wait 3-7 days for full curing before moving furniture back or using the space normally. I will also monitor the temperature and humidity in the room, as these can affect drying times, aiming for conditions within the recommended range (typically 65-75°F and 40-60% humidity).

**Conclusion:**  
The planning and implementation steps for applying a polyurethane finish to floors at home using a brush have been completed. All subgoals have been addressed in the correct sequence, respecting the provided dependencies. The floor should now have a durable, smooth finish with water-based polyurethane, ready for use after the full curing period. If further adjustments or additional coats are needed, the process can be revisited using the same structured approach.
