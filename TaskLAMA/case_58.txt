### Step 1: Plan a Business Structure

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To plan the business structure for an LLC in India, break down the goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:

- Determine the management structure (member-managed or manager-managed).  
- Outline the purpose and operational scope of the business.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For an LLC in India (commonly referred to as a Private Limited Company under the Companies Act, 2013), choose a multi-member LLC to allow for multiple stakeholders. Opt for a member-managed structure to keep decision-making among owners. The business purpose is a general service-based operation (e.g., consulting). Compliance requires at least two directors, two shareholders, and a registered office address.
