### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of creating a product catalog into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies:  
- Subgoal 1: Collect product data to provide the necessary information for the catalog.  
- Subgoal 2: Plan the catalog’s structure to organize the collected data effectively.  
- Subgoal 3: Design the catalog to create a visually appealing and functional layout.  
- Subgoal 4: Publish the catalog to make it accessible to the intended audience.  
- Subgoal 5: Download the catalog image as a final deliverable.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Create a product catalog.  
  - Subgoal 1: Collect product data (not started).  
  - Subgoal 2: Plan the catalog’s structure (not started, depends on Subgoal 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Design the catalog (not started, depends on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Publish the catalog (not started, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Download the catalog image (not started, depends on Subgoal 3).  
**Current Goal**: Collect product data (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to collect product data. This will be achieved by identifying the types of products, gathering relevant details (e.g., names, descriptions, prices, images), and compiling them into a structured format for use in the catalog.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To collect product data:  
- Identify product categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, etc.).  
- Gather details for each product, including name, description, price, and images.  
- Organize the data in a spreadsheet or database for easy access in later steps.  
Example: For a product like a smartphone, collect data such as “Model: XPhone 12, Description: 128GB, 6.1-inch display, Price: $799, Image: xphone12.jpg”.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the collected product data. This will be achieved by checking the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data to ensure it meets the needs of the catalog creation process.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the product data:  
- Check that all products have complete entries (name, description, price, image).  
- Verify accuracy by cross-referencing with reliable sources (e.g., inventory records).  
- Ensure consistency in data format (e.g., uniform units for prices, consistent image file types).  
- Correct any missing or inconsistent entries, such as adding a missing price or standardizing image formats to JPG.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 2: Plan the catalog’s structure (not started, ready to begin).  
  - Subgoal 3: Design the catalog (not started, depends on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Publish the catalog (not started, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Download the catalog image (not started, depends on Subgoal 3).  
**Current Goal**: Plan the catalog’s structure (Subgoal 2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to plan the structure of the catalog. This will be achieved by defining the layout, sections, and organization of the product data to ensure clarity and usability.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To plan the catalog’s structure:  
- Define sections (e.g., by product category, such as “Electronics,” “Clothing”).  
- Determine layout elements (e.g., table of contents, product pages with images, descriptions, and prices).  
- Create a template outlining the structure, such as:  
  - Page 1: Cover page with title and branding.  
  - Page 2: Table of contents.  
  - Pages 3+: Product listings by category, with each product displaying name, image, description, and price.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the catalog structure plan. This will be achieved by ensuring the structure is logical, user-friendly, and aligns with the collected product data.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To validate the catalog structure:  
- Confirm that all product categories from the collected data are represented in the structure.  
- Check that the layout is intuitive (e.g., table of contents links to correct pages).  
- Ensure the template supports all necessary data fields (name, image, description, price).  
- Adjust the structure if needed, e.g., add a section for promotions if missing.
