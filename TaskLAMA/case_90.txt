--- Case 90 ---
### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to lose weight naturally and quickly by following a series of steps while respecting their temporal dependencies. The steps include doing cardio, counting calories, choosing better beverages, eating slowly, adding fiber, eating a high-protein breakfast, getting enough sleep, practicing intermittent fasting, doing HIIT exercises, preparing a diet plan, and tracking weight regularly. Dependencies dictate the order of execution, such as preparing the diet plan before dietary changes and completing certain steps before others.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of losing weight naturally and quickly into intermediate subgoals based on the provided steps and their dependencies. Analyze the dependencies to determine a feasible order of execution, starting with steps that have no prerequisites.  

- **Subgoal 1**: Prepare the diet plan (Step 10), as it must be done before steps 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- **Subgoal 2**: Implement dietary changes (Steps 3, 4, 5, 6), which depend on the diet plan.  
- **Subgoal 3**: Practice intermittent fasting (Step 8), which depends on steps 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
- **Subgoal 4**: Perform exercise routines (Steps 1, 9), which depend on step 8.  
- **Subgoal 5**: Start counting calories (Step 2), which depends on steps 1 and 9.  
- **Subgoal 6**: Get enough sleep (Step 7), which depends on step 2.  
- **Subgoal 7**: Keep weight tracking regularly (Step 11), which depends on step 7.  

The first subgoal to address is preparing the diet plan, as it is a prerequisite for multiple steps.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the diet plan. This will be achieved by creating a structured plan that incorporates high-protein, high-fiber foods, healthier beverage choices, and guidelines for eating slowly, tailored to support weight loss.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Develop a diet plan that emphasizes:  
- **High-protein foods**: Include lean meats, eggs, legumes, and Greek yogurt to support muscle maintenance and satiety.  
- **High-fiber foods**: Incorporate vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes to improve digestion and fullness.  
- **Healthier beverages**: Prioritize water, herbal teas, and unsweetened coffee over sugary drinks.  
- **Eating guidelines**: Recommend eating slowly to enhance mindfulness and control portion sizes.  
The plan should include daily meal examples, such as a high-protein breakfast (e.g., oatmeal with chia seeds and egg whites), fiber-rich lunches and dinners (e.g., grilled chicken with quinoa and steamed broccoli), and water as the primary beverage.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Lose weight naturally and quickly  
  - Subgoal 1: Prepare the diet plan (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Implement dietary changes (Steps 3, 4, 5, 6)  
  - Subgoal 3: Practice intermittent fasting (Step 8)  
  - Subgoal 4: Perform exercise routines (Steps 1, 9)  
  - Subgoal 5: Start counting calories (Step 2)

### Step 4: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since the diet plan is complete, refine Subgoal 2 to break down the dietary changes into specific steps based on dependencies. Steps 3 (Choose better beverages), 4 (Eat food slowly), 5 (Add fiber to your diet), and 6 (Eat a high-protein breakfast) can be implemented in parallel, as they all depend only on the diet plan. Prioritize these steps before moving to intermittent fasting (Step 8).  
- **Adjusted Subgoal 2.1**: Choose better beverages.  
- **Adjusted Subgoal 2.2**: Eat food slowly.  
- **Adjusted Subgoal 2.3**: Add fiber to your diet.  
- **Adjusted Subgoal 2.4**: Eat a high-protein breakfast.
