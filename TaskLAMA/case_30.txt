**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to paint a garage door using a roller, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, while adhering to the meta-cognitive action framework. The plan must include cleaning the garage door, taping off areas, applying primer, dipping the roller into paint, applying the first coat, letting it dry, and applying the second coat, ensuring all dependencies are respected.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of painting a garage door into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Clean the garage door.  
2. Tape off areas where paint should not be applied.  
3. Apply a coat of primer.  
4. Dip the roller into the paint.  
5. Apply the first coat of paint.  
6. Let the first coat dry.  
7. Apply the second coat of paint.  
These subgoals follow the dependency structure, ensuring each step is completed before the next dependent step begins.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format and highlight the current goal:  
- Main Goal: Paint the garage door with a roller  
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the garage door (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Tape off areas where paint should not be applied  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply a coat of primer  
  - Subgoal 4: Dip the roller into the paint  
  - Subgoal 5: Apply the first coat of paint  
  - Subgoal 6: Let the first coat dry  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the second coat of paint  
The current goal is to clean the garage door, which is the first step and has no prior dependencies.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clean the garage door. This will be achieved by using appropriate cleaning materials (e.g., soap, water, and a sponge or cloth) to remove dirt and debris from the door’s surface to ensure proper paint adhesion.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To clean the garage door, gather a bucket, mild detergent, water, a sponge or soft cloth, and a hose. Mix the detergent with water, scrub the door’s surface thoroughly to remove dirt, grease, and debris, then rinse with the hose and let it dry completely.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the garage door is properly cleaned. This will be achieved by inspecting the door’s surface for any remaining dirt or debris and confirming it is dry and ready for the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the garage door visually and by touch to ensure all dirt, grease, and debris are removed. Verify the surface is completely dry. If any areas are still dirty or wet, repeat the cleaning and drying process.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system:  
- Main Goal: Paint the garage door with a roller  
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the garage door (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Tape off areas where paint should not be applied (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply a coat of primer  
  - Subgoal 4: Dip the roller into the paint  
  - Subgoal 5: Apply the first coat of paint  
  - Subgoal 6: Let the first coat dry  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the second coat of paint  
The current goal is to tape off areas where paint should not be applied, which depends on the completion of cleaning the garage door.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to tape off areas where paint should not be applied. This will be achieved by using painter’s tape to cover edges, handles, and other areas to prevent paint from getting on them.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gather painter’s tape and a utility knife. Carefully apply the tape to edges, handles, windows, or any areas of the garage door where paint should not be applied. Ensure the tape is pressed down firmly to prevent paint seepage.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply a coat of primer. This will be achieved by using a paint roller to apply a suitable primer evenly across the garage door’s surface to prepare it for the topcoat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select a primer suitable for the garage door material (e.g., metal or wood). Pour the primer into a paint tray, dip the roller into the primer, and apply an even coat across the entire door surface. Work in small sections to ensure uniform coverage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the primer coat is properly applied. This will be achieved by inspecting the door for even coverage and addressing any missed spots or uneven areas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Visually inspect the garage door to ensure the primer coat is even and fully covers the surface. Check for missed spots or thin areas. If necessary, apply additional primer to any uneven or uncovered areas and let it dry according to the primer’s instructions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dip the roller into the paint. This will be achieved by pouring the chosen paint into a paint tray and coating the roller evenly with paint.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Select a high-quality exterior paint suitable for the garage door material. Pour the paint into a clean paint tray. Dip the roller into the paint, rolling it back and forth to ensure even coverage on the roller, and remove excess paint to avoid drips.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the first coat of paint. This will be achieved by using the paint-covered roller to apply an even coat of paint over the primed garage door surface.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the paint-covered roller, apply the first coat of paint to the garage door, working in small sections. Roll the paint on evenly, maintaining a wet edge to avoid lap marks. Ensure full coverage over the primed surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the first coat of paint is properly applied. This will be achieved by inspecting the door for even coverage and addressing any missed spots or uneven areas.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the garage door to ensure the first coat of paint is even and fully covers the primed surface. Check for missed spots, drips, or thin areas. If necessary, apply additional paint to any uneven or uncovered areas.

The current goal is to let the first coat of paint dry, which depends on the completion of the first coat application.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to let the first coat of paint dry. This will be achieved by allowing sufficient time for the paint to dry according to the paint manufacturer’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Follow the paint manufacturer’s instructions for drying time, typically 2-4 hours for exterior paint, depending on weather conditions. Avoid touching the door or exposing it to dust or debris during this period. Ensure proper ventilation and suitable weather (e.g., no rain).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the first coat of paint is fully dry. This will be achieved by checking the door’s surface to confirm it is dry and ready for the second coat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the garage door by lightly touching a small, inconspicuous area to ensure the paint is dry and not tacky. If the paint is not fully dry, allow additional drying time as needed. Confirm the surface is ready for the second coat.  
[/IMP]

### Step 18
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the second coat of paint. This will be achieved by dipping the roller into the paint again and applying an even second coat over the dried first coat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Dip the roller into the paint tray, ensuring even coverage on the roller. Apply the second coat of paint to the garage door, working in small sections to ensure an even application. Maintain a wet edge to avoid lap marks and ensure full coverage.  
[/IMP]
