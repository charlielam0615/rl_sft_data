--- Case 48 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make an end table for the living room, following the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and guidelines.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of making an end table into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies.  
- Subgoal 1: Choose a beautiful corner to place the end table in the living room.  
- Subgoal 2: Take measurements for the end table.  
- Subgoal 3: Cut the wood according to the measurements.  
- Subgoal 4: Make the table top.  
- Subgoal 5: Make the table bottom.  
- Subgoal 6: Attach the table top and bottom.  
- Subgoal 7: Paint the table.  
These subgoals follow the sequence dictated by the dependencies, ensuring each step is completed before the next.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals generated in the previous step and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make an end table for the living room.  
  - Subgoal 1: Choose a beautiful corner to place the end table in the living room.  
  - Subgoal 2: Take measurements for the end table.  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the wood according to the measurements.  
  - Subgoal 4: Make the table top.  
  - Subgoal 5: Make the table bottom.  
  - Subgoal 6: Attach the table top and bottom.  
  - Subgoal 7: Paint the table.  
**Current Goal**: Choose a beautiful corner to place the end table in the living room.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Choose a beautiful corner to place the end table in the living room.  
**How to Achieve**: Evaluate the living room layout to identify a corner that is aesthetically pleasing, accessible, and complements the room’s decor. Consider factors like lighting, furniture arrangement, and visibility.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Assess the living room by walking through it and noting potential corners. Look for a spot that is not obstructed by other furniture, receives good natural or artificial light, and enhances the room’s aesthetic balance. For example, a corner near a sofa or armchair, away from high-traffic areas, would be ideal. Select the corner that best fits these criteria and mark it for the end table placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the chosen corner for the end table placement.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the selected corner meets the requirements for aesthetics, accessibility, and functionality by checking its suitability within the living room context.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify the chosen corner by ensuring it is free from obstructions (e.g., no overlapping furniture or decor), has sufficient space for the end table (approximately 2x2 feet for a standard end table), and aligns with the room’s style. Check that the corner allows easy access for placing items on the table and complements the existing furniture arrangement. If the corner meets these criteria, proceed; otherwise, revisit the selection process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Take measurements for the end table.  
**How to Achieve**: Measure the dimensions of the chosen corner and determine the appropriate size for the end table, considering both functionality and proportionality to the space.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a measuring tape to record the dimensions of the chosen corner, noting the available width, depth, and height. For a standard end table, aim for dimensions like 24 inches wide, 24 inches deep, and 22–26 inches high, adjusting based on the corner’s constraints and the surrounding furniture (e.g., sofa height). Document the measurements (e.g., 24" W x 24" D x 24" H) for use in the next step. Ensure the measurements allow the table to fit comfortably without crowding the space.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Cut the wood with the required measurements.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the measurements taken in the previous step to ensure the wood is cut accurately for the end table.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The measurements for the end table, as determined in Step 5, are 24 inches wide, 24 inches deep, and 24 inches high. These dimensions were chosen to fit the selected corner and complement the living room’s layout. This information will guide the wood-cutting process to ensure the table’s components align with the planned size.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Cut the wood with the required measurements.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the documented measurements to cut wood pieces for the table top, legs, and any additional components, ensuring precision for a proper fit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gather wood (e.g., oak or pine) and tools (e.g., saw, measuring tape, pencil). Mark the wood for the table top (24" x 24") and four legs (each 23" long, assuming a 1" thick top for a total height of 24"). Use a saw to cut the wood precisely along the marked lines. Double-check each piece against the measurements (24" W x 24" D for the top, 23" L for each leg). Sand the edges to ensure smooth surfaces for assembly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Make the table top.  
**How to Achieve**: Assemble the cut wood pieces designated for the table top, ensuring a sturdy and smooth surface.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the 24" x 24" wood piece cut for the table top. If using multiple planks, join them with wood glue and clamps, ensuring a flat surface. Sand the top thoroughly to achieve a smooth finish. Check for stability and evenness using a level. If desired, add edge trim or bevel for aesthetic appeal. The table top should now be ready for attachment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Make the table bottom.  
**How to Achieve**: Construct the table’s base using the cut legs and any necessary support pieces to ensure stability.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Take the four 23" legs cut in Step 7. Create a stable base by attaching cross-braces or an apron (e.g., four 20" wood pieces forming a square frame) to the legs using wood glue and screws. Ensure the legs are perpendicular to the ground and the frame is level. Sand all surfaces for a smooth finish. The base should be sturdy enough to support the table top.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the table top and bottom before attachment.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the table top and bottom are correctly constructed, stable, and align with the measurements and design requirements.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the table top (24" x 24") for smoothness, flatness, and structural integrity. Confirm the base’s legs and frame are securely attached, level, and match the 24" height requirement when combined with the top. Test stability by applying light pressure to ensure no wobbling. If both components meet these standards, proceed to attachment; otherwise, adjust or redo the faulty parts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attach the top and bottom of the table.  
**How to Achieve**: Securely join the table top to the base using appropriate hardware to form a complete end table.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the table top on the base, ensuring alignment. Use wood screws or brackets to attach the top to the base’s frame or legs, drilling pilot holes to prevent splitting. Securely fasten all connections, checking that the top is level and firmly attached. Test the table’s stability by placing it on a flat surface and applying pressure. The end table should now be fully assembled.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Paint the table.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply paint or finish to the assembled end table to enhance its appearance and protect the wood.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Sand the entire table lightly to prepare the surface. Apply a primer coat if using paint, or choose a wood stain for a natural look. Use a brush or roller to apply two even coats of paint or stain, allowing drying time between coats (follow product instructions, typically 2–4 hours). Sand lightly between coats for a smooth finish. Once dry, apply a clear sealant for durability. Place the table in the chosen corner to complete the task.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and confirm all subgoals have been completed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Make an end table for the living room.  
  - Subgoal 1: Choose a beautiful corner to place the end table in the living room (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Take measurements for the end table (Completed).
