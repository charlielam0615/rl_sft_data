--- Case 38 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to plan the construction of a deck around a pool in a resort, following a meta-cognitive action set (M) divided into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must adhere to the given substeps and their temporal dependencies, ensuring each step is completed in sequence. The substeps are:

1. Measure the length of the area.
2. Design the deck.
3. Cut the tiles according to the design.
4. Framing the floor.
5. Laying out the deck.
6. Putting the posts and piers in place.
7. Install the guard rail.
8. Build the stairs.

Dependencies dictate that each substep must be completed before the next. The solution will use one meta-cognitive action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, until the plan is complete.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a deck around a pool into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
- Measure the pool area to determine deck dimensions.  
- Design the deck layout based on measurements.  
- Cut tiles to match the design specifications.  
- Frame the floor to support the deck.  
- Lay out the deck surface.  
- Install posts and piers for structural integrity.  
- Install guard rails for safety.  
- Build stairs for access.  
Each subgoal must be completed sequentially due to dependencies. The first subgoal is to measure the area.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to measure the length of the area around the pool. This will be achieved by using a measuring tape or laser measuring tool to determine the dimensions of the area where the deck will be constructed, ensuring accurate data for the design phase.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use a laser measuring tool to measure the length, width, and perimeter of the pool area. Record the dimensions in a notebook or digital device, noting any irregularities in the pool shape (e.g., circular, rectangular). Ensure measurements account for space needed for the deck’s width (e.g., 4-6 feet from the pool edge). Verify measurements by rechecking critical points. The output is a set of precise measurements (e.g., 20 ft x 30 ft rectangular pool with 5 ft deck width).  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a deck around a pool in a resort.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the length of the area (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Design the deck (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut tiles according to the design (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Frame the floor (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Lay out the deck (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Put posts and piers in place (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 7: Install the guard rail (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 8: Build the stairs (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Design the deck based on the measurements obtained.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to design the deck. This will be achieved by creating a detailed blueprint using the measurements from Step 2, specifying deck shape, materials, and layout, while ensuring compliance with resort safety and aesthetic standards.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the measurements (e.g., 20 ft x 30 ft pool with 5 ft deck width), create a blueprint with design software or graph paper. Design a rectangular deck surrounding the pool, selecting materials like composite decking for durability. Include features like guard rails (4 ft high) and stairs (leading to resort pathways). Ensure the design accounts for drainage slopes (1% grade away from the pool) and complies with local building codes. The output is a detailed deck blueprint.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the deck design. This will be achieved by checking the blueprint against measurements, building codes, and resort requirements to ensure feasibility and safety.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the blueprint to confirm it matches the recorded measurements (e.g., 20 ft x 30 ft pool with 5 ft deck width). Verify compliance with local codes (e.g., guard rail height, load-bearing capacity). Consult resort management for aesthetic approval. Check for practical issues like drainage and accessibility. Adjust the design if issues are found (e.g., increase slope for better drainage). The output is a validated blueprint ready for implementation.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 1: Measure the length of the area (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Design the deck (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut tiles according to the design (Current).  
  - Subgoal 4: Frame the floor (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Lay out the deck (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Put posts and piers in place (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 7: Install the guard rail (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 8: Build the stairs (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Cut tiles according to the design specifications.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut tiles according to the design. This will be achieved by using the validated blueprint to measure and cut deck tiles (e.g., composite decking boards) to fit the specified dimensions and layout.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the blueprint, mark the composite decking boards for cutting based on the deck’s dimensions (e.g., 5 ft wide sections around the 20 ft x 30 ft pool). Use a circular saw or miter saw to cut boards to precise lengths, ensuring cuts are straight and match the design’s pattern (e.g., staggered or straight layout). Double-check measurements before cutting to minimize waste. The output is a set of cut tiles ready for framing.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to frame the floor. This will be achieved by constructing a wooden or metal frame around the pool based on the blueprint, ensuring structural stability for the deck tiles.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the blueprint, install pressure-treated wooden beams or metal joists around the pool perimeter to form the deck’s substructure. Space joists 16 inches apart for stability, securing them with galvanized screws or bolts. Ensure the frame is level using a spirit level and adjust with shims if needed. Anchor the frame to concrete footings if required by local codes. The output is a completed floor frame ready for deck tiles.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the cut composite decking boards onto the framed floor, following the blueprint’s pattern (e.g., staggered layout). Secure each board to the joists using hidden fasteners or deck screws, ensuring tight connections. Check alignment and spacing (e.g., 1/8 inch gaps for expansion). Trim any excess material for a clean edge. The output is a fully laid-out deck surface.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Dig holes for concrete piers at designated points around the deck perimeter (e.g., every 6 ft, per blueprint). Pour concrete into pier forms and insert metal post anchors. Once cured (24-48 hours), attach 4x4 wooden or metal posts to anchors using bolts. Ensure posts are plumb using a level. The output is installed posts and piers ready for guard rails.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the blueprint, build a staircase with pressure-treated wood or composite materials. Install stringers (e.g., 3 stringers for a 4 ft wide staircase) anchored to the deck frame and ground. Attach treads and risers, ensuring each step is 10-11 inches deep and 7-8 inches high for comfort and safety. Secure handrails on both sides. The output is a completed staircase.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the deck for stability, ensuring no loose boards, posts, or railings. Verify guard rail height (4 ft) and baluster spacing (≤4 inches). Test stairs for evenness and strength. Confirm the deck slopes correctly for drainage and meets resort aesthetic standards. Address any issues (e.g., tighten screws, adjust posts). The output is a fully validated deck ready for use.
