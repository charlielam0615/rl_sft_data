--- Case 25 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a detailed plan for performing auto body work yourself, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of performing auto body work into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Eliminate all rust stains.  
2. Minimize the dents.  
3. Clean the panels using a cotton rag.  
4. Fill the area with body fillers.  
5. Apply the primer.  
6. Allow the primer to dry.  
7. Apply the finishing putty.  
8. Clean the car.  
9. Mix the paint.  
10. Start painting using a spray.  
11. Let the paint dry.  
12. Finish the process by polishing.  
These subgoals must follow the dependencies (e.g., rust removal and dent minimization must precede panel cleaning).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system with a nested hierarchy of goals:  
- Main Goal: Complete auto body work.  
  - Subgoal 1: Eliminate all rust stains.  
  - Subgoal 2: Minimize the dents.  
  - Subgoal 3: Clean the panels using a cotton rag.  
  - Subgoal 4: Fill the area with body fillers.  
  - Subgoal 5: Apply the primer.  
  - Subgoal 6: Allow the primer to dry.  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the finishing putty.  
  - Subgoal 8: Clean the car.  
  - Subgoal 9: Mix the paint.  
  - Subgoal 10: Start painting using a spray.  
  - Subgoal 11: Let the paint dry.  
  - Subgoal 12: Finish the process by polishing.  
**Current Goal**: Eliminate all rust stains (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Eliminate all rust stains.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a wire brush or sandpaper to remove rust from affected areas, followed by applying a rust converter to prevent further corrosion.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To eliminate rust stains, start by inspecting the car’s surface for rust spots. Use a wire brush or medium-grit sandpaper (e.g., 80-grit) to scrub off visible rust until bare metal is exposed. For stubborn areas, use a power sander with caution. Apply a rust converter chemical (e.g., Rust-Oleum Rust Reformer) with a brush to neutralize remaining rust. Ensure proper ventilation and wear gloves and a mask. Allow the converter to dry as per instructions (typically 20-30 minutes).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Minimize the dents.  
**How to Achieve**: Use dent removal tools (e.g., dent puller or suction cup) for shallow dents and a hammer with a dolly for deeper dents to reshape the metal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Identify dents on the car’s surface. For shallow dents, use a suction cup dent puller: place it over the dent, pull gently, and release. For deeper dents, work from the underside if accessible, using a rubber mallet and a dolly to gently tap the metal back into shape. Work in small, controlled taps to avoid over-stretching the metal. If necessary, sand the area lightly with 120-grit sandpaper to smooth the surface.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure rust removal and dent minimization are complete before cleaning panels.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the treated areas to confirm all rust is removed and dents are minimized to a smooth surface.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visually inspect the car’s surface under good lighting. Run your hand over the treated areas to feel for remaining rust or uneven surfaces. Rust-free areas should show bare metal or a uniform rust converter coating. Dents should be nearly invisible or significantly reduced, with no sharp edges. If issues remain, repeat rust removal or dent repair as needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Clean the panels using a cotton rag.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a cotton rag with a degreaser or automotive soap to clean the panels, ensuring no contaminants remain before applying fillers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Mix automotive soap (e.g., Meguiar’s Car Wash) with water or use a degreaser (e.g., Simple Green). Dampen a clean cotton rag and wipe down the panels thoroughly to remove grease, dust, and debris. Focus on areas treated for rust and dents. Rinse with clean water and dry with a fresh cotton rag to prevent water spots. Ensure the surface is completely clean and dry.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Fill the area with body fillers.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply automotive body filler (e.g., Bondo) to repaired areas using a plastic spreader, then sand smooth.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Mix body filler with hardener as per instructions (typically a 50:1 ratio). Apply the mixture to dents or low spots using a plastic spreader, building up thin layers. Let it cure for 20-30 minutes. Sand the cured filler with 120-grit sandpaper, then 220-grit for a smooth finish. Check for evenness with your hand and repeat if necessary.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the primer.  
**How to Achieve**: Spray automotive primer evenly over the repaired and filled areas to prepare for painting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Shake a can of automotive primer (e.g., Rust-Oleum Automotive Primer) for 1-2 minutes. Hold the can 10-12 inches from the surface and apply thin, even coats using sweeping motions. Cover all filled and sanded areas. Apply 2-3 coats, allowing 10-15 minutes drying time between coats. Avoid heavy application to prevent drips.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Allow the primer to dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Let the primer cure fully as per the product instructions, typically 24 hours, in a well-ventilated area.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place the car in a dry, dust-free environment with good ventilation. Allow the primer to dry for at least 24 hours, or as specified by the primer’s instructions. Avoid touching the surface or exposing it to moisture during this time to ensure proper curing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply the finishing putty.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply a thin layer of finishing putty over the primed areas to smooth imperfections, then sand lightly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Apply a thin layer of finishing putty (e.g., 3M Acryl-Green Spot Putty) over the primed areas using a clean spreader. Let it cure for 15-20 minutes. Sand lightly with 400-grit sandpaper to achieve a smooth, even surface. Wipe away dust with a tack cloth to prepare for painting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Clean the car.  
**How to Achieve**: Wash the entire car with automotive soap and dry it to ensure a clean surface for painting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Wash the car with automotive soap and water using a sponge or microfiber cloth. Rinse thoroughly and dry with clean microfiber towels to prevent water spots. Pay extra attention to the repaired areas to ensure no dust or residue remains. Use a tack cloth for final dust removal.  
[/IMP]
