--- Case 4 ---
**Problem Statement:**  
I need to simulate the planning process for writing a research paper introduction by creating a detailed plan that adheres to the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The task involves following a series of substeps and respecting the temporal dependencies between them to ensure a logical and coherent structure for the introduction. The substeps include starting by introducing the topic, giving an overview, adding a compelling quotation, mentioning the thesis, focusing on the rationale, and finishing with a summary. The dependencies outline the order in which these steps must be completed.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overarching goal of writing a research paper introduction into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps. The subgoals are: (1) Start by introducing the topic, (2) Give an overview of the topic, (3) Add a compelling quotation, (4) Mention the thesis, (5) Focus on the rationale, and (6) Finish with a summary. These subgoals will serve as the foundation for the structure of the introduction. I will prioritize them based on the dependencies provided, ensuring that each step is planned in the correct order. For now, I will focus on setting up this initial structure to guide the subsequent planning and implementation steps.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
To ensure the subgoals are logically connected and achievable, I will work backward from the final subgoal, "Finish with a summary," to confirm the necessary prerequisites for each preceding step. Starting from the end, the summary depends on having a compelling quotation and a clear rationale. The rationale, in turn, depends on an overview of the topic, as does the quotation. The overview depends on a proper introduction of the topic. Additionally, mentioning the thesis must precede the introduction of the topic as per the dependencies. Therefore, the sequence must be adjusted to respect this constraint, placing "Mention Your Thesis" before "Start by introducing your topic." Revised subgoals in order are: (1) Mention the thesis, (2) Start by introducing the topic, (3) Give an overview of the topic, (4) Add a compelling quotation, (5) Focus on the rationale, and (6) Finish with a summary. This backward analysis confirms the necessary order of steps to achieve the final goal.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
Based on the backward subgoaling analysis and the provided dependencies, I will adjust the initial sequence of subgoals to ensure alignment with the temporal constraints. The dependency stating that "Mention Your Thesis" must be done before "Start by introducing your topic" was not reflected in the initial forward subgoaling. Therefore, the adjusted sequence of subgoals is: (1) Mention the thesis, (2) Start by introducing the topic, (3) Give an overview of the topic, (4) Add a compelling quotation, (5) Focus on the rationale, and (6) Finish with a summary. This adjustment ensures that the plan respects all dependencies and provides a clear path forward for writing the introduction.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
With the adjusted sequence of subgoals in place, I will further refine each subgoal by identifying smaller tasks or considerations within them to ensure comprehensive planning. For (1) Mention the thesis, the task involves crafting a clear and concise thesis statement that outlines the paperâ€™s main argument. For (2) Start by introducing the topic, I will plan to include a hook or broad statement to capture interest. For (3) Give an overview of the topic, I will outline key background information or context. For (4) Add a compelling quotation, I will plan to select a relevant quote that supports the thesis or theme. For (5) Focus on the rationale, I will justify the importance of the research or topic. Finally, for (6) Finish with a summary, I will plan to briefly recap the main points of the introduction and transition to the body of the paper. This detailed breakdown ensures each subgoal is actionable during implementation.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Write a research paper introduction  
  - Subgoal 1: Mention the thesis  
  - Subgoal 2: Start by introducing the topic  
  - Subgoal 3: Give an overview of the topic  
  - Subgoal 4: Add a compelling quotation  
  - Subgoal 5: Focus on the rationale  
  - Subgoal 6: Finish with a summary  

Current Goal: Mention the thesis (Subgoal 1)  
This hierarchy reflects the most recent updates from the planning steps, ensuring all subgoals are organized in the correct order based on dependencies and adjustments made. The focus is currently on crafting the thesis statement as the starting point of the introduction.  
[/REVIEW]

**Conclusion of Planning Phase:**  
At this point, the planning for writing a research paper introduction is complete. All subgoals have been identified, ordered according to dependencies, refined with detailed tasks, and organized in a goal management system. The next steps would involve moving into the implementation phase to start writing the introduction based on this plan. However, as per the request to focus on planning until all plans are completed, I have concluded the planning process here. If further implementation or review steps are needed, they can be initiated in subsequent interactions.
