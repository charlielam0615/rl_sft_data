**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate a planning case for building a good Minecraft house by myself. The task involves a series of steps: measuring the space, building the walls, attaching a roof, painting the house, and decorating the interior with lights. These steps have specific temporal dependencies, meaning each step must be completed in a particular order as outlined in the dependencies.

**Step 1: Planning the Overall Approach**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overarching goal of building a good Minecraft house into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and their dependencies. The subgoals are as follows:  
1. Measure the space to determine the dimensions of the house.  
2. Build the walls based on the measured space.  
3. Attach a roof to the structure after the walls are built.  
4. Paint the house to enhance its appearance after the roof is attached.  
5. Decorate the interior with lights after the roof is in place.  
These subgoals respect the dependencies provided, ensuring each step is completed in the correct order.

**Step 2: Reviewing the Goal Hierarchy**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Build a good Minecraft house by myself.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the space.  
  - Subgoal 2: Build the walls (dependent on Subgoal 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach a roof (dependent on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Paint the house (dependent on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the interior with lights (dependent on Subgoal 3).  
Current Goal: Measure the space.  
This hierarchy integrates the forward subgoaling from the previous planning step and ensures focus on the first actionable subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3: Planning for the First Subgoal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Measure the space.  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will select an appropriate location in the Minecraft world and determine the dimensions of the house by marking the area with blocks or tools to outline the space.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I start by exploring the Minecraft world to find a flat, open area suitable for building a house. Once I’ve identified the location, I decide on a rectangular space of 10 blocks in length and 8 blocks in width, which should provide enough room for a small but functional house. Using dirt blocks or any available material, I place markers at the four corners of the rectangle to define the boundaries. I then walk along the perimeter to ensure the measurements are accurate and adjust if necessary. This step is now complete, as the space for the house is clearly defined.

Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Build a good Minecraft house by myself.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the space (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Build the walls (dependent on Subgoal 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach a roof (dependent on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Paint the house (dependent on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the interior with lights (dependent on Subgoal 3).  
Current Goal: Build the walls.  
This updated hierarchy reflects the completion of the first subgoal and shifts focus to the next actionable subgoal.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5: Planning for the Second Subgoal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Build the walls.  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will gather materials such as wood or stone and construct walls along the measured perimeter, ensuring they are of a suitable height and include openings for doors and windows.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I begin by collecting resources, opting for oak wood planks as my primary building material for a classic look. I gather enough wood by chopping down nearby trees and crafting the logs into planks at a crafting table. Returning to the marked perimeter, I start building the walls by placing oak wood planks along the edges of the measured space, stacking them to a height of 3 blocks. I leave a 1-block wide gap on one side for a door and create two 2x2 block spaces on opposite walls for windows. Once all four walls are constructed, I double-check to ensure they are connected at the corners and uniform in height. This step is complete, as the walls are now in place.

  - Subgoal 5: Decorate the interior with lights (dependent on Subgoal 3).  
Current Goal: Attach a roof.  
This hierarchy reflects the completion of the second subgoal and focuses on the next actionable subgoal.

**Step 7: Planning for the Third Subgoal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Attach a roof.  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will use wooden slabs or planks to create a slanted or flat roof over the walls, ensuring it covers the entire structure and provides protection.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I decide to build a simple slanted roof using oak wood slabs for a cohesive look with the walls. I gather additional oak wood and craft it into slabs. Starting at the top of the walls, I place slabs along the longer sides (10 blocks), stepping up by half a block each row to create a slope towards the center. I repeat this on both sides until the slopes meet at the top, forming a peaked roof. I fill any gaps to ensure the roof is watertight and overhangs slightly over the walls for aesthetics. After inspecting the structure from different angles, I confirm the roof is securely attached and covers the entire house. This step is complete.

**Step 9: Planning for the Fourth Subgoal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Paint the house.  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will use colored wool or terracotta blocks to add color to the exterior walls, enhancing the house’s visual appeal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I choose to use light blue wool to give the house a vibrant and welcoming appearance. I gather wool by shearing sheep and craft light blue dye using lapis lazuli, then combine them at a crafting table. Returning to the house, I replace some of the oak wood planks on the exterior walls with light blue wool in a patterned design, focusing on the front wall for a striking effect. I also add white wool around the windows as accents to mimic window frames. After stepping back to view the house, I adjust a few blocks to balance the colors. This step is complete, as the house now has a painted, polished look.

**Step 11: Planning for the Final Subgoal**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Decorate the interior with lights.  
Description: To achieve this subgoal, I will place torches or glowstone inside the house to illuminate the interior, ensuring it is functional and cozy.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I gather materials for lighting, opting for torches due to their simplicity and availability. I craft torches using coal and sticks at a crafting table. Inside the house, I place torches on the walls, positioning one in each corner of the main room and additional ones near the door and windows to ensure even lighting. I check the light level by walking through the space, adding an extra torch in darker spots if needed. For a decorative touch, I also place a single glowstone block in the center of the ceiling as a chandelier-like feature, crafted from glowstone dust if available. After confirming the interior is well-lit and inviting, I conclude this step is complete.
