**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan for replacing a ceiling fan motor in a bedroom, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and adhering to the specified substeps and dependencies. The assumptions, substeps, and dependencies are as follows:

- **Assumption**: Replace ceiling fan motor in bedroom.
- **Substeps**:
  1. Turn off the electricity supply for the bedroom.
  2. Remove the light kits from the ceiling fan.
  3. Remove the blades.
  4. Remove the wires on the old ceiling fan motor.
  5. Disconnect the old motor.
  6. Replace with the new motor.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Turn off electricity must be done before removing light kits and blades.
  - Remove light kits and blades must be done before removing wires.
  - Remove wires must be done before disconnecting the old motor.
  - Disconnect old motor must be done before replacing with the new motor.

The plan will be developed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, using the required [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks, and ensuring all substeps are completed while respecting dependencies.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of replacing the ceiling fan motor into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:
1. Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply.
2. Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades.
3. Access the motor by removing the wires.
4. Remove the old motor.
5. Install the new motor.
These subgoals align with the provided substeps and respect the temporal dependencies.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system by listing all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1:
- Main Goal: Replace ceiling fan motor in bedroom
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply (Current)
  - Subgoal 2: Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades
  - Subgoal 3: Access the motor by removing the wires
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the old motor
  - Subgoal 5: Install the new motor
Current Goal: Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply.
How to Achieve: Locate the circuit breaker panel and switch off the breaker corresponding to the bedroom’s electricity supply.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Identify the circuit breaker panel, typically found in a basement, garage, or utility area. Check the breaker labels to find the one controlling the bedroom’s power. Switch the breaker to the "off" position. Verify the power is off by testing the ceiling fan’s switch or using a voltage tester.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply.
How to Achieve: Confirm that the electricity to the ceiling fan is off to ensure safe disassembly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use a non-contact voltage tester to check the ceiling fan’s wiring for any live current. Alternatively, attempt to turn on the fan using its switch to confirm it does not operate. Ensure no power is present before proceeding.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Review the next subgoals (removing light kits and blades) and adjust their order based on dependencies. Since both must be done before removing wires, and they can be performed in parallel after turning off electricity, combine them into a single subgoal for efficiency: "Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades."
[/PLANNING]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Update the goal-management system to reflect the adjusted subgoal from Step 5:
- Main Goal: Replace ceiling fan motor in bedroom
  - Subgoal 1: Ensure safety by turning off the electricity supply (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades (Current)
  - Subgoal 3: Access the motor by removing the wires
  - Subgoal 4: Remove the old motor
  - Subgoal 5: Install the new motor
Current Goal: Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 7**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades.
How to Achieve: Use a screwdriver to remove the light kit components and fan blades, following the manufacturer’s instructions or general ceiling fan disassembly guidelines.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
1. **Remove Light Kits**: Use a screwdriver (typically Phillips) to unscrew the light kit from the ceiling fan’s base. Carefully detach any glass covers or bulbs, then remove the light kit housing by unscrewing it from the fan’s switch housing. Place components safely aside.
2. **Remove Blades**: Locate the screws securing each fan blade to the blade brackets (usually 2-3 screws per blade). Unscrew and remove each blade, keeping screws and brackets organized for potential reuse.
[/IMP]

**Step 8**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Disassemble the ceiling fan by removing light kits and blades.
How to Achieve: Confirm that the light kits and blades are fully removed and the motor housing is accessible.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the ceiling fan to ensure all light kit components (bulbs, glass covers, housing) and blades are detached. Verify that the motor housing or wiring is now exposed, indicating readiness to access the motor’s wires.
[/IMP]

**Step 9**

[PLANNING]
Action: Recall Info (Review)
Current Goal: Access the motor by removing the wires.
Core Content for Retrieval: Information related to safely handling and identifying the wires connected to the ceiling fan motor.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Recalling previous content:
- Step 3 and Step 4 emphasized turning off the electricity and validating that no power is present, which is critical for safely handling wires.
- Step 7 mentioned following manufacturer instructions, which may include diagrams or labels identifying the motor’s wiring.
Summarized Information: Ensure the power is off (confirmed in Steps 3 and 4). Refer to the ceiling fan’s manual or labels to identify the motor’s wiring connections (e.g., black, white, ground) before removal.

**Step 10**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Access the motor by removing the wires.
How to Achieve: Carefully disconnect the wires attached to the old ceiling fan motor, ensuring no damage to the wiring.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using a screwdriver, remove the canopy or cover concealing the wiring at the ceiling. Identify the wires connected to the motor (typically black, white, and green/copper for ground). Unscrew any wire nuts or connectors, and gently separate the motor wires from the house wiring. Label the wires if needed to ensure correct reconnection later.
[/IMP]
