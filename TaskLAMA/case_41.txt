### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate planning a process to write a research proposal PDF on a Lenovo Chromebook, following a structured meta-cognitive action framework. The process involves completing the following substeps in accordance with their dependencies: open a PDF on the Lenovo Chromebook, set the title, list objectives, provide background information, create a methodology section, and end with references. The solution must use one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) action sets, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of writing a research proposal PDF into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies:  
1. Open a PDF editing application on the Lenovo Chromebook.  
2. Set the title of the research proposal.  
3. List the objectives of the research.  
4. Provide background information for context.  
5. Create a methodology section.  
6. Add references to conclude the PDF.  
These subgoals align with the provided substeps, and dependencies indicate that opening the PDF must precede setting the title, which must precede objectives, background, and methodology, all of which must be completed before adding references.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- Main Goal: Write a research proposal PDF on a Lenovo Chromebook.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open a PDF editing application on the Lenovo Chromebook.  
  - Subgoal 2: Set the title of the research proposal.  
  - Subgoal 3: List the objectives of the research.  
  - Subgoal 4: Provide background information for context.  
  - Subgoal 5: Create a methodology section.  
  - Subgoal 6: Add references to conclude the PDF.  
**Current Goal:** Open a PDF editing application on the Lenovo Chromebook (first step to enable document creation).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Open a PDF editing application on the Lenovo Chromebook.  
**How to Achieve:** Use a PDF editing tool available on the Chromebook, such as Google Docs or a web-based editor like Adobe Acrobat Online, to create a new document for the research proposal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To open a PDF editing application, access the Lenovo Chromebook’s app launcher, select Google Docs (a compatible tool for creating and exporting PDFs), and create a new document. Alternatively, navigate to a web-based PDF editor via the Chrome browser, sign in if required, and start a new file. This step ensures the document is ready for content input.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm that the PDF editing application is open and ready for use.  
**How to Achieve:** Check that the application (e.g., Google Docs or a web-based editor) is active, a new document is created, and the interface allows text input and formatting.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Verify that Google Docs or the chosen PDF editor is open on the Lenovo Chromebook. Ensure a blank document is visible, the cursor is active, and basic formatting options (e.g., font size, headings) are accessible. If the application fails to load, troubleshoot by checking internet connectivity or restarting the app.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Set the title of the research proposal.  
**How to Achieve:** Enter a clear, concise title at the top of the document that reflects the research topic, ensuring it meets standard proposal formatting guidelines.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the open document, type a title such as “Research Proposal: [Topic Name]” at the top. Format it as a heading (e.g., Heading 1 in Google Docs) and center it. Ensure the title is specific, professional, and relevant to the research topic (e.g., “Investigating Sustainable Energy Solutions for Urban Areas”).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Adjust Subgoals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review the subgoals to ensure they align with the dependencies and progress. The original subgoals remain appropriate, but refine the sequence for clarity:  
1. Open a PDF editing application (completed).  
2. Set the title (completed).  
3. List objectives (next, dependent on title).  
4. Provide background information (dependent on title, can be parallel with objectives).  
5. Create methodology section (dependent on title, can be parallel with objectives and background).  
6. Add references (dependent on objectives, background, and methodology).  
Adjust by prioritizing objectives next to maintain logical flow.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal:** List the objectives of the research.  
**Core Content for Retrieval:** Information related to setting objectives for a research proposal, including their dependency on the title.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Previous steps confirm that the title must be set before listing objectives (dependency from Step 1’s subgoals and Step 5’s implementation). The title, now set (e.g., “Investigating Sustainable Energy Solutions for Urban Areas”), provides the research focus. Objectives should be specific, measurable statements outlining the research’s aims, typically 3–5 in number, aligned with the title’s topic.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** List the objectives of the research.  
**How to Achieve:** Write 3–5 clear, measurable objectives in the document, ensuring they align with the research title and address key aspects of the study.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
In the document, create a section titled “Objectives” below the title. List objectives in bullet points, such as:  
- Evaluate the feasibility of solar energy adoption in urban settings.  
- Identify barriers to implementing sustainable energy solutions.  
- Propose strategies to overcome identified barriers.  
- Assess the environmental impact of proposed solutions.  
Ensure each objective is concise and directly tied to the research topic.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm that the objectives are correctly listed and aligned with the research title.  
**How to Achieve:** Review the objectives for clarity, relevance to the title, and adherence to standard research proposal formats.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Check the “Objectives” section to ensure it contains 3–5 objectives, each clearly worded and relevant to the title (e.g., “Investigating Sustainable Energy Solutions for Urban Areas”). Verify that objectives are specific, measurable, and logically connected to the research focus. If any are vague or off-topic, revise them (e.g., change “Study energy” to “Evaluate solar energy feasibility”).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Backward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Work backward from the final subgoal (add references) to identify necessary intermediate steps:  
1. References require citing sources used in objectives, background, and methodology.  
2. Methodology requires a detailed plan based on objectives and background.  
3. Background requires research to contextualize the objectives and title.  
4. Objectives (completed) depend on the title.  
5. Title (completed) depends on opening the PDF editor.  
This confirms the need to address background information next to support methodology and references.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Provide background information for the research proposal.  
**How to Achieve:** Research and summarize relevant literature or context in the document, ensuring it supports the objectives and title.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Create a section titled “Background Information” below the objectives. Write a concise paragraph (150–200 words) summarizing key literature or context, e.g., “Urban areas face increasing energy demands, with sustainable solutions like solar and wind gaining attention (Smith, 2023). Challenges include high costs and infrastructure limitations (Jones, 2024). This research builds on these findings to explore feasible solutions.” Use placeholder citations for now, to be detailed in the references section later.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Create a methodology section.  
**How to Achieve:** Outline the research methods in the document, ensuring they align with the objectives and are supported by the background information.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Add a section titled “Methodology” below the background. Describe the research approach, e.g., “This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of energy consumption data with qualitative interviews of urban planners. Data will be collected from three cities over six months, analyzed using statistical software, and validated through stakeholder feedback.” Ensure the methodology addresses each objective (e.g., feasibility, barriers, environmental impact).  
[/IMP]
