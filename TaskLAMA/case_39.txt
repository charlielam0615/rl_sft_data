**Problem Statement**: The task is to simulate the planning of a business report about marketing by creating a comprehensive plan that adheres to the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review). The plan must incorporate the given assumptions, substeps, and dependencies to ensure a structured approach to writing the report. The substeps include researching marketing, adding a title, writing a table of contents, including a brief summary, making a good introduction, outlining the methodology, presenting findings, and concluding with recommendations, with each step dependent on the completion of the previous one.
