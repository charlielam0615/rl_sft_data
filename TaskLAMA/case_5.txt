### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a free-standing patio cover into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Measure the garden area to determine the patio cover's dimensions.  
2. Dig holes for the posts, ensuring proper placement based on measurements.  
3. Remove moisture from the holes to prepare for post installation.  
4. Assemble the posts to form the structural supports.  
5. Secure the posts with cement to ensure stability.  
6. Create the beams to support the roof structure.  
7. Attach the beams to the main posts to form the frame.  
8. Build the roof structure on top of the beams.  
9. Cover the roof to complete the patio cover.  
These subgoals align with the provided substeps and respect the temporal dependencies (e.g., measuring must precede digging, etc.).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to provide context for the planning process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a free-standing patio cover in the garden.  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the garden area to determine the patio cover's dimensions.  
  - Subgoal 2: Dig holes for the posts, ensuring proper placement based on measurements.  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove moisture from the holes to prepare for post installation.  
  - Subgoal 4: Assemble the posts to form the structural supports.  
  - Subgoal 5: Secure the posts with cement to ensure stability.  
  - Subgoal 6: Create the beams to support the roof structure.  
  - Subgoal 7: Attach the beams to the main posts to form the frame.  
  - Subgoal 8: Build the roof structure on top of the beams.  
  - Subgoal 9: Cover the roof to complete the patio cover.  
**Current Goal**: Measure the garden area to determine the patio cover's dimensions.  
This hierarchy reflects the subgoals established in the previous step and respects the dependencies (e.g., measuring must be completed before digging).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Measure the garden area to determine the patio cover's dimensions.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a tape measure or laser measuring tool to measure the length and width of the garden area where the patio cover will be built. Record the dimensions to guide the placement of posts and the overall structure size.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To measure the garden area, select a tape measure or laser measuring tool for accuracy. Identify the desired location for the patio cover in the garden. Measure the length and width of the area, ensuring to account for any obstacles (e.g., trees, garden beds). Record the measurements (e.g., 12 feet by 10 feet) and double-check for accuracy to ensure the patio cover fits within the space and complies with local building regulations, if applicable. These dimensions will determine the placement of the posts in the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the measurements of the garden area.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the recorded measurements by re-measuring the garden area and verifying compliance with local building codes or space constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-measure the garden area using the same or a different tool (e.g., if a tape measure was used initially, try a laser measure for confirmation). Compare the new measurements with the previously recorded ones to ensure consistency. Check if the dimensions align with any local zoning or building regulations, such as maximum structure size or setback requirements from property lines. If discrepancies are found, adjust the measurements and note the final dimensions. For example, confirm the area is 12 feet by 10 feet and meets all requirements.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Based on the validated measurements, plan the next steps for digging holes. Break down the subgoal of digging holes into:  
1. Mark the locations for the post holes based on the patio cover's dimensions.  
2. Determine the depth and diameter of the holes to ensure stability.  
3. Gather necessary tools (e.g., post hole digger, shovel) for digging.  
These subgoals prepare for the physical construction phase while respecting the dependency that measuring must precede digging.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Dig holes for the posts, ensuring proper placement based on measurements.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the validated measurements to mark hole locations, then dig holes to the required depth and diameter using a post hole digger or shovel.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the recorded dimensions (e.g., 12 feet by 10 feet), mark the locations for the post holes at the corners of the patio cover area, ensuring even spacing (e.g., four posts for a rectangular cover). Use stakes and string or spray paint to mark the spots. Dig holes approximately 2–3 feet deep and 12–18 inches in diameter, depending on local building codes and the size of the posts (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6 posts). Remove soil and debris from the holes, ensuring they are uniform and level at the bottom to support the posts.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Current Goal**: Remove moisture from the holes to prepare for post installation.  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the condition of the holes (e.g., depth, diameter, and any potential moisture issues) from previous steps to ensure proper preparation.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
From the previous step, the holes are dug to a depth of 2–3 feet and a diameter of 12–18 inches, based on the validated measurements of the garden area (e.g., 12 feet by 10 feet). The holes are intended to support 4x4 or 6x6 posts. No specific moisture issues were noted during digging, but moisture removal is a required step to ensure the holes are dry before cement is applied, as per the substep list.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Remove moisture from the holes to prepare for post installation.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the holes for any accumulated water and use tools like a pump or absorbent materials to remove moisture.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect each hole for water accumulation, especially if digging occurred after rain or in a high-water-table area. If water is present, use a submersible pump or a manual method (e.g., a bucket or sponge) to remove it. Alternatively, add dry gravel or sand to the bottom of the holes to absorb residual moisture. Ensure the holes are completely dry and free of standing water to prevent issues with cement adhesion in the next step. Verify that the hole dimensions remain consistent (2–3 feet deep, 12–18 inches in diameter).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Plan the assembly of the posts by breaking down the subgoal into:  
1. Select appropriate post materials (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6 wooden or metal posts).  
2. Cut posts to the desired height, accounting for hole depth and patio cover height.  
3. Prepare posts for installation by ensuring they are level and aligned.  
This respects the dependency that digging holes must precede assembling posts.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Assemble the posts to form the structural supports.  
**How to Achieve**: Cut and install the posts in the prepared holes, ensuring they are level and aligned for structural integrity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select 4x4 or 6x6 posts (e.g., pressure-treated wood or metal) based on the patio cover design and local weather conditions. Cut the posts to the required height, typically 8–10 feet above ground, accounting for the 2–3 feet embedded in the holes. Place each post in a hole, using a level to ensure it is plumb (vertically straight). Temporarily brace the posts with stakes or supports to maintain alignment. Verify that the posts are evenly spaced according to the marked locations (e.g., corners of a 12x10-foot area).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Secure the posts with cement to ensure stability.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour concrete into the holes around the posts and allow it to set, ensuring the posts remain level during the process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Mix concrete according to the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., quick-setting concrete mix). Pour the concrete into each hole, filling it to just below ground level, ensuring the post remains centered and level. Use a level to check the post’s alignment during pouring and adjust if necessary. Allow the concrete to cure for at least 24–48 hours, depending on the product specifications, to ensure stability. Verify that all posts are securely fixed and aligned with the planned dimensions (e.g., 12x10-foot layout).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Plan the creation of the beams by breaking down the subgoal into:  
1. Select beam materials (e.g., 2x6 or 2x8 lumber) based on the patio cover’s size and load requirements.  
2. Cut beams to the appropriate length to span the posts.  
3. Prepare beams for attachment by sanding or treating them as needed.  
This respects the dependency that beams must be created before attaching them to the posts.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Create the beams to support the roof structure.  
**How to Achieve**: Cut and prepare beams to the correct dimensions for spanning the posts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select 2x6 or 2x8 lumber for the beams, ensuring they are strong enough to support the roof’s weight (e.g., for a 12x10-foot patio cover). Measure and cut the beams to span the distance between posts (e.g., 12 feet for the length and 10 feet for the width). Sand or treat the beams with weather-resistant sealant to protect against environmental damage. Ensure the beams are straight and free of defects to maintain structural integrity.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attach the beams to the main posts to form the frame.  
**How to Achieve**: Secure the beams to the posts using appropriate hardware (e.g., brackets, bolts) to create a stable frame.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Position the beams on top of the posts, aligning them to form the rectangular frame of the patio cover (e.g., 12x10 feet). Use galvanized steel brackets or post-to-beam connectors to secure the beams to the posts, ensuring a strong connection. Drill pilot holes and fasten with bolts or screws, checking that the beams are level and square. Verify the frame’s stability by ensuring all connections are tight and the structure does not wobble.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Plan the building of the roof by breaking down the subgoal into:  
1. Select roof framing materials (e.g., 2x4 lumber for rafters).  
2. Design the roof structure (e.g., sloped or flat) based on aesthetic and functional needs.  
3. Install rafters or other supports to complete the roof frame.  
This respects the dependency that the beams must be attached before building the roof.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Build the roof structure on top of the beams.  
**How to Achieve**: Install rafters or other supports to create the roof frame, ensuring proper spacing and alignment.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select 2x4 lumber for rafters, spaced approximately 16–24 inches apart, depending on the roof design (e.g., sloped for water runoff). Cut the rafters to the required length (e.g., 10 feet for the width of the patio cover). Attach the rafters to the beams using metal hangers or nails, ensuring they are evenly spaced and level. If a sloped roof is desired, angle the rafters accordingly (e.g., a 5-degree pitch). Check the roof frame for stability and alignment to support the roof covering.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Cover the roof of the patio.  
**How to Achieve**: Install the roof covering material (e.g., shingles, metal panels, or polycarbonate sheets) to complete the patio cover.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Choose a roof covering material suitable for the garden’s climate and aesthetic (e.g., asphalt shingles for durability or polycarbonate sheets for light transmission). Measure and cut the material to fit the roof frame (e.g., 12x10 feet). Secure the covering to the rafters using appropriate fasteners (e.g., roofing nails for shingles or screws for metal panels). Ensure the covering is weatherproof by overlapping materials and sealing edges as needed. Inspect the roof for gaps or loose sections to confirm it is fully protected.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 18
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been addressed and the patio cover is complete.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a free-standing patio cover in the garden (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 1: Measure the garden area to determine the patio cover's dimensions (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Dig holes for the posts, ensuring proper placement based on measurements (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove moisture from the holes to prepare for post installation (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Assemble the posts to form the structural supports (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Secure the posts with cement to ensure stability (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Create the beams to support the roof structure (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 7: Attach the beams to the main posts to form the frame (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 8: Build the roof structure on top of the beams (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 9: Cover the roof to complete the patio cover (Completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed).  
All subgoals have been addressed in sequence, respecting the dependencies (e.g., measuring before digging, attaching beams before building the roof). The patio cover is now fully planned and constructed.  
[/REVIEW]
