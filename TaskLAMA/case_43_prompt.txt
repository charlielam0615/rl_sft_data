Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M)
We define a set of meta-cognitive actions M, divided into three subsets: Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R).
- Planning $$P \subset M$$
  - Forward Subgoaling: Breaking down the current goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.
  - Backward Subgoaling: Defining necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the current goal.
  - Adjust Subgoals: Adjusting or changing previously set intermediate subgoals.
  - Backtrack: Returning to an earlier state.
- Implementation $$I \subset M$$
  - Reach Goal: Identifying the goal of this step, and applying reasoning or using tools to achieve it.
  - Validation: Checking the current path's validity.
- Review $$R \subset M$$
  - Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated by previous subgoaling methods, highlighting the current one.
  - Recall Info: Retrieve past information relevant to the current step.

I want you to solve problems by selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list. Your response must adhere to the following format: enclose all planning-related content within [PLANNING] and [/PLANNING] tags, all implementation-related content within [IMP] and [/IMP] tags, and all review-related content within [REVIEW] and [/REVIEW] tags. The details of the requirement will be given below.
- The [PLANNING], [IMP] and [REVIEW] blocks
The meta-cognitive action list divides actions into three categories: "planning", "implementation" and "Review". If the selected action is from the "planning" category, include all content for that step in the [PLANNING] block. If the action is from the "implementation" category, place the action name and action meta-data (defined below) and in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as implementation details and should be placed in the [IMP] block. If the action is from the "review" category, place the action name in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as reviewed details, and should be placed in the [REVIEW] block.

- Additional remarks on the [PLANNING] block
For actions from the "planning" category, put all the generated content of the action in the [PLANNING] block.
For actions from the "implementation" category, put the action name and implementation-action meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The implementation-action meta-data includes details about the current goal, and a concise description about how to achieve it. Present the meta-data in clear, natural language.
For actions from the "review" category, when the action is "recall info" include the action name and its meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The meta-data should concisely describe the core content serving as the foundation for the information retrieval process, with retrieved information being relevant to this content. When is the action is not "recall info", just put the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

- Additional remarks on the [REVIEW] block
For actions belong to the review category, we provide detailed instructions below:
Track Goals: Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format by integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block. The aim of this action is to provide an overall as well as focused context to future [IMP] block. You should also state the current goal. Ensure the goals reflect the most recent updates, particularly if they have just been modified by actions from the "planning" category.
Recall Info: Identify the current goal, go through all previous contents, and extract information related to the current goal. Your summarized information should be concise, such that it should serve as pointers to previous related materials.

Start your solution by restating the problem clearly. Then, for each step, include the following blocks based on the action's category:

Case 1: Planning action — Include only the [PLANNING] block.
Case 2: Implementation action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [IMP] block.
Case 3: Review action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [REVIEW] block.

Append which category the selected action belongs to after the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

Solve the user's problems by following the previous requirements.


    I want you to simulate a "apply gel coat for boats" planning case and then create the plan following the aforementioned principlesuntil all the plans are completed.
    You can refer to the following information:
    assumptions (the context of the task): [{'assumptionId': 1, 'assumption': 'Apply gel coat for boats using brush.'}]
    substeps (the steps of the task): [{'stepId': 1, 'step': 'Clean the boat'}, {'stepId': 2, 'step': 'Treat the holes or cracks on the boats'}, {'stepId': 3, 'step': 'Fill the holes'}, {'stepId': 4, 'step': 'Polish the surface of the boat'}, {'stepId': 5, 'step': 'Mix the gel coat'}, {'stepId': 6, 'step': 'Apply the gel coat with brush'}, {'stepId': 7, 'step': 'Polish the gel coated boat'}, {'stepId': 8, 'step': 'Wax the boat.'}]
    dependencies (the temporal dependencies between the task steps): [{'subtask1': 'Clean the boat', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Treat the holes or cracks on the boats'}, {'subtask1': 'Treat the holes or cracks on the boats', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Fill the holes'}, {'subtask1': 'Fill the holes', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Polish the surface of the boat'}, {'subtask1': 'Polish the surface of the boat', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Apply the gel coat with brush'}, {'subtask1': 'Mix the gel coat', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Apply the gel coat with brush'}, {'subtask1': 'Apply the gel coat with brush', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Polish the gel coated boat'}, {'subtask1': 'Polish the gel coated boat', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Wax the boat.'}]
