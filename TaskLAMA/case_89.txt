--- Case 89 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to make a wooden picture frame by following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step must select one action, and the response must adhere to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, based on the action's category. The plan must respect the given substeps and their temporal dependencies.

### Step 1: Define Subgoals for the Plan
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of making a wooden picture frame into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Cut each piece of wood to the proper length.  
2. Attach the wooden pieces using glue.  
3. Strengthen the frame corners.  
4. Apply paint to the frame.  
5. Place glass inside the frame.  
These subgoals must be executed in this order due to the dependencies provided.
