--- Case 33 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for cleaning a Briggs and Stratton carburetor for a pressure washer, following the provided meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must adhere to the given substeps and their temporal dependencies, ensuring each step uses one meta-cognitive action and follows the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required. The substeps are: assemble the outer case of the engine, check air filters, remove the carburetor, clean the carburetor bowl with a pressure washer, clean the central gasket, check all connections in parallel, use a carburetor cleaner, and reassemble the carburetor. These steps must be executed in the order dictated by the dependencies.
