### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Accurately measure the floor area to determine the required wood dimensions.  
**How to Achieve:** Use a tape measure to measure the length and width of the room, calculate the total area, and account for any irregularities (e.g., corners, alcoves). Record measurements for use in subsequent steps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal of measuring the floor area:
1. Gather tools: tape measure, notebook, and pen.
2. Measure the length and width of the room in feet or meters, ensuring to measure at multiple points to account for any uneven walls.
3. Note any irregularities, such as alcoves or protrusions, that may affect plank placement.
4. Calculate the total square footage (length × width) to estimate the amount of wood needed, adding 5-10% extra for waste or errors.
5. Record all measurements clearly for reference in the next steps.
[/IMP]
