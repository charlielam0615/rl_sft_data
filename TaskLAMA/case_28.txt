### Problem Restatement
The goal is to create a plan to lose arm fat by following a structured approach based on the provided substeps and their dependencies. The substeps are:
1. Pay attention to overall weight loss.
2. Focus on meals to burn arm fat.
3. Add more protein into your diet.
4. Boost your fiber intake.
5. Limit refined carbohydrates.
6. Engage in body weight exercises.

The dependencies specify the order:
- "Pay attention to overall weight loss" must be done before "Focus on meals to burn arm fat" and "Engage in body weight exercises."
- "Focus on meals to burn arm fat" must be done before "Add more protein into your diet," "Boost your fiber intake," and "Limit refined carbohydrates."

The plan will be developed step-by-step using the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as per the specified format.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the main goal of losing arm fat into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies.  
- Main goal: Lose arm fat.  
- Subgoals (following dependencies):  
  1. Achieve overall weight loss as a foundation.  
  2. Focus on meals tailored to burn arm fat.  
  3. Incorporate dietary changes: add protein, boost fiber, limit refined carbs.  
  4. Engage in body weight exercises to target arm fat.  
These subgoals respect the dependencies, where overall weight loss precedes meal planning and exercise, and meal planning precedes specific dietary adjustments.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to provide context for future steps.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Track Goals**  
Goal hierarchy:  
- Main goal: Lose arm fat  
  - Subgoal 1: Achieve overall weight loss  
  - Subgoal 2: Focus on meals to burn arm fat  
    - Subgoal 2.1: Add more protein into your diet  
    - Subgoal 2.2: Boost your fiber intake  
    - Subgoal 2.3: Limit refined carbohydrates  
  - Subgoal 3: Engage in body weight exercises  
**Current goal**: Achieve overall weight loss (Subgoal 1), as it is the foundational step per the dependencies.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Achieve overall weight loss.  
- **How to achieve**: Create a plan for overall weight loss by establishing a calorie deficit through a combination of dietary adjustments and increased physical activity, ensuring it supports arm fat reduction.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve overall weight loss:  
1. **Calculate calorie needs**: Determine daily caloric intake for maintenance (e.g., using a TDEE calculator) and aim for a 500-750 calorie deficit per day to lose 1-1.5 pounds per week.  
2. **Increase physical activity**: Incorporate 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) weekly to burn calories.  
3. **Monitor progress**: Track food intake and activity using an app to ensure consistency with the calorie deficit.  
This sets the foundation for subsequent steps targeting arm fat.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**:  
- **Current goal**: Validate the overall weight loss plan.  
- **How to achieve**: Check if the calorie deficit and activity plan is feasible and aligns with the goal of losing arm fat.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validation of the overall weight loss plan:  
- **Feasibility**: A 500-750 calorie deficit is sustainable and aligns with healthy weight loss guidelines (1-2 pounds per week).  
- **Alignment**: Aerobic activities burn overall body fat, which includes arm fat, as spot reduction is not possible but contributes to the main goal.  
- **Adjustments**: Ensure the plan includes nutrient-dense foods to support energy for upcoming exercise steps. The plan is valid and supports progression to meal planning.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Refine the next subgoal, "Focus on meals to burn arm fat," into actionable steps while respecting dependencies.  
- Subgoal: Focus on meals to burn arm fat.  
- Intermediate steps:  
  1. Plan balanced meals to maintain the calorie deficit.  
  2. Prepare for specific dietary adjustments (protein, fiber, carbs).  
This subgoal follows overall weight loss and precedes dietary specifics.
[/PLANNING]

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Meal plan to burn arm fat:  
1. **Structure meals**: Plan 3 meals and 1-2 snacks daily within the calorie deficit (e.g., 1500-1800 calories for a 2000-calorie maintenance).  
2. **Nutrient focus**: Emphasize whole foods (vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains) to support fat loss and muscle maintenance.  
3. **Sample daily plan**:  
   - Breakfast: Greek yogurt with berries (300 cal).  
   - Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with veggies (400 cal).  
   - Snack: Apple with almond butter (200 cal).  
   - Dinner: Baked salmon, quinoa, steamed broccoli (600 cal).  
This prepares for specific dietary tweaks in the next steps.
