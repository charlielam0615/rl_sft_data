--- Case 66 ---
### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to safely access the dark web on an iPhone, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) divided into Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and respecting the dependencies between substeps.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of safely accessing the dark web on an iPhone into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Open the VPN server.  
2. Select quick connect on the VPN.  
3. Open the onion browser.  
4. Configure the onion browser.  
5. Click on the next option in the onion browser.  
6. Select silver or medium security level.  
7. Click on start browsing.  
8. Connect to the Tor network.  
9. Explore the dark web.  
These subgoals follow the temporal dependencies, ensuring each step is completed before its dependent steps.
