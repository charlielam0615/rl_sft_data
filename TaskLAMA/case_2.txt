Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
Current Goal: Subgoal 1 - Prepare the space by emptying all the cabinets.  
Description: Achieve this subgoal by removing all items from the upper kitchen cabinets to ensure the space is ready for further preparation and painting tasks. This will involve organizing the items temporarily in a safe location.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To prepare the space, I will empty all the upper kitchen cabinets by carefully removing dishes, utensils, and other stored items. I will place these items in a designated area, such as a nearby table or counter, ensuring they are protected from dust or paint. I will also cover the countertops and surrounding areas with drop cloths or plastic sheets to prevent any damage during the painting process. This step ensures a clear workspace for the subsequent tasks.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will inspect the upper kitchen cabinets to confirm that they are completely empty, with no items left inside. I will also check that the countertops and nearby areas are covered with drop cloths or plastic sheets to protect them from potential spills or debris during the painting process. If any items are still in the cabinets or if any area remains unprotected, I will address these issues before moving to the next subgoal.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will use a screwdriver to carefully remove the hinges attaching the cabinet doors to the frames of the upper kitchen cabinets. I will label each door and its corresponding hardware (hinges, handles, screws) with masking tape and a marker to ensure they can be reinstalled in the correct positions later.

Description: Achieve this subgoal by cleaning the surfaces of the upper cabinets to remove dust, grease, or debris before further preparation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will use a damp cloth or sponge with a mild cleaning solution (such as dish soap and water) to wipe down the interior and exterior surfaces of the upper cabinet frames.

Description: Achieve this subgoal by filling any existing holes or imperfections in the cabinet frames with wood filler to create a smooth surface for painting.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will use a putty knife to apply wood filler to any visible holes, dents, or scratches on the upper cabinet frames. I will ensure the filler is pressed firmly into the holes and smoothed out to be level with the surrounding surface.

[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will use medium-grit sandpaper (around 120-150 grit) to sand all sides and faces of the cabinet doors, focusing on removing the existing stain or finish. I will sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. For hard-to-reach areas, I will use a sanding sponge or smaller pieces of sandpaper.
