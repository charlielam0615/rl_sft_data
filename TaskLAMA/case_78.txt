### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Remove all items from the cabinets.  
**How to Achieve**: Open all cabinet doors and drawers, and remove all contents (e.g., dishes, utensils, food) to a safe location, ensuring the cabinets are empty for cleaning and painting.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Open each cabinet door and drawer. Carefully remove all items, such as dishes, pots, pans, and food, and place them in a designated area, like a dining table or storage boxes, to keep them safe and out of the way. Ensure no items remain inside to allow full access to all cabinet surfaces.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all items have been removed from the cabinets.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect all cabinets and drawers to confirm they are empty and ready for the next step (taking a cotton cloth).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check every cabinet and drawer visually and by hand to ensure no items, such as small utensils or containers, remain inside. Confirm that all surfaces are accessible for cleaning. If any items are found, remove them to complete the step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Take a cotton cloth.  
**How to Achieve**: Locate a clean cotton cloth suitable for cleaning the cabinets, ensuring it is free of lint and debris.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Find a clean cotton cloth, such as a cotton rag or microfiber cloth, from a supply area or purchase one if necessary. Ensure the cloth is suitable for cleaning wood surfaces without leaving residue.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Clean the cabinets in the kitchen.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the cotton cloth with an appropriate cleaning solution to wipe down all cabinet surfaces, removing dirt, grease, and debris to prepare for priming.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Dampen the cotton cloth with a mild cleaning solution (e.g., warm water with a few drops of dish soap). Wipe down all cabinet surfaces, including doors, frames, and interiors, to remove grease, dust, and dirt. Dry the surfaces with a clean, dry cloth to ensure they are ready for primer application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the cabinets are clean and ready for priming.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect all cabinet surfaces to ensure they are free of grease, dirt, and moisture, confirming readiness for the primer coat.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Visually inspect and touch all cabinet surfaces to confirm they are clean, dry, and free of any residue. If any areas remain greasy or dirty, re-clean them with the cotton cloth and cleaning solution, then dry thoroughly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply a coat of primer.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a brush to apply a thin, even coat of primer to all cabinet surfaces, ensuring proper adhesion for the paint.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a high-quality primer suitable for wood surfaces. Using a clean brush, apply a thin, even layer of primer to all cabinet surfaces, including doors, frames, and edges. Work in small sections to ensure smooth application, following the grain of the wood.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Let the primer dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Allow sufficient time for the primer to dry completely, following the manufacturer’s instructions, before proceeding to painting.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Check the primer can for drying time instructions (typically 4-6 hours). Ensure the kitchen is well-ventilated and avoid touching the primed surfaces. Wait the recommended time to confirm the primer is fully dry before moving to the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Add paint to the bucket.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour the chosen paint into a clean bucket for easy access during painting.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a clean bucket or paint tray. Open the paint can and stir the paint thoroughly to ensure consistency. Pour a sufficient amount of paint into the bucket, avoiding overfilling to prevent spills.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Take a good quantity of paint.  
**How to Achieve**: Dip the brush into the bucket to collect an appropriate amount of paint for even application.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Dip a clean paintbrush into the bucket, coating the bristles with paint but avoiding overloading to prevent drips. Scrape excess paint off the brush on the bucket’s edge to ensure a controlled amount for application.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply paint to the cabinets with a brush.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the brush to apply an even coat of paint to all cabinet surfaces, following the wood grain for a smooth finish.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the loaded brush, apply paint to the cabinet surfaces in smooth, even strokes, following the wood grain. Work in small sections, ensuring no drips or streaks. Cover all areas, including doors, frames, and edges, for a uniform coat.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Let the paint dry.  
**How to Achieve**: Allow the first coat of paint to dry completely, following the paint manufacturer’s instructions, before applying the second coat.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Refer to the paint can for drying time (typically 4-8 hours). Ensure good ventilation in the kitchen and avoid touching the painted surfaces. Wait until the paint is fully dry to the touch before proceeding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Apply a second coat of paint.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply a second even coat of paint to the cabinets using the brush to achieve a polished, durable finish.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Dip the brush into the paint bucket again, collecting an appropriate amount. Apply a second coat of paint to all cabinet surfaces, using smooth, even strokes along the wood grain. Ensure full coverage and check for any missed spots or uneven areas.  
[/IMP]
