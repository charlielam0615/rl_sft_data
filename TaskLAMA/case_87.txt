**Current Goal**: Turn off the Hayward pool pump (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to turn off the Hayward pool pump. This will be achieved by locating the pump’s power switch and turning it off to ensure safety and stop water flow before proceeding with other steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the power switch or control panel for the Hayward pool pump, typically found near the pump or on a connected control system. Switch the pump to the "off" position to stop its operation. Confirm the pump is off by checking that it is no longer running.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the pump is turned off. This will be achieved by checking for no operational noise or vibration from the pump.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Listen for any operational noise from the pump and place a hand on the pump to feel for vibrations. If no noise or vibration is detected, the pump is confirmed to be off, validating the previous step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take off the drain cap. This will be achieved by locating the drain cap at the bottom of the filter tank and unscrewing it to allow drainage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the drain cap at the base of the Hayward sand filter tank. Use your hands or a wrench, if necessary, to unscrew the cap counterclockwise. Remove the cap and set it aside, allowing any water in the tank to drain out completely.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the multiport valve. This will be achieved by loosening any clamps or screws securing the valve to the filter tank and carefully lifting it off.

Identify the multiport valve on top of the filter tank. Loosen the clamp or screws holding the valve in place using a screwdriver or wrench, as required. Carefully lift the valve off the tank and place it in a safe location to avoid damage.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Adjust the order of the next subgoals based on the dependency that "Take off the valve" must precede "Remove the collar," which was listed in reverse in the initial substeps. The corrected sequence is:  
1. Take off the valve.  
2. Remove the collar.  
This adjustment ensures the plan aligns with the dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take off the valve. This will be achieved by detaching any remaining connections or fittings securing the valve to the stand pipe or tank.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the valve for any additional fittings or connections to the stand pipe or tank. Use appropriate tools (e.g., a screwdriver or wrench) to loosen and remove these connections. Carefully detach the valve and set it aside.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the collar. This will be achieved by unscrewing or unclamping the collar that secures the valve assembly to the tank.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the collar around the top of the filter tank, typically securing the valve assembly. Unscrew or unclamp the collar using a wrench or your hands, depending on the design. Remove the collar and place it in a safe location.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to seal the stand pipe with duct tape to prevent sand entry. This will be achieved by applying duct tape over the open end of the stand pipe inside the tank.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the stand pipe in the center of the filter tank. Cut a piece of duct tape large enough to cover the open end of the stand pipe. Apply the tape securely over the opening to prevent sand from entering during removal.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove the sand using a bucket. This will be achieved by scooping out the old sand from the tank into a bucket for disposal.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a small bucket or scoop to carefully remove the old sand from inside the filter tank. Transfer the sand into a larger bucket or container for disposal. Continue until most of the sand is removed from the tank.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to rinse the inside of the tank to remove any remaining sand. This will be achieved by using a garden hose to wash out residual sand and debris.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a garden hose to spray water inside the filter tank, focusing on areas with residual sand or debris. Rinse thoroughly, allowing the water to drain out through the open drain port. Continue until the tank is clean.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reattach the drain cap. Retrieve information from previous steps to confirm the drain cap was removed and is ready to be reattached.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
From Step 5, the drain cap was removed by unscrewing it from the base of the filter tank and set aside. It should be clean and ready for reattachment to the tank’s bottom.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to reattach the drain cap to the filter tank’s bottom. This will be achieved by screwing the drain cap back onto the tank’s drain port.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Retrieve the drain cap removed in Step 5. Align it with the drain port at the bottom of the filter tank. Screw it clockwise by hand or with a wrench until it is securely tightened to prevent leaks.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill the tank halfway with water. This will be achieved by using a hose to add water to the tank until it reaches approximately half its capacity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a garden hose to fill the filter tank with water until it reaches about halfway up the tank. Monitor the water level to ensure it does not exceed this point, as this prepares the tank for adding new sand.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add new sand to the tank. This will be achieved by pouring the correct type and amount of filter sand into the tank over the water.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Obtain the appropriate filter sand (e.g., silica sand) as specified for the Hayward sand filter model. Slowly pour the sand into the tank over the water, ensuring it settles evenly around the stand pipe. Add the recommended amount as per the filter’s specifications.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to change the sand-pipe. This will be achieved by replacing the stand pipe or its components if damaged or as part of maintenance.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the stand pipe for damage or wear. If replacement is needed, remove the duct tape from Step 10 and replace the stand pipe or its components with a new one compatible with the Hayward filter model. Secure the new pipe in place.  
[/IMP]
