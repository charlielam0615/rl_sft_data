### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To begin building the wooden bed frame, break down the overall goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The first subgoal is to take the required measurements, as it must be completed before cutting the wood. Subsequent subgoals will follow the sequence of substeps: cut the wood, make pocket holes, create the frame, attach the aprons, flip the frame to attach legs, attach supports, sand everything smooth, and wipe away sawdust.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain clarity on the current and upcoming steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a wooden bed frame  
  - Subgoal 1: Take the required measurement (current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Cut the wood  
  - Subgoal 3: Make the pocket holes  
  - Subgoal 4: Create the frame  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach the aprons  
  - Subgoal 6: Flip the frame assembly over to attach the legs  
  - Subgoal 7: Attach the supports  
  - Subgoal 8: Sand everything smooth  
  - Subgoal 9: Wipe away the sawdust  
**Current Goal**: Take the required measurement.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take the required measurement. This involves measuring the dimensions for the bed frame components (e.g., headboard, footboard, side rails, and supports) to ensure accurate cuts in the next step. Use a tape measure and note the dimensions based on the desired bed size (e.g., queen, king).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, select a standard bed size (e.g., queen: 60" wide x 80" long). Use a tape measure to determine the lengths and widths for the headboard, footboard, side rails, and support slats. Record measurements accurately, ensuring they align with the bed design. For example, side rails should be 80" long, and the headboard/footboard should be 60" wide, with heights based on design preferences (e.g., 36" for headboard, 24" for footboard). Double-check measurements to avoid errors in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the measurements taken for the bed frame components to ensure they meet the requirements for a stable and correctly sized bed frame. Check that measurements align with the chosen bed size and design specifications.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the recorded measurements against standard queen-size bed dimensions (60" x 80"). Ensure the side rails are exactly 80" long, the headboard and footboard are 60" wide, and heights are consistent with the design. Verify that support slat measurements account for even spacing across the frame. If discrepancies are found, re-measure to confirm accuracy before proceeding to cutting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the wood. Using the validated measurements, cut the wooden boards for the headboard, footboard, side rails, and supports to the specified dimensions using appropriate tools (e.g., circular saw).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Gather the required wood (e.g., 2x4s and 2x6s for the frame, 1x4s for slats). Using a circular saw or miter saw, cut the wood to the measurements: two 80" side rails (2x6), two 60" headboard/footboard pieces (2x6), and multiple support slats (1x4, approximately 60" long, depending on spacing). Ensure cuts are straight and precise, using a square to check edges. Label each piece to avoid confusion during assembly.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 6: Flip the frame assembly over to attach the legs  
  - Subgoal 7: Attach the supports  
  - Subgoal 8: Sand everything smooth  
  - Subgoal 9: Wipe away the sawdust  
**Current Goal**: Make the pocket holes.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make the pocket holes. Create pocket holes in the cut wooden pieces to allow for strong, hidden joints during frame assembly, using a pocket hole jig and drill.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set up a pocket hole jig according to the wood thickness (e.g., 1.5" for 2x6s). Drill pocket holes at the ends of the side rails (two per end) to connect to the headboard and footboard. Add pocket holes along the inner faces of the side rails (spaced every 12-15") to attach support slats. Ensure the jig is set for the correct angle and depth to create secure joints. Collect sawdust for easy cleanup later.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create the frame. Assemble the headboard, footboard, and side rails into a rectangular frame using pocket hole screws to form secure joints.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Lay out the headboard, footboard, and two side rails on a flat surface. Use pocket hole screws (e.g., 2.5" screws for 2x6s) to attach the side rails to the headboard and footboard, forming a rectangular frame. Ensure corners are square using a carpenter’s square. Clamp pieces together before screwing to maintain alignment. Check that the frame is level and sturdy after assembly.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the aprons. Secure the apron boards to the frame to add structural support and aesthetic detail, using screws or pocket holes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Cut apron boards (e.g., 1x4s) to fit along the outer edges of the side rails, headboard, and footboard. Attach the aprons to the frame using pocket hole screws or wood glue and finishing nails, ensuring they are flush with the frame’s edges. Verify that aprons are level and securely fastened to enhance the frame’s stability and appearance.  
[/IMP]

**Current Goal**: Flip the frame assembly over to attach the legs.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to flip the frame assembly over to attach the legs. Flip the assembled frame and attach four legs to the corners to elevate the bed frame.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Carefully flip the frame assembly upside down to access the bottom side. Cut four legs (e.g., 4x4 posts, 12" long for standard bed height). Attach one leg to each corner of the frame using pocket hole screws or heavy-duty brackets and screws, ensuring they are perpendicular to the frame. Check that all legs are securely fastened and the frame sits evenly on the ground.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the supports. Install support slats across the frame to provide a base for the mattress, securing them to the side rails.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the pre-cut support slats (e.g., 1x4s) across the frame, spaced evenly (approximately 3-4" apart). Secure each slat to the side rails using pocket hole screws through the holes drilled earlier. Ensure slats are level and flush with the top of the side rails to provide a flat surface for the mattress. Verify the frame’s stability after attaching all supports.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the assembled bed frame to ensure it is stable, level, and ready for finishing. Check all joints, legs, and supports for structural integrity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect all joints (pocket holes, screws) to ensure they are tight and secure. Test the frame’s stability by applying pressure to various points, checking for wobble or weakness. Use a level to confirm the frame and legs are even. Verify that support slats are evenly spaced and securely attached. Address any issues (e.g., tighten screws, adjust legs) before proceeding to sanding.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sand everything smooth. Sand all surfaces of the bed frame to remove rough edges and prepare for finishing.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use medium-grit sandpaper (e.g., 120-grit) to sand all surfaces of the frame, legs, aprons, and supports, focusing on rough edges and surfaces. Follow with fine-grit sandpaper (e.g., 220-grit) for a smooth finish. Sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. Ensure all surfaces are uniformly smooth and free of splinters.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wipe away the sawdust from the wooden bed frame. Clean the frame to remove all sawdust and debris in preparation for finishing or staining.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a tack cloth or a damp rag to wipe down all surfaces of the bed frame, removing sawdust and debris from sanding. Pay special attention to corners and joints where dust may accumulate. Ensure the frame is completely clean and dry before applying any finish or stain. Inspect the frame to confirm it is ready for final use or additional finishing steps.  
[/IMP]
