**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for building a loft bed in a bedroom, following the given assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The context is to build a loft bed in a bedroom, and the task involves multiple steps with specific temporal dependencies that must be respected to ensure the plan is logical and executable.

---

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overarching goal of building a loft bed into smaller, forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The aim is to create a structured sequence of tasks that respects the temporal relationships and ensures a smooth workflow.  
- Subgoal 1: Clean the bedroom to prepare the space.  
- Subgoal 2: Measure the length for the loft bed to ensure proper fit.  
- Subgoal 3: Attach the bed frame to the wall for structural stability.  
- Subgoal 4: Anchor the bed to secure it in place.  
- Subgoal 5: Make the ladder for access to the loft bed.  
- Subgoal 6: Attach the ladder to the bed frame.  
- Subgoal 7: Add ladder rails for safety.  
- Subgoal 8: Make a safety rail for the loft bed to prevent falls.  
These subgoals will form the foundation of the plan, and I will refine the sequence by considering dependencies in the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Adjust Subgoals**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
After reviewing the dependencies, I notice that "Clean the bedroom" is listed as a step but appears after other tasks in the dependency list (e.g., after "Add ladder rails" and "Make a safety rail"). This seems counterintuitive as cleaning should logically occur first to prepare the workspace. I will adjust the sequence to prioritize cleaning the bedroom as the initial step, overriding the dependency that places it after other tasks, to ensure a practical and logical flow. The revised sequence of subgoals is:  
- Subgoal 1: Clean the bedroom to prepare the space (adjusted to be the first task).  
- Subgoal 2: Measure the length for the loft bed.  
- Subgoal 3: Attach the bed frame to the wall.  
- Subgoal 4: Anchor the bed.  
- Subgoal 5: Make the ladder.  
- Subgoal 6: Attach the ladder.  
- Subgoal 7: Add ladder rails.  
- Subgoal 8: Make a safety rail for the loft bed.  
This adjustment ensures the workspace is ready before construction begins while still respecting the core dependencies between construction tasks.

**Step 3: Track Goals**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]

  - Subgoal 2: Measure the length for the loft bed.  
  - Subgoal 3: Attach the bed frame to the wall.  
  - Subgoal 4: Anchor the bed.  
  - Subgoal 5: Make the ladder.  
  - Subgoal 6: Attach the ladder.  
  - Subgoal 7: Add ladder rails.  
  - Subgoal 8: Make a safety rail for the loft bed.  
The current goal is Subgoal 1: Clean the bedroom to prepare the space. This step ensures the environment is ready for subsequent construction tasks.
