### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for painting a fiberglass door using a flat brush, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies. The plan must be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and guidelines. The assumptions, substeps, and dependencies are provided, and the plan must ensure all steps are completed in the correct order.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of painting a fiberglass door into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Remove dust from the fiberglass door.  
2. Wash the door neatly.  
3. Cover the hardware with tape.  
4. Apply a good amount of primer to the door.  
5. Cover the edges with a primer.  
6. Mix the paint to a perfect consistency.  
7. Dip the flat brush in the paint.  
8. Apply the paint to the fiberglass door using a flat brush.  
9. Let the paint dry.  
10. Apply the second coat.  
These subgoals must be executed sequentially due to the "Must be done before" dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format and highlight the current goal:  
- Main Goal: Paint a fiberglass door with a flat brush  
  - Subgoal 1: Remove dust from the fiberglass door (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Wash the door neatly  
  - Subgoal 3: Cover the hardware with tape  
  - Subgoal 4: Apply a good amount of primer to the door  
  - Subgoal 5: Cover the edges with a primer  
  - Subgoal 6: Mix the paint to a perfect consistency  
  - Subgoal 7: Dip the flat brush in the paint  
  - Subgoal 8: Apply the paint to the fiberglass door using a flat brush  
  - Subgoal 9: Let the paint dry  
  - Subgoal 10: Apply the second coat  
**Current Goal**: Remove dust from the fiberglass door.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to remove dust from the fiberglass door. This will be achieved by using a dry cloth or a soft brush to gently wipe or brush off dust from the door surface, ensuring it is clean for subsequent steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To remove dust from the fiberglass door, take a clean, dry cloth or a soft-bristled brush and gently wipe or brush the entire surface of the door, including edges and crevices, to ensure no dust remains. Pay attention to corners and textured areas where dust may accumulate.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the dust removal step was completed correctly. This will be achieved by visually inspecting the door surface to confirm no dust or debris remains.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the fiberglass door under good lighting to verify that all dust has been removed. Run a clean hand over the surface to feel for any residual particles. If dust is found, repeat the dust removal process with a dry cloth or brush.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 8: Apply the paint to the fiberglass door using a flat brush  
  - Subgoal 9: Let the paint dry  
  - Subgoal 10: Apply the second coat  
**Current Goal**: Wash the door neatly.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to wash the door neatly. This will be achieved by using a mild detergent mixed with water and a soft sponge or cloth to clean the door surface thoroughly, followed by rinsing and drying.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Mix a small amount of mild detergent with water in a bucket. Use a soft sponge or cloth to gently scrub the fiberglass door, removing any dirt or grease. Rinse the door with clean water to remove soap residue, then dry it thoroughly with a clean, lint-free cloth to prevent water spots.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the door has been washed neatly. This will be achieved by checking the door for any remaining dirt, grease, or soap residue and ensuring it is completely dry.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visually inspect the door to ensure no dirt, grease, or soap residue remains. Check for streaks or water spots. If any issues are found, rewash the affected areas with the detergent solution, rinse, and dry again. Confirm the door is clean and dry to the touch.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cover the hardware with tape. This will be achieved by applying painter’s tape carefully around door handles, hinges, and other hardware to protect them from primer and paint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Use high-quality painter’s tape to carefully cover all hardware on the fiberglass door, including handles, hinges, and any glass or decorative elements. Ensure the tape is applied smoothly without gaps to prevent primer or paint from seeping through. Press down firmly to secure the tape.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the hardware is properly covered with tape. This will be achieved by checking that all hardware is fully protected and the tape is securely adhered.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect all taped areas to ensure no hardware is exposed. Check that the tape is firmly adhered with no loose edges. If any gaps or loose tape are found, reapply painter’s tape to ensure full coverage and a secure seal.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cover the edges with a primer. This will be achieved by using a flat brush to carefully apply primer to the door’s edges, ensuring full coverage.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the same primer as before, apply a thin, even coat to the edges of the fiberglass door with a flat brush. Work carefully to avoid drips and ensure all edge surfaces are covered. Follow the manufacturer’s drying instructions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 18
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to mix the paint to a perfect consistency. This will be achieved by stirring the paint thoroughly to ensure an even texture and color.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the paint can and use a stir stick to mix the paint thoroughly for several minutes, ensuring no sediment remains at the bottom and the color is uniform. If the paint is too thick, add a small amount of thinner as per the manufacturer’s instructions and stir again.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 19
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the paint is mixed to a perfect consistency. This will be achieved by checking the paint’s texture and uniformity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the paint’s consistency by lifting the stir stick to observe its flow; it should be smooth and even without clumps. Test a small amount on a scrap surface to ensure it applies evenly. If the consistency is off, continue stirring or adjust with thinner as needed.

### Step 22
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the flat brush is properly loaded with paint. This will be achieved by checking that the brush has an even coat of paint without dripping.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the flat brush to ensure it is evenly coated with paint, with no excess dripping. If too much paint is loaded, tap the brush again to remove excess. If too little, dip again to load more paint, ensuring the brush is ready for application.

### Step 27
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to let the paint dry. This will be achieved by allowing the door to sit undisturbed for the recommended drying time as per the paint manufacturer’s instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Leave the fiberglass door undisturbed in a well-ventilated area, avoiding dust or debris. Follow the paint manufacturer’s recommended drying time, typically 4-6 hours, before proceeding to the next step. Check the paint can for specific instructions.  
[/IMP]
