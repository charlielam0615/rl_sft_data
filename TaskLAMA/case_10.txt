--- Case 10 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to build shed trusses for a penthouse, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure the solution. The plan must adhere to the given assumptions, substeps, and temporal dependencies, ensuring each step selects one action from the meta-cognitive action list and follows the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of building shed trusses into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The substeps are: create a sketch, submit the plan, measure lengths, cut wood, design truss shapes, construct a ledge, use hooks, attach truss pieces, and use gusset plates. Dependencies indicate a sequence: sketch → submit plan → measure → (cut wood, design truss) → construct ledge → use hooks → (attach pieces, use gussets). Subgoals are set as completing each substep in a feasible order respecting these dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build shed trusses for a penthouse.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a sketch of the truss design.  
  - Subgoal 2: Submit the plan to the constructing authority.  
  - Subgoal 3: Measure the length to structure the truss.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the wood.  
  - Subgoal 5: Design the truss by cutting into perfect shapes.  
  - Subgoal 6: Construct a ledge to place the truss.  
  - Subgoal 7: Use hooks made of construction adhesive.  
  - Subgoal 8: Attach the pieces of truss to the supportable hooks.  
  - Subgoal 9: Make use of gusset plates for good support.  
**Current Goal**: Create a sketch of the truss design (first step per dependencies).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create a sketch of the truss design. This involves drafting a detailed diagram of the truss structure, specifying dimensions and angles suitable for a penthouse, using drafting tools or software.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Create a detailed sketch of the truss design, including dimensions (e.g., span, height, pitch) tailored for a penthouse roof. Use drafting software like AutoCAD or hand-draw with precise measurements, ensuring the design accounts for load-bearing requirements and local building codes.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: Validate the truss design sketch by checking its compliance with building codes and structural requirements. This involves reviewing the sketch for accuracy in dimensions and load specifications.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Review the truss sketch to ensure it meets local building codes (e.g., wind and snow load requirements) and structural integrity standards. Cross-check dimensions and angles against penthouse specifications, consulting an engineer if necessary.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to submit the plan to the constructing authority. This involves preparing the sketch and supporting documents and submitting them to the relevant authority for approval.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compile the truss design sketch with any required documentation (e.g., material specifications, load calculations). Submit the package to the local constructing authority via their designated process (e.g., online portal or in-person).  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build shed trusses for a penthouse.  
  - Subgoal 1: Create a sketch of the truss design (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Submit the plan to the constructing authority (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Measure the length to structure the truss.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the wood.  
  - Subgoal 5: Design the truss by cutting into perfect shapes.  
  - Subgoal 6: Construct a ledge to place the truss.  
  - Subgoal 7: Use hooks made of construction adhesive.  
  - Subgoal 8: Attach the pieces of truss to the supportable hooks.  
  - Subgoal 9: Make use of gusset plates for good support.  
**Current Goal**: Measure the length to structure the truss (next step per dependencies).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to measure the length to structure the truss. This involves taking precise measurements based on the approved sketch to ensure accurate wood cutting and truss assembly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the approved truss sketch, measure the required lengths for each truss component (e.g., chords, webs) with a tape measure or laser tool. Mark measurements clearly, accounting for the penthouse’s dimensions and design specifications.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The dependency graph shows that measuring lengths enables two parallel subgoals: cutting wood and designing the truss by cutting into perfect shapes. To streamline, prioritize cutting wood first, as it provides materials needed for designing the truss shapes. Adjust subgoals to sequence cutting wood before truss design.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the wood. This involves using the measurements to cut wood pieces accurately for the truss components.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using a circular saw or miter saw, cut the wood (e.g., 2x4 or 2x6 lumber) to the measured lengths from the sketch. Ensure cuts are straight and precise, labeling each piece for its role in the truss (e.g., top chord, bottom chord).  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to design the truss by cutting into perfect shapes. This involves shaping the cut wood pieces into the specific angles and forms required by the truss design.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Use a miter saw to cut precise angles on the wood pieces as specified in the sketch (e.g., for pitched chords or diagonal webs). Sand edges if needed to ensure smooth, accurate fits for assembly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to construct a ledge to place the truss. This involves building a stable ledge or support structure to hold the truss during assembly.

**Meta-data**: Validate the constructed ledge by checking its stability and alignment. This ensures it can safely support the truss during assembly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Test the ledge’s stability by applying weight and checking for wobble or deflection. Use a level to confirm it is horizontal and aligned with the truss design specifications.  
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use hooks made of construction adhesive. This involves applying adhesive hooks to secure truss components during assembly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Apply heavy-duty construction adhesive to metal hooks or brackets, positioning them on the ledge or support structure as per the truss design. Ensure hooks are placed to hold truss components securely during assembly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the pieces of truss to the supportable hooks. This involves assembling the truss by securing wood pieces to the hooks.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Position the cut and shaped wood pieces onto the adhesive hooks on the ledge, following the sketch. Secure temporarily with clamps if needed, ensuring alignment with the design before permanent fastening.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make use of gusset plates for good support. This involves attaching metal gusset plates to reinforce truss joints.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Attach metal gusset plates to the truss joints using nails or screws, ensuring each joint is reinforced as per the design. Verify that plates are securely fastened and provide adequate support.  
[/IMP]

### Step 16
