**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to write a business case study, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure the solution. The substeps are: (1) Determine the best possible avenue for the data, (2) Make the title eye-catching, (3) Maintain simplicity in the language, (4) Include actual numbers in the case study, (5) Complete the case study with all relevant contact information, (6) Make the piece more visually appealing, and (7) Publish the case study. Dependencies dictate the order of execution.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of writing a business case study into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Identify the best data sources and format for the case study.  
2. Ensure language simplicity for accessibility.  
3. Incorporate accurate numerical data.  
4. Add relevant contact information.  
5. Enhance visual appeal.  
6. Create an eye-catching title.  
7. Publish the completed case study.  
These subgoals align with the provided substeps and respect dependencies (e.g., data avenue before language simplicity, language simplicity before numbers and visuals, etc.).

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate:  
- Verify data reliability: Confirm internal sales data is accurate and testimonials are authentic.  
- Assess format suitability: Ensure the problem-solution format effectively communicates the business value to stakeholders.  
- Seek feedback from a sample audience (e.g., a colleague or manager) to confirm clarity and impact.  
**Outcome**: Data sources (sales data, testimonials) are verified as reliable; problem-solution format is deemed suitable based on audience alignment.  
[/IMP]

4. Add contact information (e.g., company website, contact email).  
5. Incorporate visuals (e.g., charts, infographics) to enhance appeal.  
6. Craft an eye-catching title that reflects the case study’s value proposition.  
7. Publish the case study on the appropriate platform (e.g., company website, industry journal).  
Adjustment: Emphasize verified data in subgoal 1 and specify types of visuals in subgoal 5 for clarity.
