--- Case 62 ---
**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for replacing floor tiles in a shower, adhering to the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The context is to replace the floor tile in the shower, and the plan must follow the given sequence of substeps and their temporal dependencies while using the meta-cognitive action set to structure the planning process.

---

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of replacing the floor tile in the shower into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will be structured to ensure a logical flow of tasks. My forward subgoals are:  
1. Remove the old tile as the initial step.  
2. Check the shower base after removing the old tile.  
3. Inspect the water barrier concurrently or after checking the shower base.  
4. Place the new tile once the base and barrier are confirmed to be in good condition.  
5. Use tile spacers to avoid breakage during or after placing the new tile.  
These subgoals respect the dependencies provided, ensuring each task is performed in the correct order.  
[/PLANNING]

---

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
I will refine the initial subgoals to add clarity and ensure all dependencies are explicitly addressed. The adjusted subgoals are:  
1. Remove the old tile completely to prepare the area for inspection.  
2. Check the shower base for any damage or issues that need repair before proceeding.  
3. Inspect the water barrier to ensure it is intact and functional, as it must be verified before new tile installation.  
4. Place the new tile carefully on the prepared surface after confirming the base and barrier are ready.  
5. Use tile spacers during the tile placement process to maintain even gaps and prevent breakage or misalignment.  
This adjustment incorporates the temporal dependencies more explicitly, such as ensuring the water barrier and base are checked before placing new tiles.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Replace floor tile in the shower.  
  - Subgoal 1: Remove the old tile completely to prepare the area for inspection.  
  - Subgoal 2: Check the shower base for any damage or issues that need repair before proceeding.  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect the water barrier to ensure it is intact and functional.  
  - Subgoal 4: Place the new tile carefully on the prepared surface.  
  - Subgoal 5: Use tile spacers during the tile placement process to maintain even gaps and prevent breakage or misalignment.  
Current Goal: Remove the old tile completely to prepare the area for inspection.  
This hierarchy reflects the most recent updates to the subgoals and provides a clear context for the next steps.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Remove the old tile completely to prepare the area for inspection.  
How to Achieve: Use appropriate tools such as a chisel and hammer or a tile removal tool to carefully break and lift the old tiles, ensuring the underlying surface is not damaged. Dispose of the debris safely and clean the area for the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To remove the old tile, start by wearing safety gear such as gloves and goggles to protect against sharp edges and dust. Use a chisel and hammer or a powered tile removal tool to break the tiles into smaller pieces, starting from an edge or a corner for easier access. Carefully pry up the broken pieces, ensuring not to damage the underlying shower base or water barrier. Collect all debris in a sturdy container or bag for disposal, and sweep or vacuum the area to remove any remaining dust or small fragments. This prepares the surface for the next inspection steps.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the removal of the old tile.  
How to Achieve: Inspect the area where the old tile was removed to ensure no tile fragments remain and that the underlying surface is clean and undamaged, ready for the next steps of checking the shower base and water barrier.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Examine the shower floor area thoroughly to confirm that all old tiles have been completely removed. Check for any leftover adhesive or grout that might interfere with the next steps, and scrape it off if necessary using a putty knife or scraper. Verify that the shower base appears intact with no visible cracks or damage caused during tile removal. Ensure the area is clean by sweeping or wiping it down, confirming it is prepared for inspecting the base and water barrier.

**Step 7**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Check the shower base for any damage or issues that need repair before proceeding.  
How to Achieve: Inspect the shower base visually and physically for cracks, unevenness, or signs of water damage, and determine if repairs are needed before moving to the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carefully examine the exposed shower base for any visible cracks, chips, or uneven areas that could affect the installation of new tiles. Use a flashlight if necessary to check for hidden damage in corners or under edges. Press gently on different areas to detect any soft spots or instability that might indicate underlying issues. If any damage is found, note the extent and type of repair needed, such as patching cracks with a suitable filler or leveling the surface. If the base is in good condition, confirm it is ready for the next step of inspecting the water barrier.  
[/IMP]

**Step 8**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Inspect the water barrier to ensure it is intact and functional.  
How to Achieve: Check the water barrier or membrane beneath the tile area for tears, holes, or improper sealing, ensuring it can prevent water leakage before installing new tiles.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Inspect the water barrier or waterproof membrane that should be present beneath the shower base area. Look for any visible tears, punctures, or areas where the barrier might have been compromised during tile removal. Check the edges and seams where the barrier meets the walls or drain to ensure they are properly sealed. If possible, perform a simple water test by pouring a small amount of water onto the barrier to see if it holds without leaking through. If any issues are found, plan to repair or replace the damaged sections of the barrier using appropriate waterproofing materials before proceeding. If the barrier is intact, confirm readiness for tile installation.

**Step 10**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Place the new tile carefully on the prepared surface.  
How to Achieve: Apply mortar or adhesive to the shower base and lay the new tiles in a planned pattern, ensuring they are level and aligned properly before they set.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Begin by preparing the tile adhesive or thin-set mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring the correct consistency for application. Spread the adhesive evenly over a small section of the shower base using a notched trowel to create ridges that help with tile adhesion. Start laying the new tiles from a central point or corner, following a pre-planned layout to ensure symmetry and minimal cutting. Press each tile firmly into the adhesive, twisting slightly to ensure a good bond, and check for levelness using a spirit level. Adjust as needed before the adhesive sets. Continue this process, working in small sections to maintain control over the adhesive drying time, until the entire area is covered with new tiles.  
[/IMP]

**Step 11**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Use tile spacers during the tile placement process to maintain even gaps and prevent breakage or misalignment.  
How to Achieve: Insert tile spacers between each tile as they are laid to ensure consistent spacing for grout lines and to prevent tiles from shifting or breaking due to uneven pressure.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
While placing each tile, insert plastic tile spacers at the corners where tiles meet to maintain uniform gaps for grout application later. Use spacers of the appropriate size based on the desired grout line width, typically 1/8 inch or 1/16 inch for shower floors. Place spacers vertically between tiles to ensure they stay aligned and do not shift while the adhesive dries. Check periodically to confirm that the spacers are keeping the tiles evenly spaced and adjust if necessary. Remove excess adhesive that may squeeze up between tiles before it hardens. Once the tiles are set and the adhesive has cured (as per manufacturer guidelines, usually 24 hours), remove the spacers before proceeding to grout. This step prevents breakage and misalignment by ensuring even distribution of pressure across the tiled surface.
