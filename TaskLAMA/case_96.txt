--- Case 96 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to become a real estate agent in California, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and requirements.

The goal is to complete all steps required to obtain a California real estate license, following the sequence: 
1. Register for the pre-licensing course.
2. Complete the required 135 hours of pre-licensing education.
3. Apply for the salesperson license.
4. Submit fingerprints for a criminal background check.
5. Pass the licensing exam with a score of 70 percent.
6. Obtain a sponsorship from a California-licensed broker.
7. Complete the California real estate license.

Each step must respect the dependencies (e.g., Step 1 must be completed before Step 2, etc.), and the plan will be developed systematically using the meta-cognitive actions: Planning (Forward Subgoaling, Backward Subgoaling, Adjust Subgoals, Backtrack), Implementation (Reach Goal, Validation), and Review (Track Goals, Recall Info).
