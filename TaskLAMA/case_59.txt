### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Measure the area.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of the backsplash area in the camper, accounting for any obstacles like outlets or corners. Record the measurements accurately to calculate the required tile quantity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To measure the area, gather a tape measure, notepad, and pen. Measure the height and width of the backsplash area on the camper’s kitchen wall. Note any irregularities, such as outlets or fixtures, that may affect tile placement. Double-check measurements for accuracy and calculate the total square footage by multiplying height by width. For example, if the area is 2 feet high by 6 feet wide, the total area is 12 square feet. Add 10% extra for cuts or errors (e.g., 13.2 square feet).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Ensure the measurements are accurate.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify the recorded measurements by re-measuring the area and checking calculations to confirm they align with the backsplash requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-measure the backsplash area to confirm the dimensions match the initial recordings. For instance, if the first measurement was 2 feet by 6 feet, re-measure to ensure consistency. Recalculate the square footage and compare it with the initial result. Check for overlooked obstacles (e.g., outlets) that could affect tile quantities. If discrepancies are found, adjust the measurements accordingly.
