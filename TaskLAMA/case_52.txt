**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan for building a double wood gate, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, adhering to the specified format and guidelines.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of building a double wood gate into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Measure the width between the fence posts.  
2. Lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner.  
3. Attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame.  
4. Turn the gate frames.  
5. Attach vertical boards using galvanized nails.  
6. Adjust the hinges.  
7. Place the gates between the fence posts.  
8. Place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps.  
9. Attach all hardware.  
These subgoals will guide the construction process, respecting the dependencies (e.g., measuring must precede laying lumber).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from the previous planning step. The current goal is to measure the width between the fence posts.  
- **Main Goal**: Build a double wood gate  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Measure the width between the fence posts (Current)  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Turn the gate frames  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Attach vertical boards using galvanized nails  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Adjust the hinges  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Place the gates between the fence posts  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Attach all hardware  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to measure the width between the fence posts. This will be achieved by using a tape measure to determine the precise distance between the posts to ensure the gate frames fit correctly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Use a tape measure to measure the distance between the two fence posts where the double gate will be installed. Record the measurement to determine the total width of the gate, accounting for a small gap (e.g., 1/4 inch on each side) for smooth operation. Ensure the measurement is taken at multiple points (top, middle, bottom) to confirm the posts are parallel.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the measurement of the width between the fence posts. This will be achieved by re-measuring the distance and checking consistency with the recorded value to ensure accuracy before proceeding.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-measure the width between the fence posts at the top, middle, and bottom to confirm the initial measurement. Compare the results with the recorded value. If discrepancies exist, take the average or re-measure to ensure accuracy. Verify that the posts are plumb using a level to ensure the gate will align properly.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner. This will be achieved by cutting a piece of lumber to fit diagonally across the gate frame and securing it to provide structural support.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a piece of lumber (e.g., 2x4) and measure the diagonal distance across one gate frame from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. Cut the lumber to fit precisely. Place the lumber diagonally across the frame and secure it with galvanized screws or nails at each end, ensuring it is flush with the frame to reinforce its structure. Repeat for the second gate frame.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress. The current goal is to attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame.  
- **Main Goal**: Build a double wood gate  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Measure the width between the fence posts (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame (Current)  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Turn the gate frames  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Attach vertical boards using galvanized nails  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Adjust the hinges  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Place the gates between the fence posts  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Attach all hardware  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame. This will be achieved by securing a wooden block to the bottom of each gate frame to add stability and support.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a block of wood (e.g., 2x4 or scrap piece) sized to fit the width of the bottom horizontal frame of each gate. Position the block along the bottom horizontal frame of one gate and secure it using galvanized screws or nails. Ensure it is level and flush with the frame. Repeat for the second gate frame.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to turn the gate frames. This will be achieved by flipping the gate frames to prepare for attaching vertical boards on the opposite side.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Carefully lift and rotate each gate frame 180 degrees so the opposite side faces up, ensuring the diagonal lumber and bottom block remain secure. Place the frames on a flat surface, such as sawhorses, to prepare for attaching vertical boards. Verify that the frames remain square using a carpenter’s square.  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach vertical boards using galvanized nails. This will be achieved by securing vertical boards to the gate frames to form the gate’s surface.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Measure and cut vertical boards (e.g., 1x6 or 1x8) to match the height of each gate frame. Align the boards side by side across the frame, ensuring even spacing and flush edges. Secure each board to the frame using galvanized nails, driving them into the horizontal and diagonal supports. Check that the boards are level and evenly spaced. Repeat for the second gate frame.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The subgoal “Adjust the hinges” may need clarification, as hinges are typically attached before adjustment. Adjust the subgoal to “Attach and adjust the hinges” to reflect the need to install hinges before fine-tuning their alignment. The updated subgoals are:  
1. Measure the width between the fence posts (Completed).  
2. Lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner (Completed).  
3. Attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame (Completed).  
4. Turn the gate frames (Completed).  
5. Attach vertical boards using galvanized nails (Completed).  
6. Attach and adjust the hinges.  
7. Place the gates between the fence posts.  
8. Place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps.  
9. Attach all hardware.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach and adjust the hinges. This will be achieved by installing hinges on each gate frame and fine-tuning their alignment for smooth operation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select heavy-duty gate hinges (e.g., strap or T-hinges) suitable for the gate’s weight. For each gate, attach two hinges to the vertical frame on the side that will connect to the fence post, spacing them evenly (e.g., 6 inches from top and bottom). Secure the hinges with galvanized screws. Temporarily hang each gate on its respective fence post by attaching the other side of the hinges to the post. Test the gate’s swing and adjust the hinge positions or screw tightness to ensure smooth operation without binding.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Update the goal-management system to reflect progress. The current goal is to place the gates between the fence posts.  
- **Main Goal**: Build a double wood gate  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Measure the width between the fence posts (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Lay a piece of lumber diagonally from corner to corner (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Attach a block of wood to the bottom horizontal frame (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Turn the gate frames (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Attach vertical boards using galvanized nails (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Attach and adjust the hinges (Completed)  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Place the gates between the fence posts (Current)  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Attach all hardware  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the gates between the fence posts. This will be achieved by permanently hanging the gates on the fence posts using the installed hinges.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Lift each gate and align the hinges with the corresponding points on the fence posts. Secure the hinges to the posts using galvanized screws, ensuring the gates are level and swing freely. Check that the gates meet in the middle with a small gap (e.g., 1/4 inch) to allow for expansion and smooth operation. Use a level to confirm both gates are plumb and aligned with each other.  
[/IMP]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place wedges at the sides of the gates to cover gaps between gates. This will be achieved by installing wooden wedges to fill gaps and ensure a seamless appearance.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Measure the gaps between the gates and between each gate and its adjacent fence post. Cut thin wooden wedges or shims to fit these gaps, tapering them for a snug fit. Insert the wedges into the gaps, securing them with wood glue or small galvanized nails if necessary. Sand the wedges to match the gate’s surface for a smooth, uniform look.  
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach all hardware. Retrieve information related to the hardware required for the double gate, based on previous steps and typical gate construction needs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to attach all hardware. From previous steps, hinges have already been attached and adjusted (Step 11). Typical hardware for a double gate includes a latch or lock to secure the gates together and possibly a gate stop or drop rod to stabilize one gate. No specific hardware details were provided in earlier steps beyond hinges, so the focus is on completing the gate with a latch and any additional hardware like a drop rod.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 16
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach all hardware. This will be achieved by installing a latch to secure the gates and a drop rod to stabilize one gate.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select a heavy-duty gate latch (e.g., a slide bolt or thumb latch) suitable for double gates. Install the latch on the inner side of one gate, aligning it with a corresponding catch on the other gate, and secure it with galvanized screws. Test the latch to ensure it engages smoothly. For added stability, install a drop rod on one gate (typically the less frequently used one). Attach the drop rod vertically to the gate’s frame with brackets, ensuring it can be lowered into a hole in the ground to lock the gate in place. Drill a small hole in the ground if necessary. Verify all hardware functions properly and the gates open and close securely.  
[/IMP]

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
