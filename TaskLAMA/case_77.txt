--- Case 77 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for installing a pool pump motor, following the provided meta-cognitive action framework. The process involves completing the substeps in the correct order, respecting the temporal dependencies, and using the meta-cognitive actions (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure the solution. The substeps are: (1) Turn off the power to the pool, (2) Remove the diffuser, (3) Remove the impeller, (4) Prepare the motor, (5) Install the new motor, and (6) Reinstall the pool pump. Each substep must be completed before the next, as specified in the dependencies.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of installing a pool pump motor into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Turn off the power to the pool.  
2. Remove the diffuser.  
3. Remove the impeller.  
4. Prepare the motor.  
5. Install the new motor.  
6. Reinstall the pool pump.  
These subgoals must be executed sequentially due to the "Must be done before" dependencies.

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Maintain a goal-management system to list all subgoals in a nested format:  
- Main Goal: Install pool pump motor  
  - Subgoal 1: Turn off the power to the pool  
  - Subgoal 2: Remove the diffuser  
  - Subgoal 3: Remove the impeller  
  - Subgoal 4: Prepare the motor  
  - Subgoal 5: Install the new motor  
  - Subgoal 6: Reinstall the pool pump  
**Current Goal**: Turn off the power to the pool (Subgoal 1).  
This provides context for the next implementation step.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to turn off the power to the pool. This will be achieved by locating the pool’s electrical breaker and switching it off to ensure safety during the pump installation process.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To turn off the power to the pool:  
1. Locate the electrical breaker panel that controls the pool equipment.  
2. Identify the breaker labeled for the pool or pump (typically marked or listed in the panel’s directory).  
3. Switch the breaker to the "off" position.  
4. Verify the power is off by checking that the pump is not running or using a non-contact voltage tester at the pump’s power connection.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm that the power to the pool is turned off. This will be achieved by verifying that the pump is non-operational and no voltage is present at the pump’s power connection.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate that the power is off:  
1. Check that the pool pump is not running (no noise or vibration).  
2. Use a non-contact voltage tester at the pump’s electrical connection to confirm no voltage is present.  
3. If power is still detected, return to the breaker panel to ensure the correct breaker is switched off.
