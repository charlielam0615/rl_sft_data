--- Case 64 ---
### Problem Statement
The goal is to build a batting cage at home in the garden by completing a series of predefined substeps in the correct order, respecting their temporal dependencies. The substeps are: (1) Get the garden area clean, (2) Take the required measurements, (3) Set small stakes in the ground, (4) Make holes for wood poles, (5) Clean the grass around the holes, (6) Add the eye hooks to the insides of the poles, (7) Align the steel cable through all of the poles, (8) Tie the cable together with the clamps, (9) Put the net over top of the poles, and (10) Adjust the net to the top of all sides of poles. Each step must be completed before the next, as specified in the dependencies.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and adhering to the meta-cognitive action guidelines.
