--- Case 75 ---
**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to change the sand in a pool filter, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) with one action per step, formatted with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The plan must respect the dependencies and complete all substeps in the correct order.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create a plan for changing the pool filter sand, work backward from the final goal: running the filter with new sand (Step 9). Identify necessary intermediate subgoals by following the dependencies in reverse order:  
- Run the filter (Step 9) requires backwashing and rinsing the filter (Step 8).  
- Step 8 requires reassembling connections after filling the tank (Step 7).  
- Step 7 requires tossing in new sand (Step 6).  
- Step 6 requires filling the tank halfway with water (Step 5).  
- Step 5 requires rinsing the tank and laterals (Step 4).  
- Step 4 requires protecting the standpipe (Step 3).  
- Step 3 requires taking out the multiport valve (Step 1).  
- Step 1 requires removing the pipes connected to the multiport valve (Step 2).  
This results in the correct sequence: Step 2 → Step 1 → Step 3 → Step 4 → Step 5 → Step 6 → Step 7 → Step 8 → Step 9.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Change the pool filter sand and run the filter.  
  - Subgoal 1: Remove the pipes connected to the multiport valve (Step 2, current).  
  - Subgoal 2: Take out the multiport valve (Step 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Protect the standpipe (Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 4: Rinse the tank and laterals (Step 4).  
  - Subgoal 5: Fill the tank halfway with water (Step 5).  
  - Subgoal 6: Toss in new sand (Step 6).  
  - Subgoal 7: Reassemble connections after filling the tank (Step 7).  
  - Subgoal 8: Backwash and rinse the filter (Step 8).  
  - Subgoal 9: Run the filter (Step 9).  
**Current Goal**: Remove the pipes connected to the multiport valve (Step 2).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Remove the pipes connected to the multiport valve.  
**How to Achieve**: Turn off the pump, close valves to isolate the filter, and use tools (e.g., wrench or screwdriver) to disconnect the pipes from the multiport valve, ensuring no water leakage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Turn off the pool pump to stop water flow. Close the inlet and outlet valves to isolate the filter system. Identify the pipes connected to the multiport valve (typically PVC pipes secured with unions or clamps). Use a wrench or screwdriver to loosen and remove the unions or clamps, then carefully detach the pipes, ensuring no residual water spills excessively. Place the pipes aside safely for reassembly later.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Take out the multiport valve.  
**How to Achieve**: With the pipes removed, unscrew or unclamp the multiport valve from the filter tank, carefully lifting it off to avoid damaging the valve or tank.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Locate the multiport valve on top of the filter tank. Use a screwdriver or wrench to loosen the bolts or clamps securing the valve to the tank. Gently lift the valve straight up, ensuring not to damage the standpipe or any attached components. Set the valve aside in a safe, clean location to prevent debris contamination.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the multiport valve is removed correctly and the standpipe is accessible for protection.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the filter tank to ensure the multiport valve is fully detached and the standpipe is exposed and undamaged, ready for the next step.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Visually inspect the top of the filter tank to confirm the multiport valve is completely removed. Check that the standpipe (the central tube inside the tank) is visible, intact, and free of debris. Ensure no residual bolts or clamps remain that could interfere with protecting the standpipe. If any issues are found, address them (e.g., remove leftover clamps or clear debris).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Protect the standpipe.  
**How to Achieve**: Cover the standpipe opening with a protective cap or tape to prevent sand or debris from entering during the next steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Obtain a standpipe cap, a plastic bag, or duct tape. Carefully place the cap or tape over the open end of the standpipe to seal it, ensuring no sand or debris can enter during tank rinsing or sand replacement. Secure the cover tightly but avoid damaging the standpipe.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Rinse the tank and laterals.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a garden hose to spray water inside the filter tank and over the laterals to remove old sand and debris, ensuring the standpipe remains protected.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Connect a garden hose to a water source. Direct the hose into the filter tank, spraying water to dislodge and flush out old sand and debris. Focus on the laterals (the slotted tubes at the tank’s bottom) to ensure they are clean and free of clogs. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear, ensuring the standpipe’s protective cover remains in place to prevent debris entry. Drain excess water if necessary.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Fill the tank halfway with water.  
**How to Achieve**: Add water to the filter tank using a hose until it reaches approximately halfway, providing a cushion for the new sand to protect the laterals.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the garden hose, slowly fill the filter tank with water until it reaches about half the tank’s height. Monitor the water level to avoid overfilling, ensuring the laterals are submerged but the tank is not too full to accommodate the new sand. Keep the standpipe’s protective cover in place during this process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Toss in new sand.  
**How to Achieve**: Pour the appropriate type and amount of filter sand into the tank, ensuring even distribution around the standpipe while keeping its cover in place until the sand is added.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Obtain the correct type and quantity of pool filter sand (e.g., silica sand, as specified for the filter model). With the standpipe still protected, carefully pour the sand into the tank, aiming for even distribution around the standpipe. Add sand until it reaches the manufacturer-recommended level (typically marked inside the tank). Remove the standpipe’s protective cover after adding the sand, ensuring no sand enters the pipe. Smooth the sand surface if needed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Reassemble connections after filling the tank.  
**How to Achieve**: Reattach the multiport valve to the tank and reconnect the pipes, ensuring secure and leak-free connections.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the multiport valve back onto the filter tank, aligning it properly with the standpipe and tank fittings. Secure it with the original bolts or clamps, tightening them evenly with a screwdriver or wrench. Reconnect the pipes to the multiport valve, ensuring unions or clamps are properly fastened to prevent leaks. Check all connections for tightness and alignment.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Backwash and rinse the filter.  
**How to Achieve**: Set the multiport valve to “backwash,” run the pump to flush out debris, then switch to “rinse” to settle the sand, ensuring the system is clean.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Turn on the pool pump. Set the multiport valve to the “backwash” position and run the pump for 2–3 minutes, observing the sight glass until the water runs clear, indicating debris is flushed out. Switch the valve to the “rinse” position and run for about 30 seconds to settle the new sand. Turn off the pump after completing both cycles.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Run the filter.  
**How to Achieve**: Set the multiport valve to “filter” and start the pump to begin normal operation, ensuring the system functions correctly.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Set the multiport valve to the “filter” position. Turn on the pool pump to start normal filtration. Observe the system for a few minutes to ensure there are no leaks, unusual noises, or pressure issues. Verify that water is circulating properly through the filter and returning to the pool.  
[/IMP]
