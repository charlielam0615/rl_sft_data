### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for fixing garage door problems through a DIY approach. The process involves completing six substeps: sliding the door to identify sticking issues, examining external controls, inspecting safety sensors, looking over the door opener mechanism, checking door springs and cables, and examining door rails and tracks. These steps have specific temporal dependencies, where certain steps must be completed before others can begin, as outlined in the provided dependencies.

I will solve this by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the provided format and principles, until the plan is completed.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of fixing garage door problems into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Slide the door to identify sticking issues.  
2. Examine external controls (after step 1).  
3. Inspect safety sensors (after step 2).  
4. Look over the door opener mechanism (after step 3).  
5. Check door springs and cables (after step 3).  
6. Examine door rails and tracks (after step 3).  
These subgoals form a structured sequence respecting the dependencies, with step 3 (inspect safety sensors) being a critical prerequisite for steps 4, 5, and 6.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Fix garage door problems (DIY).  
  - Subgoal 1: Slide the door to identify sticking issues (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 2: Examine external controls (pending, depends on Subgoal 1).  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect safety sensors (pending, depends on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Look over the door opener mechanism (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Check door springs and cables (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 6: Examine door rails and tracks (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  

**Current Goal:** Slide the door to identify sticking issues.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to slide the door to identify sticking issues. This will be achieved by manually operating the garage door to observe any resistance, unusual noises, or areas where the door does not move smoothly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Manually slide the garage door up and down several times. Note any points where the door sticks, drags, or makes unusual noises. Check for visible obstructions or misalignments in the door’s movement. Record observations (e.g., sticking at the top, grinding noise on one side) to guide further inspection in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the observations from sliding the door. This will be achieved by confirming that the recorded sticking issues are consistent and identifying potential causes based on the observations.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the notes from sliding the door. Repeat the sliding process to confirm consistency of sticking points or noises. Compare observations with common garage door issues (e.g., misaligned tracks, worn rollers, or debris). Ensure the door was operated correctly (e.g., disengaged from the opener if automatic) to rule out procedural errors. If inconsistencies are found, note them for further investigation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and highlight the next goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Fix garage door problems (DIY).  
  - Subgoal 1: Slide the door to identify sticking issues (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Examine external controls (current goal, can proceed as Subgoal 1 is done).  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect safety sensors (pending, depends on Subgoal 2).  
  - Subgoal 4: Look over the door opener mechanism (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 5: Check door springs and cables (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  
  - Subgoal 6: Examine door rails and tracks (pending, depends on Subgoal 3).  

**Current Goal:** Examine external controls.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to examine external controls. This will be achieved by testing the functionality of the garage door’s remote, keypad, or wall-mounted control panel to identify any operational issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the external controls by pressing the remote, keypad, or wall-mounted button to open and close the garage door. Observe if the door responds consistently or if there are delays, failures, or partial operations. Check for loose wiring, dead batteries in the remote, or damaged keypads. Clean any dirty contacts and replace batteries if needed. Note any malfunctions for further investigation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to inspect safety sensors. Retrieve past information related to the door’s operation and external controls to inform the inspection process.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Subgoal 1 (sliding the door): Observations of sticking points or noises may indicate mechanical issues that could affect sensor alignment or functionality.  
- From Subgoal 2 (external controls): Malfunctions in the controls (e.g., door not responding) could be linked to faulty safety sensors, as they are part of the control system.  
This information suggests that sensor issues might manifest as operational failures or inconsistent door movement, guiding the inspection of safety sensors.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to inspect safety sensors. This will be achieved by checking the alignment, cleanliness, and functionality of the garage door’s safety sensors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Locate the safety sensors near the bottom of the garage door tracks. Ensure they are aligned (facing each other directly) and free of dirt or obstructions. Check for steady indicator lights on the sensors (if applicable). Test functionality by placing an object in the sensor path and attempting to close the door; it should not close if sensors are working. Adjust alignment or clean lenses as needed, and note any persistent issues.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Based on the completion of the safety sensor inspection, adjust the remaining subgoals to prioritize the next steps, considering that steps 4, 5, and 6 (opener mechanism, springs/cables, rails/tracks) can now proceed. Prioritize checking the door opener mechanism next, as it directly relates to the control system, followed by springs/cables and rails/tracks, which may relate to sticking issues observed earlier.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to reflect progress and highlight the next goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Fix garage door problems (DIY).  
  - Subgoal 1: Slide the door to identify sticking issues (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Examine external controls (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect safety sensors (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Look over the door opener mechanism (current goal).  
  - Subgoal 5: Check door springs and cables (pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Examine door rails and tracks (pending).  

**Current Goal:** Look over the door opener mechanism.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to look over the door opener mechanism. This will be achieved by inspecting the garage door opener unit for mechanical or electrical issues.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the garage door opener unit (typically mounted on the ceiling). Check for loose or worn parts, such as the drive belt, chain, or gears. Listen for unusual noises during operation. Inspect electrical connections and ensure the power supply is stable. Test the opener’s force settings and adjust if the door struggles to open or close. Note any issues for repair or replacement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to check door springs and cables. This will be achieved by inspecting the springs and cables for wear, damage, or improper tension.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Visually inspect the torsion or extension springs and cables for signs of rust, fraying, or damage. Ensure springs are properly tensioned (caution: high tension, handle carefully or consult a professional if unsure). Check cable alignment and attachment points. Lubricate springs and cables if dry, and note any issues requiring repair or replacement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to examine door rails and tracks. This will be achieved by checking the alignment, cleanliness, and condition of the tracks and rollers.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Inspect the garage door tracks for dents, bends, or debris. Ensure tracks are aligned vertically and horizontally using a level. Check rollers for wear or damage and lubricate them if needed. Clean tracks with a cloth to remove dirt. Tighten any loose bolts or brackets. Note any misalignments or damage for correction.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to confirm completion of all subgoals.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Fix garage door problems (DIY).  
  - Subgoal 1: Slide the door to identify sticking issues (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Examine external controls (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Inspect safety sensors (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Look over the door opener mechanism (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Check door springs and cables (completed).  
  - Subgoal 6: Examine door rails and tracks (completed).  

**Current Goal:** None, as all subgoals are completed.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the entire plan by testing the garage door’s operation after completing all inspections and fixes. This will be achieved by operating the door to ensure all issues are resolved.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Test the garage door by opening and closing it multiple times using the external controls and opener. Verify smooth operation without sticking, unusual noises, or failures. Confirm safety sensors prevent closing when obstructed. Check that all adjustments (e.g., track alignment, spring tension, opener settings) have resolved the identified issues. If problems persist, revisit specific subgoals for further inspection or consider professional assistance.  
[/IMP]

### Conclusion
The plan to fix garage door problems has been completed through a structured sequence of meta-cognitive actions, respecting the provided substeps and dependencies. All subgoals were addressed, and a final validation step ensures the door operates correctly. If issues remain, the plan allows for backtracking to specific subgoals for further investigation.
