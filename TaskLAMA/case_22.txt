--- Case 22 ---
### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for applying wood stain to interior wood, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. The plan must adhere to the specified format, using [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required, and select one meta-cognitive action per step until all planning is completed.

**Assumptions:**
- The task involves applying wood stain to interior wood.

**Substeps:**
1. Clean the interior wood that needs to be stained.
2. Sand the interior wood with sandpaper.
3. Make the wood wet.
4. Apply the required foundation to cover the holes.
5. Stain the wood.
6. Wipe out the excess stain.
7. Apply a second coat.

**Dependencies:**
- Clean the wood must be done before applying the foundation.
- Apply the foundation must be done before sanding the wood.
- Sand the wood must be done before making the wood wet.
- Make the wood wet must be done before staining the wood.
- Stain the wood must be done before wiping out excess stain.
- Wipe out excess stain must be done before applying a second coat.

### Solution

#### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of applying wood stain into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:
1. Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris.
2. Apply foundation to cover holes.
3. Sand the wood to smooth the surface.
4. Wet the wood to prepare it for staining.
5. Apply the first coat of stain.
6. Wipe excess stain to ensure even application.
7. Apply a second coat for a finished look.

#### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Organize and review the hierarchy of goals to provide context for future steps.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Apply wood stain to interior wood.
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris.
  - Subgoal 2: Apply foundation to cover holes.
  - Subgoal 3: Sand the wood to smooth the surface.
  - Subgoal 4: Wet the wood to prepare it for staining.
  - Subgoal 5: Apply the first coat of stain.
  - Subgoal 6: Wipe excess stain to ensure even application.
  - Subgoal 7: Apply a second coat for a finished look.

**Current Goal:** Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris.
[/REVIEW]

#### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to clean the interior wood to remove dirt and debris. This will be achieved by using a damp cloth and mild detergent to wipe down the wood surface, ensuring it is free of dust and contaminants.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use a clean, damp cloth with a small amount of mild detergent to gently wipe the entire wood surface. Ensure all dirt, dust, and grease are removed. Dry the wood with a clean, dry cloth to prepare it for the next step.
[/IMP]

#### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Review and adjust the sequence of subgoals based on the dependencies, as the next step (apply foundation) must occur before sanding, which differs from the initial substep order.
Adjusted subgoals:
1. Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris (completed).
2. Apply foundation to cover holes.
3. Sand the wood to smooth the surface.
4. Wet the wood to prepare it for staining.
5. Apply the first coat of stain.
6. Wipe excess stain to ensure even application.
7. Apply a second coat for a finished look.
[/PLANNING]

#### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Update and review the hierarchy of goals to reflect the adjusted subgoals.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Apply wood stain to interior wood.
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply foundation to cover holes.
  - Subgoal 3: Sand the wood to smooth the surface.
  - Subgoal 4: Wet the wood to prepare it for staining.
  - Subgoal 5: Apply the first coat of stain.
  - Subgoal 6: Wipe excess stain to ensure even application.
  - Subgoal 7: Apply a second coat for a finished look.

**Current Goal:** Apply foundation to cover holes.
[/REVIEW]

#### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply foundation to cover holes in the wood. This will be achieved by using wood filler to fill any holes or imperfections, smoothing it with a putty knife.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Apply wood filler to any holes or cracks in the wood using a putty knife. Spread the filler evenly, ensuring it fills the imperfections completely. Allow the filler to dry according to the product instructions, typically 2-4 hours.
[/IMP]

#### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to sand the interior wood to smooth the surface. This will be achieved by using medium-grit sandpaper to sand the wood and dried filler, creating a smooth surface for staining.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use medium-grit sandpaper (120-150 grit) to sand the wood surface and dried wood filler. Sand in the direction of the grain to avoid scratches. Remove sanding dust with a tack cloth or damp cloth.
[/IMP]

#### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the sanding step to ensure the wood surface is smooth and ready for the next step. This will be achieved by inspecting the wood for smoothness and cleanliness.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Inspect the sanded wood surface by running a hand over it to check for smoothness. Ensure no rough patches or excess filler remain. Confirm all sanding dust has been removed with a tack cloth.
[/IMP]

#### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to wet the wood to prepare it for staining. This will be achieved by lightly dampening the wood surface with a wet cloth to raise the grain.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Lightly dampen a clean cloth with water and wipe the wood surface to make it slightly wet. This raises the wood grain, improving stain absorption. Allow the wood to dry completely, typically 1-2 hours.
[/IMP]

#### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply the first coat of stain to the wood. This will be achieved by using a brush or cloth to apply an even layer of wood stain.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Stir the wood stain thoroughly. Apply an even layer of stain using a brush or lint-free cloth, working in the direction of the grain. Ensure consistent coverage and avoid pooling. Let the stain sit for 5-15 minutes, depending on the desired color intensity.
[/IMP]

#### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to wipe out excess stain. Retrieve information related to the staining process to ensure proper technique for wiping excess stain.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:** From Step 10, the stain was applied and allowed to sit for 5-15 minutes to achieve the desired color intensity. Wiping excess stain ensures an even finish and prevents blotching. This step must be done before applying a second coat, as per the dependencies.
[/REVIEW]

#### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to wipe out excess stain to ensure an even finish. This will be achieved by using a clean, lint-free cloth to remove excess stain from the wood surface.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Use a clean, lint-free cloth to gently wipe off excess stain from the wood surface. Wipe in the direction of the grain to maintain an even finish. Ensure no excess stain remains to prevent blotching. Allow the stain to dry for 4-8 hours, per product instructions.
[/IMP]

#### Step 13
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to apply a second coat of stain for a finished look. This will be achieved by applying another layer of stain to enhance color and depth.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Stir the wood stain again. Apply a second, thin coat of stain using a brush or lint-free cloth, following the grain. Ensure even application and avoid over-applying. Allow the stain to dry completely, typically 24 hours, before handling or applying a sealant.
[/IMP]

#### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Review the hierarchy of goals to confirm all subgoals have been addressed and the main goal is complete.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Apply wood stain to interior wood (completed).
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the wood to remove dirt and debris (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Apply foundation to cover holes (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Sand the wood to smooth the surface (completed).
