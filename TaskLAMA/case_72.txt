### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of building a simple desk with drawers into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Decide the size of the desk.  
2. Take the measurements.  
3. Cut the wood to the required dimensions.  
4. Sand the wood.  
5. Attach the legs to the desktop using wood screws.  
6. Attach the drawers to the desk.  
7. Paint the top of the desk.  
These subgoals respect the dependencies, such as deciding the size and taking measurements before cutting the wood, and ensuring sanding is done before attaching legs and drawers.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a simple desk with drawers.  
  - Subgoal 1: Decide the size of the desk (current).  
  - Subgoal 2: Take the measurements.  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the wood to the required dimensions.  
  - Subgoal 4: Sand the wood.  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach the legs to the desktop using wood screws.  
  - Subgoal 6: Attach the drawers to the desk.  
  - Subgoal 7: Paint the top of the desk.  
**Current Goal**: Decide the size of the desk.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decide the size of the desk. This will be achieved by determining the desk’s dimensions (width, depth, height) based on typical desk sizes and the need for drawers, considering standard ergonomic measurements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
A standard desk size is approximately 48 inches wide, 24 inches deep, and 30 inches high, suitable for a small workspace with room for drawers. For a simple desk with drawers, allocate space for two drawers on one side (each approximately 15 inches wide, 18 inches deep, 4 inches high). Final dimensions:  
- Desktop: 48” W x 24” D x 1” H.  
- Legs: 29” H (to achieve 30” total height).  
- Drawers: Two, each 15” W x 18” D x 4” H.  
These dimensions ensure functionality and ergonomic comfort.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the decided desk size. This will be achieved by checking if the dimensions meet ergonomic standards and allow space for drawers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The chosen dimensions (48” W x 24” D x 30” H) align with ergonomic standards: the height supports comfortable seating (knee clearance ~25”), and the width/depth accommodates a workspace and drawer placement. The drawer sizes (15” W x 18” D x 4” H) fit within the desk’s understructure, leaving sufficient legroom. The dimensions are valid for a simple desk with drawers.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take the measurements. This will be achieved by measuring and marking the wood based on the decided dimensions for the desktop, legs, and drawers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using a tape measure and pencil:  
- Desktop: Mark a 48” x 24” rectangle on a 1” thick wood sheet.  
- Legs: Mark four pieces, each 29” long, from 2” x 2” wood stock.  
- Drawers: For two drawers, mark panels (plywood, 0.5” thick):  
  - Front/Back: 4 pieces, each 15” W x 4” H.  
  - Sides: 4 pieces, each 18” D x 4” H.  
  - Bottom: 2 pieces, each 15” W x 18” D.  
Double-check measurements for accuracy before cutting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the wood to the required dimensions. This will be achieved by using a saw to cut the marked wood pieces for the desktop, legs, and drawers.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using a circular saw or table saw:  
- Cut the desktop to 48” x 24” x 1”.  
- Cut four legs, each 29” long from 2” x 2” stock.  
- For drawers, cut:  
  - 4 front/back panels: 15” x 4” x 0.5”.  
  - 4 side panels: 18” x 4” x 0.5”.  
  - 2 bottom panels: 15” x 18” x 0.5”.  
Ensure cuts are straight and follow marked lines. Collect all pieces for the next step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sand the wood. Retrieve information about the wood pieces prepared for sanding, based on previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Sand the wood.  
**Relevant Information**: From Step 6, the wood pieces cut are:  
- Desktop: 48” x 24” x 1”.  
- Legs: Four pieces, each 29” long (2” x 2”).  
- Drawer panels: Four 15” x 4” x 0.5” (front/back), four 18” x 4” x 0.5” (sides), two 15” x 18” x 0.5” (bottoms).  
These pieces need sanding to smooth surfaces and edges for assembly and painting.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to sand the wood. This will be achieved by using sandpaper to smooth all cut wood surfaces and edges.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Use 120-grit sandpaper to sand all surfaces of the desktop, legs, and drawer panels, removing rough spots and splinters. Follow with 220-grit sandpaper for a smoother finish. Focus on edges to prevent splinters during assembly. Wipe down all pieces with a damp cloth to remove dust.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the legs to the desktop using wood screws. This will be achieved by securing the four legs to the underside of the desktop with screws.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Position the four 29” legs at the corners of the 48” x 24” desktop’s underside, 1” from each edge for stability. Pre-drill two holes per leg through the desktop into the leg tops (using a 1/8” drill bit). Secure each leg with two 2” wood screws. Ensure legs are perpendicular to the desktop using a square.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the drawers to the desk. This will be achieved by assembling the drawer panels and installing them with drawer slides under the desktop.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Assemble each drawer:  
- Attach two side panels (18” x 4”) to front/back panels (15” x 4”) using wood glue and 1” wood screws, forming a rectangular frame.  
- Attach the bottom panel (15” x 18”) with wood glue and 0.75” screws.  
Install drawer slides:  
- Attach one pair of 18” drawer slides to the outer sides of each drawer.  
- Mount corresponding slide tracks under the desktop, aligned to position drawers on one side (e.g., right side, 15” wide space).  
Slide drawers into tracks, ensuring smooth operation.  
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the remaining subgoal (paint the top of the desk) and dependencies. Adjust the plan to ensure painting is optimized, considering the need to protect drawers and legs during painting.  
[/PLANNING]  
[PLANNING]  
Add a substep before painting: mask off the legs and drawers to prevent paint splatter. Revised subgoals:  
1. Decide the size of the desk (done).  
2. Take the measurements (done).  
3. Cut the wood to the required dimensions (done).  
4. Sand the wood (done).  
5. Attach the legs to the desktop using wood screws (done).  
6. Attach the drawers to the desk (done).  
7. Mask off legs and drawers.  
8. Paint the top of the desk.  
[/PLANNING]
