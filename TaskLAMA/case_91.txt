### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan to sell herbs online on Etsy. The task involves a series of substeps with defined temporal dependencies. The substeps are: (1) Create an Etsy account, (2) Take pictures of the herbs, (3) Upload the pictures on the website, (4) Add the product description, (5) Add price to the herbs, and (6) Start taking orders. The dependencies specify the order in which these steps must be completed. The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of selling herbs online on Etsy into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Create an Etsy account.  
2. Take pictures of the herbs.  
3. Upload the pictures on the website.  
4. Add the product description.  
5. Add price to the herbs.  
6. Start taking orders.  
These subgoals must follow the dependencies, e.g., creating an account must precede taking pictures, and so on.

**Meta-data:** The current goal is to take pictures of the herbs. This will be achieved by photographing the herbs with good lighting and clear presentation to create appealing product images.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Gather the herbs to be sold. Use a camera or smartphone to take high-quality photos in natural light, ensuring herbs are clean and arranged attractively (e.g., on a white background or in bundles). Capture multiple angles and close-ups to highlight freshness and quality. Save images in a digital format (e.g., JPEG) for upload.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to add the product description. Retrieve information about the herbs and listing requirements to ensure the description is accurate and appealing.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:**  
- From Step 6 [IMP]: Herbs were photographed to highlight freshness and quality, suggesting descriptions should emphasize these traits (e.g., "freshly harvested, vibrant herbs").  
- From Step 9 [IMP]: Photos are uploaded to Etsy listings, indicating the listings are ready for descriptions.  
- General Etsy requirements: Product descriptions should include details like herb type, quantity, uses (e.g., culinary, medicinal), and any unique selling points (e.g., organic or locally grown).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to add the product description. This will be achieved by writing detailed and appealing descriptions for each herb listing on Etsy.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For each herb listing, write a description including:  
- Herb name (e.g., "Organic Basil").  
- Quantity (e.g., "1 oz bundle").  
- Key features (e.g., "Freshly harvested, vibrant, ideal for cooking or tea").  
- Unique selling points (e.g., "Locally grown, pesticide-free").  
- Care instructions (e.g., "Store in a cool, dry place").  
Enter the description in the "Description" field of each Etsy listing, ensuring clarity and appeal to attract buyers.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Research similar herb listings on Etsy to determine competitive pricing (e.g., $5–$10 per oz for common herbs like basil or mint). Consider costs (e.g., growing, packaging, shipping) and desired profit margin. In each Etsy listing, enter the price in the "Price" field, ensuring it reflects the quantity and quality described (e.g., $6 for 1 oz of organic basil).
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the prices are correctly set and competitive. This will be achieved by reviewing the listed prices and comparing them to market standards.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Review each listing’s price in the Etsy shop dashboard. Compare prices to similar Etsy listings to ensure they are competitive (e.g., not significantly higher or lower than market rates). Check that the price aligns with the quantity and description (e.g., $6 for 1 oz of basil is reasonable). Adjust prices if necessary to balance profitability and attractiveness.
