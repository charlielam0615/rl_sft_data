### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To write a novel in notepad, break down the goal into manageable subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Open notepad.  
2. Choose the novel’s resolution.  
3. Decide on the ending.  
4. Write the first draft.  
5. Write the second draft.  
6. Write additional drafts.  
7. End the novel with a good note.  
These subgoals align with the dependencies, ensuring each step is completed before the next. The first subgoal is to open notepad.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Write a novel in notepad.  
  - Subgoal 1: Open notepad (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Choose the novel’s resolution (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Decide on the ending.  
  - Subgoal 4: Write the first draft.  
  - Subgoal 5: Write the second draft.  
  - Subgoal 6: Write additional drafts.  
  - Subgoal 7: End the novel with a good note.  
**Current Goal**: Choose the novel’s resolution.  
The first subgoal (open notepad) has been completed and validated. The focus is now on choosing the resolution, which must be done before deciding on the ending, as per the dependencies.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Backward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To choose the novel’s resolution, work backward from the goal of writing a compelling novel. The resolution requires defining the story’s central conflict and how it will resolve. Intermediate steps include:  
1. Identify the novel’s genre and themes.  
2. Outline the main conflict.  
3. Determine the resolution’s tone and outcome.  
These steps will guide the decision-making process for the resolution.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to choose the novel’s resolution. This will be achieved by selecting a genre, defining the main conflict, and deciding how the conflict will resolve, ensuring alignment with the novel’s overall vision.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Select a genre (e.g., fantasy) and theme (e.g., redemption). Define the main conflict, such as a hero’s quest to defeat a dark force. Decide that the resolution will involve the hero overcoming personal doubts to triumph, setting a hopeful tone. Document this in notepad as: “Genre: Fantasy, Conflict: Hero vs. Dark Force, Resolution: Hero overcomes doubts to triumph.”  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve information related to the current goal of deciding on the novel’s ending, focusing on the previously chosen resolution to ensure consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
The current goal is to decide on the novel’s ending. From previous steps, the resolution involves a fantasy novel where the hero overcomes personal doubts to triumph over a dark force. This suggests an ending that emphasizes victory and personal growth, aligning with the hopeful tone of the resolution.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decide on the novel’s ending. This will be achieved by crafting an ending that reflects the resolution’s hopeful tone and the hero’s triumph, ensuring it satisfies the story’s arc.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Write in notepad: “Ending: The hero defeats the dark force in a climactic battle, realizing their inner strength. The world is restored, and the hero returns home celebrated, with a newfound sense of purpose.” This ending aligns with the resolution and sets up the drafting process.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Review the remaining subgoals (write first draft, second draft, additional drafts, and end with a good note). To streamline the process, combine “write additional drafts” and “end the novel with a good note” into a single subgoal: “Finalize drafts and conclude the novel.” This adjustment reflects that additional drafts refine the novel toward its conclusion. Updated subgoals:  
1. Open notepad (Completed).  
2. Choose the novel’s resolution (Completed).  
3. Decide on the ending (Completed).  
4. Write the first draft.  
5. Write the second draft.  
6. Finalize drafts and conclude the novel.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 11: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the first draft. This will be achieved by drafting the novel in notepad, following the genre, conflict, resolution, and ending established earlier.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In notepad, write the first draft of the novel, starting with an introduction to the hero and the fantasy world, building the conflict with the dark force, and progressing toward the resolution. Aim for a rough but complete narrative arc, approximately 50,000–80,000 words, saved in notepad.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the first draft is complete. This will be achieved by checking that the draft includes the key elements (introduction, conflict, resolution) and meets the basic word count.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the notepad file to ensure the first draft contains the hero’s introduction, the conflict with the dark force, and the resolution where the hero triumphs. Confirm the draft is approximately 50,000–80,000 words and saved. If incomplete, continue writing to address missing elements.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the second draft. This will be achieved by revising the first draft in notepad to improve clarity, character development, and plot coherence, building on the validated first draft.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Open the first draft in notepad. Revise by enhancing character motivations, refining the fantasy world’s details, and tightening the plot to ensure the hero’s journey is compelling. Save the revised draft as a new file in notepad, maintaining the 50,000–80,000-word range.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Backtrack

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backtrack (Planning)  
The second draft may have introduced inconsistencies with the planned ending. Return to the “decide on the ending” step to ensure the ending aligns with revisions made in the second draft.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 15: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the ending aligns with the second draft. This will be achieved by comparing the ending in the second draft with the planned ending from Step 8.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the second draft in notepad and compare its ending to the planned ending: “The hero defeats the dark force in a climactic battle, realizing their inner strength. The world is restored, and the hero returns home celebrated, with a newfound sense of purpose.” If misaligned, revise the ending in the second draft to match.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 16: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to finalize drafts and conclude the novel. This will be achieved by writing additional drafts to polish the narrative and ensuring the novel ends on a good note, as defined in the adjusted subgoal.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
In notepad, create a third draft by polishing prose, fixing inconsistencies, and enhancing emotional impact. Ensure the ending reflects the hero’s triumph and a satisfying conclusion. Save the final draft, confirming it aligns with the planned resolution and ending, and conclude the novel with a hopeful, impactful note.  
[/IMP]
