--- Case 65 ---
### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a plan for building a closet organizer, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review). The plan must adhere to the specified format, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list (Planning: Forward Subgoaling, Backward Subgoaling, Adjust Subgoals, Backtrack; Implementation: Reach Goal, Validation; Review: Track Goals, Recall Info). Each step will include the appropriate [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks based on the action's category, ensuring all substeps are completed in the correct order as dictated by the dependencies.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a closet organizer into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The substeps are:  
1. Determine the closet space.  
2. Take required measurements for the closet organizer.  
3. Cut the shelf supports.  
4. Cut the shelves.  
5. Attach the shelf support to the wall.  
6. Set up the central unit.  
7. Place the central unit in the closet.  
8. Install the long shelves.  
These substeps form a linear sequence based on the dependencies, where each step must be completed before the next. The first subgoal is to determine the closet space, as it is the initial step with no prior dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the closet space. This involves assessing the available space in the closet to understand its dimensions and constraints, which will guide subsequent measurements and design decisions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To determine the closet space, inspect the closet to identify its layout (e.g., reach-in or walk-in), check for obstructions (e.g., pipes, electrical outlets), and note any structural features (e.g., walls, corners). Ensure the space is clear of items to visualize the area available for the organizer. Record observations about the closet’s shape and potential mounting surfaces for the organizer.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Build a closet organizer.  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the closet space (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Take required measurements for the closet organizer (Current).  
  - Subgoal 3: Cut the shelf supports.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the shelves.  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach the shelf support to the wall.  
  - Subgoal 6: Set up the central unit.  
  - Subgoal 7: Place the central unit in the closet.  
  - Subgoal 8: Install the long shelves.  
**Current Goal**: Take required measurements for the closet organizer.  
The goal hierarchy reflects the linear dependency structure, with the first subgoal completed and the second subgoal now active.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to take required measurements for the closet organizer. This involves measuring the closet’s dimensions (width, height, depth) and determining the size requirements for the shelves and supports based on the closet space assessment.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Use a tape measure to record the closet’s width, height, and depth. Measure specific areas where shelves and supports will be installed, accounting for any obstructions noted in Step 2. Sketch a diagram of the closet, marking measurements and planned locations for the central unit and shelves. Ensure measurements are precise to avoid errors in cutting materials.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the measurements taken for the closet organizer. This involves checking the accuracy and completeness of the measurements to ensure they align with the closet space and organizer design requirements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Review the recorded measurements against the closet space diagram. Re-measure key dimensions to confirm accuracy. Check that all necessary measurements (e.g., for shelves, supports, and central unit) are included and account for obstructions. Verify that the measurements allow for a feasible organizer layout that fits the closet space.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Based on validated measurements, the next subgoals involve preparing materials for the organizer. The immediate subgoals are to cut the shelf supports and cut the shelves, as both depend on the measurements and must be completed before attaching supports to the wall. These can be planned concurrently since they have the same dependency (measurements).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the shelf supports. This involves using the validated measurements to cut support pieces to the correct size for mounting in the closet.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Select appropriate materials for shelf supports (e.g., wooden or metal brackets). Using the measurements from Step 4, mark the support pieces to the required lengths. Use a saw (e.g., circular saw or hand saw) to cut the supports accurately. Sand edges if necessary to ensure a clean finish. Label each piece to correspond with its intended position in the closet.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to cut the shelves. This involves cutting shelf boards to the correct dimensions based on the validated measurements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Choose shelf material (e.g., plywood or MDF) suitable for the closet organizer. Refer to the measurements from Step 4 to mark the shelf boards for width and depth. Use a saw to cut the shelves to size, ensuring straight cuts. Sand the edges for a smooth finish and label each shelf for its designated position.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the cut shelf supports and shelves. This involves checking that the cut pieces match the measurements and are suitable for installation.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Compare the cut shelf supports and shelves against the measurements from Step 4. Test-fit the pieces in the closet to ensure they align with the planned layout and fit within the space. Check for any cutting errors (e.g., uneven edges) and re-cut or sand as needed to ensure proper fit and stability.  
[/IMP]

  - Subgoal 3: Cut the shelf supports (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the shelves (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Attach the shelf support to the wall (Current).  
  - Subgoal 6: Set up the central unit.  
  - Subgoal 7: Place the central unit in the closet.  
  - Subgoal 8: Install the long shelves.  
**Current Goal**: Attach the shelf support to the wall.  
The completed subgoals (1–4) have prepared the necessary materials, and the next subgoal is to begin installation by attaching the shelf supports.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to attach the shelf support to the wall. This involves securing the cut shelf supports to the closet walls using appropriate hardware.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Locate the wall studs using a stud finder for secure mounting. Mark the positions for the shelf supports based on the validated measurements and layout. Use a level to ensure supports are aligned horizontally. Secure the supports to the wall with screws or anchors, ensuring they are firmly attached and can bear the weight of the shelves.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to set up the central unit. This involves assembling the central unit (e.g., a shelving tower or drawer unit) according to the organizer design.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Assemble the central unit following the manufacturer’s instructions or custom design plan. If it’s a pre-made unit, connect components (e.g., shelves, sides, drawers) using provided hardware. If custom-built, cut and assemble pieces based on the measurements. Ensure the unit is stable and all connections are secure before placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the central unit in the closet. Retrieve information about the closet space and measurements to ensure the central unit fits correctly.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Relevant information:  
- From Step 2: The closet space was assessed, noting its layout, obstructions, and mounting surfaces.  
- From Step 4: Measurements of the closet (width, height, depth) and specific areas for the central unit were recorded.  
- From Step 5: Measurements were validated, confirming the central unit’s dimensions are compatible with the closet space.  
This information ensures the central unit can be placed in the designated area without interference from obstructions or spatial constraints.  
[/REVIEW]
