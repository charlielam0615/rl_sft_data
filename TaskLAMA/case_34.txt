### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a comprehensive plan to start a notary business on your own, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies. The substeps are: (1) Confirm your state's requirements, (2) Complete the education, (3) Obtain the training, (4) Get a surety bond, (5) Fill out notary forms to be official, (6) Purchase notary supplies, and (7) Promote the services. The dependencies specify the order in which these steps must be completed. The plan will be developed using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), selecting one action per step, and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of starting a notary business into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will follow the sequence: confirm state requirements, complete education, obtain training, get a surety bond, fill out notary forms, purchase supplies, and promote services. Each subgoal will be addressed sequentially, respecting dependencies, to ensure a structured plan.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Track Goals**:  
The goal hierarchy for starting a notary business is:  
- **Main Goal**: Start a notary business on your own.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Confirm your state's requirements.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Complete the education.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Obtain the training.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Get a surety bond.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Fill out notary forms to be official.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Purchase notary supplies.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Promote the services.  
**Current Goal**: Confirm your state's requirements.  
The hierarchy reflects the provided substeps and dependencies, ensuring that each step is completed in the correct order.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm your state's requirements. This will be achieved by researching the specific notary regulations, eligibility criteria, and application processes outlined by the state’s notary governing body, typically the Secretary of State’s office.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To confirm your state's requirements, visit the official website of your state’s Secretary of State or equivalent notary-regulating authority. Look for a dedicated notary section that outlines eligibility (e.g., age, residency, background checks), required education or training, application forms, fees, and bond requirements. For example, some states require a clean criminal record and specific coursework, while others may have additional exams. Note any deadlines or renewal periods for notary commissions. If the state is unspecified, assume a general process and check a resource like the National Notary Association (NNA) for state-specific guides. Document all requirements to inform subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm your state's requirements. Validate that the collected information is accurate and complete by cross-referencing with reliable sources.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Cross-check the requirements gathered from the state’s official website with secondary sources, such as the National Notary Association (NNA) or state-specific notary handbooks. Ensure all eligibility criteria (e.g., age, residency), required documents, fees, and any mandatory education or training are fully understood and documented. If discrepancies arise, contact the state’s notary division for clarification. Confirm that the information aligns with the assumption of starting the business independently.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the education. This will be achieved by enrolling in and completing any state-mandated notary education courses, as identified in the state’s requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Based on the state’s requirements, identify any mandatory notary education courses (e.g., a 6-hour course for new notaries in some states like California). Enroll in an approved course through providers like the NNA or state-approved vendors. Complete the coursework, which typically covers notary laws, ethics, and procedures. Obtain a certificate of completion, as this may be required for the notary application. If the state does not require education, verify this and proceed to training.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to obtain the training. This will be achieved by completing any required or recommended notary training programs, focusing on practical skills like notarization procedures.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Identify if the state requires specific notary training (distinct from education), such as hands-on practice with notarization or exam preparation. Enroll in a training program through a reputable provider like the NNA or a state-approved organization. Complete the training, which may include workshops or online modules on proper document handling, journal keeping, and notarization techniques. If no training is required, confirm this with the state’s notary division and proceed.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
If the state does not require separate education or training, combine these subgoals into a single step to streamline the process, ensuring alignment with dependencies.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to get a surety bond. This will be achieved by purchasing a notary surety bond as required by the state, typically through an insurance or bonding agency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Determine the bond amount required by the state (e.g., $10,000 in many states). Contact a licensed surety bond provider, such as those recommended by the NNA or state notary division. Purchase the bond, ensuring it meets state specifications, and obtain the bond certificate. This bond protects the public from notary errors and is often required before submitting the notary application. Keep records for the application process.  
[/IMP]
