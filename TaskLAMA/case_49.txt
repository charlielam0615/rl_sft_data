**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to apply Behr DeckOver on a wooden deck, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure the solution. The goal is to complete all planning steps for applying Behr DeckOver, ensuring the deck is properly prepared and coated.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of applying Behr DeckOver into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The substeps are: (1) Replace any shaky wooden boards, (2) Patch any cracks and nail holes, (3) Using brush paint the edges, (4) Coat each board end that is reachable, (5) Paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller, (6) Let the first coat dry, (7) Apply the second coat. The dependencies indicate a specific order: Step 1 must precede Step 2, Step 1 must precede Step 5, Step 5 must precede Step 4, Step 4 must precede Step 3, Step 3 must precede Step 6, and Step 6 must precede Step 7. Thus, the subgoals are ordered as: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 5 → Step 4 → Step 3 → Step 6 → Step 7.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all subgoals in a nested format, reflecting the order established in Step 1, and highlight the current goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Apply Behr DeckOver on wooden deck  
  - Subgoal 1: Replace any shaky wooden boards (Current)  
  - Subgoal 2: Patch any cracks and nail holes  
  - Subgoal 3: Paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat each board end that is reachable  
  - Subgoal 5: Using brush paint the edges  
  - Subgoal 6: Let the first coat dry  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the second coat  

**Current Goal**: Replace any shaky wooden boards.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to replace any shaky wooden boards. This will be achieved by inspecting the deck, identifying unstable boards, removing them, and installing new boards securely.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the deck by walking across it and applying pressure to identify loose or shaky boards. Mark these boards with chalk. Use a pry bar and hammer to remove the identified boards, ensuring nails or screws are fully extracted. Measure and cut replacement boards to match the removed ones, using treated wood suitable for outdoor use. Secure new boards with galvanized screws or nails, ensuring they are flush and stable.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal hierarchy to reflect progress and highlight the next goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Apply Behr DeckOver on wooden deck  
  - Subgoal 1: Replace any shaky wooden boards (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Patch any cracks and nail holes (Current)  
  - Subgoal 3: Paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat each board end that is reachable  
  - Subgoal 5: Using brush paint the edges  
  - Subgoal 6: Let the first coat dry  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the second coat  

**Current Goal**: Patch any cracks and nail holes.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to patch any cracks and nail holes. This will be achieved by cleaning the deck surface, filling cracks and holes with appropriate materials, and sanding for smoothness.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Clean the deck with a broom and pressure washer to remove dirt and debris. Identify cracks and nail holes. Apply wood filler to cracks and holes using a putty knife, ensuring even application. Allow the filler to dry per the manufacturer’s instructions (typically 2-4 hours). Sand the filled areas with medium-grit sandpaper to create a smooth surface, then sweep away dust.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
Update the goal hierarchy to reflect progress and highlight the next goal.  

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Apply Behr DeckOver on wooden deck  
  - Subgoal 1: Replace any shaky wooden boards (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Patch any cracks and nail holes (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller (Current)  
  - Subgoal 4: Coat each board end that is reachable  
  - Subgoal 5: Using brush paint the edges  
  - Subgoal 6: Let the first coat dry  
  - Subgoal 7: Apply the second coat  

**Current Goal**: Paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
The dependency indicates that painting the first coat with a roller (Step 5) must precede coating board ends (Step 4), which precedes painting edges with a brush (Step 3). To optimize efficiency, adjust the subgoals to group painting tasks (Steps 3, 4, 5) together, ensuring the roller application (Step 5) is followed by board ends (Step 4) and edges (Step 3) before drying. Revised order: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 5 → Step 4 → Step 3 → Step 6 → Step 7 (unchanged, as dependencies are satisfied).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to paint the first coat of Behr DeckOver using a roller. This will be achieved by applying the product evenly across the deck surface with a roller for broad coverage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stir the Behr DeckOver thoroughly. Pour it into a roller tray. Use a 3/8-inch nap roller to apply an even coat across the deck, working in small sections to maintain a wet edge. Roll in the direction of the wood grain to ensure consistent texture. Avoid over-application to prevent pooling.  
[/IMP]

[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to coat each reachable board end. This will be achieved by using a brush to apply Behr DeckOver to the exposed ends of deck boards for complete coverage.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a 2-inch angled paintbrush to apply Behr DeckOver to the ends of each reachable board. Dip the brush lightly into the product and coat the board ends evenly, ensuring no drips. Work systematically around the deck to cover all accessible ends.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to paint the edges using a brush. This will be achieved by carefully applying Behr DeckOver to the deck’s perimeter and any detailed areas with a brush for precision.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a 2-inch angled paintbrush to apply Behr DeckOver along the deck’s edges, railings, and any areas inaccessible to the roller. Work slowly to ensure clean lines and avoid drips onto adjacent surfaces. Tape off areas if needed for precision.  
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to let the first coat dry. This will be achieved by allowing sufficient drying time as per Behr DeckOver’s instructions, ensuring the surface is ready for the second coat.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Allow the first coat of Behr DeckOver to dry for at least 4-6 hours, or as specified on the product label, depending on weather conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity). Avoid foot traffic or placing objects on the deck during this time to prevent marks or damage.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Stir the Behr DeckOver thoroughly. Use a 3/8-inch nap roller to apply the second coat evenly across the deck, working in small sections to maintain a wet edge. Use a 2-inch angled brush for edges and board ends, ensuring complete coverage. Apply the product thinly to avoid pooling and ensure a uniform finish. Allow the second coat to dry for 24 hours before light use.
