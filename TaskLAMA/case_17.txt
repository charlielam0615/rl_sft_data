### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for building a concrete block wall with mortar, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies. The plan must be developed using the Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), selecting one action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a concrete block wall into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Check necessary construction permits.  
2. Mark the perimeter of the structure.  
3. Dig a trench.  
4. Fill the trench with drain grade gravel.  
5. Place a cornerstone in each corner.  
6. Place the stones for the first layer of the wall.  
7. Build the wall.  
8. Add mortar to the wall.  
These subgoals follow the temporal dependencies, ensuring each step is completed before the next.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain context and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to check necessary construction permits. This involves contacting the local building authority to confirm if permits are required for constructing a concrete block wall and obtaining them if needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Contact the local building authority (e.g., city or county office) to inquire about permit requirements for a concrete block wall. Verify zoning regulations and submit any required applications, including site plans or structural details, to obtain approval.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to ensure the permit-checking step is valid. This involves confirming that all necessary permits have been identified and obtained as required.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Review the response from the local building authority to confirm that all required permits have been identified. Ensure any issued permits are valid and cover the scope of the concrete block wall project. If permits are not required, document this confirmation for records.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to update progress and highlight the next goal.

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Measure the dimensions of the wall as per the project plan. Drive stakes into the ground at the corners of the wall’s perimeter. Connect the stakes with string to outline the wall’s footprint, ensuring the lines are straight and corners are square using a level and square tool.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the marked perimeter. This involves checking that the perimeter is accurately aligned, square, and matches the planned dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Measure the diagonals of the marked perimeter to ensure they are equal, confirming the layout is square. Verify that the dimensions match the project plan and adjust the stakes or string if necessary to correct any discrepancies.  
[/IMP]
