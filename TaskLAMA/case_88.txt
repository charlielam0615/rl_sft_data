--- Case 88 ---
### Problem Restatement
The task is to create a plan for writing a critical analysis essay about poetry, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (M) with actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories. Each step must select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, adhere to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, and respect the dependencies between substeps. The plan will be developed until all substeps are completed.

---

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of writing a critical analysis essay about poetry into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Examine the poem.  
2. Identify the main subject of the poem.  
3. Create the context.  
4. Determine the genre of the poem.  
5. Make a checklist for critical analysis.  
6. Look over the poems.  
7. Examine the format.  
8. Analyze the language used.  
9. Make a thesis statement.  
10. Write the analysis.  
These subgoals must follow the specified dependencies (e.g., "Examine the poem" and "Identify the main subject" must precede "Create the context").  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to organize the hierarchy of goals:  
- **Main Goal**: Write a critical analysis essay about poetry.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Examine the poem.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Identify the main subject of the poem.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Create the context.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Determine the genre of the poem.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Make a checklist for critical analysis.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Look over the poems.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Examine the format.  
  - **Subgoal 8**: Analyze the language used.  
  - **Subgoal 9**: Make a thesis statement.  
  - **Subgoal 10**: Write the analysis.  
**Current Goal**: Examine the poem (Subgoal 1).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to examine the poem. This will be achieved by reading the poem thoroughly and noting initial observations about its structure, themes, and tone.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Read the poem multiple times to understand its content and form. Note key elements such as the title, speaker, imagery, and any standout stylistic features. Record initial impressions about the poem’s mood and possible themes.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the main subject of the poem. This will be achieved by analyzing the poem’s content to determine its central theme or message.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the observations from examining the poem. Identify recurring images, symbols, or ideas that point to the poem’s main subject. Summarize the central theme in one or two sentences, focusing on what the poem is primarily about (e.g., love, nature, mortality).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to create the context. This will be achieved by researching the poem’s historical, cultural, and biographical background to inform the analysis.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Research the poet’s life, the time period when the poem was written, and any relevant cultural or historical events. Identify how these factors might influence the poem’s themes or perspective. Summarize the context in a concise paragraph.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the genre of the poem. This will be achieved by analyzing the poem’s form, style, and thematic elements to classify its genre.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Examine the poem’s structure (e.g., sonnet, free verse, ode) and thematic focus. Compare these to characteristics of poetic genres such as lyric, narrative, or dramatic poetry. Determine the most fitting genre based on this analysis.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a checklist for critical analysis. This will be achieved by compiling a list of key elements to analyze, tailored to the poem’s genre and themes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Create a checklist including elements such as imagery, tone, diction, structure, rhyme, meter, symbolism, and thematic development. Ensure the checklist is specific to the poem’s genre (e.g., for a sonnet, include volta analysis).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to look over the poems. This will be achieved by reviewing the poem again with the checklist to ensure all relevant aspects are considered.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-read the poem, applying the critical analysis checklist. Take detailed notes on each element (e.g., specific images, tone shifts, or structural features). Highlight any new insights or patterns not previously noted.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to examine the format. This will be achieved by analyzing the poem’s structural elements, such as stanza arrangement and line breaks.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Analyze the poem’s format, including stanza structure, line lengths, and any use of rhyme or meter. Note how these elements contribute to the poem’s meaning or emotional impact. Summarize findings in a concise paragraph.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to analyze the language used. This will be achieved by examining the poem’s diction, figurative language, and sound devices.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Identify key linguistic features, such as specific word choices, metaphors, similes, alliteration, or assonance. Analyze how these elements enhance the poem’s themes or tone. Document examples and their effects in a detailed paragraph.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a thesis statement. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the poem’s subject, context, genre, format, and language to form a cohesive thesis.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Summarize relevant information:  
- **Subject**: The main theme identified in Step 4.  
- **Context**: Historical/cultural background from Step 5.  
- **Genre**: The poem’s genre from Step 6.  
- **Format**: Structural elements from Step 9.  
- **Language**: Linguistic features from Step 10.  
This information provides the foundation for crafting a thesis statement that ties together the poem’s key elements.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 12: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a thesis statement. This will be achieved by synthesizing insights from the subject, context, genre, format, and language to create a clear, arguable statement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Draft a thesis statement that articulates the poem’s main theme and how specific elements (e.g., language, structure) contribute to it. Ensure the statement is specific, arguable, and concise (e.g., “Through its use of vivid imagery and structured sonnet form, the poem explores the tension between love and loss in a Victorian context”).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the thesis statement. This will be achieved by checking if it aligns with the analysis and addresses the poem’s key elements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the thesis statement against the notes from Steps 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Ensure it reflects the poem’s subject, context, genre, format, and language. Adjust the thesis if it lacks clarity or specificity. Confirm that it provides a clear direction for the essay.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to write the analysis. This will be achieved by organizing the essay around the thesis statement, using evidence from previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Structure the essay with an introduction (including the thesis), body paragraphs (covering context, genre, format, language, and themes), and a conclusion. Use specific examples from the poem to support the thesis. Write a cohesive draft, ensuring each paragraph ties back to the thesis statement.  
[/IMP]
