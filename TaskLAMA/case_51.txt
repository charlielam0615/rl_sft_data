--- Case 51 ---
**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan for installing a generator transfer switch panel, following the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The plan must adhere to the meta-cognitive action set (M) framework, selecting one action per step from Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, and organizing content into [PLANNING], [IMP], or [REVIEW] blocks as specified. The substeps are: (1) Turn off the power supply, (2) Drill a hole through the house wall, (3) Fix the switch panel with screws, (4) Run an electrical cable from the box to the transfer switch, (5) Test the work by starting the portable generator, and (6) Change the Line to generator switches on the transfer switch, with dependencies ensuring each step is completed before the next.
