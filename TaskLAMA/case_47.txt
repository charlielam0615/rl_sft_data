### Problem Statement
The task is to create a business plan online, following a structured process that includes the following substeps: (1) Write an executive summary, (2) Describe the business, (3) Analyze the market, (4) Demonstrate that the product is in high demand, (5) Explain the core product or service in detail, (6) Describe how to reach the target market, (7) Create a budget and forecasts, and (8) Explain the estimates of return on investment (ROI) for investors. These substeps have specific temporal dependencies, where each step must be completed before certain subsequent steps, as outlined in the dependencies provided.

To solve this, I will select one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and structure the response using [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required. The process will continue until all substeps are completed, respecting the dependencies.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of creating a business plan into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and their dependencies. The substeps are: (1) Executive summary, (2) Describe the business, (3) Analyze the market, (4) Demonstrate high demand, (5) Explain core product/service, (6) Describe reaching the target market, (7) Create budget and forecasts, (8) Explain ROI estimates. The dependencies indicate a sequential order where each step must be completed before the next dependent step. Thus, the subgoals are:
- Subgoal 1: Complete the executive summary.
- Subgoal 2: Describe the business (after Subgoal 1).
- Subgoal 3: Explain the core product/service (after Subgoal 2).
- Subgoal 4: Analyze the market (after Subgoal 3).

- **Year 1:** Net Profit $200,000; ROI = ($200,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 100%.
- **Year 2:** Cumulative Profit $600,000 ($200,000 + $400,000); ROI = ($600,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 300%.
- **Year 3:** Cumulative Profit $1,300,000 ($600,000 + $700,000); ROI = ($1,300,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 650%.
