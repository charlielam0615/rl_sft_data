[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3: Execute First Subgoal

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to prepare the coaxial cable by removing insulation. This will be achieved by using a wire stripper or utility knife to carefully strip the outer insulation from the end of the coaxial cable, exposing the inner conductor and shielding.  
[/PLANNING]

1. Prepare the coaxial cable by removing insulation (Completed).  
2. Test connectivity with a paper clip in the TV’s coaxial port (Completed).  
3. Prepare an ethernet cord by stripping its end to extract copper wires.  
4. Cut the copper wire to the required length.  
5. Shape the wires into V-shaped ears.  
6. Drill holes on the board for mounting.  
7. Insert screws and washers into the holes.  
8. Add thread wires between the V-shaped ears.  
9. Secure the setup with screws.  
10. Strip the ends of the cables for final connections.
