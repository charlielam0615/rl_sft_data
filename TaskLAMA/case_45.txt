### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for painting a brick house using Asian Paints, following a structured meta-cognitive approach. The plan must adhere to the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, ensuring all steps are completed in the correct order. The assumptions, substeps, and dependencies are as follows:

- **Assumption**: Painting a brick house with Asian Paints.
- **Substeps**:
  1. Clean and prepare the brick of the wall.
  2. Wrap the doors and windows with newspaper.
  3. Mend the gaps in the walls.
  4. Apply primer to the surface of the bricks.
  5. Use Asian Paints for the highest level of durability.
  6. Paint using a paint roller for smaller brick surfaces.
  7. Use a paintbrush to fill unreachable spots.
  8. Let the paint dry.
  9. Add a second coat if required.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Clean and prepare the brick of the wall must be done before mending the gaps in the walls.
  - Wrap the doors and windows with newspaper must be done before mending the gaps in the walls.
  - Mend the gaps in the walls must be done before applying primer to the surface of the bricks.
  - Paint using a paint roller for smaller brick surfaces must be done before applying primer to the surface of the bricks (noted as potentially incorrect in dependencies, to be clarified).
  - Apply primer to the surface of the bricks must be done before using Asian Paints.
  - Use Asian Paints must be done before using a paintbrush to fill unreachable spots.
  - Use a paintbrush to fill unreachable spots must be done before letting the paint dry.
  - Let the paint dry must be done before adding a second coat if required.

The plan will be developed by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the Planning (P), Implementation (I), or Review (R) categories, following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of painting a brick house into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will follow the sequence: clean and prepare the wall, wrap doors and windows, mend gaps, apply primer, use Asian Paints, paint with a roller, paint with a brush, let the paint dry, and add a second coat if needed. Note that the dependency stating "paint using a paint roller" must precede "apply primer" appears incorrect, as painting typically follows priming. Adjust the sequence to place painting with a roller after applying primer.
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Revise the subgoals to correct the dependency error. The corrected sequence of subgoals is:
1. Clean and prepare the brick of the wall.
2. Wrap the doors and windows with newspaper.
3. Mend the gaps in the walls.
4. Apply primer to the surface of the bricks.
5. Paint using a paint roller for smaller brick surfaces.
6. Use Asian Paints for the highest level of durability.
7. Use a paintbrush to fill unreachable spots.
8. Let the paint dry.
9. Add a second coat if required.
This adjustment ensures that painting with a roller follows priming, aligning with standard painting procedures.
