**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for building a wooden gate in the backyard. The task involves a series of substeps with specific temporal dependencies that must be followed to ensure the gate is constructed correctly. The context is provided through assumptions, substeps, and dependencies, which will guide the planning process. My goal is to simulate and develop a comprehensive plan by applying the meta-cognitive action set until all planning is completed.

**Step 1: Planning Action**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overarching goal of building a wooden gate into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The main goal is to "Build a wooden gate in the backyard." I will organize the substeps into a logical sequence, considering the dependencies provided, to create a structured plan. The subgoals will be:  
1. Clean the backyard.  
2. Take the required measurements.  
3. Design the layout.  
4. Cut the wood into the desired size.  
5. Clamp a pocket hole onto two of the cedar pieces.  
6. Connect three of the frame pieces together with the screws.  
7. Insert a diagonal cross brace through the gate's center.  
8. Trim the cross brace ends.  
9. Create two pocket holes on the cross brace's ends.  
10. Build vertical cedar planks.  
11. Connect the fence posts to the gate.  
12. Attach one of the hinges to the fence post.  
13. Attach a latch to the gate for easy opening.  
These subgoals will serve as the foundation for the planning process, ensuring all necessary steps are accounted for in the correct order.

**Step 2: Review Action**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
I will organize and review the hierarchy of goals to provide context for future steps. The goal hierarchy is as follows:  
- Main Goal: Build a wooden gate in the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 2: Take the required measurements.  
  - Subgoal 3: Design the layout.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the wood into the desired size.  
  - Subgoal 5: Clamp a pocket hole onto two of the cedar pieces.  
  - Subgoal 6: Connect three of the frame pieces together with the screws.  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert a diagonal cross brace through the gate's center.  
  - Subgoal 8: Trim the cross brace ends.  
  - Subgoal 9: Create two pocket holes on the cross brace's ends.  
  - Subgoal 10: Build vertical cedar planks.  
  - Subgoal 11: Connect the fence posts to the gate.  
  - Subgoal 12: Attach one of the hinges to the fence post.  
  - Subgoal 13: Attach a latch to the gate for easy opening.  
The current goal is Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard.

**Step 3: Planning Action**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will work backward from the main goal of building the wooden gate to ensure that all prerequisites and dependencies are considered for each subgoal. Starting from the final step (attaching a latch), I confirm the sequence of dependencies: attaching the latch requires the hinges to be attached, which requires the fence posts to be connected to the gate, and so on. This backward approach validates the sequence of subgoals identified in forward subgoaling:  
- Attaching the latch (Subgoal 13) depends on attaching the hinges (Subgoal 12).  
- Attaching the hinges depends on connecting the fence posts to the gate (Subgoal 11).  
- Connecting the fence posts depends on building vertical cedar planks (Subgoal 10) and creating pocket holes on the cross brace (Subgoal 9).  
- These steps trace back through trimming the cross brace, inserting the brace, connecting frame pieces, clamping pocket holes, cutting wood, designing the layout, taking measurements, and cleaning the backyard.  
This confirms that the initial sequence of subgoals aligns with the dependencies provided, ensuring a logical progression.

**Step 4: Review Action**

Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
I will maintain the goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format for clarity:  
- Main Goal: Build a wooden gate in the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 2: Take the required measurements.  
  - Subgoal 3: Design the layout.  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the wood into the desired size.  
  - Subgoal 5: Clamp a pocket hole onto two of the cedar pieces.  
  - Subgoal 6: Connect three of the frame pieces together with the screws.  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert a diagonal cross brace through the gate's center.  
  - Subgoal 8: Trim the cross brace ends.  
  - Subgoal 9: Create two pocket holes on the cross brace's ends.  
  - Subgoal 10: Build vertical cedar planks.  
  - Subgoal 11: Connect the fence posts to the gate.  
  - Subgoal 12: Attach one of the hinges to the fence post.  
  - Subgoal 13: Attach a latch to the gate for easy opening.  
The current goal remains Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard, as it is the first step in the sequence.

**Step 5: Planning Action**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
Upon reviewing the sequence and dependencies, I notice that some subgoals might benefit from additional clarity or minor adjustments to ensure practical execution. For instance, before cutting the wood (Subgoal 4), it might be necessary to gather materials and tools, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided substeps. However, since the provided substeps and dependencies are comprehensive and specific, I will not add new subgoals but rather adjust the understanding of existing ones to ensure they are actionable. For example:  
- Subgoal 2 (Take the required measurements) should include identifying the dimensions of the gate based on the backyard space.  
- Subgoal 3 (Design the layout) should involve sketching or planning the gate's structure based on measurements.  
These adjustments refine the subgoals without altering the sequence or dependencies, ensuring each step is clear and executable.

**Step 6: Review Action**

Action: Track Goals (Review Category)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
I will update the goal hierarchy to reflect the refined understanding from the adjusted subgoals:  
- Main Goal: Build a wooden gate in the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard.  
  - Subgoal 2: Take the required measurements (including identifying gate dimensions based on backyard space).  
  - Subgoal 3: Design the layout (including sketching or planning the gate's structure).  
  - Subgoal 4: Cut the wood into the desired size.  
  - Subgoal 5: Clamp a pocket hole onto two of the cedar pieces.  
  - Subgoal 6: Connect three of the frame pieces together with the screws.  
  - Subgoal 7: Insert a diagonal cross brace through the gate's center.  
  - Subgoal 8: Trim the cross brace ends.  
  - Subgoal 9: Create two pocket holes on the cross brace's ends.  
  - Subgoal 10: Build vertical cedar planks.  
  - Subgoal 11: Connect the fence posts to the gate.  
  - Subgoal 12: Attach one of the hinges to the fence post.  
  - Subgoal 13: Attach a latch to the gate for easy opening.  
The current goal is still Subgoal 1: Clean the backyard, as the planning phase focuses on organizing the overall structure before implementation.

**Conclusion of Planning Phase:**  
At this point, the planning for building a wooden gate in the backyard is complete. The subgoals have been identified, sequenced according to dependencies, validated through backward subgoaling, and refined for clarity. The goal hierarchy is well-structured and ready for implementation in subsequent steps. If further actions are required, such as moving to implementation or addressing specific subgoals, I can proceed accordingly in future steps. For now, the planning phase has covered all necessary aspects of creating a comprehensive plan for building the wooden gate.
