### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To create an effective plan for writing an appeal letter for college admission, break down the main goal into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and their dependencies. The main goal is to write and submit a successful appeal letter. The subgoals are:  
1. Understand the college’s appeals procedure.  
2. Compose the appeal letter.  
3. Provide detailed information in the letter.  
4. Use a formal format for the letter.  
5. Include letters of recommendation.  
6. Submit the appeal promptly.  
7. Check the application for updates or changes.  
These subgoals align with the provided substeps and will guide the planning process, respecting dependencies (e.g., understanding the procedure must precede submission, and composing the letter must precede including detailed information).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Write and submit a successful appeal letter for college admission.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the college’s appeals procedure.  
  - Subgoal 2: Compose the appeal letter.  
  - Subgoal 3: Provide detailed information in the letter.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use a formal format for the letter.  
  - Subgoal 5: Include letters of recommendation.  
  - Subgoal 6: Submit the appeal promptly.  
  - Subgoal 7: Check the application for updates or changes.  
**Current Goal**: Understand the college’s appeals procedure.  
This hierarchy integrates the subgoals identified in the previous forward subgoaling step, ensuring clarity and focus for subsequent actions. The current goal is the first step, as it must be completed before other tasks per the dependencies.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the college’s appeals procedure. This will be achieved by researching the college’s official website, contacting the admissions office, or reviewing any provided denial letter for specific appeal instructions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To understand the college’s appeals procedure, start by visiting the college’s official admissions website to locate the appeals process section. Look for details on deadlines, required materials, and submission methods. If the information is unclear, email or call the admissions office to clarify specific requirements, such as word limits for the appeal letter or acceptable grounds for appeal. Additionally, review the denial letter for any mentioned appeal instructions or contact details. Document all findings, including deadlines and required documents, to ensure compliance with the procedure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the appeals procedure information is accurate and complete. This will be achieved by cross-checking the documented procedure against multiple sources and confirming understanding of all requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Verify the documented appeals procedure by comparing information from the college’s website with details in the denial letter or any admissions office correspondence. Ensure all key elements are noted, including submission deadlines, required materials (e.g., appeal letter, recommendation letters), and acceptable grounds for appeal. If discrepancies exist, contact the admissions office to resolve them. Confirm that the procedure aligns with the assumption of writing an appeal letter for college admission.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Backward Subgoaling

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To ensure the appeal letter is successfully composed and submitted, work backward from the final goal of submitting the appeal. The submission requires a completed appeal letter with detailed information, a formal format, and recommendation letters, which in turn requires understanding the appeals procedure. The subgoals in reverse order are:  
1. Check the application for updates (final step).  
2. Submit the appeal promptly (requires completed letter and recommendations).  
3. Include recommendation letters (requires detailed letter).  
4. Use a formal format for the letter (requires detailed content).  
5. Provide detailed information in the letter (requires composed letter).  
6. Compose the appeal letter (requires understanding the procedure).  
7. Understand the appeals procedure (already addressed).  
This confirms the dependency structure and ensures all necessary steps are planned.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6: Track Goals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Write and submit a successful appeal letter for college admission.  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the college’s appeals procedure (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compose the appeal letter.  
  - Subgoal 3: Provide detailed information in the letter.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use a formal format for the letter.  
  - Subgoal 5: Include letters of recommendation.  
  - Subgoal 6: Submit the appeal promptly.  
  - Subgoal 7: Check the application for updates or changes.  
**Current Goal**: Compose the appeal letter.  
The hierarchy reflects the completion of understanding the appeals procedure and shifts focus to composing the letter, respecting the dependency that composition precedes detailed information and formal formatting.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compose the appeal letter. This will be achieved by drafting an initial version of the letter, addressing the reasons for the appeal and aligning with the college’s appeals procedure.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Draft the appeal letter, clearly stating the intent to appeal the admission decision. Include a brief introduction, the basis for the appeal (e.g., new achievements, extenuating circumstances), and a respectful request for reconsideration. Ensure the draft aligns with the college’s appeals procedure, such as addressing specific grounds for appeal or adhering to word limits. Use a professional tone and structure the letter with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Save the draft for further refinement in subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8: Adjust Subgoals

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
After composing the initial draft, refine the subgoals to ensure the letter meets all requirements. Adjust the subgoal of “Provide detailed information” to include specific details like new academic achievements, personal circumstances, or additional qualifications not previously considered. Additionally, adjust the subgoal of “Use a formal format” to emphasize adherence to the college’s specified format (e.g., letterhead, specific addressee). These adjustments ensure the letter is comprehensive and compliant with the appeals procedure.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 9: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to provide detailed information in the appeal letter. This will be achieved by revising the draft to include specific, relevant details that strengthen the appeal, such as new achievements or extenuating circumstances.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Revise the appeal letter draft to incorporate detailed information. Add specific examples, such as recent academic achievements (e.g., improved grades, new awards), relevant extracurricular accomplishments, or personal circumstances that impacted the original application (e.g., family issues, health challenges). Ensure the information is concise, relevant to the appeal’s grounds, and supported by evidence where possible (e.g., transcripts, certificates). Update the letter to reflect these details while maintaining clarity and coherence.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10: Reach Goal

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use a formal format for the appeal letter. This will be achieved by structuring the letter according to standard business letter conventions and any college-specific guidelines.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Format the revised appeal letter using a formal business letter structure: include the sender’s address, date, recipient’s name and title, college address, a formal salutation (e.g., “Dear Admissions Committee”), the body, and a closing (e.g., “Sincerely”). Use a professional font (e.g., Times New Roman, 12-point) and ensure proper alignment and spacing. If the college specifies a format (e.g., digital submission, specific addressee), adjust accordingly. Proofread for grammatical and formatting consistency.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11: Recall Info

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to include letters of recommendation. Retrieve information from previous steps related to the appeals procedure and letter composition to ensure recommendation letters align with requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Relevant information from previous steps:  
- Step 3 (Reach Goal): The appeals procedure may specify requirements for recommendation letters, such as who can write them (e.g., teachers, counselors) or their content.  
- Step 4 (Validation): Confirmed the appeals procedure includes details on required materials, potentially including recommendation letters.  
- Step 9 (Reach Goal): The appeal letter includes detailed information, which recommendation letters should support (e.g., academic achievements, personal circumstances).  
The recommendation letters should come from credible sources, support the appeal’s grounds, and adhere to any procedural guidelines (e.g., submission method, number of letters).  
[/REVIEW]
