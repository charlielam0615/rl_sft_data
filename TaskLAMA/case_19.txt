### Problem Statement
The task is to simulate a "write a diary" planning case, creating a plan to write a diary about my daily routine. The process must follow the provided meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) and adhere to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks. The task includes assumptions, substeps, and dependencies:

- **Assumption**: Write a diary about your daily routine.
- **Substeps**:
  1. Make a plan for what you're going to write.
  2. Select a format.
  3. Record your daily routine from morning to night in the diary.
  4. Keep your thoughts organized.
  5. Get your imagination going.
  6. Complete the conclusion.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Select a format must be done before making a plan.
  - Make a plan must be done before keeping thoughts organized.
  - Keep thoughts organized must be done before recording the daily routine.
  - Record the daily routine must be done before getting imagination going.
  - Get imagination going must be done before completing the conclusion.

The solution will proceed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, respecting the dependencies, and using the required block structure until the plan is complete.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of writing a diary into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The first subgoal is to select a format for the diary, as it must be done before making a plan. Subsequent subgoals include making a plan, keeping thoughts organized, recording the daily routine, getting imagination going, and completing the conclusion.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select a format for the diary. This will be achieved by evaluating different diary formats (e.g., narrative, bullet points, journal prompts) and choosing one that suits a daily routine description, considering clarity and ease of use.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To select a format, I consider three options:  
- **Narrative**: A free-flowing story-like format, good for detailed descriptions but potentially lengthy.  
- **Bullet Points**: A concise, list-based format, ideal for clear and organized routine tracking.  
- **Journal Prompts**: A question-driven format, useful for reflection but less focused on routine.  
Given the goal of documenting a daily routine clearly, the bullet-point format is most suitable due to its simplicity and ability to organize events chronologically.  
**Selected Format**: Bullet-point list with time-based entries for morning, afternoon, and evening.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
With the format selected (bullet-point list), the next subgoal is to make a plan for what to write in the diary. This involves outlining the key components of the daily routine to ensure all relevant activities are covered in a structured way.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a plan for what to write in the diary. This will be achieved by identifying key activities in a typical daily routine (morning, afternoon, evening) and structuring them to fit the bullet-point format.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To make a plan, I outline a typical daily routine:  
- **Morning**: Wake-up time, personal care (e.g., brushing teeth, shower), breakfast, and morning tasks (e.g., work, exercise).  
- **Afternoon**: Lunch, work or study, breaks, and any specific tasks (e.g., meetings, errands).  
- **Evening**: Dinner, leisure activities (e.g., reading, TV), and bedtime routine.  
The plan will include specific times and brief descriptions for each activity, ensuring a chronological flow in the bullet-point format.  
**Plan**: A bullet-point list with time stamps and activities for morning (6:00 AM–12:00 PM), afternoon (12:00 PM–6:00 PM), and evening (6:00 PM–10:00 PM).  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Write a diary about your daily routine.  
  - Subgoal 1: Select a format (Completed: Bullet-point list with time-based entries).  
  - Subgoal 2: Make a plan for what to write (Completed: Outline of morning, afternoon, evening activities).  
  - Subgoal 3: Keep your thoughts organized (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Record your daily routine from morning to night in the diary (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 5: Get your imagination going (Pending).  
  - Subgoal 6: Complete the conclusion (Pending).  
**Current Goal**: Keep your thoughts organized.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to keep thoughts organized while writing the diary. This will be achieved by creating a template based on the bullet-point format and plan, ensuring consistent structure and clear categorization of activities.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To keep thoughts organized, I create a template for the diary:  
- **Morning (6:00 AM–12:00 PM)**: List activities with time stamps (e.g., 6:30 AM – Wake up, 7:00 AM – Breakfast).  
- **Afternoon (12:00 PM–6:00 PM)**: List activities with time stamps (e.g., 12:30 PM – Lunch, 2:00 PM – Work).  
- **Evening (6:00 PM–10:00 PM)**: List activities with time stamps (e.g., 6:30 PM – Dinner, 8:00 PM – Leisure).  
This template ensures all activities are grouped by time of day, maintaining clarity and preventing overlap or omission of details.  
**Template**: A structured bullet-point list with time-based sections for morning, afternoon, and evening.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to record the daily routine from morning to night in the diary. This will be achieved by filling the template with specific activities from a typical day, following the bullet-point format and time-based structure.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Using the template, I record a sample daily routine:  
- **Morning (6:00 AM–12:00 PM)**:  
  - 6:30 AM – Wake up, stretch.  
  - 7:00 AM – Brush teeth, shower.  
  - 7:30 AM – Breakfast (oatmeal, coffee).  
  - 8:00 AM – Work (check emails, start tasks).  
- **Afternoon (12:00 PM–6:00 PM)**:  
  - 12:30 PM – Lunch (sandwich, salad).  
  - 1:00 PM – Work (meetings, project tasks).  
  - 3:00 PM – Short walk break.  
  - 4:00 PM – Continue work.  
- **Evening (6:00 PM–10:00 PM)**:  
  - 6:30 PM – Dinner (pasta, vegetables).  
  - 7:30 PM – Read a book.  
  - 9:00 PM – Watch TV.  
  - 10:00 PM – Bedtime routine (brush teeth, prepare for bed).  
This entry captures a complete daily routine in the bullet-point format, adhering to the organized template.  
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to get imagination going. Recall information about techniques or approaches used previously in the diary-writing process that could inspire creative additions to the diary entry.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Relevant information for getting imagination going:  
- The diary uses a bullet-point format for clarity (Step 2).  
- The plan includes morning, afternoon, and evening activities (Step 4).  
- The template organizes activities by time of day (Step 6).  
These elements suggest that creativity can be added by incorporating descriptive details or personal reflections within the structured format, enhancing the diary’s vividness without disrupting its organization.

  - 12:30 PM – Enjoy a hearty sandwich and crisp salad, reflecting on the morning’s progress.  
  - 1:00 PM – Engage in meetings, feeling productive as ideas flow.  
  - 3:00 PM – Take a short walk, inspired by the vibrant colors of spring outside.  
  - 4:00 PM – Return to work, focused and energized.  
- **Evening (6:00 PM–10:00 PM)**:  
  - 6:30 PM – Relish homemade pasta and vegetables, grateful for a cozy meal.  
  - 7:30 PM – Get lost in a gripping novel, imagination soaring with each page.  
  - 9:00 PM – Unwind with a favorite show, laughing at familiar scenes.  
  - 10:00 PM – Wind down with a bedtime routine, feeling content with the day.  
These additions make the entry more vivid and personal while preserving the structure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
The next subgoal is to complete the conclusion of the diary. This involves summarizing the day’s experience and reflecting on its significance to provide closure to the entry.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to complete the conclusion of the diary. This will be achieved by writing a brief summary of the day’s activities and a reflective statement on their significance, appended to the diary entry in the bullet-point format.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I add a conclusion to the diary:  
- **Conclusion**:  
  - **Summary**: Today was a balanced day of work, rest, and personal enjoyment, with a productive morning, focused afternoon, and relaxing evening.  
  - **Reflection**: This routine reminds me how structure and small moments of joy, like a walk or reading, create a fulfilling day.  
This conclusion ties together the diary entry, providing a sense of closure.  
[/IMP]
