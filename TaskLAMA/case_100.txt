**Problem Statement**: Create a plan to build a fire pit in the garden, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review). The plan must adhere to the specified format, selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list, and complete all steps required to build the fire pit.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of building a fire pit into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Choose the point in the garden area.  
2. Measure the length of the fire pit to be constructed.  
3. Outline the fire pit.  
4. Dig the hole according to the size.  
5. Pour the gravel into the hole.  
6. Place the initial ring of stones around the gravel's edge.  
7. Arrange the stone rows according to the plan.  
These subgoals must be executed in sequence due to the dependencies provided.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system:  
- **Main Goal**: Build a fire pit in the garden.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Choose the point in the garden area (Current).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Measure the length of the fire pit to be constructed.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Outline the fire pit.  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Dig the hole according to the size.  
  - **Subgoal 5**: Pour the gravel into the hole.  
  - **Subgoal 6**: Place the initial ring of stones around the gravel's edge.  
  - **Subgoal 7**: Arrange the stone rows according to the plan.  
**Current Goal**: Choose the point in the garden area.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to choose the point in the garden area. This will be achieved by evaluating the garden for a suitable location based on safety, accessibility, and aesthetics.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To choose the point in the garden:  
- Assess the garden for a flat, open area at least 10 feet away from structures, trees, or flammable materials for safety.  
- Ensure the location is easily accessible for seating and maintenance.  
- Consider aesthetic factors, such as visibility from seating areas or integration with the garden’s layout.  
- Select a spot that meets these criteria, e.g., a level area in the center or a corner of the garden with good clearance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the chosen point in the garden. This will be achieved by confirming the location meets safety and practical requirements.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To validate the chosen point:  
- Verify the location is at least 10 feet from buildings, fences, or vegetation to minimize fire risk.  
- Check that the ground is level and stable to support the fire pit structure.  
- Ensure the spot allows for comfortable access and seating arrangements.  
- Confirm no underground utilities (e.g., water or gas lines) are present by checking with local utility services or using a utility locator.  
If all criteria are met, proceed; otherwise, select a new location and repeat the validation.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to measure the length of the fire pit to be constructed. This will be achieved by determining the desired size and marking the measurements at the chosen location.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To measure the length of the fire pit:  
- Decide on the fire pit’s diameter (e.g., 3–5 feet for a standard backyard fire pit).  
- Use a tape measure to measure the diameter at the chosen location.  
- Mark the center point with a stake and use a string or tape measure to confirm the radius (half the diameter) in all directions for a circular pit.  
- Record the measurements for use in outlining and digging.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to outline the fire pit. Retrieve information related to the measurements and chosen location to ensure accurate outlining.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Current Goal**: Outline the fire pit.  
**Relevant Information**:  
- From Step 3: The chosen point is a flat, safe, and accessible location in the garden.  
- From Step 5: The fire pit’s diameter (e.g., 3–5 feet) and center point were measured and marked with a stake.  
This information provides the dimensions and location needed to outline the fire pit accurately.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to outline the fire pit. This will be achieved by marking the fire pit’s perimeter on the ground using the measured dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To outline the fire pit:  
- Use the stake at the center (from Step 5) and attach a string equal to the radius length.  
- Walk the string in a circle, marking the ground with spray paint, chalk, or a small trench to define the perimeter.  
- Ensure the outline is even and matches the planned diameter.  
- Double-check the outline’s shape and size with the tape measure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dig the hole according to the size. This will be achieved by excavating within the outlined area to the appropriate depth.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To dig the hole:  
- Use a shovel to excavate within the outlined perimeter to a depth of about 6–12 inches, depending on the fire pit design (e.g., 6 inches for a shallow pit, deeper for an in-ground pit).  
- Keep the sides of the hole as vertical as possible and remove loose soil or roots.  
- Level the base of the hole to ensure stability for the gravel layer.  
- Verify the hole’s diameter matches the outlined dimensions.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to pour the gravel into the hole. This will be achieved by adding a layer of gravel to the excavated area for drainage and stability.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To pour the gravel:  
- Obtain gravel (e.g., pea gravel or crushed stone) sufficient to fill the hole to a depth of 2–4 inches.  
- Spread the gravel evenly across the bottom of the hole using a shovel or rake.  
- Compact the gravel with a tamper or by pressing firmly to create a stable base.  
- Check that the gravel layer is level and covers the entire base of the hole.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the initial ring of stones around the gravel’s edge. This will be achieved by arranging stones along the perimeter of the gravel-filled hole.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To place the initial ring of stones:  
- Select fire-resistant stones or bricks (e.g., fire bricks or natural stone) suitable for the fire pit’s diameter.  
- Place the stones tightly together along the edge of the gravel, following the outlined perimeter.  
- Ensure the stones are stable and level, adjusting the gravel base if needed.  
- Verify the ring is complete and matches the planned diameter.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to arrange the stone rows according to the plan. This will be achieved by stacking additional rows of stones to reach the desired height.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To arrange the stone rows:  
- Stack additional rows of stones on top of the initial ring, staggering the joints for stability (like bricklaying).  
- Aim for a total height of 12–18 inches (or as per the plan) to contain the fire safely.  
- Use mortar or dry-stack the stones, depending on the desired permanence and aesthetic.  
- Check each row for levelness and stability, ensuring the structure is secure.  
[/IMP]

### Step 12
