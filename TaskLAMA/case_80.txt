### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to plan the size of the chicken coop. This will be achieved by determining the number of chickens, calculating space needs, and ensuring the dimensions fit the selected location.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Assume 6 chickens for the coop (a common small-scale number).  
- Calculate space: 6 chickens × 4 sq ft = 24 sq ft for the interior; 6 chickens × 10 sq ft = 60 sq ft for the outdoor run.  
- Add space for nesting boxes (1 sq ft per box, 3 boxes = 3 sq ft) and roosts (1 ft per chicken = 6 ft length).  
- Propose a coop size of 6x4 ft (24 sq ft) for the interior and 10x6 ft (60 sq ft) for the run, fitting within the 10x10 ft location.  
- Sketch a layout ensuring the coop and run align with the location’s boundaries.
