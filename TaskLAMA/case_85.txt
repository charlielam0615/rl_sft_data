**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to create a detailed plan for adjusting a cabinet door, following the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The task involves locating the adjustment screw, tightening screws, adjusting the door height, securing the screws, closing the door, and checking the position, while ensuring the correct sequence of steps as defined by the dependencies.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of adjusting a cabinet door into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals will be structured to follow the sequence: (1) Locate the side adjustment screw at the hinge, (2) Tighten the loose mounting screws, (3) Adjust the cabinet door to the desired height, (4) Tighten the screws by hand, (5) Close the cabinet door, and (6) Check the position. These subgoals respect the temporal dependencies provided, ensuring each step is performed in the correct order.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Locate the side adjustment screw at the hinge  
How to Achieve: I will visually inspect the cabinet door hinges to identify the side adjustment screw, which is typically located on the side of the hinge mechanism.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To locate the side adjustment screw, I will open the cabinet door fully to expose the hinges. I will examine each hinge, focusing on the side portion where adjustment screws are commonly placed. These screws are often small and may require a screwdriver for adjustment, so I will ensure I can clearly see and access them. If necessary, I will use a flashlight to improve visibility in darker areas.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the identification of the side adjustment screw  
How to Achieve: I will confirm that the screw I’ve located is indeed the side adjustment screw by checking its position on the hinge and referring to typical hinge designs.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will double-check the screw’s location on the hinge to ensure it matches the expected position for a side adjustment screw, which is usually on the side of the hinge arm. If I’m unsure, I will compare it against common hinge designs or consult a reference (like a manual or online resource) to confirm its function. I will also test by slightly turning the screw to see if it affects the door’s lateral alignment, ensuring I don’t fully adjust it yet.

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Tighten the loose mounting screws  
How to Achieve: I will use a screwdriver to tighten any loose screws on the hinge that secure it to the cabinet frame.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will inspect the mounting screws on each hinge that attach the hinge to the cabinet frame. Using a suitable screwdriver (likely a Phillips or flathead, depending on the screw type), I will turn each screw clockwise to tighten it, ensuring the hinge is firmly secured. I will avoid over-tightening to prevent stripping the screws or damaging the cabinet material. I will check each screw methodically to ensure none are missed.

**Step 8:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Adjust the cabinet door to the desired height  
How to Achieve: I will turn the side adjustment screw to move the door up or down until it aligns properly with the cabinet frame or adjacent doors.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
With the side adjustment screw located, I will use a screwdriver to turn it slowly. Turning it clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on the hinge design) will raise or lower the door. I will make small adjustments, checking the door’s alignment with the cabinet frame or other doors after each turn. My aim is to ensure the door is at the desired height and visually aligned. I will take care not to over-adjust, as this could misalign other aspects of the door.

**Step 10:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Tighten the screws by hand  
How to Achieve: I will ensure all adjustment and mounting screws are securely tightened by hand using a screwdriver.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will go over each screw on the hinge, including the side adjustment screw and mounting screws, and tighten them by hand with a screwdriver. I will turn each screw clockwise until it feels snug, ensuring the hinge and door remain in the adjusted position. I will be cautious not to over-tighten, as this could strip the screws or damage the hinge or cabinet. This step secures the door’s new alignment.

**Step 14:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Check the position  
How to Achieve: I will inspect the closed cabinet door to ensure it is properly aligned and at the desired height.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
With the cabinet door closed, I will visually inspect its alignment with the cabinet frame and adjacent doors (if any). I will check for even gaps around the door edges and confirm that the height matches the desired position. If I notice any misalignment, I will note the specific issue for potential further adjustments. If everything looks correct, I will consider the adjustment complete.

**Step 15:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning Category)  
After checking the position, I will evaluate if further adjustments are needed. If the door is not aligned properly, I will revisit specific subgoals (e.g., adjusting the height or tightening screws) to correct the issue. For now, assuming the position is correct based on the final check, I will mark the main goal as complete. If misalignment is observed in the future, I will adjust the plan to revisit earlier steps.

This completes the planning and execution of the cabinet door adjustment task. If any issues arise post-check, I can revisit specific steps using the "Backtrack" or "Adjust Subgoals" actions to refine the alignment. For now, the plan is finalized with all subgoals and the main goal marked as completed.
