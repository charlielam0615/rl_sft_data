[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select a suitable location in the backyard for the fire pit. This will be achieved by evaluating the backyard for a flat, safe area away from flammable structures and ensuring compliance with local regulations.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To select the best place for the fire pit:
- Inspect the backyard for a flat area, ideally 10-15 feet away from the house, trees, or other flammable structures to ensure safety.
- Check for overhead hazards like tree branches or power lines.
- Verify local regulations or homeowner association rules regarding fire pit placement and permits.
- Choose a spot with good drainage to prevent water accumulation.
- Mark a potential area (e.g., a 4-5 foot diameter circle) to visualize the fire pit’s footprint.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the selected location for the fire pit. This will be achieved by confirming the location meets safety, regulatory, and practical requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the selected location:
- Measure the distance from the chosen spot to the house, trees, and other structures to ensure it meets the 10-15 foot safety buffer.
- Confirm no underground utilities (e.g., gas or water lines) are present using a utility locator service or by contacting local authorities.
- Check that the ground is level using a spirit level; minor slopes can be corrected during digging.
- Consult local fire codes or permit offices to ensure compliance with regulations.
- Test drainage by pouring water on the spot to ensure it doesn’t pool.
If any issues are found, adjust the location accordingly.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
If the selected location fails validation (e.g., due to drainage issues or proximity to hazards), adjust the subgoal of selecting a location by choosing a new spot in the backyard that addresses the identified issues.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Build a fire pit in the backyard using cinder blocks.
  - Subgoal 1: Select a suitable location in the backyard (Completed or adjusted if necessary).
  - Subgoal 2: Design the layout for the selected area (Current).
  - Subgoal 3: Dig out the soil in the designated area.
  - Subgoal 4: Add sand to the center of the pit.
  - Subgoal 5: Place the first row of cinder blocks.
  - Subgoal 6: Add additional cinder block layers.
  - Subgoal 7: Seal the blocks with mortar.
**Current Goal**: Design the layout for the selected area.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to design the layout for the selected area. This will be achieved by determining the fire pit’s size, shape, and cinder block arrangement, and marking the layout on the ground.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To design the layout:
- Decide on a circular fire pit with a 3-4 foot inner diameter for a standard backyard fire pit.
- Plan for a cinder block wall 2-3 layers high (each cinder block is approximately 8x8x16 inches).
- Calculate the number of cinder blocks needed for the first row: For a 3-foot inner diameter, the outer diameter is about 4 feet, requiring approximately 12-14 cinder blocks per row.
- Mark the circular layout on the ground using spray paint or string and stakes, ensuring the circle is centered and even.
- Sketch a simple diagram noting the dimensions and block placement for reference during construction.
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to dig out the soil in the designated area. This will be achieved by excavating the marked area to create a stable base for the fire pit.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To dig out the soil:
- Use a shovel to dig within the marked circle to a depth of about 6-8 inches to create a stable base.
- Remove grass, roots, and rocks to ensure a smooth surface.
- Level the base using a tamper or flat board and check with a spirit level.
- Set aside the excavated soil for potential backfilling or disposal.
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add sand to the center of the pit. This will be achieved by spreading a layer of sand to create a heat-resistant base.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To add sand:
- Pour a 2-3 inch layer of coarse sand (e.g., paver sand) into the excavated pit.
- Spread the sand evenly using a rake or shovel.
- Compact the sand with a tamper to create a firm base.
- Check the level to ensure uniformity.
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the first row of cinder blocks on the ground. This will be achieved by arranging cinder blocks along the marked layout on the sand base.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To place the first row of cinder blocks:
- Position 12-14 cinder blocks (based on layout design) along the marked circle, ensuring they are tightly aligned.
- Place blocks with the hollow side up for stability and aesthetic consistency.
- Check alignment with a spirit level and adjust as needed by adding or removing sand beneath.
- Tap blocks gently into place with a rubber mallet to ensure they are secure.
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to add more cinder block layers. This will be achieved by stacking additional rows of cinder blocks on the first row in a staggered pattern.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To add more cinder block layers:
- Stack the second row of cinder blocks (12-14 blocks) in a staggered pattern, offsetting each block to overlap the joints of the first row for stability.
- Add a third row if desired for additional height, following the same staggered pattern.
- Check each row with a spirit level to ensure the structure remains even.
- Adjust blocks as needed to maintain alignment and stability.
[/IMP]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to seal the blocks together using mortar. This will be achieved by applying mortar between cinder block layers to secure the structure.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To seal the blocks with mortar:
- Mix mortar according to package instructions to achieve a workable consistency.
- Apply a 1/2-inch layer of mortar between each cinder block in the rows and between layers using a trowel.
- Press blocks into the mortar to ensure adhesion.
- Smooth excess mortar with the trowel for a clean finish.
- Allow the mortar to cure for 24-48 hours, keeping it moist to prevent cracking.
[/IMP]
