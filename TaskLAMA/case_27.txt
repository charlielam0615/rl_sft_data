--- Case 27 ---
**Problem Statement**: The task is to create a plan for building a deck out of pallet wood in the backyard, following the provided substeps and dependencies, using the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to structure the solution. Each step will select one action from the meta-cognitive action list, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as appropriate, ensuring all dependencies are respected until the plan is complete.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of building a deck out of pallet wood into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Clean the backyard.  
2. Decide the block size.  
3. Determine the number of concrete blocks.  
4. Set blocks four feet apart.  
5. Make holes for blocks.  
6. Fill holes with gravel.  
7. Tamp down gravel.  
8. Insert blocks into holes.  
9. Level the blocks.  
10. Assemble wood pallets.  
11. Arrange pallets on blocks.  
12. Allow the deck to settle.  
These subgoals align with the provided substeps and respect the temporal dependencies (e.g., cleaning must precede block size decision and block quantity determination).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
Maintain a goal-management system to list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the subgoals from Step 1 and highlighting the current goal.  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Build a deck out of pallet wood  
  - Clean the backyard (Current Goal)  
  - Decide the block size  
  - Determine the number of concrete blocks  
  - Set blocks four feet apart  
  - Make holes for blocks  
  - Fill holes with gravel  
  - Tamp down gravel  
  - Insert blocks into holes  
  - Level the blocks  
  - Assemble wood pallets  
  - Arrange pallets on blocks  
  - Allow the deck to settle  
**Current Goal**: Clean the backyard by removing unwanted weeds or plants.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to clean the backyard by removing unwanted weeds or plants. This will be achieved by identifying and removing weeds, plants, or debris to prepare a clear area for the deck.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To clean the backyard:  
1. Inspect the backyard to identify unwanted weeds, plants, or debris.  
2. Use gardening tools (e.g., shovel, rake, or weed puller) to remove weeds and plants, ensuring roots are extracted to prevent regrowth.  
3. Clear debris and dispose of it properly.  
4. Level the ground if necessary to ensure a flat surface for subsequent steps.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to ensure the backyard cleaning is complete and valid. This will be achieved by checking that all weeds, plants, and debris are removed and the area is level.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate the backyard cleaning:  
1. Visually inspect the backyard to confirm no weeds or unwanted plants remain.  
2. Check that debris is fully cleared.  
3. Use a level tool to verify the ground is even and suitable for block placement.  
4. Address any remaining issues (e.g., stray weeds or uneven patches).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Since the backyard is cleaned, focus on the next subgoals: deciding the block size and determining the number of concrete blocks, as both must be done before setting blocks (per dependencies). Subdivide these into:  
- Research standard block sizes and select one suitable for the deck.  
- Calculate the number of blocks based on deck dimensions and block spacing (four feet apart).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to decide the size of the concrete blocks. This will be achieved by researching standard block sizes and selecting one based on stability and deck requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To decide the block size:  
1. Research common concrete block sizes (e.g., 8x8x16 inches is standard for decks).  
2. Consider the deck’s expected load and pallet wood dimensions.  
3. Select a block size (e.g., 8x8x16 inches) for stability and compatibility with four-foot spacing.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the number of concrete blocks required. This will be achieved by calculating based on the deck’s dimensions and the four-foot spacing requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To determine the number of blocks:  
1. Assume a deck size (e.g., 12x12 feet, adjustable based on user preference).  
2. With blocks spaced four feet apart, calculate: (12/4 + 1) rows and (12/4 + 1) columns = 4x4 = 16 blocks.  
3. Adjust for any additional edge or corner blocks if needed.  
4. Finalize the count (e.g., 16 blocks for a 12x12-foot deck).  
[/IMP]

These must be executed sequentially per the dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to make a hole twice as deep as the block at each marked position. This will be achieved by digging holes based on the block size (e.g., 8 inches deep for a 4-inch block).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To make holes:  
1. Use a shovel or post-hole digger at each marked grid point.  
2. For an 8x8x16-inch block with 4-inch height above ground, dig holes approximately 8 inches deep.  
3. Ensure holes are wide enough for the block (e.g., 16x16 inches).  
4. Remove excess soil and keep the area tidy.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to fill the holes with gravel. This will be achieved by adding gravel to each hole to create a stable base.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To fill holes with gravel:  
1. Pour gravel into each hole, filling to about 1-2 inches below the block’s base level.  
2. Use approximately 0.5 cubic feet of gravel per hole (adjust based on hole size).  
3. Ensure even distribution of gravel.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to firmly tamp down the gravel. This will be achieved by compacting the gravel to ensure a stable foundation.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To tamp down gravel:  
1. Use a tamper or heavy flat tool to compact the gravel in each hole.  
2. Apply firm pressure to ensure the gravel is tightly packed.  
3. Check that the gravel surface is level and stable.  
[/IMP]

2. Use a long straightedge or string line across blocks to verify they are level with each other.  
3. Test stability by applying pressure to each block.  
4. Make adjustments if any issues are found.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 17
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
For the deck assembly phase, break down into:  
- Assemble wood pallets into a cohesive deck structure.  
- Arrange the assembled pallets on top of the blocks.  
- Allow the deck to settle for 24 hours.  
These must follow the dependencies (e.g., assembly and leveling precede arrangement).  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 18
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to assemble the wood pallets to make the deck. This will be achieved by preparing and joining pallets to form the deck surface.
