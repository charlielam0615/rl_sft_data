Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M)
We define a set of meta-cognitive actions M, divided into three subsets: Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R).
- Planning $$P \subset M$$
  - Forward Subgoaling: Breaking down the current goal into forward-looking intermediate subgoals.
  - Backward Subgoaling: Defining necessary intermediate subgoals by working backward from the current goal.
  - Adjust Subgoals: Adjusting or changing previously set intermediate subgoals.
  - Backtrack: Returning to an earlier state.
- Implementation $$I \subset M$$
  - Reach Goal: Identifying the goal of this step, and applying reasoning or using tools to achieve it.
  - Validation: Checking the current path's validity.
- Review $$R \subset M$$
  - Track Goals: Organize and review the hierarchy of goals generated by previous subgoaling methods, highlighting the current one.
  - Recall Info: Retrieve past information relevant to the current step.

I want you to solve problems by selecting one action per step from the meta-cognitive action list. Your response must adhere to the following format: enclose all planning-related content within [PLANNING] and [/PLANNING] tags, all implementation-related content within [IMP] and [/IMP] tags, and all review-related content within [REVIEW] and [/REVIEW] tags. The details of the requirement will be given below.
- The [PLANNING], [IMP] and [REVIEW] blocks
The meta-cognitive action list divides actions into three categories: "planning", "implementation" and "Review". If the selected action is from the "planning" category, include all content for that step in the [PLANNING] block. If the action is from the "implementation" category, place the action name and action meta-data (defined below) and in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as implementation details and should be placed in the [IMP] block. If the action is from the "review" category, place the action name in the [PLANNING] block, and the rest of the content is deemed as reviewed details, and should be placed in the [REVIEW] block.

- Additional remarks on the [PLANNING] block
For actions from the "planning" category, put all the generated content of the action in the [PLANNING] block.
For actions from the "implementation" category, put the action name and implementation-action meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The implementation-action meta-data includes details about the current goal, and a concise description about how to achieve it. Present the meta-data in clear, natural language.
For actions from the "review" category, when the action is "recall info" include the action name and its meta-data in the [PLANNING] block. The meta-data should concisely describe the core content serving as the foundation for the information retrieval process, with retrieved information being relevant to this content. When is the action is not "recall info", just put the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

- Additional remarks on the [REVIEW] block
For actions belong to the review category, we provide detailed instructions below:
Track Goals: Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format by integrating information from the recent [PLANNING] block. The aim of this action is to provide an overall as well as focused context to future [IMP] block. You should also state the current goal. Ensure the goals reflect the most recent updates, particularly if they have just been modified by actions from the "planning" category.
Recall Info: Identify the current goal, go through all previous contents, and extract information related to the current goal. Your summarized information should be concise, such that it should serve as pointers to previous related materials.

Start your solution by restating the problem clearly. Then, for each step, include the following blocks based on the action's category:

Case 1: Planning action — Include only the [PLANNING] block.
Case 2: Implementation action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [IMP] block.
Case 3: Review action — Include the [PLANNING] block followed by the [REVIEW] block.

Append which category the selected action belongs to after the action name in the [PLANNING] block.

Solve the user's problems by following the previous requirements.


    I want you to simulate a "make chocolate ice cream easy" planning case and then create the plan following the aforementioned principlesuntil all the plans are completed.
    You can refer to the following information:
    assumptions (the context of the task): [{'assumptionId': 1, 'assumption': 'Make chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips.'}]
    substeps (the steps of the task): [{'stepId': 1, 'step': 'Light the stove on the low flame'}, {'stepId': 2, 'step': 'Place a bowl on the stove'}, {'stepId': 3, 'step': 'Add milk into the bowl'}, {'stepId': 4, 'step': 'Add the required amount of sugar'}, {'stepId': 5, 'step': 'Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved'}, {'stepId': 6, 'step': 'Add the cocoa powder'}, {'stepId': 7, 'step': 'Add condensed milk'}, {'stepId': 8, 'step': 'Mix all the ingredients well'}, {'stepId': 9, 'step': 'Allow the chocolate mixture to cool completely'}, {'stepId': 10, 'step': 'Mix the whipped cream with the chocolate mixture'}, {'stepId': 11, 'step': 'Add choco chips to the chocolate mixture'}, {'stepId': 12, 'step': 'Transfer the mixture to an air tight container'}, {'stepId': 13, 'step': 'Freeze the mixture for fifteen hours.'}]
    dependencies (the temporal dependencies between the task steps): [{'subtask1': 'Light the stove on the low flame', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Place a bowl on the stove'}, {'subtask1': 'Place a bowl on the stove', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Add milk into the bowl'}, {'subtask1': 'Place a bowl on the stove', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Add the required amount of sugar'}, {'subtask1': 'Add milk into the bowl', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved'}, {'subtask1': 'Add the required amount of sugar', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved'}, {'subtask1': 'Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Add the cocoa powder'}, {'subtask1': 'Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Add condensed milk'}, {'subtask1': 'Add the cocoa powder', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Mix all the ingredients well'}, {'subtask1': 'Add condensed milk', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Mix all the ingredients well'}, {'subtask1': 'Mix all the ingredients well', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Allow the chocolate mixture to cool completely'}, {'subtask1': 'Allow the chocolate mixture to cool completely', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Mix the whipped cream with the chocolate mixture'}, {'subtask1': 'Allow the chocolate mixture to cool completely', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Add choco chips to the chocolate mixture'}, {'subtask1': 'Mix the whipped cream with the chocolate mixture', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Transfer the mixture to an air tight container'}, {'subtask1': 'Add choco chips to the chocolate mixture', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Transfer the mixture to an air tight container'}, {'subtask1': 'Transfer the mixture to an air tight container', 'relation': 'Must be done before', 'subtask2': 'Freeze the mixture for fifteen hours.'}]
