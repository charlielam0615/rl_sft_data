### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a detailed plan for building a ramp for a shed using a DIY approach, following the provided substeps and their temporal dependencies, while adhering to the meta-cognitive action set framework (Planning, Implementation, Review). The plan will be developed step-by-step, selecting one meta-cognitive action per step, and organizing the content into [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required by the action’s category.

---

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a shed ramp into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Measure and mark the ramp dimensions.  
2. Prepare the foundation by digging and placing concrete blocks.  
3. Construct the ramp structure by attaching the ledger board, cutting and securing stringers, and adding blocking.  
4. Install the ramp and ensure it is straight and secure.  
These subgoals will guide the sequence of actions, respecting the dependencies (e.g., measuring before marking, digging before placing blocks).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals to maintain focus and context.  
- **Main Goal**: Build a ramp for a shed (DIY).  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Measure and mark the ramp dimensions.  
  - **Subgoal 2**: Prepare the foundation by digging and placing concrete blocks.  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Construct the ramp structure (ledger board, stringers, blocking).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Install the ramp and ensure it is straight and secure.  
**Current Goal**: Measure and mark the ramp dimensions (Subgoal 1).  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
The goal hierarchy is established based on the forward subgoaling in Step 1. The current focus is on Subgoal 1, which involves measuring and marking dimensions, as these are the initial steps required by the dependencies (measuring must precede marking).  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Measure the dimensions using a T-square.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a T-square to measure the height of the shed entrance and the desired ramp length, ensuring accuracy for the ramp’s slope and fit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To measure the dimensions, gather a T-square, a measuring tape, and a notebook. Measure the vertical height from the shed entrance to the ground to determine the ramp’s rise. Then, measure the horizontal distance from the shed to where the ramp will end, ensuring a safe slope (typically 1:12 for accessibility). Record the measurements precisely to guide the marking step.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Mark the dimensions with a marker.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a marker to outline the ramp’s dimensions on the materials (e.g., wood for stringers) based on the measurements taken with the T-square.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Using the measurements from the T-square, mark the length, width, and angle of the ramp on the wood or ground surface with a permanent marker. Ensure the marks are clear and visible, double-checking against the recorded dimensions to avoid errors before cutting or construction begins.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)**  
Reassess the subgoals to ensure the foundation preparation (digging and placing concrete blocks) aligns with the ramp’s marked dimensions. Adjust Subgoal 2 to include verifying soil stability for the concrete blocks to ensure a stable foundation.  
- **Updated Subgoal 2**: Prepare the foundation by verifying soil stability, digging an area, and placing concrete blocks.  
[/PLANNING]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Dig an area just big enough to fit the concrete blocks.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a shovel to dig a precise area based on the marked dimensions, ensuring it is level and deep enough to hold the concrete blocks securely.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
With a shovel, dig an area at the base of the ramp’s marked endpoint, sized to fit the concrete blocks (e.g., 12x12 inches each). The depth should be about 4-6 inches to ensure stability. Level the ground and remove any debris to prepare for block placement.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Place the concrete blocks.  
**How to Achieve**: Position the concrete blocks in the dug area, ensuring they are level and aligned with the ramp’s planned structure.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the concrete blocks into the dug area, checking with a level to ensure they sit evenly. Adjust the soil if needed to achieve a flat surface. Ensure the blocks are spaced according to the ramp’s width and aligned with the marked dimensions to support the ramp structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate the foundation setup (concrete blocks).  
**How to Achieve**: Check that the concrete blocks are level, stable, and properly aligned with the ramp’s marked dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a level to confirm the blocks are even and stable. Measure the alignment with the marked ramp dimensions to ensure the blocks match the planned layout. If any blocks are uneven or misaligned, adjust the soil or reposition them to correct the setup.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Attach the ledger board.  
**How to Achieve**: Secure the ledger board to the shed’s entrance using screws, ensuring it is level and aligned with the marked dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Position the ledger board (a strong piece of wood, e.g., 2x6) at the shed’s entrance where the ramp will connect. Use a level to ensure it is horizontal. Secure it to the shed’s frame with heavy-duty screws, ensuring a firm connection to support the ramp’s weight.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Cut the stringers.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a saw to cut the stringers (support beams) to the marked dimensions, ensuring they match the ramp’s slope and length.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Based on the marked dimensions, cut the stringers (e.g., 2x6 boards) using a circular saw. Ensure the cuts follow the ramp’s slope angle (calculated from the height and length measurements). Double-check measurements before cutting to avoid errors.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 11
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Secure each stringer with screws into the ledger board.  
**How to Achieve**: Attach the cut stringers to the ledger board using screws, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Position the stringers against the ledger board, spaced evenly (e.g., 16 inches apart). Use a drill to secure each stringer to the ledger board with screws, ensuring a tight connection. Check alignment with a level to maintain the ramp’s slope.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 12
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Trim off excess stringers on each side.  
**How to Achieve**: Use a saw to trim any excess length from the stringers to ensure they fit the ramp’s design.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Inspect the stringers for any excess length protruding beyond the ramp’s planned dimensions. Use a circular saw to trim them to the exact length, ensuring a clean and flush fit with the ramp’s structure.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 13
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Screwed blocking between stringers to maintain space.  
**How to Achieve**: Install blocking (wood pieces) between the stringers to maintain spacing and add structural support, securing them with screws.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Cut wood blocks (e.g., 2x4 pieces) to fit between the stringers. Place them at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 feet) to maintain consistent spacing. Secure each block with screws into the stringers, ensuring the structure remains rigid and stable.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 14
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Install the ramp at the shed.  
**How to Achieve**: Attach the ramp’s structure (stringers and decking) to the ledger board and concrete blocks, ensuring a secure fit.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Place the ramp structure (stringers and decking boards) onto the concrete blocks and against the ledger board. Secure the decking boards to the stringers with screws, ensuring the ramp is firmly attached to both the blocks and the ledger board. Check that the ramp aligns with the shed entrance.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 15
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Make sure everything is straight and tight.  
**How to Achieve**: Inspect the ramp for alignment, stability, and secure connections, making adjustments as needed.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Use a level to check that the ramp is straight and slopes correctly. Tighten any loose screws in the ledger board, stringers, or decking. Test the ramp’s stability by applying weight to ensure it is secure and safe for use.  
[/IMP]
