### Problem Statement
The task is to create a plan for building a tiki bar, with a specific focus on constructing the roof. The process involves completing a series of subtasks in a specific order, as defined by the provided assumptions, substeps, and dependencies. The subtasks are: draft the plan of the roof, lay the foundation, make the deck, assemble the walls, install the roof supports, make the roof structure, cover the rooftop, and form the roof. Each subtask must follow the temporal dependencies, where each step must be completed before the next one begins. The goal is to develop a comprehensive plan by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided Meta-Cognitive Action Set (M), which includes Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) actions, and to structure the response using [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as specified.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of building a tiki bar roof into forward-looking intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and dependencies. The subgoals are:  
1. Draft the plan of the roof.  
2. Lay the foundation.  
3. Make the deck.  
4. Assemble the walls.  
5. Install the roof supports.  
6. Make the roof structure.  
7. Cover the rooftop.  
8. Form the roof.  
These subgoals must be executed in sequence due to the dependencies, starting with drafting the roof plan.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to draft the plan of the roof. This will be achieved by creating a detailed blueprint that includes the roof’s dimensions, materials, and structural design, considering the tiki bar’s aesthetic and functional requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Create a blueprint for the tiki bar roof, specifying:  
- **Dimensions:** A 10x10 ft square roof to cover the bar area.  
- **Materials:** Bamboo for supports, thatch for covering, and wooden beams for the frame.  
- **Design:** A sloped, tropical-style roof with a 30-degree pitch to ensure water runoff.  
- **Tools Needed:** Drafting software or graph paper, measuring tape, and reference images of tiki-style roofs.  
The plan must account for the subsequent steps, ensuring the design aligns with the foundation, deck, and wall dimensions.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the roof plan. This will be achieved by checking the blueprint for completeness, feasibility, and alignment with the tiki bar’s requirements and dependencies.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Review the roof plan:  
- **Completeness:** Confirm the blueprint includes dimensions (10x10 ft), materials (bamboo, thatch, wood), and a 30-degree pitch.  
- **Feasibility:** Verify that bamboo and thatch are locally available and that the 30-degree pitch is structurally sound for weather conditions.  
- **Alignment:** Ensure the plan supports the next steps (e.g., foundation and deck dimensions match the roof’s footprint).  
The plan is valid and ready for the next subtask.  
[/IMP]
