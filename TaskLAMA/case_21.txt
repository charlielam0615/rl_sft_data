**Problem Restatement:**  
I need to simulate and create a detailed plan for building a fence on a slope using wood as the primary material. The task involves several substeps with specific temporal dependencies. The substeps include leveling the ground surface, measuring the size of the slope, cutting the wood according to the fence size, setting the rails, attaching the slats with screws, angling the ends of the rails, and finally installing the fencing. The plan must adhere to the provided dependencies and be developed step-by-step using the meta-cognitive action set framework.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the overall goal of building a fence on a slope into intermediate subgoals based on the provided substeps and their dependencies. The subgoals will be structured to ensure a logical progression of tasks. My forward subgoaling will involve outlining the sequence of actions needed to complete the project, starting from the initial step of leveling the ground to the final installation of the fencing. The subgoals are as follows:  
1. Level the ground surface to create a stable base.  
2. Measure the size of the slope to determine the dimensions for the fence.  
3. Cut the wood according to the measured size of the fence.  
4. Set the rails to form the framework of the fence.  
5. Angle the ends of the rails to match the slope's incline.  
6. Attach the slats to the rails using screws.  
7. Install the completed fencing structure on the slope.  
These subgoals respect the temporal dependencies provided, ensuring each step is completed in the correct order.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Level the ground surface to create a stable base.  
How to Achieve: Use tools such as a shovel and a level to remove uneven soil and create a flat surface on the slope where the fence will be installed. This will involve assessing the slope's gradient and deciding how much leveling is necessary to ensure stability for the fence posts.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To level the ground surface, begin by inspecting the slope to identify high and low points. Use a shovel to remove excess soil from higher areas and redistribute it to lower areas to achieve a more even surface. Employ a level tool to check the flatness periodically, ensuring the ground is stable enough to support fence posts. If the slope is steep, consider creating small terraces or steps to accommodate the fence's foundation. Document any significant challenges, such as rocky terrain or hard soil, for future reference during installation. This step is critical as it ensures the fence will stand securely without leaning or collapsing due to uneven ground.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the leveled ground surface.  
How to Achieve: Check the flatness and stability of the ground using a level tool and by physically inspecting the area to ensure it can support the fence structure.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Walk along the leveled area to confirm there are no noticeable dips or bumps. Use a level tool across multiple sections of the slope to verify that the surface is even. Test the stability by applying pressure to the ground to see if it shifts or feels loose. If any areas are uneven or unstable, repeat the leveling process with the shovel to correct them. Ensure the ground is compacted enough to hold fence posts by stepping firmly on it or using a tamper if necessary. Record any adjustments made to ensure consistency in future steps.

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Measure the size of the slope to determine the dimensions for the fence.  
How to Achieve: Use a measuring tape and other tools to calculate the length, height, and angle of the slope where the fence will be installed, ensuring accurate dimensions for cutting wood and setting rails.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Start by marking the starting and ending points of the fence line on the slope. Use a measuring tape to determine the total length of the fence line along the slope. Measure the height difference between the highest and lowest points of the slope to understand the vertical drop, which will affect the fence design. Use a protractor or an angle finder to measure the slope's incline to ensure the fence rails can be angled appropriately. Record all measurements carefully, including multiple points along the slope if it varies, to ensure the fence fits the terrain. Double-check the measurements for accuracy before proceeding to the next step of cutting the wood.  
[/IMP]

**Step 7:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Validation (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Validate the measurements of the slope.  
How to Achieve: Recheck the recorded measurements using the measuring tape and angle finder to confirm accuracy before using them for cutting wood.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Revisit the marked points on the slope and remeasure the length, height differences, and angle of the slope using the same tools. Compare these new measurements with the initial ones to ensure they match. If discrepancies are found, take a third set of measurements to confirm the correct values. Pay special attention to the slope's angle, as it will directly impact how the rails and slats are cut and installed. Note any inconsistencies or challenges, such as uneven terrain affecting measurement accuracy, and adjust the recorded dimensions if necessary. This validation ensures that the subsequent step of cutting wood is based on precise data, avoiding costly errors.

How to Achieve: Use the recorded measurements to cut wooden posts, rails, and slats to the appropriate lengths and angles with a saw, ensuring they fit the slope's dimensions.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Gather the wood materials and tools, including a saw, measuring tape, and pencil for marking. Refer to the recorded measurements of the slope's length, height differences, and angle to mark the wood for cutting. For posts, cut them to the required height, considering the slope's drop to ensure they stand evenly. For rails, cut them to the measured length of the fence line, and note where angled cuts may be needed later. Cut slats to uniform lengths based on the desired fence height. Use a miter saw for angled cuts if necessary to match the slope's incline. Double-check each piece after cutting to ensure it matches the measurements, and label pieces for easy identification during assembly. Store cut pieces safely to avoid damage before the next step.

Begin by placing the cut wooden posts at regular intervals along the leveled slope, ensuring they are vertical using a level tool. Dig holes for each post if necessary, and secure them with concrete or compacted soil for stability. Once the posts are set, attach the horizontal rails to the posts using screws or nails, aligning them with the slope's incline based on the measured angle. Use a level to check that the rails are positioned correctly, adjusting as needed to ensure they follow the slope's contour. Space the rails evenly to support the slats later. Check the stability of the framework by applying gentle pressure to ensure it can withstand weight and environmental factors. Document any adjustments or issues encountered during this process for reference in subsequent steps.

Refer to the recorded slope angle measurements to determine the precise angle needed for the rail ends. Mark the cutting lines on the ends of the rails using a pencil and a protractor or angle finder for accuracy. Use a miter saw to make clean, angled cuts on the rail ends, ensuring they align with the slope's incline when positioned. Test-fit the rails against the posts or adjacent rails to confirm the angle matches the slope's contour. Make minor adjustments with sandpaper or additional cuts if necessary to achieve a perfect fit. Ensure all rail ends are cut consistently to maintain a uniform appearance.

Gather the cut slats, a drill, screws, and a measuring tape. Start at one end of the fence framework and position the first slat vertically against the rails, ensuring it aligns with the slope's angle. Use a level to confirm the slat is plumb, adjusting as needed. Drill pilot holes through the slat into the rails to prevent splitting, then secure the slat with screws at each rail intersection. Measure and mark consistent spacing for the next slat, typically a few inches apart, to ensure a uniform look. Repeat the process for each slat, checking alignment and spacing regularly.
