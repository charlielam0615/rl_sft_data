**Problem Statement**: I am in a room with various furniture items, including multiple drawers, sidetables, a sofa, an armchair, a garbage can, a dresser, and a cabinet. My task is to find two remote controls and place them in the armchair.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To achieve the goal of finding two remote controls and placing them in the armchair, I will break it down into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Search for the remote controls in likely locations (drawers, sidetables, sofa, etc.).  
2. Collect two remote controls once found.  
3. Place the collected remote controls in the armchair.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to search for the remote controls in likely locations. I will achieve this by systematically checking furniture items where remote controls are commonly found, such as drawers and sidetables, starting with drawer 1.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I will begin by opening and checking drawer 1 for any remote controls.  
*Action*: Open drawer 1 and inspect its contents.  
*Result*: Drawer 1 contains no remote controls.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)  
Since drawer 1 had no remote controls, I will adjust the subgoal to continue searching other furniture items. The next logical step is to check additional drawers and sidetables, as these are common places for remote controls. I will proceed to check drawer 2 next.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to continue searching for remote controls. I will achieve this by checking drawer 2 for any remote controls.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
*Action*: Open drawer 2 and inspect its contents.  
*Result*: Drawer 2 contains one remote control. I will take the remote control and keep it with me.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find two remote controls and place them in the armchair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Search for remote controls in likely locations (in progress).  
    - Checked drawer 1: No remote controls.  
    - Checked drawer 2: Found one remote control (currently holding).  
  - Subgoal 2: Collect two remote controls (one found, need one more).  
  - Subgoal 3: Place the collected remote controls in the armchair (not started).  
**Current Goal**: Continue searching for the second remote control.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the second remote control. I will achieve this by checking sidetable 1, as sidetables are another likely location for remote controls.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
*Action*: Inspect sidetable 1 for any remote controls.  
*Result*: Sidetable 1 contains one remote control. I will take the second remote control.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find two remote controls and place them in the armchair.  
  - Subgoal 1: Search for remote controls in likely locations (completed).  
    - Checked drawer 1: No remote controls.  
    - Checked drawer 2: Found one remote control.  
    - Checked sidetable 1: Found one remote control.  
  - Subgoal 2: Collect two remote controls (completed, holding two remote controls).  
  - Subgoal 3: Place the collected remote controls in the armchair (next step).  
**Current Goal**: Place the two remote controls in the armchair.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to place the two collected remote controls in the armchair. I will achieve this by moving to the armchair and placing both remote controls on it.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
*Action*: Move to armchair 1 and place the two remote controls on it.  
*Result*: Both remote controls are now placed on armchair 1. The task is complete.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The task is completed. I found one remote control in drawer 2 and another in sidetable 1, and I placed both remote controls on armchair 1.
