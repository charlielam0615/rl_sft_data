**Problem Restatement:** You are in a room with various objects: safe 1, shelf 4, drawer 2, bed 1, drawer 1, shelf 5, shelf 2, sidetable 2, shelf 3, drawer 3, shelf 1, sidetable 1, desk 1, and garbagecan 1. Your task is to examine an alarm clock with the desk lamp.

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To examine the alarm clock with the desk lamp, break down the task into intermediate subgoals:
1. Locate the alarm clock in the room.
2. Locate the desk lamp in the room.
3. Bring the alarm clock and desk lamp together if they are not already in the same location.
4. Use the desk lamp to examine the alarm clock.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Locate the alarm clock in the room.
Approach: Systematically search likely locations such as the desk, sidetables, bed, and shelves, as these are common places for an alarm clock.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Start by checking the desk, as it is a common place for an alarm clock. Examine desk 1 for the presence of an alarm clock. If not found, proceed to check sidetable 1, sidetable 2, and the bed, as these are also typical spots. Then, inspect shelves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as the alarm clock might be placed there for storage or display. Check drawers 1, 2, and 3 last, as they are less likely but possible locations.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Locate the desk lamp in the room.
Approach: Search the desk first, as desk lamps are typically found there, then check sidetables and shelves for any misplaced or alternative placements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Begin by examining desk 1, as it is the most likely location for a desk lamp. If not found, check sidetable 1 and sidetable 2, as lamps are sometimes placed there for convenience. Then, inspect shelves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as a desk lamp might be stored or misplaced on a shelf.

Goal-Management System:
- Main Goal: Examine the alarm clock with the desk lamp
  - Subgoal 1: Locate the alarm clock in the room
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the desk lamp in the room
  - Subgoal 3: Bring the alarm clock and desk lamp together if they are not already in the same location
  - Subgoal 4: Use the desk lamp to examine the alarm clock
Current Goal: Locate the alarm clock and desk lamp in the room (Subgoals 1 and 2 in progress).
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Bring the alarm clock and desk lamp together if they are not already in the same location.
Approach: If the alarm clock and desk lamp are found in different locations, pick up the alarm clock and move it to the desk lamp’s location, or vice versa, depending on which is more practical to move.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Assuming the alarm clock is found (e.g., on sidetable 1) and the desk lamp is found (e.g., on desk 1), carefully pick up the alarm clock from sidetable 1. Move to desk 1, ensuring the alarm clock is handled gently to avoid damage. Place the alarm clock next to the desk lamp on desk 1, ensuring both are stable and accessible for examination.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Use the desk lamp to examine the alarm clock.
Approach: Turn on the desk lamp to illuminate the alarm clock, then inspect the alarm clock’s features, condition, and functionality under the light.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Ensure the desk lamp is plugged in and functional. Turn on the desk lamp to direct light onto the alarm clock. Examine the alarm clock closely, checking for details such as the time display, buttons, alarm settings, and any signs of damage or wear. Adjust the lamp’s position if needed to better illuminate specific areas of the alarm clock. Test the alarm clock’s functionality, such as setting the time or alarm, if possible, to confirm it works properly.
