**Meta-data:**

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a vase, I will systematically check the shelves first, as they are common locations for decorative items. The room contains shelves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Assuming a visual scan, I inspect shelf 1 and find a vase on it. Since the goal is to find a vase, this step is complete.
