**Problem Restatement:** I am in the middle of a room surrounded by various objects including a safe, multiple shelves, drawers, a bed, sidetables, a desk, and a garbage can. My task is to examine an alarm clock using a desk lamp. I need to locate both the alarm clock and the desk lamp among the items in the room and then use the lamp to assist in examining the clock.

**Step 1:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning Category)  
I will break down the main goal of examining the alarm clock with the desk lamp into smaller, manageable subgoals. First, I need to locate the alarm clock in the room. Second, I need to locate the desk lamp. Third, I need to ensure that the desk lamp is functional or positioned in a way that it can be used to illuminate the alarm clock. Finally, I will use the lamp’s light to examine the alarm clock closely for any details or features.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Locate the alarm clock in the room.  
How to Achieve: I will systematically search the room by checking areas where an alarm clock is likely to be placed, such as near the bed on a sidetable or on the desk. I will start with the sidetables and desk since these are common locations for alarm clocks.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I begin my search by walking over to sidetable 1, which is near the bed, as alarm clocks are often placed beside beds for easy access. I look on the surface of sidetable 1 but do not see an alarm clock. Next, I check sidetable 2, carefully scanning the top and any shelves it might have, but again, I find no alarm clock. I then move to the desk, as desks are another logical place for an alarm clock. Upon inspecting desk 1, I notice an alarm clock sitting on the corner of the desk. I have successfully located the alarm clock.

**Step 3:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Locate the desk lamp in the room.  
How to Achieve: I will search for the desk lamp, focusing on the desk first since it is a common location for desk lamps. If it’s not there, I will check other surfaces like shelves or sidetables where a lamp might be placed for lighting purposes.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Since I am already at desk 1 where I found the alarm clock, I look around the desk surface for a desk lamp. I see a desk lamp positioned near the edge of the desk, likely used for studying or reading. I have successfully located the desk lamp.

**Step 4:**

[REVIEW]  
Goal Management System:  
- Main Goal: Examine the alarm clock with the desk lamp.  
  - Subgoal 1: Locate the alarm clock (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Locate the desk lamp (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Ensure the desk lamp is functional or positioned correctly.  
  - Subgoal 4: Use the desk lamp to examine the alarm clock.  

Current Goal: Ensure the desk lamp is functional or positioned correctly.  
I am maintaining a clear hierarchy of goals to stay focused on the next steps. Both the alarm clock and desk lamp have been located, so I now need to verify the lamp’s functionality or adjust its position to illuminate the alarm clock effectively.

**Step 5:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Ensure the desk lamp is functional or positioned correctly.  
How to Achieve: I will check if the desk lamp is plugged in and turned on. If it is not in a suitable position to illuminate the alarm clock, I will adjust its angle or move it closer to the clock.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I approach the desk lamp on desk 1 and check if it is plugged into a power source. I see that it is plugged in. I then press the power button or switch to turn it on, and the lamp lights up, confirming it is functional. I notice that the lamp’s light is not directly shining on the alarm clock, so I adjust the lamp’s arm to angle the light towards the alarm clock. The alarm clock is now well-lit under the desk lamp’s illumination.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6:**  
[PLANNING]  
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation Category)  
Current Goal: Use the desk lamp to examine the alarm clock.  
How to Achieve: With the desk lamp now illuminating the alarm clock, I will closely inspect the clock for any details such as the time displayed, buttons, or any visible features or damages.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
I stand near desk 1 and lean in to examine the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp. The light clearly highlights the face of the clock, showing the current time as 3:45. I observe the buttons on the top, likely for setting the time and alarm. There is also a small switch on the side, possibly for turning the alarm on or off. I notice no visible damage or irregularities on the clock. The examination is complete, and I have gathered all necessary details about the alarm clock using the desk lamp.
