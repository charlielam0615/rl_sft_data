### Problem Restatement
The task is to schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, ensuring the meeting fits within their available time slots based on their existing schedules:
- **George**: Busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- **Hannah**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30.
- **Ian**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
We need to find a one-hour time slot where all three participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the scheduling problem, break it down into the following subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.  
3. Validate the solution or determine if no such slot exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window. This will be achieved by listing the time periods when each participant is not busy, based on their given schedules.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Calculate the available time slots for each participant by subtracting their busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window:

- **George’s busy times**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00  
  **Available slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  

- **Hannah’s busy times**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30  
  **Available slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00  

- **Ian’s busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
  **Available slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are available. This will be achieved by comparing the available time slots from the previous step to identify common periods that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare the available slots to find overlaps:  

- **George’s available slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- **Hannah’s available slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00  
- **Ian’s available slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  

**Step-by-step overlap analysis**:  
1. **9:00–9:30**: George and Hannah are available, but Ian is busy (9:00–9:30). No overlap.  
2. **9:30–10:00**: Hannah is available, but George and Ian are busy (9:30–10:30 and 9:00–9:30). No overlap.  
3. **10:30–11:00**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
4. **11:00–11:30**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
5. **11:30–12:00**: George is available, but Ian is busy (11:30–12:30), and Hannah is available. No overlap.  
6. **12:30–13:00**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (until 13:30). No overlap.  
7. **13:00–13:30**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
8. **13:30–14:30**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
9. **14:30–15:30**: George and Hannah are available, but Ian is busy (14:30–15:30). No overlap.  
10. **15:30–16:30**: George and Ian are available, but Hannah is busy (15:30–16:30). No overlap.  
11. **16:30–17:00**: All three are available (George: 13:00–17:00, Hannah: 16:30–17:00, Ian: 15:30–17:00).  

The only overlapping period is **16:30–17:00**, but this is only 30 minutes, which is less than the required one-hour duration.  

No one-hour time slot exists where all three participants are available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the conclusion that no one-hour time slot exists is correct. This will be achieved by rechecking the overlap analysis to ensure no periods were missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Recheck the available slots and overlaps:  
- The available slots were correctly identified in Step 2.  
- The overlap analysis in Step 3 systematically checked all possible time periods within 9:00–17:00.  
- The only common period (16:30–17:00) is confirmed to be 30 minutes, which does not meet the one-hour requirement.  
- No other continuous one-hour period exists where all three participants are free, as their busy times interleave in a way that blocks all possible one-hour windows.  

The conclusion that no one-hour time slot exists is valid.

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the conclusion (completed, confirmed no slot exists).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by explaining why no solution exists.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to provide a detailed explanation of why no one-hour meeting slot exists. This will be achieved by summarizing the findings from the overlap analysis and validation steps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot exists for the meeting because:  
- The available time slots for George (9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00), Hannah (9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00), and Ian (9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00) do not overlap for any continuous one-hour period.  
- The only common availability is from 16:30–17:00, which is only 30 minutes and does not meet the one-hour requirement.  
- The participants’ busy periods (e.g., Hannah’s 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30, Ian’s 11:30–12:30 and 14:30–15:30, and George’s 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00) interleave in a way that blocks all possible one-hour windows within 9:00–17:00.  

**Conclusion**: It is impossible to schedule a one-hour meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that fits the schedules of George, Hannah, and Ian.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot is available for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The only common availability is 16:30–17:00, which is only 30 minutes. Their busy periods (George: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00; Hannah: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30; Ian: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) interleave, preventing any one-hour overlap.
