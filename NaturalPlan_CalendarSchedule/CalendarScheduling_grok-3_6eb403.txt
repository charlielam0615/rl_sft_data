**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Zack is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30; Amy is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Brian is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify available time slots and find the earliest 30-minute window where Zack, Amy, and Brian are all free.  
**How to Achieve:** List the busy time slots for Zack and Amy, since Brian is free all day. Divide the day (9:00–17:00) into 30-minute intervals and check each interval against the busy times to find common availability. Select the earliest slot that works for all.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time, let’s analyze the schedules and identify free 30-minute slots between 9:00 and 17:00:  

- **Zack’s busy times:** 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30  
- **Amy’s busy times:** 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00  
- **Brian’s busy times:** None (free all day)  

Divide the day into 30-minute intervals:  
9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:00–14:30, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00  

Check each interval for availability:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Zack is busy, Amy is free, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **10:00–10:30**: Zack is free, Amy is busy, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **10:30–11:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **11:00–11:30**: Zack is busy, Amy is free, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **12:30–13:00**: Zack is free, Amy is busy, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **13:30–14:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **14:00–14:30**: Zack is busy, Amy is free, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **14:30–15:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **15:00–15:30**: Zack is free, Amy is busy, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **15:30–16:00**: Zack is free, Amy is busy, Brian is free → Not available.  
- **16:00–16:30**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  
- **16:30–17:00**: Zack is free, Amy is free, Brian is free → Available.  

Available slots: 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  

The earliest available slot is **9:30–10:00**.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the selected time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that 9:30–10:00 is within 9:00–17:00, is exactly 30 minutes, and does not overlap with any busy times for Zack, Amy, or Brian.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time window check:** 9:30–10:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Duration check:** 9:30–10:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
- **Zack’s availability:** Zack is busy 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30. No overlap with 9:30–10:00.  
- **Amy’s availability:** Amy is busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00. No overlap with 9:30–10:00.  
- **Brian’s availability:** Brian is free all day, so 9:30–10:00 is fine.  

The slot 9:30–10:00 satisfies all constraints.
