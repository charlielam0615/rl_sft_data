**Problem Statement:** Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Clara is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30. Daniel is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-16:00. Eve is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that works for all participants.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00-17:00).  
2. Determine the busy periods for Clara and Daniel.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots for Clara, Daniel, and Eve.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots within 9:00-17:00 and determine the busy periods for Clara and Daniel.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the work hours as 30-minute intervals, mark the busy periods for Clara and Daniel, and note that Eve is available all day.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The work hours from 9:00 to 17:00 can be divided into 30-minute intervals:  
9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

**Clara’s busy periods:**  
- 9:00-9:30  
- 11:00-11:30  
- 14:00-14:30  

**Daniel’s busy periods:**  
- 10:00-10:30  
- 12:30-13:00  
- 15:00-16:00  

**Eve’s schedule:** Available all day.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping free time slots for Clara, Daniel, and Eve.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare Clara’s and Daniel’s busy periods against the 30-minute intervals to identify slots where both are free. Since Eve is available all day, the solution depends only on Clara and Daniel’s availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Mark the busy intervals:  
- 9:00-9:30: Clara busy  
- 10:00-10:30: Daniel busy  
- 11:00-11:30: Clara busy  
- 12:30-13:00: Daniel busy  
- 14:00-14:30: Clara busy  
- 15:00-15:30: Daniel busy  
- 15:30-16:00: Daniel busy  

Available intervals where both Clara and Daniel are free:  
- 9:30-10:00  
- 10:30-11:00  
- 11:30-12:00  
- 12:00-12:30  
- 13:00-13:30  
- 13:30-14:00  
- 14:30-15:00  
- 16:00-16:30  
- 16:30-17:00  

Since Eve is free all day, these slots are valid for all participants.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
- **How to Achieve:** From the list of available slots, choose the earliest one that is 30 minutes long and fits within 9:00-17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The available slots are:  
- 9:30-10:00  
- 10:30-11:00  
- 11:30-12:00  
- 12:00-12:30  
- 13:00-13:30  
- 13:30-14:00  
- 14:30-15:00  
- 16:00-16:30  
- 16:30-17:00  

The earliest slot is **9:30-10:00**. This satisfies the 30-minute duration and the preference for the earliest availability.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the selected time slot (9:30-10:00) is valid for all participants.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the selected slot against Clara’s, Daniel’s, and Eve’s schedules to confirm no conflicts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Clara:** Busy at 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30. The slot 9:30-10:00 is free.  
- **Daniel:** Busy at 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00. The slot 9:30-10:00 is free.  
- **Eve:** Available all day, so 9:30-10:00 is free.  

The slot 9:30-10:00 has no conflicts and is valid for all participants.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00-17:00. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine busy periods for Clara and Daniel. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots for all participants. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot. (Completed)  

**Current Goal:** Schedule the meeting at 9:30-10:00, as it has been validated as the earliest available slot.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:** The meeting can be scheduled for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**. This is the earliest 30-minute slot where all participants are available, satisfying all constraints.
