**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Patricia is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30. Quentin is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00. Rachel is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time window (9:00–17:00) and the required meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant (Patricia and Quentin) and confirm Rachel’s full availability.  
3. Find the earliest 30-minute slot where all participants are free by analyzing the combined schedules.  
4. Validate the selected time slot to ensure it meets all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the earliest 30-minute time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel are all available.  
- **How to Achieve:** Combine the busy schedules of Patricia and Quentin, determine free time slots, and select the earliest 30-minute slot that fits within the work hours, considering Rachel’s full availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find the earliest available 30-minute slot, we first outline the busy times:  
- **Patricia’s busy slots:** 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.  
- **Quentin’s busy slots:** 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00.  
- **Rachel:** Available all day (9:00–17:00).  

Since Rachel is free all day, we focus on finding a 30-minute slot where both Patricia and Quentin are available. We list all busy slots in chronological order:  
- 9:00–9:30 (Patricia)  
- 10:00–10:30 (Quentin)  
- 11:00–11:30 (Patricia)  
- 12:30–13:00 (Quentin)  
- 14:00–14:30 (Patricia)  
- 15:30–16:00 (Quentin)  

Now, we identify the free 30-minute slots between 9:00 and 17:00 by examining gaps between these busy periods:  
- **9:30–10:00**: 30 minutes, both free (after Patricia’s 9:00–9:30, before Quentin’s 10:00–10:30).  
- **10:30–11:00**: 30 minutes, both free (after Quentin’s 10:00–10:30, before Patricia’s 11:00–11:30).  
- **11:30–12:30**: 60 minutes, both free (after Patricia’s 11:00–11:30, before Quentin’s 12:30–13:00).  
- **13:00–14:00**: 60 minutes, both free (after Quentin’s 12:30–13:00, before Patricia’s 14:00–14:30).  
- **14:30–15:30**: 60 minutes, both free (after Patricia’s 14:00–14:30, before Quentin’s 15:30–16:00).  
- **16:00–17:00**: 60 minutes, both free (after Quentin’s 15:30–16:00, until end of workday).  

The earliest available 30-minute slot is **9:30–10:00**, as it comes immediately after Patricia’s first meeting and before Quentin’s first busy slot.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm that the selected time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check that 9:30–10:00 does not overlap with any busy slots for Patricia or Quentin and fits within the 9:00–17:00 work hours, while ensuring Rachel is available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The selected slot is 9:30–10:00. We verify:  
- **Patricia**: Busy at 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30. The slot 9:30–10:00 is free (ends before 11:00).  
- **Quentin**: Busy at 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00. The slot 9:30–10:00 is free (ends at 10:00, when Quentin’s meeting starts).  
- **Rachel**: Free all day, so 9:30–10:00 is available.  
- **Constraints**: The slot is 30 minutes long and within 9:00–17:00.  

The slot 9:30–10:00 satisfies all constraints and is the earliest available time.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify the time window and meeting duration (completed: 9:00–17:00, 30 minutes).  
  - **Subgoal 2**: List busy time slots for all participants (completed: Patricia and Quentin’s schedules listed, Rachel fully available).  
  - **Subgoal 3**: Find the earliest 30-minute slot where all are free (completed: 9:30–10:00 identified).  
  - **Subgoal 4**: Validate the selected time slot (completed: 9:30–10:00 confirmed valid).  

**Current Goal**: The scheduling task is complete, as a valid time slot (9:30–10:00) has been identified and validated.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute slot where Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel are all available.
