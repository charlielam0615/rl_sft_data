**Problem Statement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules and prioritizing the earliest possible time. Olivia is free all day, Peter is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Quinn is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute window.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: List all participants’ unavailable time slots and identify available 30-minute windows.  
**How to Achieve**: Compile the busy time slots for Peter and Quinn (since Olivia is free all day), then identify 30-minute windows within 9:00–17:00 where no participant has a conflict.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Olivia’s Schedule**: Free all day (9:00–17:00).  
- **Peter’s Busy Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
- **Quinn’s Busy Slots**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  

**Available Windows**:  
Break the day (9:00–17:00) into 30-minute intervals and check for conflicts:  
- 9:00–9:30: Peter is busy (9:00–10:00).  
- 9:30–10:00: Peter is busy (9:00–10:00).  
- 10:00–10:30: Quinn is busy (10:00–10:30).  
- 10:30–11:00: Free for all.  
- 11:00–11:30: Free for all.

- 12:30–13:00: Quinn is busy (12:30–13:00).  
- 13:00–13:30: Free for all.  
- 13:30–14:00: Free for all.  
- 14:00–14:30: Peter is busy (14:00–15:00).  
- 14:30–15:00: Peter is busy (14:00–15:00).  
- 15:00–15:30: Free for all.  
- 15:30–16:00: Quinn is busy (15:30–16:30).  
- 16:00–16:30: Quinn is busy (15:30–16:30).  
- 16:30–17:00: Free for all.  

**Available 30-minute slots**: 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest available 30-minute window for the meeting.  
**How to Achieve**: From the list of available windows, choose the earliest one that satisfies the 30-minute duration and all participants’ availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the available windows (10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00), the earliest is **10:30–11:00**.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) is free for all participants and meets the 30-minute requirement.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the 10:30–11:00 slot against each participant’s busy schedule.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Olivia**: Free all day, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Peter**: Busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00; 10:30–11:00 is outside these times, so free.  
- **Quinn**: Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30; 10:30–11:00 is outside these times, so free.  
- **Duration**: 10:30–11:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  

The slot **10:30–11:00** is valid for all participants and meets the duration requirement.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List unavailable time slots and find available 30-minute windows (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest available window (completed: 10:30–11:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected time slot (completed: 10:30–11:00 is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time as 10:30–11:00, as it satisfies all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **10:30 to 11:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute window where Olivia, Peter, and Quinn are all available.
