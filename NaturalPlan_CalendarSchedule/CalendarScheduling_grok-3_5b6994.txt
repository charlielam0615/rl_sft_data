**Problem Statement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Aaron is busy from 9:00-10:00, 12:00-13:00, and 15:00-16:00.
- Bella is busy from 10:30-11:30 and 13:30-14:30.
- Caleb is busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:30-13:30, and 14:30-15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00-17:00).  
2. List each participant's busy and free time slots.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
4. Verify if a valid one-hour slot exists or determine why none exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** List each participant's busy and free time slots within 9:00-17:00.  
**How to Achieve:** Analyze the given schedules, convert busy times to free times, and represent the day in hourly or half-hourly intervals for clarity.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the subgoal, calculate the free time slots for each participant based on their busy schedules within 9:00-17:00:

- **Aaron**:
  - Busy: 9:00-10:00, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00.
  - Free: 10:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.

- **Bella**:
  - Busy: 10:30-11:30, 13:30-14:30.
  - Free: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-13:30, 14:30-17:00.

- **Caleb**:
  - Busy: 9:30-10:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-15:30.
  - Free: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.

Break the day into half-hour intervals to align schedules and identify free slots:
- 9:00-9:30: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
- 9:30-10:00: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 10:00-10:30: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 10:30-11:00: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free).
- 11:00-11:30: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free).
- 11:30-12:00: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
- 12:00-12:30: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
- 12:30-13:00: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 13:00-13:30: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 13:30-14:00: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free).
- 14:00-14:30: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free).
- 14:30-15:00: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 15:00-15:30: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (busy).
- 15:30-16:00: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
- 16:00-16:30: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
- 16:30-17:00: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free).
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
**How to Achieve:** Identify consecutive half-hour intervals where all participants are free, ensuring at least two consecutive intervals (one hour).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, the half-hour intervals where all participants are free are:
- 11:30-12:00: All free.
- 16:00-16:30: All free.
- 16:30-17:00: All free.

Check for one-hour consecutive slots:
- **11:30-12:30**: 11:30-12:00 (all free), but 12:00-12:30 (Aaron busy). Not a full hour.
- **16:00-17:00**: 16:00-16:30 (all free), 16:30-17:00 (all free). This forms a one-hour slot.

Thus, a potential one-hour meeting slot is **16:00-17:00**.
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify if the 16:00-17:00 slot is valid and check for other possible slots.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm the slot against all busy schedules and ensure no other one-hour slots were missed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify **16:00-17:00**:
- Aaron: Free (16:00-17:00).
- Bella: Free (14:30-17:00).
- Caleb: Free (15:30-17:00).
This slot satisfies all constraints.

Check for other possible one-hour slots:
- **11:30-12:30**: Fails because Aaron is busy 12:00-12:30.
- Other intervals (e.g., 9:00-10:00, 13:00-14:00) have at least one participant busy, as seen in the interval breakdown.

No other consecutive one-hour slots exist where all are free.
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00-17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00-17:00 (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: List each participant's busy and free time slots (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Verify if a valid one-hour slot exists (completed).

**Current Goal:** Conclude the scheduling process with the identified time slot.

**Summary:** The goal hierarchy is complete, with all subgoals addressed. The identified slot (16:00-17:00) has been validated.
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer:**
A suitable time for the one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday is **16:00-17:00**. This slot satisfies all scheduling constraints, as all participants are free during this period. No other one-hour slots are available due to overlapping busy times in other intervals.
