### Problem Statement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Wendy is busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00
- Xavier is busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00
- Yvonne is busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30
Find a time slot that works for all participants. If no such slot exists, explain why.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the scheduling problem, break it down into subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping free time slots among all participants that can accommodate a one-hour meeting.
3. Validate the solution or determine if no such slot exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.
How to Achieve: List the busy time slots for each participant, then determine their free time slots by excluding the busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Wendy’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Xavier’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **Yvonne’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find overlapping free time slots among all participants that can accommodate a one-hour meeting.
How to Achieve: Compare the free time slots of Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne to identify common periods of at least one hour within 9:00–17:00.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time slot, we need a one-hour period where all participants are free. Let’s compare the free time slots:
- **Wendy’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Xavier’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **Yvonne’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

Now, identify overlaps:
- **9:00–9:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). **No overlap**.
- **9:30–10:00**: Wendy (busy), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.
- **10:00–10:30**: Wendy (busy), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.
- **10:30–11:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.
- **11:00–11:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). **Overlap**, but only 30 minutes (insufficient for a one-hour meeting).
- **11:30–12:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). **No overlap**.
- **12:00–12:30**: Wendy (busy), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). **No overlap**.
- **12:30–13:00**: Wendy (busy), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.
- **13:00–13:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). **Overlap**, but only 30 minutes (insufficient).
- **13:30–14:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.
- **14:30–15:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). **No overlap**.
- **15:30–16:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). **Overlap**, but only 30 minutes (insufficient).
- **16:00–17:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). **No overlap**.

No one-hour overlapping free slot exists.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate whether there is a one-hour time slot where all participants are free, or confirm that no such slot exists.
How to Achieve: Re-examine the overlapping periods and check for any missed opportunities or errors in the analysis.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The overlapping free periods identified are:
- 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes)
- 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes)
- 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes)

All overlaps are less than one hour. To confirm, let’s ensure no one-hour continuous slot was missed:
- The work hours (9:00–17:00) are fully covered by breaking the day into half-hour segments and checking each.
- No single hour-long period (e.g., 9:00–10:00, 10:00–11:00, etc.) has all three participants free, as at least one is busy in each possible one-hour window.

The analysis confirms no one-hour slot satisfies the constraints.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour free slots (completed, no valid slot found).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution or confirm no solution exists (completed, no solution exists).

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by reporting the result.

No one-hour time slot was found where all participants are free, so the task requires reporting why no solution exists.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Provide a final answer with a detailed explanation of why no one-hour meeting slot exists.
How to Achieve: Summarize the free time slots, overlapping periods, and the reason no one-hour slot satisfies the constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Final Answer**: No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne.

**Explanation**:
- **Wendy’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Xavier’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **Yvonne’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00
- **Overlapping Free Slots**:
  - 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes)
  - 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes)
  - 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes)
- All overlapping periods are only 30 minutes long, which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting.
- Every possible one-hour slot between 9:00 and 17:00 has at least one participant busy, as their busy periods cover different parts of the day, leaving no continuous one-hour window where all are free.

Thus, due to the conflicting schedules, no feasible time slot exists for the meeting.
