### Problem Statement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Liam is free all day, Mia has meetings from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Noah is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time constraints (work hours: 9:00–17:00).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify each participant’s unavailable time slots and determine their available times within 9:00–17:00.  
**How to Achieve**: Collect the busy times for Mia and Noah (Liam is free all day), and calculate the time slots where none of them are busy.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Liam’s Schedule**: Free from 9:00–17:00.  
- **Mia’s Busy Times**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
  - **Mia’s Available Times**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Noah’s Busy Times**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
  - **Noah’s Available Times**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
Since Liam is free all day, we focus on finding time slots where both Mia and Noah are available.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping available time slots for Mia and Noah within 9:00–17:00 that can accommodate a 30-minute meeting.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare Mia’s and Noah’s available time slots to identify periods where both are free for at least 30 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Mia’s Available Slots**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Noah’s Available Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Overlapping Slots**:  
  - 10:00–11:30 (Mia) and 10:30–12:30 (Noah) → Overlap: 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes).  
  - 12:00–14:00 (Mia) and 13:00–15:30 (Noah) → Overlap: 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes).  
  - 15:00–17:00 (Mia) and 16:30–17:00 (Noah) → Overlap: 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes).  
All overlapping slots are at least 30 minutes long and thus viable for the meeting.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the overlapping available slots.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the overlapping slots identified and choose the one that starts earliest within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Overlapping slots: 10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 16:30–17:00.  
- Earliest slot: 10:30–11:30 (starts at 10:30).  
- A 30-minute meeting can be scheduled from 10:30–11:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation (Implementation)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) satisfies all constraints for Liam, Mia, and Noah.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the selected slot against each participant’s busy times to ensure no conflicts exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Selected Slot**: 10:30–11:00.  
- **Liam**: Free all day → No conflict.  
- **Mia**: Busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00 → 10:30–11:00 is free (within 10:00–11:30).  
- **Noah**: Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30 → 10:30–11:00 is free (within 10:30–12:30).  
The slot 10:30–11:00 is valid as it does not overlap with any participant’s busy times.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals (Review)

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify time constraints and participants’ unavailable slots.  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping available time slots.  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest 30-minute slot.  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected slot.  
**Current Goal**: Completed—validate the selected time slot (10:30–11:00).  
The proposed time slot has been validated, and all subgoals are complete.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The earliest available time to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday is **10:30–11:00**. This slot satisfies all constraints, as Liam is free all day, Mia is available from 10:00–11:30, and Noah is available from 10:30–12:30.
