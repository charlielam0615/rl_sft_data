**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Clara is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00; Daniel is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30; Eve is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Identify a time slot that accommodates all participants or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
2. Find overlapping available time slots for all three participants.  
3. Select a one-hour time slot that fits within the overlapping availability.  
4. If no overlapping slot exists, analyze conflicts to explain why.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for Clara, Daniel, and Eve within 9:00–17:00 on Monday. This will be achieved by listing their busy times and determining the gaps where they are free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Clara’s schedule**: Busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
  Available: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Daniel’s schedule**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30.  
  Available: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Eve’s schedule**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  Available: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all available. This will be achieved by comparing their available time slots and identifying any common one-hour periods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common time slot, we need a one-hour period where all three participants are available. Let’s compare their availability:  

- **Clara’s availability**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Daniel’s availability**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Eve’s availability**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

**Step-by-step comparison**:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Clara and Daniel are available, but Eve is busy.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Daniel and Eve are available, but Clara is busy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:00–10:30**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **10:30–11:00**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **11:00–11:30**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is only available starting at 11:00 (after 10:00–11:00), so this is a partial overlap, not a full hour.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Clara and Daniel are available, but Eve is busy (11:30–12:30).  
- **12:00–12:30**: Daniel and Eve are available, but Clara is busy (12:00–13:00).  
- **12:30–13:00**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is only available until 13:30, so we check further.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is only available until 13:30, not enough for a full hour.  
- **13:30–14:30**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is busy (13:30–14:30).  
- **14:30–15:30**: Clara and Daniel are available, but Eve is busy (14:30–15:30).  
- **15:30–16:30**: Clara and Eve are available, but Daniel is busy (15:30–16:30).  
- **16:30–17:00**: Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all available, but this is only a 30-minute window, not sufficient for a one-hour meeting.  

No one-hour time slot exists where all three are available.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: If no slot exists, explain why (in progress).  

**Current Goal**: Explain why no one-hour time slot exists for the meeting.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to explain why no one-hour time slot exists for the meeting. This will be achieved by summarizing the conflicts in the participants’ schedules that prevent a common one-hour slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot exists between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all available due to the following conflicts:  
- Early morning (9:00–9:30): Eve is busy.  
- Mid-morning (9:30–11:00): Either Clara or Daniel is busy.  
- Late morning (11:00–12:30): Eve is busy during 11:30–12:30, and Clara is busy during 12:00–13:00, limiting overlaps to less than an hour.  
- Early afternoon (12:30–15:30): Daniel is busy from 13:30–14:30, and Eve is busy from 14:30–15:30, preventing a full hour of overlap.  
- Late afternoon (15:30–17:00): Daniel is busy from 15:30–16:30, and the remaining 16:30–17:00 window is only 30 minutes.  

The participants’ busy periods are staggered such that no continuous one-hour period satisfies all availability constraints.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: No one-hour time slot exists between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all available. The staggered busy periods—Clara (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00), Daniel (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30), and Eve (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30)—prevent any continuous one-hour overlap. The longest common availability is 16:30–17:00, which is only 30 minutes.
