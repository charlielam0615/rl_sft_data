### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Clara: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- Daniel: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- Eve: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot where all participants are available for one hour. If no such slot exists, explain why.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. List each participant’s busy and free time slots.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
4. Validate the solution or explain why no solution exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to list each participant’s busy and free time slots within 9:00–17:00 on Monday. This will be achieved by analyzing the given schedules and determining the time periods when each participant is free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To determine free time slots, we first outline the busy periods and then derive the free periods within 9:00–17:00 for each participant:

- **Clara’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.

- **Daniel’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.

- **Eve’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

These free time slots represent the periods when each participant is available for the meeting.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long for Clara, Daniel, and Eve. This will be achieved by comparing their free time slots and identifying common periods that satisfy the one-hour duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time slot, we compare the free time slots of all participants and look for overlaps that are at least one hour long. Let’s analyze the free periods:

- **Clara’s free slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Daniel’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Eve’s free slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, we check for overlaps:

1. **9:00–9:30**:
   - Clara: Free (9:00–9:30).
   - Daniel: Free (9:00–10:00).
   - Eve: Busy (9:00–9:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Eve is busy).

2. **9:30–10:00**:
   - Clara: Busy (9:30–10:30).
   - Daniel: Free (9:00–10:00).
   - Eve: Free (9:30–11:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Clara is busy).

3. **10:00–10:30**:
   - Clara: Busy (9:30–10:30).
   - Daniel: Busy (10:00–11:00).
   - Eve: Free (9:30–11:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Clara and Daniel are busy).

4. **10:30–11:00**:
   - Clara: Free (10:30–12:00).
   - Daniel: Busy (10:00–11:00).
   - Eve: Free (9:30–11:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Daniel is busy).

5. **11:00–11:30**:
   - Clara: Free (10:30–12:00).
   - Daniel: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Eve: Free (9:30–11:30).
   - **Result**: Overlap from 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes, too short).

6. **11:30–12:00**:
   - Clara: Free (10:30–12:00).
   - Daniel: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Eve: Busy (11:30–12:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Eve is busy).

7. **12:00–12:30**:
   - Clara: Busy (12:00–13:00).
   - Daniel: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Eve: Busy (11:30–12:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Clara and Eve are busy).

8. **12:30–13:00**:
   - Clara: Busy (12:00–13:00).
   - Daniel: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Eve: Free (12:30–14:30).
   - **Result**: No overlap (Clara is busy).

9. **13:00–13:30**:
   - Clara: Free (13:00–15:00).
   - Daniel: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Eve: Free (12:30–14:30).
   - **Result**: Overlap from 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes, too short).

10. **13:30–14:30**:
    - Clara: Free (13:00–15:00).
    - Daniel: Busy (13:30–14:30).
    - Eve: Free (12:30–14:30).
    - **Result**: No overlap (Daniel is busy).

11. **14:30–15:00**:
    - Clara: Free (13:00–15:00).
    - Daniel: Free (14:30–17:00).
    - Eve: Busy (14:30–15:30).
    - **Result**: No overlap (Eve is busy).

12. **15:00–15:30**:
    - Clara: Busy (15:00–16:00).
    - Daniel: Free (14:30–17:00).
    - Eve: Busy (14:30–15:30).
    - **Result**: No overlap (Clara and Eve are busy).

13. **15:30–16:00**:
    - Clara: Busy (15:00–16:00).
    - Daniel: Free (14:30–17:00).
    - Eve: Free (15:30–17:00).
    - **Result**: No overlap (Clara is busy).

14. **16:00–17:00**:
    - Clara: Free (16:00–17:00).
    - Daniel: Free (14:30–17:00).
    - Eve: Free (15:30–17:00).
    - **Result**: Overlap from 16:00–17:00 (1 hour, sufficient).

The only overlapping time slot that is at least one hour long is **16:00–17:00**.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the identified time slot (16:00–17:00) satisfies all constraints, including the one-hour duration and the availability of all participants within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate the solution:
- **Time slot**: 16:00–17:00 (1 hour, meets the duration requirement).
- **Constraints**:
  - Within 9:00–17:00: Yes, 16:00–17:00 is within the work hours.
  - Clara: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00).
  - Daniel: Free from 14:30–17:00 (no conflict with 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30).
  - Eve: Free from 15:30–17:00 (no conflict with 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).
- **Conclusion**: The time slot 16:00–17:00 is valid as it satisfies the one-hour duration and all participants are available.

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
