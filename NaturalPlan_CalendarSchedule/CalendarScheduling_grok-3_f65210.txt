**Problem Statement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, considering their existing schedules. Liam is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30; Mia is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00; Noah is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and the required 30-minute duration.  
2. List all participants’ unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Recall Info
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Recall Info (Review)  
**Meta-data**: Retrieve the schedules of Liam, Mia, and Noah to identify their unavailable time slots, which will serve as the foundation for finding a common available time.  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
- Liam’s unavailable slots: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.  
- Mia’s unavailable slots: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00.  
- Noah’s schedule: Fully available from 9:00–17:00.  
The goal is to find a 30-minute window between 9:00 and 17:00 where none of these unavailable slots overlap.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify a 30-minute time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 where Liam, Mia, and Noah are all available.  
**How to Achieve**: Combine the unavailable slots from Liam and Mia (since Noah is free all day), identify free 30-minute windows, and select the earliest one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Unavailable slots**:  
  - Liam: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.  
  - Mia: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00.  
- **Merged unavailable slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:00–10:30, 11:00–11:30, 12:30–13:00, 14:00–14:30, 15:30–16:00.  
- **Available 30-minute windows** (between 9:00 and 17:00):  
  - 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 14:30–15:30, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Earliest available slot**: 9:30–10:00.  
The meeting can be scheduled from **9:30–10:00** on Monday, as all participants are available during this time.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the proposed 30-minute meeting time from 9:30–10:00 on Monday satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the proposed time against each participant’s schedule to ensure no conflicts exist.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Proposed time**: 9:30–10:00.  
- **Liam’s schedule**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30. No conflict at 9:30–10:00.  
- **Mia’s schedule**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00. No conflict at 9:30–10:00.  
- **Noah’s schedule**: Fully available. No conflict.  
- **Constraint check**: The meeting must be 30 minutes and within 9:00–17:00. The slot 9:30–10:00 is 30 minutes and falls within the work hours.  
The proposed time of **9:30–10:00** is valid and satisfies all constraints.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah between 9:00–17:00 on Monday at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute windows (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest available slot (completed: 9:30–10:00).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot (completed).  
**Current Goal**: None (all subgoals completed, meeting scheduled).  
The proposed meeting time of **9:30–10:00** on Monday has been validated and meets all requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled for **9:30–10:00** on Monday, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Liam, Mia, and Noah are all available.
