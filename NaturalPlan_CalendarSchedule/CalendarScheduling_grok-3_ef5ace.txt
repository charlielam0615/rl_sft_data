### Problem Restatement
I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules and aiming for the earliest possible time. Patricia is available all day. Quentin is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Rachel is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. If no time slot works, I must explain why.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List the available time slots for each participant based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots that are at least 30 minutes long.  
4. Select the earliest time slot that satisfies all constraints.  
5. Verify the solution or explain if no solution exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant and find a common 30-minute slot. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods, determining free periods within 9:00–17:00, and finding overlaps.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal, I will analyze the schedules:  
- **Patricia**: Available 9:00–17:00 (no constraints).  
- **Quentin**: Busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00. Free periods: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Rachel**: Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30. Free periods: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
Now, find overlapping free periods:  
- 9:00–10:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free) → Not available.  
- 10:00–10:30: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy) → Not available.  
- 10:30–11:30: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free) → Available (1 hour).  
- 11:30–12:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free) → Not available.  
- 12:00–12:30: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free) → Available (30 minutes).  
- 12:30–13:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy) → Not available.  
- 13:00–14:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free) → Available (1 hour).  
- 14:00–15:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free) → Not available.  
- 15:00–15:30: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free) → Available (30 minutes).  
- 15:30–16:30: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy) → Not available.  
- 16:30–17:00: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free) → Available (30 minutes).  
The earliest 30-minute slot is 10:30–11:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the 10:30–11:00 slot satisfies all constraints. This will be achieved by checking each participant’s availability during this time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Patricia**: Available 9:00–17:00, so free at 10:30–11:00.  
- **Quentin**: Free 10:00–11:30, so free at 10:30–11:00.  
- **Rachel**: Free 10:30–12:30, so free at 10:30–11:00.  
The slot 10:30–11:00 is valid for a 30-minute meeting.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest valid time slot (completed:listen).  
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solution (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time as 10:30–11:00, as it satisfies all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for **10:30–11:00 on Monday**, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot when Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel are all available.
