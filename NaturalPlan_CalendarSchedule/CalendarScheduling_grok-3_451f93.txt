**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Diana is free all day. Ethan is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Fiona is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping free time slots among all participants.  
3. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window. This will be achieved by listing each participant’s free periods based on their busy schedules.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Diana**: Free from 9:00–17:00 (entire day).  
- **Ethan**: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00. Free periods:  
  - 10:00–11:30  
  - 12:00–14:00  
  - 15:00–17:00  
- **Fiona**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30. Free periods:  
  - 9:00–10:00  
  - 10:30–12:30  
  - 13:00–15:30  
  - 16:30–17:00

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants (Diana, Ethan, Fiona) are free. This will be achieved by comparing their free periods and identifying common windows.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Compare free periods:  
- **Diana**: Free 9:00–17:00 (no restrictions).  
- **Ethan’s free periods**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Fiona’s free periods**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  

**Overlapping free periods**:  
- Between 9:00–10:00: Only Fiona is free; Ethan is busy.  
- Between 10:00–10:30: Ethan is free, but Fiona is busy.  
- Between 10:30–11:30: Both Ethan and Fiona are free (Diana is free all day).  
  - Possible slot: 10:30–11:00 or 11:00–11:30.  
- Between 11:30–12:00: Ethan is busy; Fiona is free.  
- Between 12:00–12:30: Both are free.  
  - Possible slot: 12:00–12:30.  
- Between 12:30–13:00: Fiona is busy; Ethan is free.  
- Between 13:00–14:00: Both are free.  
  - Possible slot: 13:00–13:30 or 13:30–14:00.  
- Between 14:00–15:00: Ethan is busy; Fiona is free.  
- Between 15:00–15:30: Both are free.  
  - Possible slot: 15:00–15:30.  
- Between 15:30–16:30: Fiona is busy; Ethan is free.  
- Between 16:30–17:00: Both are free.  
  - Possible slot: 16:30–17:00.  

**Possible 30-minute slots**: 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the identified overlapping periods that satisfies all constraints. This will be achieved by reviewing the list of possible slots and choosing the earliest one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the possible slots (10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00), the earliest is **10:30–11:00**.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) is feasible for all participants by checking against their busy schedules.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Diana**: Free all day, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Ethan**: Free from 10:00–11:30, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Fiona**: Free from 10:30–12:30, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
The slot 10:30–11:00 is valid for all participants.  
[/IMP]

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping free time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest 30-minute slot (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected slot (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time by confirming the validated slot.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The earliest 30-minute time slot that works for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona is **10:30–11:00** on Monday.
