**Problem Restatement**:  
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:  
- Aaron is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
- Bella is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.  
- Caleb is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.  
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. Determine each participant’s free time by excluding their busy periods.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
4. Validate the solution or explain if no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify each participant’s free time slots within 9:00–17:00.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb, then calculate their free periods by excluding busy times from the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Work hours**: 9:00–17:00 (8 hours total).  
- **Aaron’s busy periods**: 9:30–10:30 (1 hour), 12:00–13:00 (1 hour).  
  - Free periods: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Bella’s busy periods**: 10:00–11:00 (1 hour), 13:30–14:30 (1 hour), 16:00–17:00 (1 hour).  
  - Free periods: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Caleb’s busy periods**: 9:00–9:30 (0.5 hours), 11:30–12:30 (1 hour), 14:30–15:30 (1 hour).  
  - Free periods: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free periods of Aaron, Bella, and Caleb to identify overlapping intervals that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Aaron’s free periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Bella’s free periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Caleb’s free periods**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

Compare for overlaps:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Aaron and Bella are free, but Caleb is busy (9:00–9:30). No overlap.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Bella and Caleb are free, but Aaron is busy (9:30–10:30). No overlap.  
- **10:00–10:30**: Caleb is free, but Aaron (9:30–10:30) and Bella (10:00–11:00) are busy. No overlap.  
- **10:30–11:00**: Aaron and Caleb are free, but Bella is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
- **11:00–11:30**: Aaron and Caleb are free, but Bella is free only until 13:30, and this slot is only 30 minutes. No one-hour overlap.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Aaron is free, but Caleb is busy (11:30–12:30). No overlap.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Bella and Caleb are free, but Aaron is busy (12:00–13:00). No overlap.  
- **12:30–13:00**: Bella and Caleb are free, but Aaron is busy (12:00–13:00). No overlap.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are free (13:00–13:30 is within all free periods). This is only 30 minutes, not one hour.  
- **13:30–14:30**: Aaron and Caleb are free, but Bella is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
- **14:30–15:30**: Aaron and Bella are free, but Caleb is busy (14:30–15:30). No overlap.  
- **15:30–16:00**: Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are free (15:30–16:00 is within all free periods). This is only 30 minutes, not one hour.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Aaron and Caleb are free, but Bella is busy (16:00–17:00). No overlap.  

No one-hour slot is found where all participants are free.

**Step 4: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Confirm whether a one-hour slot exists or validate that no such slot is possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the overlapping periods and ensure calculations are correct, particularly focusing on boundary times and the one-hour requirement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate the overlaps:  
- The longest potential overlaps are 13:00–13:30 and 15:30–16:00, both 30 minutes, which do not meet the one-hour requirement.  
- All other time slots have at least one participant busy, as confirmed by the previous step.  
- The work hours (9:00–17:00) are constrained, and no continuous one-hour period satisfies all participants’ availability.  

**Conclusion**: No one-hour time slot exists where Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are all free. The primary reason is the conflicting busy periods: Aaron’s 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00, Bella’s 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00, and Caleb’s 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30 create gaps that prevent a continuous one-hour overlap.

  - Subgoal 2: Determine each participant’s free time (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots of at least one hour (completed, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution or confirm no solution exists (completed, no solution exists).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by confirming no solution exists and reporting the result.

**Final Answer**:  
No one-hour time slot is available on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are all free. The conflicting schedules—Aaron’s busy periods (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00), Bella’s busy periods (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00), and Caleb’s busy periods (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30)—prevent any continuous one-hour overlap. The longest potential overlaps (13:00–13:30 and 15:30–16:00) are only 30 minutes, which does not meet the one-hour requirement.
