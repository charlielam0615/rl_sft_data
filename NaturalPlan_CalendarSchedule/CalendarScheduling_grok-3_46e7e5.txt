**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Frank is available all day, Grace is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Henry is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
- **How to Achieve:** Analyze each participant’s schedule, list their unavailable times, and determine the time slots where they are free within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Frank’s Availability:** Frank is free from 9:00 to 17:00 (entire day).  
- **Grace’s Availability:** Grace is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Her available time slots are:  
  - 10:00–11:30  
  - 12:00–14:00  
  - 15:00–17:00  
- **Henry’s Availability:** Henry is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. His available time slots are:  
  - 9:00–10:00  
  - 10:30–12:30  
  - 13:00–15:30  
  - 16:30–17:00

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where Frank, Grace, and Henry are all available.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the available time slots from Step 2 to identify common 30-minute periods, ensuring the duration meets the 30-minute requirement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find overlapping slots, compare the available time periods:  
- **Frank:** Available 9:00–17:00 (no restrictions).  
- **Grace:** Available 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Henry:** Available 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  

**Overlapping Slots:**  
- From 9:00–10:00: Grace is busy (9:00–10:00), so this slot is not available.  
- From 10:00–11:30 (Grace’s slot): Henry is busy 10:00–10:30, so the overlap is 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes, sufficient for 30 minutes).  
- From 12:00–14:00 (Grace’s slot): Henry is busy 12:30–13:00, splitting the overlap into:  
  - 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes, sufficient).  
  - 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes, sufficient).  
- From 15:00–17:00 (Grace’s slot): Henry is busy 15:30–16:30, splitting the overlap into:  
  - 15:00–15:30 (30 minutes, sufficient).  
  - 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes, sufficient).  

**Valid 30-minute slots:** 10:30–11:00, 10:31–11:01, ..., 11:00–11:30 (sliding window in 10:30–11:30), 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:01–13:31, ..., 13:30–14:00 (sliding window in 13:00–14:00), 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

**Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
- **How to Achieve:** From the overlapping slots identified, choose the earliest 30-minute period that fits within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the valid slots identified in Step 3, the earliest 30-minute slot is **10:30–11:00**.  
- **Verification:**  
  - Frank: Available (entire day).  
  - Grace: Available 10:00–11:30 (covers 10:30–11:00).  
  - Henry: Available 10:30–12:30 (covers 10:30–11:00).  
This slot satisfies the 30-minute duration and is the earliest possible time.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) is valid for all participants and meets the duration requirement.  
- **How to Achieve:** Double-check the schedules to ensure no conflicts exist and confirm the slot duration is exactly 30 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Duration Check:** 10:30–11:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
- **Conflict Check:**  
  - Frank: Free all day, no conflict.  
  - Grace: Free 10:00–11:30, no conflict (10:30–11:00 is within this window).  
  - Henry: Free 10:30–12:30, no conflict (10:30–11:00 is within this window).  
The slot is valid with no scheduling conflicts.

- **Main Goal:** Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - **Subgoal 1:** Identify available time slots for each participant (completed in Step 2).  
  - **Subgoal 2:** Find overlapping 30-minute slots (completed in Step 3).  
  - **Subgoal 3:** Select the earliest valid slot (completed in Step 4).  
  - **Subgoal 4:** Validate the selected slot (completed in Step 5).  

**Current Goal:** Confirm the final schedule and provide the result.  
The proposed meeting time of 10:30–11:00 on Monday satisfies all constraints and is the earliest available slot.
