**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Rose is free all day, Simon is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Tara is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the time range for the meeting (9:00–17:00 on Monday).
2. List the unavailable time slots for each participant based on their schedules.
3. Determine common available time slots for all participants.
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the unavailable time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by listing the busy times provided for Simon and Tara, noting that Rose is free all day.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Rose**: Free from 9:00 to 17:00.
- **Simon**: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.
- **Tara**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine common available time slots for all participants. This will be achieved by identifying time slots between 9:00 and 17:00 where Rose, Simon, and Tara are all free, ensuring the slot is at least 30 minutes long.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find common available time slots, we analyze the busy periods and identify gaps where all participants are free:
- **Busy periods**:
  - Simon: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.
  - Tara: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.
  - Rose: None.
- **Merged busy periods** (combining Simon and Tara’s schedules):
  - 9:00–10:00 (Simon)
  - 10:00–10:30 (Tara)
  - 11:30–12:00 (Simon)
  - 12:30–13:00 (Tara)
  - 14:00–15:00 (Simon)
  - 15:30–16:30 (Tara)
- **Available time slots** (gaps of at least 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00):
  - 10:30–11:30 (1 hour)
  - 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes)
  - 13:00–14:00 (1 hour)
  - 15:00–15:30 (30 minutes)
  - 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes)
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the common available time slots. This will be achieved by reviewing the list of available slots and choosing the earliest one.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the available time slots:
- 10:30–11:30
- 12:00–12:30
- 13:00–14:00
- 15:00–15:30
- 16:30–17:00

The earliest slot is **10:30–11:00**, which is 30 minutes long and satisfies the requirement for the meeting.
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) works for all participants. This will be achieved by checking the slot against each participant’s busy schedule.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Rose**: Free all day, so 10:30–11:00 is available.
- **Simon**: Busy at 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00. The slot 10:30–11:00 is outside these times, so it is available.
- **Tara**: Busy at 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30. The slot 10:30–11:00 is outside these times, so it is available.

The time slot **10:30–11:00** is valid for all participants.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range (9:00–17:00).
  - Subgoal 2: List unavailable time slots for each participant.
  - Subgoal 3: Determine common available time slots.
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot.
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot.

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final schedule, as all subgoals have been addressed.

**Summary**: The meeting is scheduled for **10:30–11:00** on Monday, as it is the earliest 30-minute slot where Rose, Simon, and Tara are all available.
[/REVIEW]
