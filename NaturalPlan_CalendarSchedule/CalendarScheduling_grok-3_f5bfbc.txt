**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Olivia is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30. Peter is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00. Quinn is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn within 9:00-17:00 and find the earliest 30-minute slot where all are free. This will be achieved by listing their busy times, determining their free times, and finding a common available slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time Range and Duration**: The meeting must be 30 minutes long and occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (8 hours).  
- **Busy Times**:  
  - Olivia: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30  
  - Peter: 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00  
  - Quinn: No conflicts (available all day).  
- **Available Times**:  
  - Olivia: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00  
  - Peter: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00  
  - Quinn: 9:00-17:00  
- **Common Available Slots**:  
  - Intersecting Olivia’s and Peter’s availability (since Quinn is free all day):  
    - 9:30-10:00 (30 minutes)  
    - 11:30-12:30 (1 hour)  
    - 13:00-14:00 (1 hour)  
    - 14:30-15:30 (1 hour)  
    - 16:00-17:00 (1 hour)  
- **Earliest Slot**: The earliest 30-minute slot is 9:30-10:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the proposed time slot (9:30-10:00) satisfies all constraints, including duration, time range, and participants’ availability. This will be achieved by checking the slot against each participant’s schedule and the given constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Proposed Slot**: 9:30-10:00 (30 minutes).  
- **Constraints Check**:  
  - **Duration**: The slot is exactly 30 minutes, meeting the requirement.  
  - **Time Range**: 9:30-10:00 falls within 9:00-17:00.  
  - **Olivia**: Free from 9:30-11:00 (no conflict with 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, or 14:00-14:30).  
  - **Peter**: Free from 9:00-10:00 (no conflict with 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, or 15:30-16:00).  
  - **Quinn**: Free all day (no conflicts).  
  - **Preference**: This is the earliest possible slot, satisfying the preference for earliest availability.  
- **Conclusion**: The 9:30-10:00 slot is valid and meets all requirements.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00-17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify time range and duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List participants’ unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot (completed: 9:30-10:00).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final scheduling decision.  
[/REVIEW]
