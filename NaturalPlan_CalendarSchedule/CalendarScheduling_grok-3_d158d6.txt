**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Zack is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–14:30; Amy is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00; Brian is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at their earliest availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ busy times to determine unavailable slots.  
3. Find common available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify unavailable time slots for all participants.  
**How to Achieve**: Collect and organize the busy times from the schedules of Zack, Amy, and Brian, and represent the day’s timeline to identify gaps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Zack’s busy times: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–14:30.  
Amy’s busy times: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00.  
Brian’s busy times: None (fully available).  
Timeline of busy periods:  
- 9:00–9:30: Zack busy  
- 10:00–10:30: Amy busy  
- 11:30–12:00: Zack busy  
- 12:30–13:00: Amy busy  
- 14:00–14:30: Zack busy  
- 15:30–16:00: Amy busy  
All other times between 9:00 and 17:00 are potentially available, pending further analysis.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify common available 30-minute slots for all participants.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the timeline to find 30-minute windows where Zack and Amy are both free, and confirm Brian’s availability (already known to be all day).  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Work hours: 9:00–17:00 (i.e., until 17:00, so last slot starts at 16:30).  
List of 30-minute slots to check (starting every 30 minutes for simplicity, then refine):  
- 9:00–9:30: Zack busy  
- 9:30–10:00: Free for all  
- 10:00–10:30: Amy busy  
- 10:30–11:00: Free for all  
- 11:00–11:30: Free for all  
- 11:30–12:00: Zack busy  
- 12:00–12:30: Free for all  
- 12:30–13:00: Amy busy  
- 13:00–13:30: Free for all  
- 13:30–14:00: Free for all  
- 14:00–14:30: Zack busy  
- 14:30–15:00: Free for all  
- 15:00–15:30: Free for all  
- 15:30–16:00: Amy busy  
- 16:00–16:30: Free for all  
- 16:30–17:00: Free for all  
Available slots: 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest available 30-minute slot.  
**How to Achieve**: From the list of available slots, choose the earliest one that meets the 30-minute duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Available slots (from Step 3): 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
Earliest slot: 9:30–10:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the selected time slot (9:30–10:00) works for all participants.  
**How to Achieve**: Cross-check the 9:30–10:00 slot against each participant’s busy times to ensure no conflicts.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Selected slot: 9:30–10:00.  
- Zack: Busy 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–14:30. No conflict at 9:30–10:00.  
- Amy: Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00. No conflict at 9:30–10:00.  
- Brian: Fully available. No conflict.  
The slot 9:30–10:00 is valid for all participants.  
[/IMP]

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Finalize and propose the meeting time.  
**How to Achieve**: Propose the validated earliest time slot (9:30–10:00) as the meeting time.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The earliest available 30-minute meeting time for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday is **9:30–10:00**.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: The meeting should be scheduled for Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**.
