**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Umar is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00; Vanessa is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00; William is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Identify a time slot where all are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the scheduling problem, break it into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
3. Validate the solution or determine if no such slot exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.
How to Achieve: List the busy time slots for each participant, then derive their free time slots by excluding busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Umar’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Vanessa’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **William’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
How to Achieve: Compare the free time slots of Umar, Vanessa, and William to identify common one-hour periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a one-hour slot where all are free, examine the free time slots:
- **Umar’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Vanessa’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **William’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

Now, identify overlaps for a continuous one-hour period:
- **9:00–9:30**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is busy. Not viable.
- **9:30–10:00**: Umar is busy, Vanessa is free, William is free. Not viable.
- **10:30–11:00**: Umar is free, Vanessa is busy, William is free. Not viable.
- **11:00–11:30**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is free.
  - This gives a 30-minute slot (11:00–11:30), which is too short for a one-hour meeting.
- **11:30–12:00**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is busy. Not viable.
- **12:30–13:00**: Umar is busy, Vanessa is free, William is free. Not viable.
- **13:00–13:30**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is free.
  - This gives a 30-minute slot (13:00–13:30), which is too short.
- **13:30–14:30**: Umar is free, Vanessa is busy, William is free. Not viable.
- **14:30–15:30**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is busy. Not viable.
- **15:30–16:00**: Umar is free, Vanessa is free, William is free.
  - This gives a 30-minute slot (15:30–16:00), which is too short.
- **16:00–17:00**: Umar is free, Vanessa is busy, William is free. Not viable.

No continuous one-hour slot exists where all participants are free. The longest overlapping periods (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) are only 30 minutes.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Confirm whether a one-hour overlapping slot exists or verify that no such slot is possible.
How to Achieve: Re-evaluate the free time slots and overlaps to ensure no one-hour period was missed.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Reassess the free time slots:
- **Umar**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Vanessa**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **William**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

Check for one-hour overlaps systematically:
- **9:00–10:00**: Only 9:00–9:30 overlaps (Umar and Vanessa free, William busy). 30 minutes.
- **10:00–11:00**: No overlap (Vanessa busy).
- **11:00–12:00**: Only 11:00–11:30 overlaps (all free until William’s busy slot at 11:30). 30 minutes.
- **12:00–13:00**: No overlap (Umar busy).
- **13:00–14:00**: Only 13:00–13:30 overlaps (all free until Vanessa’s busy slot at 13:30). 30 minutes.
- **14:00–15:00**: No overlap (Vanessa or William busy).
- **15:00–16:00**: Only 15:30–16:00 overlaps (all free until Vanessa’s busy slot at 16:00). 30 minutes.
- **16:00–17:00**: No overlap (Vanessa busy).

The analysis confirms no continuous one-hour slot exists. The schedules are too fragmented, with busy periods preventing any 60-minute overlap.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the solution or confirm no solution exists. (Completed)
Current Goal: Conclude the scheduling task by reporting the result.

No one-hour slot was found due to conflicting busy periods. The longest overlapping free periods are 30 minutes (e.g., 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00), which do not meet the one-hour requirement.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Umar, Vanessa, and William due to their conflicting schedules. The longest overlapping free periods are only 30 minutes (e.g., 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00), which are insufficient for a one-hour meeting. To proceed, consider relaxing constraints, such as shortening the meeting duration or scheduling on a different day.
