### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Liam**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- **Mia**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- **Noah**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Identify a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for Liam, Mia, and Noah, then determine their free periods within 9:00–17:00. Break the day into one-hour slots and check availability for each participant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find available time slots, first list the busy periods and then derive the free periods for each participant within 9:00–17:00.

- **Liam’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free periods (gaps between busy times and within 9:00–17:00):
    - 9:00–9:30
    - 10:30–12:00
    - 13:00–15:00
    - 16:00–17:00

- **Mia’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:00–10:00
    - 11:00–13:30
    - 14:30–17:00

- **Noah’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:30–11:30
    - 12:30–14:30
    - 15:30–17:00

Now, break the day into one-hour slots (9:00–10:00, 10:00–11:00, ..., 16:00–17:00) and check availability:

- **9:00–10:00**: Liam (free 9:00–9:30, busy 9:30–10:00), Mia (free), Noah (busy). **Not available** (Noah busy).
- **10:00–11:00**: Liam (free 10:30–11:00, busy 10:00–10:30), Mia (busy), Noah (free). **Not available** (Mia busy).
- **11:00–12:00**: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (free 11:00–11:30, busy 11:30–12:00). **Not available** (Noah busy).
- **12:00–13:00**: Liam (busy), Mia (free), Noah (busy 12:00–12:30, free 12:30–13:00). **Not available** (Liam busy).
- **13:00–14:00**: Liam (free), Mia (free 13:00–13:30, busy 13:30–14:00), Noah (free). **Not available** (Mia busy).
- **14:00–15:00**: Liam (free 14:00–15:00), Mia (busy 14:00–14:30, free 14:30–15:00), Noah (free 14:00–14:30, busy 14:30–15:00). **Not available** (all have conflicts).
- **15:00–16:00**: Liam (busy), Mia (free), Noah (busy 15:00–15:30, free 15:30–16:00). **Not available** (Liam busy).
- **16:00–17:00**: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (free). **Available**.

The slot **16:00–17:00** is a candidate as all participants are free.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate that the 16:00–17:00 slot works for all participants and fits the constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the schedules to confirm no conflicts exist in the 16:00–17:00 slot and ensure it meets the one-hour duration and 9:00–17:00 constraint.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-checking the schedules for 16:00–17:00:
- **Liam**: Free (no meetings from 16:00–17:00).
- **Mia**: Free (no meetings from 14:30–17:00).
- **Noah**: Free (no meetings from 15:30–17:00).
The slot is within 9:00–17:00 and is exactly one hour long. No conflicts exist, so **16:00–17:00** is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed; identified 16:00–17:00).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the identified time slot (completed; 16:00–17:00 is valid).
- **Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time as no further subgoals are needed.

The proposed time slot of 16:00–17:00 satisfies all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as Liam, Mia, and Noah are all available during this one-hour slot within the 9:00–17:00 workday.
