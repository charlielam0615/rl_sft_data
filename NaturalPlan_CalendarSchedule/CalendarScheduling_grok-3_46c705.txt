### Problem Statement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Mike is available all day. Natalie is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Oliver is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest available time that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all available time slots for each participant based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify available time slots for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver and find the earliest 30-minute slot where all are free. This will be achieved by listing their available times, finding overlaps, and selecting the earliest slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Mike’s availability**: Free from 9:00–17:00.  
- **Natalie’s availability**: Free from 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, and 15:00–17:00 (busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00).  
- **Oliver’s availability**: Free from 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, and 16:30–17:00 (busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30).  
- **Overlapping availability**: Compare time slots:  
  - 9:00–10:00: Mike (free), Natalie (busy), Oliver (free) → Not possible.  
  - 10:00–10:30: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (busy) → Not possible.  
  - 10:30–11:30: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (free) → Valid 30-minute slot (e.g., 10:30–11:00 or 11:00–11:30).  
  - 11:30–12:00: Mike (free), Natalie (busy), Oliver (free) → Not possible.  
  - 12:00–12:30: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (free) → Valid 30-minute slot (e.g., 12:00–12:30).  
  - 12:30–13:00: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (busy) → Not possible.  
  - 13:00–14:00: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (free) → Valid 30-minute slot (e.g., 13:00–13:30 or 13:30–14:00).  
  - 14:00–15:00: Mike (free), Natalie (busy), Oliver (free) → Not possible.  
  - 15:00–15:30: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (free) → Valid 30-minute slot (e.g., 15:00–15:30).  
  - 15:30–16:30: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (busy) → Not possible.  
  - 16:30–17:00: Mike (free), Natalie (free), Oliver (free) → Valid 30-minute slot (16:30–17:00).  
- **Earliest slot**: The earliest 30-minute slot where all are free is 10:30–11:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the proposed time slot (10:30–11:00) satisfies all constraints: it must be within 9:00–17:00, last 30 minutes, and all participants must be free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check constraints**:  
  - Time range: 10:30–11:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
  - Duration: 10:30–11:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
  - Mike: Free at 10:30–11:00 (entire day free).  
  - Natalie: Free at 10:30–11:00 (free 10:00–11:30).  
  - Oliver: Free at 10:30–11:00 (free 10:30–12:30).  
- **Conclusion**: The slot 10:30–11:00 is valid as it meets all constraints.

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest valid slot (completed: 10:30–11:00).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and ensure all subgoals are addressed.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 10:30–11:00**, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all available.
