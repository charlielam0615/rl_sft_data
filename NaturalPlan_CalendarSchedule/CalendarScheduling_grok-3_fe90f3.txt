**Problem Restatement:**  
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:  
- Rose is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
- Simon is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.  
- Tara is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.  
Find a time slot where all three are available for one hour, or explain why no such time exists.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.  
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve:** List the busy time slots for Rose, Simon, and Tara, then determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00 by excluding busy periods.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Rose’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- **Simon’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
- **Tara’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.  
**How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots from Step 2 to identify periods where they intersect, ensuring the overlap is at least one hour.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Free time slots:  
  - Rose: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
  - Simon: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
  - Tara: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
- Compare for overlaps:  
  - **9:00–9:30**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (busy). No overlap.  
  - **9:30–10:00**: Rose (busy), Simon (free), Tara (free). No overlap.  
  - **10:00–10:30**: Rose (busy), Simon (busy), Tara (free). No overlap.  
  - **10:30–11:00**: Rose (free), Simon (busy), Tara (free). No overlap.  
  - **11:00–11:30**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (free). Overlap, but only 30 minutes (insufficient for one hour).  
  - **11:30–12:00**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (busy). No overlap.  
  - **12:00–12:30**: Rose (busy), Simon (free), Tara (busy). No overlap.  
  - **12:30–13:00**: Rose (busy), Simon (free), Tara (free). No overlap.  
  - **13:00–13:30**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (free). Overlap, but only 30 minutes (insufficient).  
  - **13:30–14:30**: Rose (free), Simon (busy), Tara (free). No overlap.  
  - **14:30–15:30**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (busy). No overlap.  
  - **15:30–16:00**: Rose (free), Simon (free), Tara (free). Overlap, but only 30 minutes (insufficient).  
  - **16:00–17:00**: Rose (free), Simon (busy), Tara (free). No overlap.  
No continuous one-hour time slot exists where all three are free.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Check the validity of the conclusion that no one-hour time slot exists.  
**How to Achieve:** Re-evaluate the free time slots and overlaps to confirm the analysis, ensuring no potential time slots were missed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Re-check the free time slots:  
- Rose: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- Simon: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
- Tara: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
Confirm overlaps:  
- 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes), 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes), 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes).  
All overlapping periods are less than one hour. The analysis is valid; no continuous one-hour slot satisfies the constraints.

**Step 5: Track Goals**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no solution found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the conclusion (completed, confirmed no solution).  
**Current Goal:** Conclude the scheduling process and explain the outcome.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 6: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Conclude the scheduling process and provide an explanation.  
**How to Achieve:** Summarize the findings and explain why no one-hour time slot is available, referencing the schedules and analysis.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Rose, Simon, and Tara due to their conflicting schedules. The analysis showed:  
- Free time slots:  
  - Rose: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
  - Simon: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
  - Tara: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
- Overlapping periods (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) are only 30 minutes long, insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
Thus, no time slot satisfies the requirement.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**  
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday is available for Rose, Simon, and Tara. Their schedules conflict, with overlapping free periods (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) being only 30 minutes, which is too short for the required one-hour meeting.
