**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Irene is busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, and 15:00-16:00; Jack is busy from 10:00-11:00 and 13:30-14:30; Kelly is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, and 14:30-15:30. Find a time slot that fits everyone’s availability, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00-17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping available time slots across all participants.
3. Verify if any overlapping slot can accommodate a one-hour meeting.
4. If no slot is found, analyze conflicts to explain why no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00-17:00 on Monday. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods for Irene, Jack, and Kelly based on their given schedules.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we analyze each participant's schedule:

- **Irene**:
  - Busy: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00
  - Available: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00

- **Jack**:
  - Busy: 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30
  - Available: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00

- **Kelly**:
  - Busy: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:30-15:30
  - Available: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00

These intervals represent the time periods when each participant is free within 9:00-17:00.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping available time slots across Irene, Jack, and Kelly that can accommodate a one-hour meeting. This will be achieved by comparing the available time slots identified in the previous step and checking for common periods of at least one hour.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find overlapping time slots, we compare the available periods:

- **Irene’s available slots**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00
- **Jack’s available slots**: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00
- **Kelly’s available slots**: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00

We check for overlaps that are at least one hour long:

1. **9:00-9:30**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is busy (9:00-9:30). No overlap.
2. **9:30-10:00**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is free only from 9:30-11:30. Overlap is 9:30-10:00 (30 minutes, too short).
3. **10:30-11:00**: Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is busy (10:00-11:00). No overlap.
4. **11:00-11:30**: Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is free only from 11:00-13:30. Overlap is 11:00-11:30 (30 minutes, too short).
5. **11:30-12:00**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is busy (11:30-12:30). No overlap.
6. **12:30-13:00**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is free only from 12:30-14:30. Overlap is 12:30-13:00 (30 minutes, too short).
7. **13:00-13:30**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is free only from 12:30-14:30. Overlap is 13:00-13:30 (30 minutes, too short).
8. **13:30-14:30**: Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is busy (13:30-14:30). No overlap.
9. **14:30-15:00**: Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is free only from 14:30-17:00. Overlap is 14:30-15:00 (30 minutes, too short).
10. **15:30-16:00**: Jack and Kelly are free, but Irene is busy (15:00-16:00). No overlap.
11. **16:00-17:00**: Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is free only from 15:30-17:00. Overlap is 16:00-17:00 (1 hour, sufficient).

The only overlapping slot that is at least one hour is **16:00-17:00**.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the 16:00-17:00 time slot is indeed available for all participants and meets the one-hour meeting requirement. This will be achieved by rechecking each participant’s schedule for conflicts in this slot.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Validating the 16:00-17:00 slot:

- **Irene**: Available from 16:00-17:00 (no conflict, as her last busy period ends at 16:00).
- **Jack**: Available from 14:30-17:00 (no conflict).
- **Kelly**: Available from 15:30-17:00 (no conflict).

The 16:00-17:00 slot is free for all participants and is exactly one hour, satisfying the meeting requirement.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00-17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping available time slots (completed, found 16:00-17:00).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (completed, 16:00-17:00 is valid).
  - Subgoal 4: Confirm the final time slot or explain if no solution exists (in progress).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final time slot for the meeting.

The 16:00-17:00 slot has been identified and validated as a viable time for the meeting.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as this is the only time slot within 9:00-17:00 where all participants are available.
