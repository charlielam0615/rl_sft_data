**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Julia is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00.
- Kevin is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30.
- Laura is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
3. Select a suitable time slot or determine if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the available time slots for each participant.
How to Achieve: List the busy time slots for each participant, then determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00 by excluding busy periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Julia’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Kevin’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Laura’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
How to Achieve: Compare the free time slots of Julia, Kevin, and Laura to identify common one-hour periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common one-hour slot, examine the free periods:
- **Julia’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Kevin’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Laura’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, identify overlaps for a continuous one-hour period:
- **9:00–9:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.
- **9:30–10:00**: Julia (busy), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **10:00–10:30**: Julia (busy), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **10:30–11:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **11:00–11:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Viable for 11:00–12:00 (one hour, as Laura is free until 11:30 and Julia/Kevin are free beyond).
- **11:30–12:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.
- **12:00–12:30**: Julia (busy), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.
- **12:30–13:00**: Julia (busy), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **13:00–13:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Viable for 13:00–14:00 (one hour, as Julia is free until 15:00, Kevin until 13:30, Laura until 14:30).
- **13:30–14:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **14:00–14:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **14:30–15:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.
- **15:00–15:30**: Julia (busy), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.
- **15:30–16:00**: Julia (busy), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Not viable.
- **16:00–17:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Viable for 16:00–17:00 (one hour).

**Viable one-hour slots**: 11:00–12:00, 13:00–14:00, 16:00–17:00.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select a suitable time slot (pending).
Current Goal: Select a suitable time slot from the identified overlaps (11:00–12:00, 13:00–14:00, 16:00–17:00).
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Select a suitable time slot from the identified overlaps.
How to Achieve: Choose one of the viable time slots (11:00–12:00, 13:00–14:00, 16:00–17:00) based on typical scheduling preferences, such as earlier in the day for better focus.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The viable time slots are 11:00–12:00, 13:00–14:00, and 16:00–17:00. Since earlier meetings are often preferred for productivity, the slot **11:00–12:00** is selected as it is the earliest available time that fits all schedules.
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer**
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **11:00 to 12:00**, as it is a one-hour time slot where Julia, Kevin, and Laura are all available.
