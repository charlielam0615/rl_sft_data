**Problem Statement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Rose is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30; Simon is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00; Tara is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all available time slots by considering the busy schedules of Rose and Simon, and Tara’s open availability.  
3. Find the earliest 30-minute slot where all participants are free.  
4. Verify the solution meets all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify all available 30-minute time slots within 9:00-17:00 where Rose, Simon, and Tara are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the schedules of Rose and Simon to determine their free time slots, intersect these to find common availability, and confirm Tara’s availability (which is all day). List all possible 30-minute slots and select the earliest one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a suitable time slot, let’s break down the schedules and identify free periods:

- **Work hours**: 9:00-17:00 (8 hours, or 480 minutes).
- **Rose’s busy times**: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30.
- **Rose’s free times**: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00.
- **Simon’s busy times**: 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00.
- **Simon’s free times**: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.
- **Tara’s free times**: Entire day (9:00-17:00).

Now, identify 30-minute slots where both Rose and Simon are free, and Tara’s availability (all day) will automatically align. Break the day into 30-minute intervals: 9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

Check each slot:
- **9:00-9:30**: Rose is busy. Not possible.
- **9:30-10:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **10:00-10:30**: Simon is busy. Not possible.
- **10:30-11:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **11:00-11:30**: Rose is busy. Not possible.
- **11:30-12:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **12:00-12:30**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **12:30-13:00**: Simon is busy. Not possible.
- **13:00-13:30**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **13:30-14:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **14:00-14:30**: Rose is busy. Not possible.
- **14:30-15:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **15:00-15:30**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **15:30-16:00**: Simon is busy. Not possible.
- **16:00-16:30**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.
- **16:30-17:00**: Rose is free, Simon is free, Tara is free. **Possible**.

Possible slots: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

The earliest slot is **9:30-10:00**.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the 9:30-10:00 slot satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that Rose, Simon, and Tara are free during 9:30-10:00, the slot is within 9:00-17:00, and the duration is 30 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time range**: 9:30-10:00 is within 9:00-17:00.
- **Duration**: 9:30-10:00 is exactly 30 minutes.
- **Rose’s availability**: Free from 9:30-11:00, so 9:30-10:00 is free.
- **Simon’s availability**: Free from 9:00-10:00, so 9:30-10:00 is free.
- **Tara’s availability**: Free all day, so 9:30-10:00 is free.

The slot 9:30-10:00 satisfies all constraints.
