**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Alice, Bob, and Charlie on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Alice is busy from 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, and 14:00-14:30. Bob is busy from 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-16:00. Charlie is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find common available time slots.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 2: Recall Info
[PLANNING]
**Action: Recall Info (Review)**  
**Meta-data:** Retrieve the existing schedules of Alice, Bob, and Charlie to understand their unavailable time slots, which will serve as the foundation for identifying common availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Recalled Information:**  
- **Alice’s unavailable times:** 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30.  
- **Bob’s unavailable times:** 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00.  
- **Charlie’s availability:** Entire day (9:00-17:00).  
- **Constraints:** Meeting must be 30 minutes and occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Preference for the earliest possible time.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The goal is to identify a 30-minute time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 where Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all available. This will be achieved by mapping out unavailable times, determining free periods, and selecting the earliest 30-minute slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time slot, let’s analyze the schedules:  
- **Alice’s busy periods:** 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30.  
- **Bob’s busy periods:** 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00.  
- **Charlie:** Available all day.  

**Step-by-step analysis:**  
1. **List all busy periods in chronological order:**  
   - 9:00-10:00 (Alice)  
   - 10:30-11:00 (Bob)  
   - 11:30-12:00 (Alice)  
   - 12:30-13:00 (Bob)  
   - 14:00-14:30 (Alice)  
   - 15:00-16:00 (Bob)  

2. **Identify free periods between 9:00 and 17:00:**  
   - **9:00-10:00:** Alice is busy.  
   - **10:00-10:30:** All available.  
   - **10:30-11:00:** Bob is busy.  
   - **11:00-11:30:** All available.  
   - **11:30-12:00:** Alice is busy.  
   - **12:00-12:30:** All available.  
   - **12:30-13:00:** Bob is busy.  
   - **13:00-14:00:** All available.  
   - **14:00-14:30:** Alice is busy.  
   - **14:30-15:00:** All available.  
   - **15:00-16:00:** Bob is busy.  
   - **16:00-17:00:** All available.  

3. **Find 30-minute free slots:**  
   - **10:00-10:30:** 30 minutes, all available.  
   - **11:00-11:30:** 30 minutes, all available.  
   - **12:00-12:30:** 30 minutes, all available.  
   - **13:00-14:00:** 60 minutes, all available (includes multiple 30-minute slots).  
   - **14:30-15:00:** 30 minutes, all available.  
   - **16:00-17:00:** 60 minutes, all available (includes multiple 30-minute slots).  

4. **Select earliest slot:** The earliest 30-minute slot is **10:00-10:30**.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** Verify that the proposed time slot (10:00-10:30) satisfies all constraints: it must be 30 minutes, within 9:00-17:00, and free for Alice, Bob, and Charlie.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Verification:**  
- **Time slot:** 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes, within 9:00-17:00).  
- **Alice:** Free (busy 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30).  
- **Bob:** Free (busy 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00).  
- **Charlie:** Free (available all day).  
- **Preference:** This is the earliest available slot.  

The time slot **10:00-10:30** is valid and meets all constraints.
