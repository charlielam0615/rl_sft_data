**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Wendy's meetings are from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30. Xavier is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00. Yvonne has no scheduled meetings. The meeting should be at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the working hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.
3. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.
How to Achieve: List the busy time slots for Wendy and Xavier, determine their free time slots, and note that Yvonne is free all day. Then, identify 30-minute windows within the working hours.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Wendy’s busy times: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.
Xavier’s busy times: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00.
Yvonne’s schedule: Free all day.

**Step-by-step availability analysis:**
- **Wendy’s free slots**: 9:30–11:00, 11:30–14:00, 14:30–17:00.
- **Xavier’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:00–17:00.
- **Yvonne’s free slots**: 9:00–17:00 (entire day).

Now, identify 30-minute windows where all are free by checking overlaps:
- **9:00–9:30**: Wendy is busy, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **9:30–10:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **10:00–10:30**: Wendy is free, Xavier is busy, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **10:30–11:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **11:00–11:30**: Wendy is busy, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **11:30–12:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **12:00–12:30**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **12:30–13:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is busy, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **13:00–13:30**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **13:30–14:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **14:00–14:30**: Wendy is busy, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **14:30–15:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **15:00–15:30**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **15:30–16:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is busy, Yvonne is free. (Not possible)
- **16:00–16:30**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)
- **16:30–17:00**: Wendy is free, Xavier is free, Yvonne is free. (Possible)

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest possible time.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all are free (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest available 30-minute slot (pending).

Current Goal: Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.
[/REVIEW]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Select the earliest 30-minute slot where all participants are free.
How to Achieve: From the list of overlapping free slots identified in Step 2, choose the earliest 30-minute window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 2, the possible 30-minute slots are:
- 9:30–10:00
- 10:30–11:00
- 11:30–12:00
- 12:00–12:30
- 13:00–13:30
- 13:30–14:00
- 14:30–15:00
- 15:00–15:30
- 16:00–16:30
- 16:30–17:00

The earliest slot is 9:30–10:00.

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that the selected time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints.
How to Achieve: Confirm that Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne are free during 9:30–10:00 and that the slot meets the 30-minute duration and working hours (9:00–17:00) requirements.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Wendy**: Free from 9:30–11:00 (confirmed free at 9:30–10:00).
- **Xavier**: Free from 9:00–10:00 (confirmed free at 9:30–10:00).
- **Yvonne**: Free all day (confirmed free at 9:30–10:00).
- **Duration**: 9:30–10:00 is exactly 30 minutes.
- **Working Hours**: 9:30–10:00 falls within 9:00–17:00.

The slot 9:30–10:00 is valid.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from 9:30 to 10:00, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne are all available within the working hours of 9:00–17:00.
