**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Frank is busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, and 15:00-16:00; Grace is busy from 10:00-11:00 and 13:30-14:30; Henry is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, and 14:30-15:30. Identify a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00-17:00).  
2. Determine each participant’s unavailable time slots based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select a one-hour time slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify each participant’s unavailable time slots and calculate their available time slots within 9:00-17:00. This will be achieved by listing the busy times provided and determining the gaps between them for each participant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Frank’s schedule**: Busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00.  
  Available: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.  
- **Grace’s schedule**: Busy from 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30.  
  Available: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00.  
- **Henry’s schedule**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:30-15:30.  
  Available: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants (Frank, Grace, Henry) are available. This will be achieved by comparing their available time slots and identifying common periods that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common time slot, compare the available periods:  
- **Frank**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.  
- **Grace**: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00.  
- **Henry**: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  

**Step-by-step comparison**:  
- **9:00-9:30**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is busy (9:00-9:30). Not viable.  
- **9:30-10:00**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is available only after 9:30, and Grace is busy after 10:00. The slot is only 30 minutes (9:30-10:00), not enough for a one-hour meeting.  
- **10:30-11:00**: Frank and Henry are available (10:30-11:30), but Grace is busy (10:00-11:00). Not viable.  
- **11:00-11:30**: Frank and Henry are available, but Grace is available only after 11:00, and Henry is busy after 11:30. The slot is only 30 minutes (11:00-11:30), not enough.  
- **11:30-12:00**: Frank is available, but Henry is busy (11:30-12:30), and Grace is available. Not viable.  
- **12:30-13:00**: Frank is busy (12:00-13:00), Grace and Henry are available. Not viable.  
- **13:00-13:30**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is available only until 14:30, and Grace is busy after 13:30. The slot is only 30 minutes (13:00-13:30), not enough.  
- **13:30-14:30**: Henry is available, but Grace is busy (13:30-14:30), and Frank is available. Not viable.  
- **14:30-15:00**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is busy (14:30-15:30). Not viable.  
- **15:30-16:00**: Grace and Henry are available, but Frank is busy (15:00-16:00). Not viable.  
- **16:00-17:00**: Frank, Grace, and Henry are all available. This slot is one hour long and satisfies the requirement.  

**Conclusion**: The only viable one-hour time slot is 16:00-17:00.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the identified time slot (16:00-17:00) by confirming that it meets all constraints: it is within 9:00-17:00, is one hour long, and all participants are available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Constraint 1**: The slot must be within 9:00-17:00. 16:00-17:00 is within this range.  
- **Constraint 2**: The slot must be one hour long. 16:00 to 17:00 is exactly one hour.  
- **Constraint 3**: All participants must be available.  
  - Frank is available from 16:00-17:00 (no meetings).  
  - Grace is available from 14:30-17:00 (no meetings).  
  - Henry is available from 15:30-17:00 (no meetings).  
All constraints are satisfied for the 16:00-17:00 slot.

**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00-17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00-17:00. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine each participant’s unavailable and available time slots. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots for a one-hour meeting. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected time slot (16:00-17:00). (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and communicate the result.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry can be scheduled on Monday from 16:00 to 17:00, as all participants are available during this time, and it satisfies the constraints of being within 9:00-17:00 and one hour in duration.
