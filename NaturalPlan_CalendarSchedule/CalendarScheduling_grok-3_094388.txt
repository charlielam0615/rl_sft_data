### Problem Statement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Sam is available all day, Tina has meetings from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Victor is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates all participants.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List the unavailable time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute window that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the unavailable time slots for each participant and determine their available time windows within 9:00–17:00. This will be achieved by listing the busy times for Tina and Victor, noting Sam’s full availability, and calculating free intervals.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Sam’s Schedule**: Available from 9:00 to 17:00.  
- **Tina’s Busy Times**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
  - Available intervals: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Victor’s Busy Times**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
  - Available intervals: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping 30-minute windows where Sam, Tina, and Victor are all available, prioritizing the earliest possible time. This will be achieved by comparing the available intervals from Step 2 and identifying common time slots.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Sam’s Availability**: 9:00–17:00 (entire day).  
- **Tina’s Availability**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Victor’s Availability**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Overlapping Intervals**:  
  - Compare intervals:  
    - 9:00–10:00: Tina is busy, Victor is free, Sam is free → Not possible.  
    - 10:00–10:30: Tina is free, Victor is busy, Sam is free → Not possible.  
    - 10:30–11:30: Tina is free (10:00–11:30), Victor is free (10:30–12:30), Sam is free → Possible (10:30–11:30).  
    - 12:00–12:30: Tina is free (12:00–14:00), Victor is free (10:30–12:30), Sam is free → Possible (12:00–12:30).  
    - 12:30–13:00: Tina is free, Victor is busy, Sam is free → Not possible.  
    - 13:00–14:00: Tina is free (12:00–14:00), Victor is free (13:00–15:30), Sam is free → Possible (13:00–14:00).  
    - 15:00–15:30: Tina is free (15:00–17:00), Victor is free (13:00–15:30), Sam is free → Possible (15:00–15:30).  
    - 15:30–16:30: Tina is free, Victor is busy, Sam is free → Not possible.  
    - 16:30–17:00: Tina is free (15:00–17:00), Victor is free (16:30–17:00), Sam is free → Possible (16:30–17:00).  
- **Earliest 30-minute Window**: The earliest overlapping interval is 10:30–11:30, which accommodates a 30-minute meeting (e.g., 10:30–11:00).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the proposed meeting time of 10:30–11:00 on Monday satisfies all constraints. This will be achieved by checking the schedules of Sam, Tina, and Victor for conflicts during this time slot.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Proposed Time**: 10:30–11:00 on Monday.  
- **Sam**: Available all day (9:00–17:00) → No conflict.  
- **Tina**: Available 10:00–11:30 → 10:30–11:00 is within this window → No conflict.  
- **Victor**: Available 10:30–12:30 → 10:30–11:00 is within this window → No conflict.  
- **Constraints Check**: The time is within 9:00–17:00, the duration is 30 minutes, and it is the earliest possible slot based on the overlaps identified.  
- **Conclusion**: The time slot 10:30–11:00 is valid.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List unavailable and available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute windows (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest available window (completed).

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **10:30 to 11:00**. This is the earliest 30-minute time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Sam, Tina, and Victor are all available, with no conflicts based on their provided schedules.
