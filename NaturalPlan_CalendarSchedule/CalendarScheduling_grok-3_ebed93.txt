**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List the unavailable time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots that are at least 30 minutes long.  
4. Select the earliest available time slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping available time slots that are at least 30 minutes long.  
- **How to Achieve:** Analyze the busy slots of Diana and Ethan, determine their available time slots within 9:00-17:00, and identify 30-minute windows where both are free. Since Fiona is available all day, focus on Diana and Ethan’s availability.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time range:** 9:00-17:00 (8 hours = 480 minutes).  
- **Diana’s available slots:**  
  - 9:30-11:00 (90 minutes), 11:30-14:00 (150 minutes), 14:30-17:00 (150 minutes).  
- **Ethan’s available slots:**  
  - 9:00-10:00 (60 minutes), 10:30-12:30 (120 minutes), 13:00-15:00 (120 minutes), 16:00-17:00 (60 minutes).  
- **Fiona’s available slots:** 9:00-17:00 (entire day).  
- **Overlapping available slots (considering 30-minute duration):**  
  - 9:30-10:00 (30 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).  
  - 10:30-11:00 (30 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).  
  - 11:30-12:30 (60 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).  
  - 13:00-14:00 (60 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).  
  - 14:30-15:00 (30 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).  
  - 16:00-17:00 (60 minutes, Diana and Ethan free, Fiona free).

**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the selected time slot (9:30-10:00) satisfies all constraints.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the selected time slot against each participant’s busy schedule and confirm it meets the 30-minute duration and falls within 9:00-17:00.  

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Selected time slot:** 9:30-10:00.  
- **Constraints check:**  
  - **Diana:** Busy at 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30. Available at 9:30-10:00.
