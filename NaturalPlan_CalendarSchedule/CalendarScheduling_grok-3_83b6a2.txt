**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:  
- Xander is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
- Yvonne is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.  
- Zoe is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.  
Find a time slot that accommodates all participants, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find a suitable meeting time:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the working hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping free time slots of at least one hour among all participants.  
3. Select a specific one-hour time slot that satisfies all constraints, if one exists.  
4. If no slot is found, analyze and explain the conflict.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the busy time slots for each participant, then determine their free time slots by excluding the busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Xander’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  

- **Yvonne’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  

- **Zoe’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 3: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping free time slots of at least one hour among Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots identified in the previous step and find common periods that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:  
- **Xander’s Free Slots:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Yvonne’s Free Slots:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Zoe’s Free Slots:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

Now, check for overlaps:  
- **9:00–9:30:** Xander and Yvonne are free, but Zoe is busy (9:00–9:30). No overlap.  
- **9:30–10:00:** Yvonne and Zoe are free, but Xander is busy (9:30–10:30). No overlap.  
- **10:30–11:00:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
- **11:00–11:30:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is free only until 13:30, and the slot is less than one hour. No valid slot.  
- **11:30–12:00:** Xander is free, but Zoe is busy (11:30–12:30). No overlap.  
- **12:30–13:00:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is free only until 13:30, and the slot is less than one hour. No valid slot.  
- **13:00–13:30:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
- **13:30–14:30:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
- **14:30–15:30:** Xander and Yvonne are free, but Zoe is busy (14:30–15:30). No overlap.  
- **15:30–16:00:** Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe are all free. However, this is only a 30-minute slot (15:30–16:00), which is less than one hour. No valid slot.  
- **16:00–17:00:** Xander and Zoe are free, but Yvonne is busy (16:00–17:00). No overlap.  

No one-hour slot exists where all three participants are free simultaneously.

### Step 4: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify if the conclusion that no one-hour slot exists is correct.  
- **How to Achieve:** Re-evaluate the free time slots and their overlaps to ensure no valid slot was missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-checking the free slots:  
- **Xander:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Yvonne:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Zoe:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

Confirming overlaps:  
- The longest potential overlap is 15:30–16:00 (all three are free), but it’s only 30 minutes.  
- Other potential overlaps (e.g., 11:00–11:30, 12:30–13:00) are also less than one hour or blocked by at least one participant’s busy schedule.  
- Time slots like 13:00–14:30 (Xander and Zoe free) are blocked by Yvonne’s 13:30–14:30 meeting, and 14:30–15:30 (Xander and Yvonne free) is blocked by Zoe’s 14:30–15:30 meeting.  

The conclusion is valid: no one-hour slot exists where all three are free.

### Step 5: Track Goals  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping free time slots of at least one hour (completed, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select a specific one-hour time slot or explain conflicts (in progress).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the analysis (completed).  

**Current Goal:** Explain why no one-hour meeting slot is possible based on the findings.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Provide a detailed explanation of why no one-hour meeting slot is possible.  
- **How to Achieve:** Summarize the conflicts in the schedules and clarify why no overlapping one-hour slot exists within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot is available for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 due to conflicting schedules:  
- The only time all three are free is 15:30–16:00, which is only 30 minutes, insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
- Other potential slots are blocked:  
  - Early morning (9:00–9:30) is blocked by Zoe’s meeting.  
  - Mid-morning (9:30–11:00) is blocked by Xander (9:30–10:30) and Yvonne (10:00–11:00).  
  - Late morning (11:00–12:30) has short overlaps (e.g., 11:00–11:30), but Zoe’s 11:30–12:30 meeting and Xander’s 12:00–13:00 meeting prevent a full hour.  
  - Early afternoon (13:00–14:30) is blocked by Yvonne’s 13:30–14:30 meeting.  
  - Mid-afternoon (14:30–15:30) is blocked by Zoe’s 14:30–15:30 meeting.  
  - Late afternoon (15:30–17:00) is limited to 15:30–16:00 due to Yvonne’s 16:00–17:00 meeting.  
Thus, no one-hour slot satisfies all participants’ availability.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer:**  
No one-hour meeting slot is available on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe. The only time all three are free is 15:30–16:00, which is only 30 minutes. Other potential slots are blocked by at least one participant’s existing meetings, as detailed in the schedule conflicts above.
