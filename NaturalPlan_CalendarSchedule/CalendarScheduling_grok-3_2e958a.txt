### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Sam**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
- **Tina**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.
- **Victor**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot where all three are available for one hour.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping available time slots for all three participants.
3. Verify that at least one overlapping slot is one hour long.
4. Select a suitable time slot or determine if no solution exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by listing the time periods when each person is not busy, based on their given schedules, within the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots:
- **Sam’s busy times**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  **Available**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Tina’s busy times**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
  **Available**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Victor’s busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  **Available**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

These are the time slots when each participant is free.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping available time slots for Sam, Tina, and Victor that are at least one hour long. This will be achieved by comparing their available time slots and identifying common periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the available time slots:
- **Sam**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Tina**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Victor**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Overlaps**:
- From 9:00–9:30: Sam and Tina are free, but Victor is busy (9:00–9:30). **No overlap**.
- From 10:30–11:00: Sam and Victor (10:30–11:30) are free, Tina is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap**.
- From 11:00–11:30: Sam (10:30–12:00) and Victor (9:30–11:30) are free, Tina is free (11:00–13:30). **Overlap: 11:00–11:30** (30 minutes, too short).
- From 12:30–13:00: Sam (13:00–17:00) is busy (12:00–13:00), Tina (11:00–13:30) and Victor (12:30–14:30) are free. **No overlap**.
- From 13:00–13:30: Sam and Tina are free, Victor is free (12:30–14:30). **Overlap: 13:00–13:30** (30 minutes, too short).
- From 14:30–15:30: Sam (13:00–17:00) and Tina (14:30–16:00) are free, Victor is busy (14:30–15:30). **No overlap**.
- From 15:30–16:00: Sam and Victor (15:30–17:00) are free, Tina is free (14:30–16:00). **Overlap: 15:30–16:00** (30 minutes, too short).

No overlapping slot is one hour long.

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to check the validity of the current path by confirming whether any identified overlapping time slots meet the one-hour requirement. This will be achieved by reviewing the overlaps found in the previous step.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The overlapping time slots identified are:
- 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes).
- 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes).
- 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes).

None of these slots meet the one-hour duration requirement. To ensure accuracy, recheck the schedules for any missed opportunities:
- The entire 9:00–17:00 period has been segmented and analyzed. No one-hour slot accommodates all three participants due to conflicting busy times.

The current path indicates no valid one-hour slot exists.

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping available time slots (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify that at least one overlapping slot is one hour long (completed, no valid slot found).
  - Subgoal 4: Select a suitable time slot or determine if no solution exists (in progress).

**Current Goal**: Determine if a solution exists or provide an explanation for why no solution is possible.

The goal hierarchy reflects the steps taken, with the current focus on concluding whether a meeting can be scheduled.

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude whether a one-hour meeting can be scheduled or to explain why no solution exists. This will be achieved by summarizing the findings from previous steps and providing a clear explanation.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Conclusion**: No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday accommodates Sam, Tina, and Victor simultaneously.

**Explanation**:
- The available time slots for each participant were identified:
  - Sam: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
  - Tina: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
  - Victor: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.
- Overlapping periods (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) are all 30 minutes long, which is insufficient for the one-hour requirement.
- The schedules are tightly constrained, with each participant’s busy periods creating gaps that prevent a continuous one-hour overlap. For example:
  - Early morning (9:00–10:00) is blocked by Victor’s 9:00–9:30 and Tina’s 10:00–11:00.
  - Mid-morning (10:30–12:00) is disrupted by Tina’s 10:00–11:00 and Victor’s 11:30–12:30.
  - Afternoon periods are similarly fragmented by Sam’s 12:00–13:00, Tina’s 13:30–14:30 and 16:00–17:00, and Victor’s 14:30–15:30.
- No single hour within 9:00–17:00 is free for all three participants.

Thus, it is impossible to schedule a one-hour meeting under the given constraints.

### Final Answer
No one-hour meeting can be scheduled for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The participants’ schedules conflict, with no overlapping one-hour period available due to their respective busy times (Sam: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00; Tina: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00; Victor: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30). The longest overlapping periods are only 30 minutes (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00), which do not meet the one-hour requirement.
