### Problem Statement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Diana**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- **Ethan**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- **Fiona**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find a common one-hour time slot where all participants are free.
3. Validate the selected time slot to ensure it meets the one-hour duration and work-hour constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.
**How to Achieve**: Analyze each participant's busy schedule, determine their free time slots, and list them for comparison.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we analyze the busy periods and determine free periods within 9:00–17:00 for each participant.

**Diana’s Schedule**:
- Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.

**Ethan’s Schedule**:
- Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.

**Fiona’s Schedule**:
- Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
- Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Find a common one-hour time slot where all participants are free.
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of Diana, Ethan, and Fiona to identify overlapping periods that are at least one hour long.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the free time slots:
- **Diana**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Ethan**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Fiona**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Intersection of Free Slots**:
- 9:00–9:30: Diana and Ethan are free, but Fiona is busy.
- 10:30–11:00: Diana and Fiona are free (10:30–11:30 overlap), but Ethan is busy (10:00–11:00).
- 11:00–11:30: Diana and Fiona are free, but Ethan is free only from 11:00–13:30, so overlap is 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes, too short).
- 12:30–13:00: Diana and Fiona are free, but Ethan is free only from 11:00–13:30, so overlap is 12:30–13:00 (30 minutes, too short).
- 13:00–13:30: Diana and Fiona are free, but Ethan is free only until 13:30, so overlap is 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes, too short).
- 14:30–15:00: Diana and Ethan are free, but Fiona is busy (14:30–15:30).
- 15:30–16:00: Ethan and Fiona are free, but Diana is busy (15:00–16:00).
- 16:00–17:00: Diana, Ethan, and Fiona are all free.

**Potential Slot**: 16:00–17:00 is a one-hour slot where all participants are available.

[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot satisfies all constraints.
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the slot is within 9:00–17:00, is one hour long, and does not conflict with any participant’s busy periods.

[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Constraint**: 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.
- **Duration**: The slot is exactly one hour (16:00–17:00).
- **Conflicts**:
  - Diana: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00).
  - Ethan: Free from 14:30–17:00 (no conflict with 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30).
  - Fiona: Free from 15:30–17:00 (no conflict with 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).
- **Conclusion**: The 16:00–17:00 slot is valid.

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find a common one-hour time slot (completed: 16:00–17:00 identified).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (completed: 16:00–17:00 is valid).

**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time as 16:00–17:00, as all subgoals are completed and validated.

[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday from 16:00 to 17:00**, as it is a one-hour slot within 9:00–17:00 where Diana, Ethan, and Fiona are all available.
