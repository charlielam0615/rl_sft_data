**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Liam is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30. Mia is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:00–16:00. Noah is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and the required meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ unavailable time slots to determine their free periods.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots among all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the free time slots for Liam, Mia, and Noah within 9:00–17:00 and find a 30-minute slot where all are available. This will be achieved by listing their busy times, determining their free periods, and finding the earliest overlapping free slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Range and Duration**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (8 hours) and last 30 minutes.  
- **Busy Times**:  
  - Liam: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30  
  - Mia: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00  
  - Noah: No busy times (free all day).  
- **Free Times**:  
  - Liam: 9:30–11:00, 11:30–14:00, 14:30–17:00  
  - Mia: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00  
  - Noah: 9:00–17:00  
- **Overlapping Free Times**: Intersect the free periods of Liam, Mia, and Noah:  
  - 9:30–10:00 (30 minutes, since Mia is busy at 10:00)  
  - 11:30–12:30 (1 hour, since Mia is busy at 12:30)  
  - 13:00–14:00 (1 hour, since Liam is busy at 14:00)  
  - 16:00–17:00 (1 hour, since Liam and Mia are free, and Noah is free all day)  
- **Earliest Slot**: The earliest 30-minute slot is 9:30–10:00.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate that the proposed meeting time (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints, including the participants’ availability, meeting duration, and time range (9:00–17:00). This will be achieved by checking each participant’s schedule against the proposed time and confirming the duration.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Proposed Time**: 9:30–10:00 (30 minutes).  
- **Constraints Check**:  
  - **Duration**: The slot is exactly 30 minutes, meeting the requirement.  
  - **Time Range**: 9:30–10:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
  - **Liam**: Free from 9:30–11:00 (not busy during 9:30–10:00).  
  - **Mia**: Free from 9:00–10:00 (not busy during 9:30–10:00).  
  - **Noah**: Free all day, so available at 9:30–10:00.  
- **Conclusion**: The 9:30–10:00 slot satisfies all constraints and is the earliest available time.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List participants’ unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot (completed, proposed 9:30–10:00).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the proposed time slot (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time based on the validated slot.  
**Summary**: The proposed time of 9:30–10:00 has been identified and validated as the earliest slot where all participants are available, meeting all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**:  
The meeting can be scheduled for Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Liam, Mia, and Noah are all available within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
