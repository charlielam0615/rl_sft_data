**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Umar is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Vanessa is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30; William is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Identify a time slot that works for all participants, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. List the busy periods for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping one-hour slots where all participants are free.  
4. Validate the solution or determine if no feasible slot exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots within 9:00–17:00 and list the busy periods for each participant. This will be achieved by defining the work hours and extracting the busy schedules from the provided constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 (8 hours total). The busy periods for each participant are:  
- **Umar**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00  
- **Vanessa**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30  
- **William**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  

To find available slots, we first note the busy periods in a timeline:  
- 9:00–9:30: William busy  
- 9:30–10:00: Umar busy  
- 10:00–10:30: Umar and Vanessa busy  
- 10:30–11:00: Vanessa busy  
- 11:30–12:00: William busy  
- 12:00–12:30: Umar and William busy  
- 12:30–13:00: Umar busy  
- 13:30–14:30: Vanessa busy  
- 14:30–15:00: William busy  
- 15:00–15:30: Umar and William busy  
- 15:30–16:00: Umar busy  

This gives us a preliminary view of the constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free. This will be achieved by analyzing the timeline to identify periods where none of the participants have scheduled meetings.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find a one-hour slot where all are free, we examine the periods between 9:00 and 17:00 that are not blocked by any participant’s busy times. We list potential one-hour slots and check for conflicts:  

- **9:00–10:00**: William is busy 9:00–9:30, Umar is busy 9:30–10:00. No full hour is free.  
- **10:00–11:00**: Umar is busy 9:30–10:30, Vanessa is busy 10:00–11:00. No full hour is free.  
- **11:00–12:00**: William is busy 11:30–12:00. No full hour is free.  
- **12:00–13:00**: Umar is busy 12:00–13:00, William is busy 12:00–12:30. No full hour is free.  
- **13:00–14:00**: Vanessa is busy 13:30–14:30. The slot 13:00–13:30 is free, but it’s not a full hour.  
- **14:00–15:00**: Vanessa is busy 13:30–14:30, William is busy 14:30–15:00. No full hour is free.  
- **15:00–16:00**: Umar is busy 15:00–16:00, William is busy 15:00–15:30. No full hour is free.  
- **16:00–17:00**: All participants are free (no conflicts listed after 16:00).  

The slot **16:00–17:00** appears to be free for all participants.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the 16:00–17:00 slot is indeed free for all participants and meets the one-hour requirement within 9:00–17:00. This will be achieved by double-checking the busy schedules and confirming the slot’s validity.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Re-checking the schedules:  
- **Umar**: Busy 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00. Free at 16:00–17:00.  
- **Vanessa**: Busy 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30. Free at 16:00–17:00.  
- **William**: Busy 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30. Free at 16:00–17:00.  

The slot 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00, lasts one hour, and has no conflicts. Thus, it is a valid solution.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: List busy periods for each participant. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping one-hour slots where all are free. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time.  
The slot 16:00–17:00 has been identified and validated as a feasible time for the meeting.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as all participants—Umar, Vanessa, and William—are available during this one-hour slot within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
