### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that fits everyone’s availability, given the following constraints:
- **Patricia**: Available all day (9:00–17:00).
- **Quentin**: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00.
- **Rachel**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30.
We aim to identify the earliest 30-minute time slot where all three participants are free.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping time slots where all three participants are available.  
3. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant and find a common 30-minute slot. This will be achieved by listing each participant’s free time slots and intersecting them to find overlapping periods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To achieve the goal, let’s analyze each participant’s availability:

- **Patricia**: Available from 9:00 to 17:00 (entire day).
- **Quentin**: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00.  
  Free slots:  
  - 10:00–11:30  
  - 12:00–14:00  
  - 15:00–17:00  
- **Rachel**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30.  
  Free slots:  
  - 9:00–10:00  
  - 10:30–12:30  
  - 13:00–15:30  
  - 16:30–17:00  

Now, find overlapping 30-minute slots where all are available (since Patricia is free all day, we focus on Quentin and Rachel’s common free times):  
- **9:00–10:00**: Quentin is busy (9:00–10:00), Rachel is free. No overlap.  
- **10:00–10:30**: Quentin is free (10:00–11:30), Rachel is busy (10:00–10:30). No overlap.  
- **10:30–11:30**: Quentin is free (10:00–11:30), Rachel is free (10:30–12:30). Overlap: 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes, sufficient for a 30-minute meeting).  
- **11:30–12:00**: Quentin is busy (11:30–12:00), Rachel is free (10:30–12:30). No overlap.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Quentin is free (12:00–14:00), Rachel is free (10:30–12:30). Overlap: 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes, sufficient).  
- **12:30–13:00**: Quentin is free (12:00–14:00), Rachel is busy (12:30–13:00). No overlap.  
- **13:00–14:00**: Quentin is free (12:00–14:00), Rachel is free (13:00–15:30). Overlap: 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes, sufficient).  
- **14:00–15:00**: Quentin is busy (14:00–15:00), Rachel is free (13:00–15:30). No overlap.  
- **15:00–15:30**: Quentin is free (15:00–17:00), Rachel is free (13:00–15:30). Overlap: 15:00–15:30 (30 minutes, sufficient).  
- **15:30–16:30**: Quentin is free (15:00–17:00), Rachel is busy (15:30–16:30). No overlap.  
- **16:30–17:00**: Quentin is free (15:00–17:00), Rachel is free (16:30–17:00). Overlap: 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes, sufficient).

Possible 30-minute slots: 10:30–11:00, 10:31–11:01, ..., 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, ..., 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
The earliest slot is 10:30–11:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the proposed time slot (10:30–11:00) satisfies all constraints, ensuring no participant has a conflicting meeting and the slot is within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Check the 10:30–11:00 slot:  
- **Patricia**: Free all day (9:00–17:00). No conflict.  
- **Quentin**: Free from 10:00–11:30. 10:30–11:00 is within this window. No conflict.  
- **Rachel**: Free from 10:30–12:30. 10:30–11:00 is within this window. No conflict.  
- **Time constraint**: 10:30–11:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
The slot is valid and meets all requirements.  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest valid slot (10:30–11:00). (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected slot. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final time slot and conclude the scheduling process.

### Final Answer
The earliest 30-minute time slot for the meeting that satisfies all constraints is **10:30–11:00 on Monday**. All participants (Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel) are available during this time, and it falls within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
