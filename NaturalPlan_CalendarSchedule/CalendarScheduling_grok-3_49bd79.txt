**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Mike is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- Natalie is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.
- Oliver is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).
2. Determine each participant’s free time slots by excluding their busy periods.
3. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
4. Select a suitable time slot or conclude if no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Determine each participant’s free time slots within 9:00–17:00.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the busy periods for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver, then calculate their available time slots by excluding these periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Mike’s busy periods:** 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  **Mike’s free periods:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Natalie’s busy periods:** 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
  **Natalie’s free periods:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Oliver’s busy periods:** 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  **Oliver’s free periods:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the free periods of Mike, Natalie, and Oliver to find one-hour slots where their availability intersects.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common one-hour slot, compare the free periods:
- **Mike’s free periods:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Natalie’s free periods:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Oliver’s free periods:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step-by-step comparison:**
- **9:00–9:30:** Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is busy (9:00–9:30). **No overlap.**
- **9:30–10:00:** Natalie and Oliver are free, but Mike is busy (9:30–10:30). **No overlap.**
- **10:00–10:30:** Oliver is free, but Mike is busy (9:30–10:30) and Natalie is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap.**
- **10:30–11:00:** Mike and Oliver are free, but Natalie is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap.**
- **11:00–11:30:** Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is free only until 11:30, which is less than one hour. **No overlap.**
- **11:30–12:00:** Mike is free, but Oliver is busy (11:30–12:30) and Natalie is free. **No overlap.**
- **12:00–12:30:** Natalie and Oliver are free, but Mike is busy (12:00–13:00). **No overlap.**
- **12:30–13:00:** Natalie and Oliver are free, but Mike is busy (12:00–13:00). **No overlap.**
- **13:00–13:30:** Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are free. However, this is only a 30-minute slot (13:00–13:30, as Natalie is busy 13:30–14:30). **No one-hour overlap.**
- **13:30–14:30:** Mike and Oliver are free, but Natalie is busy (13:30–14:30). **No overlap.**
- **14:30–15:30:** Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is busy (14:30–15:30). **No overlap.**
- **15:30–16:00:** Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are free. This is a 30-minute slot (15:30–16:00, as Natalie is busy 16:00–17:00). **No one-hour overlap.**
- **16:00–17:00:** Mike and Oliver are free, but Natalie is busy (16:00–17:00). **No overlap.**

**Conclusion:** No one-hour time slot exists where Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all free.

**Goal Hierarchy:**
- **Main Goal:** Schedule a one-hour meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.

  - **Subgoal 2:** Determine each participant’s free time slots (completed).
  - **Subgoal 3:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no solution found).
  - **Subgoal 4:** Select a suitable time slot or conclude if no solution exists (current goal).

**Current Goal:** Select a suitable time slot or conclude if no solution exists.

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Confirm that no one-hour time slot exists for the meeting.  
- **How to Achieve:** Re-evaluate the overlapping time slots to ensure no errors were made in the analysis.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-check the overlapping periods:
- From Step 3, the only potential slots were 13:00–13:30 and 15:30–16:00, both 30 minutes long, which do not meet the one-hour requirement.
- Verify busy periods:
  - Mike’s busy slots (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00) block early and midday options.
  - Natalie’s busy slots (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00) restrict morning and late afternoon.
  - Oliver’s busy slots (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) conflict with remaining potential slots.
- No continuous one-hour slot satisfies all participants’ availability.

**Conclusion:** The analysis is valid; no one-hour slot exists.
[/IMP]

**Final Answer:**
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday accommodates the schedules of Mike, Natalie, and Oliver. The analysis shows that their free periods only overlap in 30-minute windows (13:00–13:30 and 15:30–16:00), which are insufficient for a one-hour meeting. The primary constraints are:
- Mike’s unavailability from 12:00–13:00 blocks midday options.
- Natalie’s busy periods from 10:00–11:00 and 16:00–17:00 limit morning and late afternoon slots.
- Oliver’s busy periods, especially 11:30–12:30 and 14:30–15:30, conflict with potential overlapping times.
To proceed, consider relaxing constraints, such as shortening the meeting duration or scheduling on a different day.
