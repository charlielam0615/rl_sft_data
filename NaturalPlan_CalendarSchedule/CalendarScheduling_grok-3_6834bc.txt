**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:  
- Diana is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
- Ethan is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30.  
- Fiona is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.  
Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability, or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the selected time slot against constraints.  
4. If no slot is found, analyze conflicts to explain why.

**Step 2**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Calculate available time slots for each participant based on their busy schedules:  

- **Diana’s schedule**:  
  Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  

- **Ethan’s schedule**:  
  Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30.  
  Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  

- **Fiona’s schedule**:  
  Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free. This will be achieved by comparing the free time slots identified in the previous step and identifying common one-hour periods.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Compare the free time slots to find one-hour periods where all participants are available:  

- **Diana’s free slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Ethan’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Fiona’s free slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

Analyze hour-by-hour for a continuous one-hour slot:  
- **9:00–10:00**: Diana free (9:00–9:30), Ethan free, Fiona busy (9:00–9:30). Not viable.  
- **10:00–11:00**: Diana free (10:30–11:00), Ethan busy, Fiona free. Not viable.  
- **11:00–12:00**: Diana free (11:00–12:00), Ethan free, Fiona free (11:00–11:30). Only 30 minutes overlap (11:00–11:30). Not viable for one hour.  
- **12:00–13:00**: Diana busy, Ethan free (12:00–13:00), Fiona free (12:30–13:00). Not viable.  
- **13:00–14:00**: Diana free, Ethan free (13:00–13:30), Fiona free. Only 30 minutes overlap (13:00–13:30). Not viable for one hour.  
- **14:00–15:00**: Diana free, Ethan busy (14:00–14:30), Fiona free (14:00–14:30). Not viable.  
- **15:00–16:00**: Diana free, Ethan busy (15:30–16:00), Fiona busy (15:00–15:30). Not viable.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Diana free, Ethan free (16:30–17:00), Fiona free. Only 30 minutes overlap (16:30–17:00). Not viable for one hour.  

No continuous one-hour slot exists where all participants are free.

**Step 4**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no viable slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (pending, no slot to validate).  
  - Subgoal 4: Explain conflicts if no slot is found (next step).  

**Current Goal:** Explain why no time slot is available.  
[/REVIEW]

**Step 5**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to explain why no one-hour time slot is available for the meeting. This will be achieved by analyzing the conflicts in the participants’ schedules and summarizing the findings from the previous steps.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot is available due to the following conflicts:  
- The free time slots for Diana (9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00), Ethan (9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00), and Fiona (9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00) do not align for a continuous one-hour period.  
- The longest overlapping periods (e.g., 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 16:30–17:00) are only 30 minutes, insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
- Key conflicts include:  
  - Fiona’s unavailability at 9:00–9:30 limits early morning options.  
  - Ethan’s busy slots at 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30 fragment the day.  
  - Diana’s busy slots at 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00 further restrict overlapping times.  
Thus, no one-hour slot satisfies all constraints within 9:00–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**  
No one-hour time slot is available for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 due to conflicting schedules. The longest overlapping free periods are only 30 minutes (e.g., 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 16:30–17:00), which do not meet the one-hour requirement. Specific conflicts include Fiona’s unavailability from 9:00–9:30, Ethan’s busy periods at 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30, and Diana’s commitments from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00, which prevent a continuous one-hour overlap.
