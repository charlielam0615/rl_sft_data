**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Aaron is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00.
- Bella is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30.
- Caleb is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability. If no such slot exists, explain why.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
4. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 and find a common one-hour slot. This will be achieved by listing each participant’s free time slots and finding their intersection.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To achieve the goal, let’s analyze the schedules and identify free time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.

**Work hours:** 9:00–17:00 (8 hours total).

**Aaron’s busy times:** 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.  
**Aaron’s free times:**  
- 9:00–9:30  
- 10:30–12:00  
- 13:00–15:00  
- 16:00–17:00  

**Bella’s busy times:** 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.  
**Bella’s free times:**  
- 9:00–10:00  
- 11:00–13:30  
- 14:30–17:00  

**Caleb’s busy times:** 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
**Caleb’s free times:**  
- 9:30–11:30  
- 12:30–14:30  
- 15:30–17:00  

Now, find one-hour time slots where all participants are free by checking for overlaps:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy). Not possible.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **10:00–10:30**: Aaron (busy), Bella (busy), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **10:30–11:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **11:00–11:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free). **Possible for 30 minutes**, but not a full hour.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy). Not possible.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (busy). Not possible.  
- **12:30–13:00**: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free). **Possible for 30 minutes**, but not a full hour.  
- **13:30–14:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **14:00–14:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **14:30–15:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy). Not possible.  
- **15:00–15:30**: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (busy). Not possible.  
- **15:30–16:00**: Aaron (busy), Bella (free), Caleb (free). Not possible.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free). **Possible for a full hour**.  

The only one-hour slot where all participants are free is **16:00–17:00**.

**Step 3: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate the identified time slot (16:00–17:00) to ensure it meets all constraints, including the one-hour duration and the 9:00–17:00 work hours.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Check the identified slot (16:00–17:00):  
- **Duration**: 16:00–17:00 is exactly one hour, meeting the requirement.  
- **Work hours**: The slot is within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Aaron’s availability**: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, or 15:00–16:00).  
- **Bella’s availability**: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 10:00–11:00 or 13:30–14:30).  
- **Caleb’s availability**: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, or 14:30–15:30).  

The slot 16:00–17:00 is valid for all participants and constraints.

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: List busy time slots for each participant. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all are free. (Completed: 16:00–17:00 identified)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the identified time slot. (Completed: 16:00–17:00 validated)  

**Current Goal:** Confirm the final meeting time and present the solution.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 16:00–17:00**, as this is the only one-hour time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are all available.
