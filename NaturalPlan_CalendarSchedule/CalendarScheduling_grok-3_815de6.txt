### Problem Statement
I need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, ensuring the time slot does not conflict with their existing schedules. Zack is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00; Amy is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00; Brian is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. I will find a one-hour time slot where all three are available or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the workday (9:00–17:00).  
2. List each participant’s busy time slots and determine their free time slots.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots for all three participants that are at least one hour long.  
4. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: List each participant’s busy time slots and determine their free time slots.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the given schedules to identify busy periods, then derive free periods by excluding busy times from the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Zack’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  

- **Amy’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  

- **Brian’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping free time slots for Zack, Amy, and Brian that are at least one hour long.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of all participants to identify common periods, then check if any are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common free time slot, intersect the free periods:  
- **Zack’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- **Amy’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
- **Brian’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  

**Intersection Analysis**:  
- From 9:00–9:30: Zack and Amy are free, but Brian is busy (9:00–9:30). **Not viable**.  
- From 9:30–10:00: Amy and Brian are free, but Zack is busy (9:30–10:30). **Not viable**.  
- From 10:30–11:00: Zack and Brian are free (10:30–11:30 for Brian), but Amy is busy (10:00–11:00). **Not viable**.  
- From 11:00–11:30: Zack and Brian are free, but Amy is free only until 11:00 (too short for a one-hour meeting). **Not viable**.  
- From 11:30–12:00: Zack is free, but Brian is busy (11:30–12:30). **Not viable**.  
- From 12:30–13:00: Zack and Brian are free, but Amy is free only until 13:30 (combined with next slot).  
- From 13:00–13:30: Zack, Amy, and Brian are free (Amy until 13:30, Brian until 14:30, Zack until 17:00). Duration: 30 minutes. **Too short**.  
- From 14:30–15:30: Zack and Amy are free, but Brian is busy (14:30–15:30). **Not viable**.  
- From 15:30–16:00: Zack, Amy, and Brian are free (Amy until 16:00, Brian until 17:00, Zack until 17:00). Duration: 30 minutes. **Too short**.  
- From 16:00–17:00: Zack and Brian are free, but Amy is busy (16:00–17:00). **Not viable**.  

No overlapping period is at least one hour long.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm whether a one-hour time slot exists or provide an explanation if no solution is possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the overlapping free time slots to confirm no one-hour slot exists and explain the conflicts.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The analysis shows no one-hour time slot where Zack, Amy, and Brian are all free. The longest common free periods are:  
- 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes, limited by Amy’s meeting at 13:30–14:30).  
- 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes, limited by Amy’s meeting at 16:00–17:00).  

**Why No Solution Exists**:  
- The workday (9:00–17:00) is fragmented by the participants’ busy schedules.  
- Zack’s meetings (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00) block early and midday slots.  
- Amy’s meetings (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00) restrict morning and late afternoon availability.  
- Brian’s meetings (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) further limit overlapping free times.  
- The combination of these schedules leaves no continuous one-hour period where all three are available.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List each participant’s free time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots of at least one hour (completed, no viable slot found).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution or explain why no solution exists (completed).  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by confirming no solution exists.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Zack, Amy, and Brian due to their conflicting schedules. The longest common free periods are 13:00–13:30 and 15:30–16:00, both only 30 minutes, which are insufficient for a one-hour meeting.
