**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Mike is busy from 9:00–10:00, 12:00–12:30, and 14:00–14:30; Natalie is free all day; Oliver is busy from 10:30–11:30, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping time slots where all participants are free for at least 30 minutes.  
3. Select the earliest available time slot that satisfies the duration and constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
**How to Achieve:** List the busy periods for Mike and Oliver, note Natalie’s full availability, and calculate the free time slots for each participant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Mike’s Schedule:**
  - Busy: 9:00–10:00, 12:00–12:30, 14:00–14:30.
  - Free: 10:00–12:00, 12:30–14:00, 14:30–17:00.
- **Natalie’s Schedule:**
  - Free: 9:00–17:00 (entire day).
- **Oliver’s Schedule:**
  - Busy: 10:30–11:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find overlapping time slots where Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all free for at least 30 minutes.  
**How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots from the previous step to identify common periods and ensure they meet the 30-minute duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Mike’s Free Slots:** 10:00–12:00, 12:30–14:00, 14:30–17:00.
- **Natalie’s Free Slots:** 9:00–17:00.
- **Oliver’s Free Slots:** 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.
- **Overlapping Slots (considering Natalie’s full availability):**
  - 10:00–10:30 (Mike and Oliver free, 30 minutes).
  - 11:30–12:00 (Mike and Oliver free, 30 minutes).
  - 12:30–13:30 (Mike and Oliver free, 60 minutes).
  - 14:30–15:30 (Mike and Oliver free, 60 minutes).
  - 16:30–17:00 (Mike and Oliver free, 30 minutes).
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select the earliest available time slot that satisfies the 30-minute meeting requirement.  
**How to Achieve:** From the overlapping time slots, choose the earliest one that is at least 30 minutes long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The overlapping time slots are: 10:00–10:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30, and 16:30–17:00. The earliest slot is 10:00–10:30, which is exactly 30 minutes and meets the meeting duration requirement.  
**Proposed Meeting Time:** Monday, 10:00–10:30.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the proposed meeting time (10:00–10:30) works for all participants and meets all constraints.  
**How to Achieve:** Check the proposed time against each participant’s busy periods and confirm the duration and time window constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Mike:** Free from 10:00–12:00, so 10:00–10:30 is available.
- **Natalie:** Free all day, so 10:00–10:30 is available.
- **Oliver:** Free from 9:00–10:30, so 10:00–10:30 is available.
- **Constraints Check:**
  - Duration: 10:00–10:30 is 30 minutes, meeting the requirement.
  - Time Window: 10:00–10:30 is within 9:00–17:00.
  - Earliest Availability: 10:00–10:30 is the earliest overlapping slot.
The proposed time satisfies all constraints.

**Step 6: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping time slots of at least 30 minutes (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest valid time slot (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the proposed time slot (completed).
**Current Goal:** Finalize the meeting schedule, as all subgoals have been addressed.
**Conclusion:** The meeting is scheduled for Monday, 10:00–10:30, as it meets all constraints and is the earliest available time slot.  
[/REVIEW]
