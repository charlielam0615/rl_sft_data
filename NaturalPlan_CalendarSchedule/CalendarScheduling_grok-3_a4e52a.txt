### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Patricia**: Busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:00–14:00.
- **Quentin**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, and 15:00–16:00.
- **Rachel**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the working hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
3. Validate the selected time slot against constraints.
4. If no slot exists, analyze and explain the conflicts.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods, determining free periods, and finding a common one-hour slot.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time slot, let’s analyze each participant’s schedule and identify their free periods within 9:00–17:00:

- **Patricia’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:00–14:00
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:00, 14:00–17:00

- **Quentin’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, 15:00–16:00
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–15:00, 16:00–17:00

- **Rachel’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

Next, identify overlapping one-hour slots where all are free:
- **9:00–9:30**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy). **Not viable**.
- **9:30–10:00**: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **10:00–11:00**: Patricia (busy), Quentin (busy until 10:30), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **11:00–11:30**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free). **Viable for 30 minutes**, but not a full hour.
- **11:30–12:30**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy). **Not viable**.
- **12:30–13:00**: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **13:00–13:30**: Patricia (busy), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **13:30–14:00**: Patricia (busy), Quentin (free), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **14:00–14:30**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free). **Viable for 30 minutes**, but not a full hour.
- **14:30–15:00**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (busy). **Not viable**.
- **15:00–15:30**: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (busy). **Not viable**.
- **15:30–16:00**: Patricia (free), Quentin (busy), Rachel (free). **Not viable**.
- **16:00–17:00**: Patricia (free), Quentin (free), Rachel (free). **Viable for a full hour**.

The slot **16:00–17:00** is a one-hour period where all participants are free.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the 16:00–17:00 slot by confirming it meets the one-hour duration requirement and fits within all participants’ schedules and the 9:00–17:00 constraint.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The proposed slot is 16:00–17:00:
- **Duration**: 17:00 – 16:00 = 1 hour, satisfying the requirement.
- **Patricia**: Free from 14:00–17:00, so 16:00–17:00 is available.
- **Quentin**: Free from 16:00–17:00, so available.
- **Rachel**: Free from 15:30–17:00, so available.
- **Constraint**: The slot is within 9:00–17:00.

The slot satisfies all constraints and is valid.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, slot 16:00–17:00 identified).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (completed, slot confirmed valid).
  - Subgoal 4: Track goals and confirm the solution (current).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the solution by reviewing the goal hierarchy and ensuring all steps align.

The 16:00–17:00 slot satisfies all requirements, and no further subgoals are needed unless new constraints arise.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**.
