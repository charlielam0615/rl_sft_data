**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Patricia: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- Quentin: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- Rachel: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping available time slots that are at least one hour long.  
3. Select a suitable time slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the busy periods for each participant, determine their free periods, and calculate continuous one-hour blocks where they are available.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we first list the busy periods and then derive the free periods for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.

- **Patricia’s Schedule:**
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free periods (excluding busy times):
    - 9:00–9:30 (0.5 hours, too short for a 1-hour meeting).
    - 10:30–12:00 (1.5 hours).
    - 13:00–15:00 (2 hours).
    - 16:00–17:00 (1 hour).

- **Quentin’s Schedule:**
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:00–10:00 (1 hour).
    - 11:00–13:30 (2.5 hours).
    - 14:30–17:00 (2.5 hours).

- **Rachel’s Schedule:**
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:30–11:30 (2 hours).
    - 12:30–14:30 (2 hours).
    - 15:30–17:00 (1.5 hours).

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots where Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel are all available.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the free periods of all participants to identify common time slots that are at least one hour long.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Now, we compare the free periods to find overlaps that are at least one hour long:

- **Patricia’s free periods:** 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Quentin’s free periods:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Rachel’s free periods:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step-by-step comparison:**
1. **9:00–10:00:**
   - Patricia: Busy (9:30–10:30).
   - Quentin: Free (9:00–10:00).
   - Rachel: Busy (9:00–9:30).
   - **Result:** No overlap (Patricia and Rachel are busy at different times).

2. **10:30–11:30:**
   - Patricia: Free (10:30–12:00).
   - Quentin: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Rachel: Free (9:30–11:30).
   - **Overlap:** 11:00–11:30 (0.5 hours, too short).

3. **11:30–12:00:**
   - Patricia: Free (10:30–12:00).
   - Quentin: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Rachel: Busy (11:30–12:30).
   - **Result:** No overlap (Rachel is busy).

4. **12:30–13:30:**
   - Patricia: Busy (12:00–13:00) until 13:00, then free (13:00–15:00).
   - Quentin: Free (11:00–13:30).
   - Rachel: Free (12:30–14:30).
   - **Overlap:** 13:00–13:30 (0.5 hours, too short).

5. **13:30–14:30:**
   - Patricia: Free (13:00–15:00).
   - Quentin: Busy (13:30–14:30).
   - Rachel: Free (12:30–14:30).
   - **Result:** No overlap (Quentin is busy).

6. **14:30–15:00:**
   - Patricia: Free (13:00–15:00).
   - Quentin: Free (14:30–17:00).
   - Rachel: Busy (14:30–15:30).
   - **Result:** No overlap (Rachel is busy).

7. **15:30–17:00:**
   - Patricia: Busy (15:00–16:00) until 16:00, then free (16:00–17:00).
   - Quentin: Free (14:30–17:00).
   - Rachel: Free (15:30–17:00).
   - **Overlap:** 16:00–17:00 (1 hour).

**Conclusion:** The only overlapping time slot that is at least one hour long is 16:00–17:00.

**Step 4: Validation (Implementation)**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot is free for all participants and meets the one-hour meeting requirement.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check each participant’s schedule to confirm they have no conflicts during 16:00–17:00 and that the slot falls within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Patricia:** Free from 16:00–17:00 (no meetings scheduled).
- **Quentin:** Free from 14:30–17:00 (no meetings scheduled).
- **Rachel:** Free from 15:30–17:00 (no meetings scheduled).
- **Work Hours Constraint:** 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.
- **Duration:** The slot is exactly one hour, meeting the requirement.

**Result:** The 16:00–17:00 time slot is valid for all participants.
