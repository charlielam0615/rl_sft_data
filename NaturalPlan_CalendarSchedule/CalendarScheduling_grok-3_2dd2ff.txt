**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Irene is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30; Jack is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Kelly is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the unavailable time slots for each participant and determine the full schedule constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Collect and organize the busy time slots for Irene and Jack, note that Kelly is free all day, and represent the working hours (9:00–17:00) to understand the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Irene’s busy slots: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.  
Jack’s busy slots: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00.  
Kelly’s busy slots: None (available 9:00–17:00).  
Working hours: 9:00–17:00 (8 hours).  
The meeting requires a 30-minute slot where neither Irene nor Jack has a conflict, and Kelly’s availability is guaranteed.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find all possible 30-minute windows between 9:00 and 17:00 where Irene and Jack are both free.  
**How to Achieve**: List all 30-minute intervals in the working hours, exclude intervals that overlap with Irene’s or Jack’s busy slots, and identify the remaining free slots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Working hours (9:00–17:00) can be divided into 16 30-minute intervals: 9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, ..., 16:30–17:00.  
Irene’s busy intervals: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30.  
Jack’s busy intervals: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00.  
Excluding busy intervals:  
- 9:00–9:30: Irene is busy.  
- 10:00–10:30: Jack is busy.  
- 11:00–11:30: Irene is busy.  
- 12:30–13:00: Jack is busy.  
- 14:00–14:30: Irene is busy.  
- 15:00–15:30: Jack is busy.  
- 15:30–16:00: Jack is busy.  
Available 30-minute slots: 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest available 30-minute slot for the meeting.  
**How to Achieve**: From the list of available slots, identify the earliest one that satisfies the 30-minute duration and all participants’ availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Available slots: 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
Earliest slot: 9:30–10:00.  
Since Kelly is free all day, and Irene and Jack are both available from 9:30–10:00, this slot works for all participants.  
[/IMP]

**Step 5: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the selected time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that 9:30–10:00 does not overlap with any busy slots for Irene or Jack and fits within the 9:00–17:00 working hours.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Selected slot: 9:30–10:00.  
- Irene’s busy slots (9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30): No overlap with 9:30–10:00.  
- Jack’s busy slots (10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00): No overlap with 9:30–10:00.  
- Kelly: Free all day, so available at 9:30–10:00.  
- Duration: 30 minutes, as required.  
- Time range: Within 9:00–17:00.  
The slot satisfies all constraints.
