### Problem Statement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Rose is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- Simon is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.
- Tara is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the working hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. Determine each participant’s unavailable time slots based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Verify if any one-hour slot satisfies all constraints.  
5. If no slot is found, analyze conflicts to explain why.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 and find a one-hour slot where all are free. This will be achieved by listing busy periods, calculating free periods, and checking for a common one-hour slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Working hours**: 9:00–17:00 (8 hours total).  
- **Rose’s schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30 (1 hour), 12:00–13:00 (1 hour).  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Simon’s schedule**:  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00 (1 hour), 13:30–14:30 (1 hour), 16:00–17:00 (1 hour).  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Tara’s schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30 (0.5 hours), 11:30–12:30 (1 hour), 14:30–15:30 (1 hour).  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
- **Find common free slots**:  
  - Combine free periods and check for overlaps:  
    - 9:00–9:30: Rose free, Simon free, Tara busy.  
    - 9:30–10:00: Rose busy, Simon free, Tara free.  
    - 10:00–10:30: Rose busy, Simon busy, Tara free.  
    - 10:30–11:00: Rose free, Simon busy, Tara free.  
    - 11:00–11:30: Rose free, Simon free, Tara free.  
    - 11:30–12:00: Rose free, Simon free, Tara busy.  
    - 12:00–12:30: Rose busy, Simon free, Tara busy.  
    - 12:30–13:00: Rose busy, Simon free, Tara free.  
    - 13:00–13:30: Rose free, Simon free, Tara free.  
    - 13:30–14:30: Rose free, Simon busy, Tara free.  
    - 14:30–15:30: Rose free, Simon free, Tara busy.  
    - 15:30–16:00: Rose free, Simon free, Tara free.  
    - 16:00–17:00: Rose free, Simon busy, Tara free.  
  - **One-hour slot analysis**:  
    - 11:00–11:30: All free, but only 30 minutes.  
    - 13:00–13:30: All free, but only 30 minutes.  
    - 15:30–16:00: All free, but only 30 minutes.  
  - No continuous one-hour slot exists where all participants are free.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether the identified time slots (or lack thereof) are correct by rechecking the schedules and ensuring no one-hour slot was missed.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Recheck schedules:  
  - Rose’s free slots: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
  - Simon’s free slots: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
  - Tara’s free slots: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
- Recompute overlaps for one-hour slots:  
  - Test 11:00–12:00: Simon free, Rose free, Tara busy (11:30–12:30).  
  - Test 13:00–14:00: Rose free, Simon free, Tara free until 13:30, then free again 13:30–14:00 (no conflict).  
  - Test 15:30–16:30: Rose free, Simon free until 16:00, Tara free.  
- Correction: 13:00–14:00 is a valid one-hour slot where all are free (Rose: free 13:00–17:00, Simon: free 11:00–13:30, Tara: free 12:30–14:30).  
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine each participant’s unavailable slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed, found 13:00–14:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the slot (completed, 13:00–14:00 validated).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the identified time slot (13:00–14:00) as the solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm and present the one-hour meeting time slot (13:00–14:00) that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**Solution**: The one-hour meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **13:00 to 14:00**, as Rose, Simon, and Tara are all available during this time.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The one-hour meeting for Rose, Simon, and Tara can be scheduled on Monday from **13:00 to 14:00**.
