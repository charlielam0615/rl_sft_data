**Problem Statement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- George is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- Hannah is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.
- Ian is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the solution or determine if no such slot exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 and find a common one-hour slot. This will be achieved by listing each participant’s free time slots and checking for intersections that satisfy the one-hour duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable time slot, we first determine the free time slots for each participant by excluding their busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.

- **George’s free slots** (busy 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00):  
  - 9:00–9:30  
  - 10:30–12:00  
  - 13:00–17:00  

- **Hannah’s free slots** (busy 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00):  
  - 9:00–10:00  
  - 11:00–13:30  
  - 14:30–16:00  

- **Ian’s free slots** (busy 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30):  
  - 9:30–11:30  
  - 12:30–14:30  
  - 15:30–17:00  

Next, we find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three are free. We examine the time range 9:00–17:00 and check for intersections:

- **9:00–9:30**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (busy). **Not viable.**
- **9:30–10:00**: George (busy), Hannah (free), Ian (free). **Not viable.**
- **10:00–10:30**: George (busy), Hannah (busy), Ian (free). **Not viable.**
- **10:30–11:00**: George (free), Hannah (busy), Ian (free). **Not viable.**
- **11:00–11:30**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (free). **Viable (30 minutes, too short).**
- **11:30–12:00**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (busy). **Not viable.**
- **12:00–12:30**: George (busy), Hannah (free), Ian (busy). **Not viable.**
- **12:30–13:00**: George (busy), Hannah (free), Ian (free). **Not viable.**
- **13:00–13:30**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (free). **Viable (30 minutes, too short).**
- **13:30–14:30**: George (free), Hannah (busy), Ian (free). **Not viable.**
- **14:30–15:30**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (busy). **Not viable.**
- **15:30–16:00**: George (free), Hannah (free), Ian (free). **Viable (30 minutes, too short).**
- **16:00–17:00**: George (free), Hannah (busy), Ian (free). **Not viable.**

No continuous one-hour slot exists where all are free. The overlapping free periods (11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) are only 30 minutes long, which does not meet the one-hour requirement.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify if the identified time slots (or lack thereof) correctly satisfy the constraints. This will be achieved by rechecking the busy schedules and confirming that no one-hour overlap exists.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck the schedules to confirm the absence of a one-hour overlapping slot:  
- **George’s busy times**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
- **Hannah’s busy times**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Ian’s busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  

The free slot analysis from Step 2 is consistent: the only overlapping free times are 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, and 15:30–16:00, each 30 minutes long. To ensure no oversight, consider if any one-hour period (e.g., 10:30–11:30) works:  
- **10:30–11:30**: Includes 10:30–11:00 (Hannah busy) and 11:00–11:30 (all free). **Not viable.**  
- **12:30–13:30**: Includes 12:30–13:00 (George busy) and 13:00–13:30 (all free). **Not viable.**  
- **15:00–16:00**: Includes 15:00–15:30 (Ian busy) and 15:30–16:00 (all free). **Not viable.**

No one-hour slot satisfies all constraints. The conclusion from Step 2 holds: no solution exists.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed in Step 2, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the absence of a solution (completed in Step 3).  
- **Current goal**: Confirm and explain why no solution exists.  

The goal hierarchy reflects that all subgoals have been addressed, leading to the conclusion that no one-hour slot is available.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for George, Hannah, and Ian due to their conflicting schedules. The only overlapping free periods are 11:00–11:30, 13:00–13:30, and 15:30–16:00, each lasting 30 minutes, which is insufficient for the required one-hour meeting duration.
