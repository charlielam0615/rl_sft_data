### Problem Statement
I need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Frank**: Busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- **Grace**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30.
- **Henry**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
The goal is to find a one-hour time slot where all three participants are available. If no such slot exists, I must explain why.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find a suitable meeting time:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by listing the time periods when each participant is not busy, based on their given schedules, within the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find available time slots, I’ll analyze each participant’s schedule and determine when they are free between 9:00 and 17:00.

- **Frank’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
  - Available: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.

- **Grace’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30.
  - Available: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

- **Henry’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Available: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

These time slots represent when each participant is free to attend a one-hour meeting.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where Frank, Grace, and Henry are all available. This will be achieved by comparing their available time slots and identifying any common one-hour periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common time slot, I’ll compare the available periods for all three participants and look for a one-hour window where they overlap.

- **Frank’s available slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Grace’s available slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.
- **Henry’s available slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, I’ll check for one-hour overlaps:
- **9:00–9:30**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is busy (9:00–9:30). **No overlap**.
- **9:30–10:00**: Grace and Henry are available, but Frank is busy (9:30–10:30). **No overlap**.
- **10:30–11:00**: Frank and Henry are available, but Grace is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap**.
- **11:00–11:30**: Frank and Henry are available, but Grace is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap**.
- **11:30–12:00**: Frank is available, but Henry is busy (11:30–12:30), and Grace is available. **No overlap**.
- **12:30–13:00**: Frank, Grace, and Henry are all available (Frank: 13:00–17:00, Grace: 11:00–13:30, Henry: 12:30–14:30). **Valid one-hour slot: 12:30–13:30**.
- **13:00–13:30**: Frank, Grace, and Henry are available (same as above). **Valid one-hour slot: 13:00–14:00**.
- **13:30–14:30**: Frank and Henry are available, but Grace is busy (13:30–14:30). **No overlap**.
- **14:30–15:30**: Frank and Grace are available, but Henry is busy (14:30–15:30). **No overlap**.
- **15:30–16:30**: Frank and Henry are available, but Grace is busy (15:30–16:30). **No overlap**.
- **16:30–17:00**: Frank, Grace, and Henry are all available (Frank: 13:00–17:00, Grace: 16:30–17:00, Henry: 15:30–17:00). **Valid one-hour slot: 16:30–17:00**.

**Identified overlapping slots**:
- 12:30–13:30
- 13:00–14:00
- 16:30–17:00

All these slots are exactly one hour or can accommodate a one-hour meeting within the 9:00–17:00 window.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the identified time slots (12:30–13:30, 13:00–14:00, 16:30–17:00) to ensure they meet all constraints, including the one-hour duration and the 9:00–17:00 window, and select a suitable time slot.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
I’ll verify each identified time slot:
- **12:30–13:30**:
  - Frank: Available (13:00–17:00).
  - Grace: Available (11:00–13:30).
  - Henry: Available (12:30–14:30).
  - Duration: Exactly one hour.
  - Within 9:00–17:00: Yes.
  - **Valid**.
- **13:00–14:00**:
  - Frank: Available (13:00–17:00).
  - Grace: Available (11:00–13:30, but 13:30–14:00 overlaps with busy time 13:30–14:30).
  - Henry: Available (12:30–14:30).
  - Issue: Grace is busy from 13:30–14:30, so this slot is not fully available. **Invalid**.
- **16:30–17:00**:
  - Frank: Available (13:00–17:00).
  - Grace: Available (16:30–17:00).
  - Henry: Available (15:30–17:00).
  - Duration: Exactly one hour.
  - Within 9:00–17:00: Yes.
  - **Valid**.

**Valid time slots**: 12:30–13:30 and 16:30–17:00. Since the problem asks for a time that works, I’ll select the earliest valid slot, 12:30–13:30, unless preferences (none provided) suggest otherwise.

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal to provide context for the final solution.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant.
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots.
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the identified time slots and select a suitable one.

**Current Goal**: Provide the final validated time slot for the meeting.

**Context**: The available time slots were identified, overlaps were found, and validated slots are 12:30–13:30 and 16:30–17:00. The earliest slot, 12:30–13:30, is selected as it meets all constraints.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
A suitable time for the one-hour meeting for Frank, Grace, and Henry on Monday is **12:30–13:30**.
