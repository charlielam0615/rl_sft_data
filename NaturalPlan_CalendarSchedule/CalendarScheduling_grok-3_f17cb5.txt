### Problem Statement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Mike**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- **Natalie**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- **Oliver**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.

The goal is to find a one-hour time slot where all three are available. If no such slot exists, provide a detailed explanation.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant based on their busy schedules.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.

**How to Achieve**: List the busy times for each participant, then determine their free time slots by excluding busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window. Represent time slots in a way that facilitates finding overlaps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we first list the busy periods and then derive the free periods for each participant within 9:00–17:00.

- **Mike’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.

- **Natalie’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.

- **Oliver’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, we need to find one-hour time slots where these free periods overlap for all three participants. To do this, we consider the time range 9:00–17:00 and identify continuous one-hour blocks where all are free.

Let’s break down the day into one-hour slots (starting on the hour or half-hour, as busy times align with these boundaries) and check availability:

- **9:00–10:00**:
  - Mike: Free (9:00–9:30, busy 9:30–10:30).
  - Natalie: Free (9:00–10:00).
  - Oliver: Busy (9:00–9:30).
  - **Result**: Not possible (Oliver is busy).

- **9:30–10:30**:
  - Mike: Busy (9:30–10:30).
  - Natalie: Free until 10:00, then busy (10:00–11:00).
  - Oliver: Free (9:30–11:30).
  - **Result**: Not possible (Mike and Natalie are busy for parts of this slot).

- **10:00–11:00**:
  - Mike: Busy until 10:30, then free (10:30–12:00).
  - Natalie: Busy (10:00–11:00).
  - Oliver: Free (9:30–11:30).
  - **Result**: Not possible (Natalie is busy).

- **10:30–11:30**:
  - Mike: Free (10:30–12:00).
  - Natalie: Busy until 11:00, then free (11:00–13:30).
  - Oliver: Free (9:30–11:30).
  - **Result**: Not possible (Natalie is busy until 11:00).

- **11:00–12:00**:
  - Mike: Free (10:30–12:00).
  - Natalie: Free (11:00–13:30).

- **11:30–12:30**:
  - Mike: Free until 12:00, then busy (12:00–13:00).
  - Natalie: Free (11:00–13:30).

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Current Goal**: Validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot satisfies all constraints.

**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the identified slot (16:00–17:00) is within the 9:00–17:00 window, is one hour long, and does not overlap with any busy periods for Mike, Natalie, or Oliver.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Window Check**: The slot 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.
- **Duration Check**: The slot is exactly one hour (16:00 to 17:00).
- **Availability Check**:
  - Mike: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflicts with 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00).
  - Natalie: Free from 14:30–17:00 (no conflicts with 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30).
  - Oliver: Free from 15:30–17:00 (no conflicts with 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).
- **Conclusion**: The 16:00–17:00 slot is valid, as it meets all constraints.
