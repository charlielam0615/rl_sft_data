**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Wendy has meetings from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30. Xavier is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00. Yvonne has no scheduled meetings. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the workday (9:00-17:00).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies the constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for all participants and determine the earliest 30-minute slot for the meeting.  
- **How to Achieve:** Analyze the schedules of Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne to find 30-minute windows between 9:00 and 17:00 where no one has a conflict, starting from the earliest possible time.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Workday Constraints:** The meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday and last 30 minutes.  
- **Participants’ Schedules:**  
  - Wendy is busy: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30.  
  - Xavier is busy: 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00.  
  - Yvonne is free all day.  
- **Available Time Slots:**  
  - Break the workday (9:00-17:00) into 30-minute intervals:  
    9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.  
  - Check each interval for conflicts:  
    - 9:00-9:30: Wendy is busy.  
    - 9:30-10:00: No conflicts (all free).  
    - 10:00-10:30: Xavier is busy.  
    - 10:30-11:00: No conflicts.  
    - 11:00-11:30: Wendy is busy.  
    - 11:30-12:00: No conflicts.  
    - 12:00-12:30: No conflicts.  
    - 12:30-13:00: Xavier is busy.  
    - 13:00-13:30: No conflicts.  
    - 13:30-14:00: No conflicts.  
    - 14:00-14:30: Wendy is busy.  
    - 14:30-15:00: No conflicts.  
    - 15:00-15:30: No conflicts.  
    - 15:30-16:00: Xavier is busy.  
    - 16:00-16:30: No conflicts.  
    - 16:30-17:00: No conflicts.  
- **Earliest Available Slot:** The earliest 30-minute slot where all participants are free is 9:30-10:00.

**Step 3: Validation**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the proposed time slot (9:30-10:00) satisfies all constraints.  
- **How to Achieve:** Confirm that Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne are free during 9:30-10:00 and that the slot meets the 30-minute duration and workday constraints.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Proposed Slot:** 9:30-10:00.  
- **Verification:**  
  - Wendy: Free (no meetings; her 9:00-9:30 meeting ends before 9:30).  
  - Xavier: Free (no meetings; his 10:00-10:30 meeting starts after 10:00).  
  - Yvonne: Free (entire day is open).  
  - Duration: 9:30-10:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
  - Workday Constraints: The slot is within 9:00-17:00.  
- **Conclusion:** The 9:30-10:00 slot is valid and satisfies all constraints.
