**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: George is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Hannah is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30; Ian is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the working hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. Determine each participant’s unavailable time slots based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select a one-hour time slot that fits within the overlapping availability.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify each participant’s unavailable time slots based on their schedules. This will be achieved by listing the busy time slots provided for George, Hannah, and Ian and calculating their free time within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **George’s schedule**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.  
  Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Hannah’s schedule**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.  
  Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Ian’s schedule**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping available time slots for George, Hannah, and Ian that can accommodate a one-hour meeting. This will be achieved by comparing their free time slots and identifying a common one-hour period.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:  
- **George**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Hannah**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Ian**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

**Step-by-step comparison**:  
- **9:00–9:30**: George and Hannah are free, but Ian is busy.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Hannah and Ian are free, but George is busy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:00–10:30**: Ian is free, but Hannah is busy (10:00–11:00) and George is busy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:30–11:00**: George and Ian are free, but Hannah is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **11:00–11:30**: George and Ian are free, but Hannah is free only until 11:00, so not a full hour.  
- **11:30–12:00**: George is free, but Ian is busy (11:30–12:30). Hannah is free.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Hannah and Ian are free, but George is busy (12:00–13:00).  
- **12:30–13:00**: Hannah and Ian are free, but George is busy (12:00–13:00).  
- **13:00–13:30**: George and Hannah are free, but Ian is busy until 12:30, so not a full hour.  
- **13:30–14:30**: George and Ian are free, but Hannah is busy (13:30–14:30).  
- **14:30–15:00**: George and Hannah are free, but Ian is busy (14:30–15:30).  
- **15:00–15:30**: Hannah and Ian are free, but George is busy (15:00–16:00).  
- **15:30–16:00**: Hannah and Ian are free, but George is busy (15:00–16:00).  
- **16:00–17:00**: George, Hannah, and Ian are all free.  

A one-hour slot is available from **16:00–17:00**.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot is a valid solution by confirming it fits within the 9:00–17:00 constraint and satisfies all participants’ availability for a one-hour meeting.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- The proposed slot is 16:00–17:00, which is within the working hours of 9:00–17:00.  
- **George**: Free from 16:00–17:00.  
- **Hannah**: Free from 14:30–17:00, so available at 16:00–17:00.  
- **Ian**: Free from 15:30–17:00, so available at 16:00–17:00.  
- The slot is exactly one hour and does not overlap with any busy periods.  
The 16:00–17:00 slot is valid.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine each participant’s unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed, identified 16:00–17:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select and validate a one-hour time slot (completed, validated 16:00–17:00).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and conclude the scheduling process.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**  
The one-hour meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**. This time slot accommodates everyone’s availability within the 9:00–17:00 working hours.
