### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, ensuring the time slot does not conflict with their existing schedules. The constraints are:

- **Patricia's busy times**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00
- **Quentin's busy times**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00
- **Rachel's busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30
- **Meeting duration**: 1 hour
- **Time constraint**: Between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday

We need to find a one-hour time slot where all three participants are available or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Determine the free time slots for each participant.  
4. Find the intersection of free time slots to identify a common one-hour slot.  
5. Validate the solution or explain if no solution exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: List the busy and free time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: Compile the busy times from the given schedules and calculate the free time slots within 9:00–17:00 for each participant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Patricia's schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- **Quentin's schedule**:  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
- **Rachel's schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available.  
**How to Achieve**: Identify the intersection of free time slots from Step 2 and check for a continuous one-hour period within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:  
- **Patricia's free slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00  
- **Quentin's free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00  
- **Rachel's free slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  

**Intersection of free slots**:  
- From 9:00–9:30: Patricia and Quentin are free, but Rachel is busy.  
- From 9:30–10:00: Patricia and Rachel are free, but Quentin is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- From 10:30–11:30: Patricia and Rachel are free, but Quentin is busy until 11:00. The overlap from 10:30–11:00 is only 30 minutes, insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
- From 11:00–11:30: Patricia and Rachel are free, Quentin is free, but this is only 30 minutes.  
- From 11:30–12:00: Patricia and Quentin are free, but Rachel is busy (11:30–12:30).  
- From 12:30–13:00: Patricia and Rachel are free, but Quentin is busy (13:30–14:30, and no overlap before 13:30).  
- From 13:00–13:30: Patricia and Rachel are free, but Quentin is busy.  
- From 14:30–15:30: Patricia and Quentin are free, but Rachel is busy (14:30–15:30).  
- From 15:30–16:00: Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel are free, but this is only 30 minutes.  
- From 16:00–17:00: Patricia and Rachel are free, but Quentin is busy (16:00–17:00).  

No continuous one-hour slot exists where all three are free.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm whether a one-hour common slot exists or explain why no solution is possible.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the intersection of free time slots to ensure no errors and provide a clear explanation if no slot is found.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-checking the free time slots:  
- The longest common free periods are 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes, limited by Quentin’s 10:00–11:00 meeting) and 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes, limited by Quentin’s 16:00–17:00 meeting).  
- No other periods provide a continuous one-hour overlap due to conflicting busy times.  

**Conclusion**: No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 satisfies the availability of all three participants. The primary conflicts are:  
- Rachel’s 9:00–9:30 and 11:30–12:30 busy times limit early and midday options.  
- Quentin’s 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00 busy times restrict morning, afternoon, and late-day slots.  
- Patricia’s 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00 busy times further constrain overlaps.  
The schedules are too fragmented to accommodate a one-hour meeting.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00 (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List busy and free time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find a common one-hour slot (attempted, no solution found).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the result (completed, no solution confirmed).  

**Current Goal**: Report the final outcome.  
No further subgoals are needed, as the validation confirmed no viable time slot exists.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday is available for Patricia, Quentin, and Rachel due to conflicting schedules. The longest common free periods are 10:30–11:00 and 15:30–16:00 (both 30 minutes), which are insufficient for a one-hour meeting.
