### Problem Statement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Olivia: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
- Peter: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
- Quinn: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot where all participants are available for a continuous one-hour meeting.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping time slots where all participants are free for at least one hour.
3. Select a suitable one-hour time slot that satisfies all constraints.
4. If no overlapping slot exists, analyze and explain why.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods for each participant.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots:
- **Olivia’s schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Peter’s schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Quinn’s schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where Olivia, Peter, and Quinn are all free. This will be achieved by comparing the free time slots identified in the previous step and checking for continuous one-hour periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the free time slots:
- **Olivia’s free slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Peter’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Quinn’s free slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Find intersections for a continuous one-hour slot:
- **9:00–9:30**: Olivia and Peter are free, but Quinn is busy. (No overlap.)
- **9:30–10:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy from 10:00. (Max 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **10:30–11:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy until 11:00. (Max 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **11:00–11:30**: Olivia, Peter, and Quinn are free. (Only 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **11:30–12:00**: Olivia and Peter are free, but Quinn is busy from 11:30. (Max 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **12:30–13:00**: Olivia (free until 13:00), Peter, and Quinn are free. (Only 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **13:00–13:30**: Peter and Quinn are free, but Olivia is busy. (No overlap.)
- **14:30–15:00**: Peter and Quinn are free, but Olivia is busy from 15:00. (Max 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **15:30–16:00**: Peter and Quinn are free, but Olivia is busy until 16:00. (Max 30 minutes, insufficient.)
- **16:00–17:00**: Olivia, Peter, and Quinn are all free. (One-hour slot available from 16:00–17:00.)

A valid one-hour slot exists from **16:00–17:00**.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot is free for all participants and meets the one-hour duration requirement. This will be achieved by rechecking the schedules for conflicts.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the 16:00–17:00 slot:
- **Olivia**: Busy 15:00–16:00, free 16:00–17:00. (No conflict.)
- **Peter**: Free 14:30–17:00. (No conflict.)
- **Quinn**: Free 15:30–17:00. (No conflict.)
The slot 16:00–17:00 is free for all participants and satisfies the one-hour duration requirement.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant. (Completed in Step 2.)
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots. (Completed in Step 3.)
  - Subgoal 3: Select and validate a suitable time slot. (Completed in Step 4.)
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time based on the validated slot.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to confirm the final meeting time based on the validated slot. This will be achieved by stating the 16:00–17:00 slot as the solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as this time slot is free for all participants and meets the duration requirement.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**.
