**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
2. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify available time slots for Clara, Daniel, and Eve within 9:00–17:00.  
- **How to Achieve:** List each participant’s unavailable time slots, determine their free periods, and represent the workday as a timeline to identify all possible 30-minute slots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Clara’s Schedule:** Free from 9:00–17:00 (entire workday).  
- **Daniel’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
  - Free: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Eve’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  

Represent the workday (9:00–17:00) as 30-minute intervals:  
- 9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:00–14:30, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  

Check each interval for availability:  
- **9:00–9:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (busy), Eve (free) → Not available.  
- **9:30–10:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (busy), Eve (free) → Not available.  
- **10:00–10:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (busy) → Not available.  
- **10:30–11:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **11:00–11:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **11:30–12:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (busy), Eve (free) → Not available.  
- **12:00–12:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **12:30–13:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (busy) → Not available.  
- **13:00–13:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **13:30–14:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **14:00–14:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (busy), Eve (free) → Not available.  
- **14:30–15:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (busy), Eve (free) → Not available.  
- **15:00–15:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  
- **15:30–16:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (busy) → Not available.  
- **16:00–16:30:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (busy) → Not available.  
- **16:30–17:00:** Clara (free), Daniel (free), Eve (free) → Available.  

Available 30-minute slots: 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Select the earliest available 30-minute slot from the identified overlapping slots.  
- **How to Achieve:** Review the list of available slots and choose the earliest one that meets the 30-minute duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
From the available slots (10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00), the earliest slot is **10:30–11:00**. This satisfies the requirement to schedule the meeting at the earliest availability.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Verify that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) is valid for all participants.  
- **How to Achieve:** Check the selected slot against each participant’s busy schedule to confirm no conflicts exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Selected Slot: 10:30–11:00**  
- **Clara:** Free all day → No conflict.  
- **Daniel:** Busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00 → Free at 10:30–11:00, no conflict.  
- **Eve:** Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30 → Free at 10:30–11:00, no conflict.  

The slot 10:30–11:00 is valid as all participants are available.
