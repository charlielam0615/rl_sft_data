**Problem Statement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Julia is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30; Kevin is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Laura is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time window (9:00–17:00) and the required meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are available.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the time slots within 9:00–17:00 where Julia, Kevin, and Laura are all available for a 30-minute meeting. This will be achieved by listing the busy times, determining free time slots, and finding a 30-minute window where all participants are available, prioritizing the earliest possible time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time Window**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (8 hours = 480 minutes).  
- **Busy Times**:  
  - Julia: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30 (30-minute blocks).  
  - Kevin: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00 (30-minute, 30-minute, and 60-minute blocks).  
  - Laura: No busy times (available 9:00–17:00).  
- **Free Times Calculation**:  
  - Convert the day into 30-minute intervals from 9:00 to 17:00:  
    9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:00–14:30, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00 (16 slots).  
  - Mark busy slots:  
    - Julia: Busy at 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30 (slots 1, 5, 11).  
    - Kevin: Busy at 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00 (slots 3, 8, 13–14).  
    - Laura: Available for all slots.  
  - Available slots (where neither Julia nor Kevin is busy):  
    - Slots 2 (9:30–10:00), 4 (10:30–11:00), 6 (11:30–12:00), 7 (12:00–12:30), 9 (13:00–13:30), 10 (13:30–14:00), 12 (14:30–15:00), 15 (16:00–16:30), 16 (16:30–17:00).  
- **Earliest Availability**: The earliest 30-minute slot where all are available is 9:30–10:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the proposed time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints: the meeting is 30 minutes long, occurs between 9:00 and 17:00, and all participants (Julia, Kevin, Laura) are available during this time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check Duration**: The proposed slot (9:30–10:00) is exactly 30 minutes.  
- **Check Time Window**: The slot is within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Check Availability**:  
  - Julia: Not busy at 9:30–10:00 (busy at 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30).  
  - Kevin: Not busy at 9:30–10:00 (busy at 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00).  
  - Laura: Available all day, including 9:30–10:00.  
- **Conclusion**: The slot 9:30–10:00 is valid as it meets all constraints.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time window and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List busy time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all are available (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest available 30-minute slot (completed: 9:30–10:00 proposed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the proposed time slot (completed: 9:30–10:00 validated).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final scheduling decision based on the validated time slot.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Julia, Kevin, and Laura are all available.
