**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Sam is free all day, Tina has meetings from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–15:00, and Victor is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:30, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest available time that works for all participants.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and confirm the meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ availability by analyzing their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available time slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Determine the availability of Sam, Tina, and Victor within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
**How to Achieve:** Analyze each participant’s schedule to identify their free time slots, then find the intersection of these slots to determine common availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Sam’s Availability:** Free from 9:00 to 17:00.  
- **Tina’s Availability:**  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–15:00.  
  - Free: 9:30–11:00, 11:30–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Victor’s Availability:**  
  - Busy: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:30, 15:30–16:30.  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Common Availability:** Compare free slots:  
  - 9:00–9:30: Tina is busy, Victor and Sam are free → Not viable.  
  - 9:30–10:00: All are free → Viable (30 minutes).  
  - 10:30–11:00: Tina and Sam are free, Victor is free → Viable (30 minutes).  
  - 11:30–12:30: Tina and Sam are free, Victor is free → Viable (60 minutes, can fit 30 minutes).  
  - 13:30–14:00: Tina and Sam are free, Victor is free → Viable (30 minutes).  
  - 15:00–15:30: Tina and Sam are free, Victor is free → Viable (30 minutes).  
  - 16:30–17:00: Tina and Sam are free, Victor is free → Viable (30 minutes).

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the common availability.  
**How to Achieve:** Review the identified common time slots and choose the earliest one that meets the 30-minute requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the common availability identified:  
- Earliest slot: 9:30–10:00 (30 minutes).  
- Other viable slots: 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
Since the preference is for the earliest availability, the 9:30–10:00 slot is selected.  
**Proposed Meeting Time:** Monday, 9:30–10:00.  
[/IMP]

---

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the proposed 9:30–10:00 slot satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve:** Check each participant’s schedule to confirm no conflicts exist in the 9:30–10:00 slot and ensure it meets the 30-minute duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Sam:** Free all day, including 9:30–10:00 → No conflict.  
- **Tina:** Free from 9:30–11:00 → No conflict.  
- **Victor:** Free from 9:00–10:00 → No conflict.  
- **Duration:** 9:30–10:00 is exactly 30 minutes, meeting the requirement.  
- **Time Range:** 9:30–10:00 falls within 9:00–17:00.  
The proposed time slot is valid.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify time range and duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List participants’ availability (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping 30-minute slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select earliest slot (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot (completed).  
**Current Goal:** Finalize the meeting schedule, as all subgoals are completed.  
**Outcome:** The meeting is scheduled for Monday, 9:30–10:00, as it satisfies all constraints and is the earliest available slot.  
[/REVIEW]
