**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, considering their existing schedules: Zack is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Amy is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30; Brian is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Find a time slot that works for all participants, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00).  
2. Determine each participant's free time slots based on their busy schedules.  
3. Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
4. Validate the solution or identify conflicts if no overlap exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify each participant's free time slots based on their busy schedules.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy time slots for Zack, Amy, and Brian, then derive their free time slots within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy periods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Zack’s Schedule**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.  
  Free slots: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Amy’s Schedule**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.  
  Free slots: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Brian’s Schedule**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  Free slots: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of Zack, Amy, and Brian to identify periods where all are available for at least one continuous hour.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:  
- **Zack’s free slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Amy’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Brian’s free slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

**Step-by-step comparison**:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Zack and Amy are free, but Brian is busy (9:00–9:30). No overlap.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Amy and Brian are free, but Zack is busy (9:30–10:30). No overlap.  
- **10:00–10:30**: Brian is free, but Amy (10:00–11:00) and Zack (9:30–10:30) are busy. No overlap.  
- **10:30–11:00**: Zack and Brian are free, but Amy is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
- **11:00–11:30**: Zack and Brian are free, but Amy is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Zack is free, but Brian is busy (11:30–12:30), and Amy is free. No overlap.  
- **12:00–12:30**: Amy is free, but Zack (12:00–13:00) and Brian (11:30–12:30) are busy. No overlap.  
- **12:30–13:00**: Amy and Brian are free, but Zack is busy (12:00–13:00). No overlap.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Zack and Amy are free, but Brian is busy (12:30–14:30). No overlap.  
- **13:30–14:30**: Zack and Brian are busy (13:30–14:30 for Brian, partial overlap with Zack’s 13:00–15:00), Amy is busy (13:30–14:30). No overlap.  
- **14:30–15:00**: Zack and Amy are free, but Brian is busy (14:30–15:30). No overlap.  
- **15:00–15:30**: Amy and Brian are free, but Zack is busy (15:00–16:00). No overlap.  
- **15:30–16:00**: Amy and Brian are free, but Zack is busy (15:00–16:00). No overlap.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Zack, Amy, and Brian are all free. This slot is one hour long and satisfies the requirement.  

**Potential slot**: 16:00–17:00.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the identified time slot (16:00–17:00) is valid for all participants and meets the one-hour duration requirement.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the schedules to confirm no conflicts exist in the 16:00–17:00 slot and ensure it fits within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Zack**: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with busy slots 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00).  
- **Amy**: Free from 14:30–17:00 (no conflict with busy slots 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30).  
- **Brian**: Free from 15:30–17:00 (no conflict with busy slots 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).  
- **Duration**: The slot 16:00–17:00 is exactly one hour and within 9:00–17:00.  

The slot 16:00–17:00 is valid for all participants.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian between 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots within 9:00–17:00. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine each participant's free time slots. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping free time slots that are at least one hour long. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution or identify conflicts. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling process by confirming the valid time slot.  

The identified time slot of 16:00–17:00 has been validated and meets all requirements.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from 16:00 to 17:00, as all participants (Zack, Amy, and Brian) are available during this one-hour slot within the work hours of 9:00–17:00.
