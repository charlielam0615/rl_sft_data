**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Wendy's busy times are 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00. Xavier is busy from 10:30–11:30 and 13:30–14:30. Yvonne is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, and 14:30–15:30. Identify a one-hour time slot where all are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping available time slots that are at least one hour long.
3. Validate the identified time slot against all constraints.
4. If no slot is found, analyze conflicts to explain why no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)

**Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.

**How to Achieve**: List the busy times for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne, then determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00. Break the day into one-hour blocks and check availability for each participant.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Wendy's Availability**:
  - Busy: 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00
  - Available: 10:00–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00
- **Xavier's Availability**:
  - Busy: 10:30–11:30, 13:30–14:30
  - Available: 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–17:00
- **Yvonne's Availability**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30
  - Available: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

Now, identify one-hour blocks where all are available:
- 9:00–10:00: Wendy is busy, Xavier and Yvonne are free (partially for Yvonne).
- 10:00–11:00: Yvonne is busy until 10:30, Xavier is busy from 10:30.
- 11:00–12:00: Xavier is busy until 11:30, Wendy is free, Yvonne is free.
- 12:00–13:00: Wendy is busy, Yvonne is busy from 12:30.
- 13:00–14:00: Xavier is busy from 13:30, Yvonne is busy until 13:30.
- 14:00–15:00: Xavier is busy until 14:30, Yvonne is busy from 14:30.
- 15:00–16:00: Wendy is busy, Yvonne is busy until 15:30.
- 16:00–17:00: All are free (Wendy: 16:00–17:00, Xavier: 14:30–17:00, Yvonne: 15:30–17:00).

The only one-hour block where all are available is 16:00–17:00.

**Step 3: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)

**Goal**: Validate the identified 16:00–17:00 time slot.

**How to Achieve**: Confirm that the 16:00–17:00 slot satisfies the one-hour duration requirement and that no participant has a conflict during this time.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- The meeting requires a continuous one-hour slot.
- For 16:00–17:00:
  - Wendy is free (available 16:00–17:00).
  - Xavier is free (available 14:30–17:00).
  - Yvonne is free (available 15:30–17:00).
- No conflicts exist, and the slot is exactly one hour long.

The 16:00–17:00 slot is valid.

**Step 4: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed: 16:00–17:00 identified).
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the identified time slot (completed: 16:00–17:00 is valid).
  - Subgoal 4: If no slot is found, explain conflicts (not needed).

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and conclude the solution.

The 16:00–17:00 slot has been identified and validated as the solution.
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from 16:00 to 17:00, as it is the only one-hour time slot where Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne are all available.
