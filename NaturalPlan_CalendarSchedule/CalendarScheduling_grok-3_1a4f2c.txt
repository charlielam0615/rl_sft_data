### Problem Statement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Xander has meetings from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30; Yvonne is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00; Zoe is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time window (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find common available time slots by comparing schedules.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
5. Validate the solution or identify if no solution exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to identify the available time slots for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe within 9:00–17:00 on Monday and find a 30-minute slot where all are free. This will be achieved by listing their unavailable times, determining free periods, and identifying overlapping availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable meeting time:  
1. **List unavailable times:**  
   - Xander: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30  
   - Yvonne: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00  
   - Zoe: None (free all day)  
2. **Determine available times for each participant:**  
   - Xander’s free periods: 9:30–11:00, 11:30–14:00, 14:30–17:00  
   - Yvonne’s free periods: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:00–17:00  
   - Zoe: Free from 9:00–17:00  
3. **Find common available 30-minute slots:**  
   - Compare Xander’s and Yvonne’s free periods (since Zoe is free all day):  
     - 9:30–10:00 (30 minutes, both free)  
     - 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes, both free)  
     - 11:30–12:30 (1 hour, both free)  
     - 13:00–14:00 (1 hour, both free)  
     - 14:30–15:30 (1 hour, both free)  
     - 16:00–17:00 (1 hour, both free)  
4. **Select earliest slot:** The earliest 30-minute slot is 9:30–10:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to validate that the 9:30–10:00 slot is free for all participants and meets the 30-minute duration requirement within 9:00–17:00. This will be achieved by rechecking each participant’s schedule for conflicts during this time.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Xander:** Free from 9:30–11:00 (no conflict at 9:30–10:00).  
- **Yvonne:** Free from 9:00–10:00 (no conflict at 9:30–10:00).  
- **Zoe:** Free all day (no conflict).  
- **Duration and time window:** The slot is 30 minutes and within 9:00–17:00.  
The 9:30–10:00 slot is valid for all participants.  
[/IMP]

**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Current Goal:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify time window and duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find common available time slots (completed: 9:30–10:00 identified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed: 9:30–10:00 is valid).  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the final meeting time.  
The goal hierarchy is up-to-date, and the current goal is to finalize the 9:30–10:00 slot as the solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for Monday from **9:30–10:00**, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Xander, Yvonne, and Zoe are all available within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
