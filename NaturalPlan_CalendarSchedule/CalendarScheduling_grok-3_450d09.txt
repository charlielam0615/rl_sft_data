### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Liam is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00.
- Mia is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30.
- Noah is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Verify that the identified slot meets the one-hour duration requirement and is within the specified work hours.  
4. If no slot is found, analyze the schedules to confirm the absence of a solution.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy time slots for Liam, Mia, and Noah, and determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we analyze each participant’s schedule:

- **Liam’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.

- **Mia’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.

- **Noah’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

These free time slots will be used to find overlapping periods.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of Liam, Mia, and Noah to identify common one-hour periods within 9:00–17:00.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:

- **Liam’s Free Slots**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Mia’s Free Slots**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Noah’s Free Slots**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

We check for one-hour overlaps:

1. **9:00–9:30**: Liam and Mia are free, but Noah is busy (9:00–9:30). No overlap.
2. **9:30–10:00**: Liam and Noah are free, but Mia is busy (10:00–11:00, so 9:30–10:00 is partially busy). No full one-hour slot.
3. **10:30–11:00**: Liam and Noah are free, but Mia is busy (10:00–11:00). No overlap.
4. **11:00–11:30**: Liam and Noah are free, but Mia is free only until 11:00 (busy 10:00–11:00). No full one-hour slot.
5. **11:30–12:00**: Liam is free, but Noah is busy (11:30–12:30). No overlap.
6. **12:30–13:00**: Liam and Noah are free, but Mia is free only until 13:30 (busy 13:30–14:30). No full one-hour slot.
7. **13:00–13:30**: Liam and Noah are free, but Mia is free only until 13:30. No full one-hour slot.
8. **14:30–15:00**: Liam and Mia are free, but Noah is busy (14:30–15:30). No overlap.
9. **15:30–16:00**: Mia and Noah are free, but Liam is busy (15:00–16:00). No overlap.
10. **16:00–17:00**: Liam, Mia, and Noah are all free.

The period **16:00–17:00** is a one-hour slot where all participants are available.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the identified time slot (16:00–17:00) is valid.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm that 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00, is exactly one hour, and does not conflict with any participant’s busy periods.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Window**: 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.
- **Duration**: The slot is exactly one hour (17:00 – 16:00 = 1 hour).
- **Conflicts**:
  - Liam: Free from 16:00–17:00 (no conflict with 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00).
  - Mia: Free from 14:30–17:00 (no conflict with 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30).
  - Noah: Free from 15:30–17:00 (no conflict with 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).
- **Conclusion**: The slot 16:00–17:00 is valid.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, identified 16:00–17:00).
  - Subgoal 3: Verify the identified slot (completed, 16:00–17:00 is valid).
  - Subgoal 4: If no slot is found, explain why (not needed, as a slot was found).

**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time.  
The identified time slot (16:00–17:00) satisfies all constraints and is ready to be proposed.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as all participants—Liam, Mia, and Noah—are available during this one-hour time slot within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
