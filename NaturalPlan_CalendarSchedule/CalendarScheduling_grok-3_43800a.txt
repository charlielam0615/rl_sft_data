### Problem Restatement
I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules and prioritizing the earliest possible time slot. George's calendar is completely open. Hannah is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Ian is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. I will find a time that satisfies all constraints or explain why no such time exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that fits within the constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for George, Hannah, and Ian within 9:00–17:00 and find a 30-minute slot where all are free. This will be achieved by listing their busy times, determining their available times, and finding a common 30-minute slot, prioritizing the earliest availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable meeting time:  
1. **George’s Schedule**: Completely open from 9:00–17:00, so he is available for any 30-minute slot.  
2. **Hannah’s Busy Times**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
   - Available: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
3. **Ian’s Busy Times**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
   - Available: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
4. **Find Overlapping Availability**: Since George is free all day, we need the intersection of Hannah’s and Ian’s available times:  
   - 9:00–10:00: Hannah is busy, Ian is free (no overlap).  
   - 10:00–10:30: Hannah is free, Ian is busy (no overlap).  
   - 10:30–11:30: Both free (1-hour slot, fits 30 minutes).  
   - 12:00–12:30: Hannah is free, Ian is free (30-minute slot).  
   - 13:00–14:00: Hannah is free, Ian is free (1-hour slot, fits 30 minutes).  
   - 15:00–15:30: Hannah is free, Ian is free (30-minute slot).  
   - 16:30–17:00: Hannah is free, Ian is free (30-minute slot).  
5. **Earliest Availability**: The earliest common slot is 10:30–11:30, which can accommodate a 30-minute meeting (e.g., 10:30–11:00).  
**Proposed Meeting Time**: 10:30–11:00 on Monday.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the proposed meeting time (10:30–11:00) satisfies all participants’ schedules and the time constraints (9:00–17:00, 30 minutes). This will be achieved by checking each participant’s availability during the proposed slot.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **George**: Free all day, so available at 10:30–11:00.  
- **Hannah**: Free from 10:00–11:30, so 10:30–11:00 is within her available time.  
- **Ian**: Free from 10:30–12:30, so 10:30–11:00 is within his available time.  
- **Constraints**: The slot is 30 minutes long and within 9:00–17:00.  
**Conclusion**: The time 10:30–11:00 is valid for all participants and meets all constraints.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List all participants’ unavailable time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed, proposed 10:30–11:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the proposed time slot (completed, validated).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time based on validated results.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for **10:30–11:00 on Monday**, as it is the earliest 30-minute slot within 9:00–17:00 where George, Hannah, and Ian are all available.
