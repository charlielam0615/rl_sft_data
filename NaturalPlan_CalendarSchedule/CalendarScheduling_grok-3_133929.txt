**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:  
- Irene is busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.  
- Jack is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.  
- Kelly is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.  
Find a time slot that works for all participants or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify available time slots for each participant.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the busy time slots for Irene, Jack, and Kelly, then determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy periods.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Irene’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Jack’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Kelly’s Schedule:**  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

**Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots of Irene, Jack, and Kelly to identify any one-hour period where all are available.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free time slots:  
- **Irene’s Free Slots:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Jack’s Free Slots:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Kelly’s Free Slots:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

**Step-by-Step Comparison:**  
- **9:00–9:30:** Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is busy.  
- **9:30–10:00:** Jack and Kelly are free, but Irene is busy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:00–10:30:** Kelly is free, but Jack is busy (10:00–11:00) and Irene is busy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:30–11:00:** Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **11:00–11:30:** Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is free only starting at 11:00, so the slot is too short for a one-hour meeting.  
- **11:30–12:00:** Irene is free, but Kelly is busy (11:30–12:30), and Jack is free.  
- **12:00–12:30:** Jack and Kelly are free, but Irene is busy (12:00–13:00).  
- **12:30–13:00:** Jack and Kelly are free, but Irene is busy (12:00–13:00).  
- **13:00–13:30:** Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is free only until 13:30, so the slot is too short.  
- **13:30–14:30:** Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is busy (13:30–14:30).  
- **14:30–15:30:** Irene and Jack are free, but Kelly is busy (14:30–15:30).  
- **15:30–16:00:** Irene, Jack, and Kelly are all free, but this is only a 30-minute slot (until Jack’s meeting at 16:00).  
- **16:00–17:00:** Irene and Kelly are free, but Jack is busy (16:00–17:00).  

No continuous one-hour slot exists where all three participants are free.

**Step 4: Validation (Implementation)**  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Validate whether a one-hour time slot exists or confirm no solution is possible.  
- **How to Achieve:** Review the overlapping time slots to confirm the absence of a valid one-hour slot and explain why no solution exists.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The comparison in Step 3 shows no one-hour time slot where Irene, Jack, and Kelly are all free. The longest common free period is 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes), which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting. The constraints of their schedules—Irene’s unavailability from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00, Jack’s unavailability from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00, and Kelly’s unavailability from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30—create conflicts that prevent any continuous one-hour overlap within 9:00–17:00.

**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (attempted in Step 3, no solution found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the result or confirm no solution exists (completed in Step 4).  

**Current Goal:** Conclude the scheduling process by confirming no solution exists.

**Final Answer:**  
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Irene, Jack, and Kelly due to their conflicting schedules. Specifically, Irene’s busy periods (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00), Jack’s busy periods (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00), and Kelly’s busy periods (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) result in no continuous one-hour period where all are free. The longest common free period is 15:30–16:00, which is only 30 minutes.
