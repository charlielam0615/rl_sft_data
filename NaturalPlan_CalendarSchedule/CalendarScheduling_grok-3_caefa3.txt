**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Julia is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30. Kevin is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-16:00. Laura is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and constraints (participants’ busy times).  
2. List all possible 30-minute time slots within the work hours.  
3. Check each time slot against the schedules of Julia, Kevin, and Laura.  
4. Select the earliest time slot where all participants are available.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify all possible 30-minute time slots between 9:00 and 17:00 and check their availability.  
**How to Achieve:** List 30-minute time slots in 30-minute increments (e.g., 9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, etc.), then compare each slot against Julia’s and Kevin’s busy times (Laura is available all day).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we consider the work hours from 9:00 to 17:00 (8 hours). Since the meeting requires 30 minutes, we list all possible 30-minute slots in 30-minute increments:  
- 9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00 (16 slots total).  

Now, we check each slot against the busy times:  
- **Julia’s busy times:** 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30.  
- **Kevin’s busy times:** 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00.  
- **Laura:** Available all day.  

Slot-by-slot analysis:  
- **9:00-9:30:** Julia is busy. Unavailable.  
- **9:30-10:00:** All available.  
- **10:00-10:30:** Kevin is busy. Unavailable.  
- **10:30-11:00:** All available.  
- **11:00-11:30:** Julia is busy. Unavailable.  
- **11:30-12:00:** All available.  
- **12:00-12:30:** All available.  
- **12:30-13:00:** Kevin is busy. Unavailable.  
- **13:00-13:30:** All available.  
- **13:30-14:00:** All available.  
- **14:00-14:30:** Julia is busy. Unavailable.  
- **14:30-15:00:** All available.  
- **15:00-15:30:** Kevin is busy. Unavailable.  
- **15:30-16:00:** Kevin is busy. Unavailable.  
- **16:00-16:30:** All available.  
- **16:30-17:00:** All available.  

Available slots: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest possible time.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select the earliest available 30-minute time slot from the identified slots.  
**How to Achieve:** Review the list of available slots from the previous step and choose the earliest one that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the previous step, the available slots are: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.  
The earliest slot is **9:30-10:00**. This satisfies the preference for the earliest availability and accommodates Julia, Kevin, and Laura’s schedules.  
[/IMP]

---

**Final Answer:**
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 9:30-10:00**. This is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Julia, Kevin, and Laura are all available.
