**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Sam's busy times are 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30. Tina's busy times are 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00. Victor is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are available.  
3. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
- **How to Achieve:** List the busy times for Sam and Tina, assume Victor is available for all slots, and determine the free 30-minute slots for each participant.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Sam’s Schedule:** Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30.  
  Available slots (30-minute increments):  
  - 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Tina’s Schedule:** Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00.  
  Available slots (30-minute increments):  
  - 9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:00–14:30, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Victor’s Schedule:** Available all day (9:00–17:00).

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where Sam, Tina, and Victor are all available.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the available time slots from Sam and Tina, since Victor is available all day, and identify common 30-minute slots.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Sam’s Available Slots:** 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 15:30–16:00, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Tina’s Available Slots:** 9:00–9:30, 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:00–14:30, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Victor’s Available Slots:** All day (9:00–17:00).  
- **Overlapping Slots:** Compare Sam and Tina’s available slots:  
  - 9:30–10:00 (both available).  
  - 10:30–11:00 (both available).  
  - 11:30–12:00 (both available).  
  - 12:00–12:30 (both available).  
  - 13:00–13:30 (both available).  
  - 13:30–14:00 (both available).  
  - 14:30–15:00 (both available).  
  - 15:00–15:30 (both available).  
  - 16:00–16:30 (both available).  
  - 16:30–17:00 (both available).  
Since Victor is available all day, these slots are valid for all three participants.

### Step 4: Reach Goal (Implementation)

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Select the earliest available 30-minute slot for the meeting.  
- **How to Achieve:** From the overlapping slots, choose the earliest one that satisfies the 30-minute duration and falls within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Overlapping Slots:** 9:30–10:00, 10:30–11:00, 11:30–12:00, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 14:30–15:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:00–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Earliest Slot:** 9:30–10:00.  
The meeting can be scheduled from 9:30 to 10:00 on Monday, as it is the earliest 30-minute slot where Sam, Tina, and Victor are all available.
