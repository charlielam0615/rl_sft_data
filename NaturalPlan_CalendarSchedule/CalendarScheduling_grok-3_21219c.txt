**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Clara is busy from 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Daniel is busy from 10:30–11:30 and 13:30–14:30; Eve is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, and 14:30–15:30. Find a time slot that works for all participants, or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the identified slot(s) to ensure they meet the one-hour duration requirement.  
4. If no slot is found, analyze conflicts to explain why no solution exists.

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
**How to Achieve:** List the busy time slots for Clara, Daniel, and Eve, then determine their free time slots by excluding the busy periods from the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we first note the busy periods:  
- **Clara**: Busy 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.  
- **Daniel**: Busy 10:30–11:30, 13:30–14:30.  
- **Eve**: Busy 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30.

Now, we calculate free time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00:  
- **Clara**: Free 10:00–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Daniel**: Free 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Eve**: Free 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots where Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all free.  
**How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots of all participants to identify common one-hour periods within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We list the free time slots from Step 2:  
- **Clara**: 10:00–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.  
- **Daniel**: 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–17:00.  
- **Eve**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, we find overlapping one-hour periods:  
- **10:00–10:30**: Clara (free 10:00–12:00), Daniel (free 9:00–10:30), Eve (busy 9:30–10:30). Not viable.  
- **10:30–11:30**: Clara (free 10:00–12:00), Daniel (busy 10:30–11:30), Eve (free 10:30–12:30). Not viable.  
- **11:30–12:00**: Clara (free 10:00–12:00), Daniel (free 11:30–13:30), Eve (free 10:30–12:30). Viable for 30 minutes (11:30–12:00), but not a full hour.  
- **13:00–13:30**: Clara (free 13:00–15:00), Daniel (free 11:30–13:30), Eve (busy 12:30–13:30). Not viable.  
- **13:30–14:30**: Clara (free 13:00–15:00), Daniel (busy 13:30–14:30), Eve (free 13:30–14:30). Not viable.  
- **14:30–15:00**: Clara (free 13:00–15:00), Daniel (free 14:30–17:00), Eve (busy 14:30–15:30). Not viable.  
- **15:30–16:00**: Clara (busy 15:00–16:00), Daniel (free 14:30–17:00), Eve (free 15:30–17:00). Not viable.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Clara (free 16:00–17:00), Daniel (free 14:30–17:00), Eve (free 15:30–17:00). Viable for a full hour (16:00–17:00).

The only one-hour slot where all are free is **16:00–17:00**.  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Validate that the 16:00–17:00 slot meets the one-hour duration requirement and is free for all participants.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that 16:00–17:00 is within the 9:00–17:00 window, lasts one hour, and does not conflict with any participant’s busy periods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Window**: 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Duration**: 16:00 to 17:00 is exactly one hour.  
- **Conflicts**:  
  - Clara: Free 16:00–17:00 (busy 15:00–16:00, no conflict).  
  - Daniel: Free 14:30–17:00 (busy 13:30–14:30, no conflict).  
  - Eve: Free 15:30–17:00 (busy 14:30–15:30, no conflict).  

The slot 16:00–17:00 is valid and conflict-free for all participants.

**Step 5: Track Goals**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy and Updates**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Clara, Daniel, and Eve on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed in Step 2).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed in Step 3).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the identified slot (completed in Step 4).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and communicate the solution.  
No modifications to goals were made since the initial planning in Step 1. The identified slot (16:00–17:00) satisfies all constraints.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer**:
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 16:00–17:00**, as it is the only one-hour time slot within 9:00–17:00 where Clara, Daniel, and Eve are all available.
