### Problem Restatement
I need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Sam**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
- **Tina**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.
- **Victor**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
The goal is to find a one-hour time slot where all three are available. If no such slot exists, I must explain why.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.
3. Select a suitable time slot or determine if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for Sam, Tina, and Victor, and determine their free periods within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy times.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Sam’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Tina’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Victor’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all three participants are free.
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free periods of Sam, Tina, and Victor to identify common one-hour intervals.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a common one-hour slot, we need a continuous 60-minute period where all three are free. Let’s examine the free periods:

- **Sam’s Free Periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Tina’s Free Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Victor’s Free Periods**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Now, identify overlaps:
- **9:00–9:30**: Sam and Tina are free, but Victor is busy (9:00–9:30). **No overlap**.
- **9:30–10:00**: Sam and Tina are free, Victor is free (9:30–11:30). **Overlap: 9:30–10:00** (30 minutes, too short).
- **10:30–11:00**: Sam and Victor are free, but Tina is busy (10:00–11:00). **No overlap**.
- **11:00–11:30**: Sam and Victor are free, Tina is free (11:00–13:30). **Overlap: 11:00–11:30** (30 minutes, too short).
- **11:30–12:00**: Sam is free, Tina is free, but Victor is busy (11:30–12:30). **No overlap**.
- **12:30–13:00**: Sam and Victor are free, Tina is free (11:00–13:30). **Overlap: 12:30–13:00** (30 minutes, too short).
- **13:00–13:30**: Sam and Victor are free, Tina is free. **Overlap: 13:00–13:30** (30 minutes, too short).
- **13:30–14:30**: Sam and Victor are free, but Tina is busy (13:30–14:30). **No overlap**.
- **14:30–15:30**: Sam and Tina are free, but Victor is busy (14:30–15:30). **No overlap**.
- **15:30–16:00**: Sam, Tina, and Victor are free. **Overlap: 15:30–16:00** (30 minutes, too short).
- **16:00–17:00**: Sam and Victor are free, but Tina is busy (16:00–17:00). **No overlap**.

All overlapping periods (9:30–10:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00) are 30 minutes or less, which does not satisfy the one-hour requirement.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Confirm whether a one-hour overlapping time slot exists or verify that no such slot is possible.
**How to Achieve**: Re-check the schedules and overlaps to ensure no one-hour slot was missed and confirm the conclusion.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Re-examine the schedules to ensure accuracy:
- **Sam**: Free 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.
- **Tina**: Free 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.
- **Victor**: Free 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Re-check overlaps for a continuous one-hour period:
- The longest overlaps identified (e.g., 15:30–16:00) are only 30 minutes.
- No single hour-long period exists where all three are free simultaneously, as confirmed by the previous step’s analysis.

The schedules are tightly constrained, with busy periods staggered such that no one-hour window aligns for all three participants.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Sam, Tina, and Victor on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no valid slot found).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Validate the result or select a suitable time slot (completed, no slot exists).
- **Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling process by reporting the result.

**Summary**: The goal hierarchy reflects the steps taken to identify and validate time slots. The current goal is to finalize the conclusion that no one-hour slot is available.
[/REVIEW]

### Conclusion
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Sam, Tina, and Victor. The schedules are misaligned, with overlapping free periods limited to 30-minute intervals (e.g., 9:30–10:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:30–13:00, 13:00–13:30, 15:30–16:00). These periods are too short for the required one-hour meeting, and no other continuous one-hour window exists where all three are free simultaneously.
