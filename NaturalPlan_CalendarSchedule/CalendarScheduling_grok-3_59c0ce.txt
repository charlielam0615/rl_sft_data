### Problem Restatement
Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Olivia**: Busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
- **Peter**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.
- **Quinn**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
Find a time slot where all participants are available for a continuous one-hour period. If no such slot exists, explain why.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping time slots where all participants are free for at least one hour.  
3. Select a suitable one-hour time slot or determine if no such slot exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn, and determine their free periods within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy times.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots:  
- **Olivia’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Peter’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.  
  - Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Quinn’s Schedule**:  
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  - Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping time slots where all participants are free for at least one hour.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free periods of Olivia, Peter, and Quinn to identify common time slots that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the free periods:  
- **Olivia’s Free Periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Peter’s Free Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00.  
- **Quinn’s Free Periods**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  

Find intersections:  
- **9:00–9:30**: Olivia and Peter are free, but Quinn is busy.  
- **9:30–10:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **10:30–11:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy (10:00–11:00).  
- **11:00–11:30**: Olivia and Peter are free, but Quinn is busy (11:30–12:30).  
- **11:30–12:00**: Olivia is free, but Peter and Quinn are busy.  
- **12:30–13:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy (13:30–14:30).  
- **13:00–13:30**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy (13:30–14:30).  
- **14:30–15:30**: Olivia and Peter are free, but Quinn is busy (14:30–15:30).  
- **15:30–16:00**: Olivia, Peter, and Quinn are all free.  
- **16:00–17:00**: Olivia and Quinn are free, but Peter is busy (16:00–17:00).  

The only common free period is **15:30–16:00**, which is 30 minutes long and does not meet the one-hour requirement.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping time slots of at least one hour (completed, no one-hour slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select a suitable time slot or explain why none exists (pending).  

**Current Goal**: Select a suitable one-hour time slot or explain why none exists.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine if a one-hour time slot exists or explain why none is available.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the overlapping time slots from Step 3. If no one-hour slot is found, analyze the schedules to explain the conflict.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From Step 3, the only common free period is 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes), which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  

**Explanation of No Solution**:  
- The working hours are 9:00–17:00 (8 hours).  
- Olivia is busy for 2 hours (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00).  
- Peter is busy for 3 hours (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00).  
- Quinn is busy for 2.5 hours (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30).  
- The busy periods are staggered across the day, leaving no continuous one-hour period where all three are free. The longest common free period (15:30–16:00) is limited by Peter’s meeting from 16:00–17:00.  
- No other continuous one-hour slot exists within 9:00–17:00 due to at least one participant being busy in every other time segment.  

**Conclusion**: No one-hour time slot is available for the meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot is available for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The only common free period is 15:30–16:00 (30 minutes), which is too short. The participants’ busy periods (Olivia: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00; Peter: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00; Quinn: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) are staggered, preventing any continuous one-hour overlap.
