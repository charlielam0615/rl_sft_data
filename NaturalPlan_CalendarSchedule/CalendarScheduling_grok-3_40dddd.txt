### Problem Restatement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, prioritizing the earliest possible time. Aaron’s schedule is completely open. Bella is unavailable from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Caleb is unavailable from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. Identify a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability or explain why no such time exists.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
2. Find overlapping time slots where all three participants are free for at least 30 minutes.  
3. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by listing Aaron, Bella, and Caleb’s free time slots based on their schedules within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Aaron’s availability**: Entirely free from 9:00 to 17:00, so available for the full 8 hours.
- **Bella’s availability**: Unavailable from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Free slots are:
  - 10:00–11:30
  - 12:00–14:00
  - 15:00–17:00
- **Caleb’s availability**: Unavailable from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. Free slots are:
  - 9:00–10:00
  - 10:30–12:30
  - 13:00–15:30
  - 16:30–17:00
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping 30-minute time slots where Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are all available. This will be achieved by comparing their free time slots and identifying periods of at least 30 minutes where all are free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Compare the free time slots:
- **Aaron**: Free 9:00–17:00 (all day).
- **Bella**: Free 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.
- **Caleb**: Free 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

Find overlaps:
- **9:00–10:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free) → No overlap.
- **10:00–10:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy) → No overlap.
- **10:30–11:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free) → Valid overlap (1 hour).
- **11:30–12:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free) → No overlap.
- **12:00–12:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free) → Valid overlap (30 minutes).
- **12:30–13:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy) → No overlap.
- **13:00–14:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free) → Valid overlap (1 hour).
- **14:00–15:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (busy), Caleb (free) → No overlap.
- **15:00–15:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free) → Valid overlap (30 minutes).
- **15:30–16:30**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (busy) → No overlap.
- **16:30–17:00**: Aaron (free), Bella (free), Caleb (free) → Valid overlap (30 minutes).

Valid 30-minute slots: 10:30–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the overlapping slots that satisfies all constraints. This will be achieved by reviewing the valid slots and choosing the earliest one.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Valid slots from Step 3: 10:30–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
The earliest slot is 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) to ensure it meets all constraints. This will be achieved by confirming that Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are free during this period and that it satisfies the 30-minute duration within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time slot**: 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes, within 9:00–17:00).
- **Aaron**: Free all day, so available at 10:30–11:00.
- **Bella**: Free 10:00–11:30, so available at 10:30–11:00.
- **Caleb**: Free 10:30–12:30, so available at 10:30–11:00.
- **Constraints**: The slot is 30 minutes long and falls within 9:00–17:00.  
The time slot 10:30–11:00 is valid for all participants and meets all requirements.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest valid slot (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected slot (completed).
**Current Goal**: Finalize and confirm the meeting time.  
The proposed time slot of 10:30–11:00 has been validated and aligns with the goal of scheduling the meeting at the earliest availability.  
[/REVIEW]

---

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday from **10:30 to 11:00**. This is the earliest 30-minute time slot within 9:00–17:00 where all participants are available.
