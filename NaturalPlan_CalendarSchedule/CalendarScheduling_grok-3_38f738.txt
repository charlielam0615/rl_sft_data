**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, considering their existing schedules:
- Wendy is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–15:30.
- Xavier is busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.
- Yvonne is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
Find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available, or explain why no such slot exists.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
2. List the busy time slots for each participant.  
3. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
4. Validate the solution or determine if no solution exists.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots within 9:00–17:00 on Monday and list the busy time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by defining the working hours and cataloging each participant's unavailable times.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The working hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 (8 hours total). The one-hour meeting must start and end within this period (e.g., 9:00–10:00, 9:30–10:30, etc., up to 16:00–17:00).  
Busy time slots:  
- **Wendy**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–15:30  
- **Xavier**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00  
- **Yvonne**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free. This will be achieved by analyzing the busy time slots and identifying one-hour periods within 9:00–17:00 where no participant has a conflict.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a suitable time slot, consider one-hour blocks starting at each half-hour mark (9:00, 9:30, 10:00, ..., 16:00). Check each block against the busy schedules:  

- **9:00–10:00**: Yvonne is busy (9:00–10:00). Conflict.  
- **9:30–10:30**: Wendy is busy (9:30–10:30), Yvonne is busy (9:00–10:00). Conflict.  
- **10:00–11:00**: Xavier is busy (10:00–11:00). Conflict.  
- **10:30–11:30**: Xavier is busy (10:00–11:00). Conflict.  
- **11:00–12:00**: Yvonne is busy (11:30–12:30). Conflict (overlaps 11:30–12:00).  
- **11:30–12:30**: Yvonne is busy (11:30–12:30). Conflict.  
- **12:00–13:00**: Wendy is busy (12:00–13:00). Conflict.  
- **12:30–13:30**: Wendy is busy (12:00–13:00). Conflict (overlaps 12:30–13:00).  
- **13:00–14:00**: Xavier is busy (13:30–14:30). Conflict (overlaps 13:30–14:00).  
- **13:30–14:30**: Xavier is busy (13:30–14:30). Conflict.  
- **14:00–15:00**: Yvonne is busy (14:30–15:30). Conflict (overlaps 14:30–15:00).  
- **14:30–15:30**: Yvonne is busy (14:30–15:30), Wendy is busy (15:00–15:30). Conflict.  
- **15:00–16:00**: Wendy is busy (15:00–15:30), Yvonne is busy (14:30–15:30). Conflict.  
- **15:30–16:30**: Xavier is busy (16:00–17:00). Conflict (overlaps 16:00–16:30).  
- **16:00–17:00**: Xavier is busy (16:00–17:00). Conflict.  

No one-hour slot from 9:00 to 17:00 is free for all participants.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate whether there is indeed no one-hour time slot where all participants are free, by rechecking the analysis for potential errors or missed opportunities.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Re-evaluate the time slots to ensure accuracy. The busy periods are:  
- Wendy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–15:30  
- Xavier: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00  
- Yvonne: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  

Combine busy periods to identify gaps:  
- **9:00–10:30**: Yvonne (9:00–10:00), Wendy (9:30–10:30).  
- **10:00–11:00**: Xavier (10:00–11:00).  
- **11:30–13:00**: Yvonne (11:30–12:30), Wendy (12:00–13:00).  
- **13:30–15:30**: Xavier (13:30–14:30), Yvonne (14:30–15:30), Wendy (15:00–15:30).  
- **16:00–17:00**: Xavier (16:00–17:00).  

Potential gaps:  
- **11:00–11:30**: Free for all (30 minutes, too short).  
- **15:30–16:00**: Free for all (30 minutes, too short).  

No continuous one-hour slot exists. The analysis confirms that every possible one-hour slot overlaps with at least one participant’s busy period.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:

  - Subgoal 2: List busy time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no slots found).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (completed, confirmed no slots).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by reporting the result.

**Step 6**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude the scheduling task by reporting that no one-hour time slot is available and explaining why. This will be achieved by summarizing the findings and constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday is available for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne. The constraints are:  
- Wendy’s busy periods (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–15:30) block early morning, midday, and mid-afternoon slots.  
- Xavier’s busy periods (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00) block late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon slots.  
- Yvonne’s busy periods (9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) block the start of the day, late morning, and mid-afternoon slots.  
Every possible one-hour slot overlaps with at least one participant’s busy period. The longest free periods for all participants are 11:00–11:30 and 15:30–16:00, each only 30 minutes, which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
[/IMP]

**Final Answer**: No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday satisfies the availability of Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne due to overlapping busy periods across the entire workday.
