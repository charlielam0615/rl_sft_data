**Problem Statement:** Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Olivia is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Peter is busy from 10:00–11:00 and 13:30–14:30; Quinn is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30. Identify a time slot that works for all participants or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to find a suitable meeting time:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00–17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping free time slots among all participants that are at least one hour long.  
3. Select a one-hour time slot that satisfies all constraints, or determine if no such slot exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday.  
**How to Achieve:** List the busy periods for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn, then determine their free periods by excluding busy times from the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Olivia’s Schedule:**  
  Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00  
  Free: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00  

- **Peter’s Schedule:**  
  Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30  
  Free: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00  

- **Quinn’s Schedule:**  
  Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30  
  Free: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  

[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve:** Compare the free time slots of Olivia, Peter, and Quinn to identify common periods that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a suitable one-hour slot, we need a continuous period where all three participants are free. Let’s intersect their free time slots:

- **Olivia’s Free Slots:** 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00  
- **Peter’s Free Slots:** 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–17:00  
- **Quinn’s Free Slots:** 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00  

**Intersection Analysis:**  
- **9:00–9:30:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (busy). Not viable.  
- **9:30–10:00:** Olivia (busy), Peter (free), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **10:00–10:30:** Olivia (busy), Peter (busy), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **10:30–11:00:** Olivia (free), Peter (busy), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **11:00–11:30:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (free). This is only 30 minutes, insufficient for a one-hour meeting.  
- **11:30–12:00:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (busy). Not viable.  
- **12:00–12:30:** Olivia (busy), Peter (free), Quinn (busy). Not viable.  
- **12:30–13:00:** Olivia (busy), Peter (free), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **13:00–13:30:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (free). This is only 30 minutes, insufficient.  
- **13:30–14:30:** Olivia (free), Peter (busy), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **14:30–15:00:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (busy). Not viable.  
- **15:00–15:30:** Olivia (busy), Peter (free), Quinn (busy). Not viable.  
- **15:30–16:00:** Olivia (busy), Peter (free), Quinn (free). Not viable.  
- **16:00–17:00:** Olivia (free), Peter (free), Quinn (free). This is a full hour, sufficient for the meeting.

**Result:** The only overlapping one-hour slot is 16:00–17:00.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Verify that the 16:00–17:00 slot satisfies all constraints.  
**How to Achieve:** Confirm that Olivia, Peter, and Quinn have no scheduled meetings during 16:00–17:00 and that the slot falls within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Olivia:** Free from 16:00–17:00 (no meetings).  
- **Peter:** Free from 14:30–17:00 (no meetings).  
- **Quinn:** Free from 15:30–17:00 (no meetings).  
- **Time Constraint:** 16:00–17:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  

The 16:00–17:00 slot is valid for a one-hour meeting.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant. (Completed in Step 2)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots. (Completed in Step 3)  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot. (Completed in Step 4)  

**Current Goal:** Confirm the final meeting time.  
**Status:** The 16:00–17:00 slot has been identified and validated as a viable time for the meeting.  
[/REVIEW]

**Final Answer:**  
The one-hour meeting for Olivia, Peter, and Quinn can be scheduled on Monday from 16:00 to 17:00, as all participants are free during this time, and it falls within the specified work hours of 9:00–17:00.
