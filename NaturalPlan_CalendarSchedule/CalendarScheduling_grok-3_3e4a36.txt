**Problem Statement**: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Zack is free all day, Amy has meetings from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00, and Brian is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The goal is to find the earliest available time slot that accommodates everyone’s schedule.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and the required duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s unavailable time slots.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute windows where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for all participants. This will be achieved by listing each participant’s busy times, determining their free times within 9:00–17:00, and finding common free time slots that are at least 30 minutes long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time Range**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (8 hours total).  
- **Participants’ Schedules**:  
  - **Zack**: Free all day (9:00–17:00).  
  - **Amy**: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
    - Free periods: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
  - **Brian**: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
    - Free periods: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Find Overlapping Free Slots**:  
  - Combine free periods for all participants:  
    - Zack is free 9:00–17:00.  
    - Amy’s free periods: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
    - Brian’s free periods: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
  - Intersect the free periods:  
    - 9:00–10:00: Zack (free), Amy (busy), Brian (free) → Not viable.  
    - 10:00–10:30: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy) → Not viable.  
    - 10:30–11:30: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free) → Viable (60 minutes).  
    - 11:30–12:00: Zack (free), Amy (busy), Brian (free) → Not viable.  
    - 12:00–12:30: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free) → Viable (30 minutes).  
    - 12:30–13:00: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy) → Not viable.  
    - 13:00–14:00: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free) → Viable (60 minutes).  
    - 14:00–15:00: Zack (free), Amy (busy), Brian (free) → Not viable.  
    - 15:00–15:30: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free) → Viable (30 minutes).  
    - 15:30–16:30: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy) → Not viable.  
    - 16:30–17:00: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free) → Viable (30 minutes).  
- **Viable 30-minute slots**: 10:30–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the viable slots (10:30–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00) that satisfies the preference for the earliest availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Viable Slots**: 10:30–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Earliest Slot**: The earliest slot is 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes).  
- **Conclusion**: Schedule the meeting from 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday, as it is the earliest 30-minute slot where Zack, Amy, and Brian are all available.
