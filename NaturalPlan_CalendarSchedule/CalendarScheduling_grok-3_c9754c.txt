**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Aaron, Bella, and Caleb on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Aaron is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, and 14:00-14:30. Bella is busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-16:00. Caleb is available all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00-17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all available time slots for each participant based on their busy schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where Aaron, Bella, and Caleb are all available.  
- **How to Achieve:** Compare the available time slots from Step 2 and identify common 30-minute intervals.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Compare available slots:  
  - Aaron’s available slots: 9:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

  - Caleb’s available slots: All intervals (9:00-17:00).  
- Overlapping slots (where all are available): 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

**Step 4: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:**  
- **Current Goal:** Select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the overlapping slots to schedule the meeting.  
- **How to Achieve:** Review the list of overlapping slots and choose the earliest one that satisfies the 30-minute duration and the preference for the earliest availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Overlapping slots: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30, 16:30-17:00.

- **How to Achieve:** Check the selected slot against each participant’s busy times to confirm no conflicts exist.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Selected slot:** 9:30-10:00.  
- **Aaron’s busy times:** 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30. No conflict with 9:30-10:00.  
- **Bella’s busy times:** 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00. No conflict with 9:30-10:00.  
- **Caleb’s busy times:** None. Available for 9:30-10:00.  
- **Verification:** The slot 9:30-10:00 is free for all participants and meets the 30-minute duration and 9:00-17:00 time range constraints.
