### Problem Restatement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- Irene: Available all day.
- Jack: Busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.
- Kelly: Busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.
The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List each participant’s available time slots based on their busy periods.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for Irene, Jack, and Kelly within 9:00–17:00 and find overlapping periods for a 30-minute meeting. This will be achieved by listing busy and free periods for each participant and computing intersections.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time Range and Duration**: The meeting must be 30 minutes long and occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (8 hours total).  
- **Irene’s Availability**: Irene is free from 9:00–17:00.  
- **Jack’s Busy Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
  **Jack’s Free Periods**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Kelly’s Busy Periods**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
  **Kelly’s Free Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Intersection of Free Periods**: Since Irene is free all day, we intersect Jack’s and Kelly’s free periods:  
  - Jack: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
  - Kelly: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
  - Overlapping periods:  
    - Between 10:00–11:30 (Jack) and 10:30–12:30 (Kelly): **10:30–11:30** (60 minutes).  
    - Between 12:00–14:00 (Jack) and 13:00–15:30 (Kelly): **13:00–14:00** (60 minutes).  
    - Between 15:00–17:00 (Jack) and 15:30–16:30 (Kelly): **15:30–16:30** (60 minutes).  
    - Between 15:00–17:00 (Jack) and 16:30–17:00 (Kelly): **16:30–17:00** (30 minutes).  
- All these periods can accommodate a 30-minute meeting.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the identified time slots (10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:30, 16:30–17:00) are correct by checking against each participant’s schedule and ensuring they meet the 30-minute requirement within 9:00–17:00.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Check Time Slots**:  
  - **10:30–11:30**:  
    - Irene: Free.  
    - Jack: Free (10:00–11:30).  
    - Kelly: Free (10:30–12:30).  
    - Duration: 60 minutes ≥ 30 minutes. Valid.  
  - **13:00–14:00**:  
    - Irene: Free.  
    - Jack: Free (12:00–14:00).  
    - Kelly: Free (13:00–15:30).  
    - Duration: 60 minutes ≥ 30 minutes. Valid.  
  - **15:30–16:30**:  
    - Irene: Free.  
    - Jack: Free (15:00–17:00).  
    - Kelly: Free (15:30–16:30).  
    - Duration: 60 minutes ≥ 30 minutes. Valid.  
  - **16:30–17:00**:  
    - Irene: Free.  
    - Jack: Free (15:00–17:00).  
    - Kelly: Free (16:30–17:00).  
    - Duration: 30 minutes = 30 minutes. Valid.  
- **Boundary Check**: All slots are within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Conclusion**: All identified time slots are valid.

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List each participant’s available time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed: 10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:30, 16:30–17:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest 30-minute slot from the validated time slots.

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to select the earliest 30-minute time slot from the validated options (10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:30, 16:30–17:00) that satisfies the preference for the earliest availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Available Time Slots**: 10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Earliest Slot**: The earliest slot starts at 10:30 (10:30–11:30). A 30-minute meeting can be scheduled from **10:30–11:00**.  
- **Verification**:  
  - Irene: Free at 10:30–11:00.  
  - Jack: Free at 10:30–11:00 (within 10:00–11:30).  
  - Kelly: Free at 10:30–11:00 (within 10:30–12:30).  
- **Conclusion**: The earliest possible 30-minute meeting time is **10:30–11:00**.

### Final Answer
The earliest available time to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 is **10:30–11:00**.
