**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Mike is busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, and 15:00-16:00; Natalie is busy from 10:00-11:00 and 13:30-14:30; Oliver is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, and 14:30-15:30. Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

**Step 1**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots within the work hours (9:00-17:00) for each participant.  
2. Find overlapping available time slots across all participants.  
3. Select a one-hour time slot that fits within the overlapping availability.  
4. Validate the selected time slot against all constraints.

**Step 2**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00-17:00 window. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Mike’s availability**: Busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00.  
  Free slots: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.  
- **Natalie’s availability**: Busy from 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30.  
  Free slots: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00.  
- **Oliver’s availability**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:30-15:30.  
  Free slots: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all available. This will be achieved by comparing their free time slots and identifying common periods that are at least one hour long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a suitable time slot, we compare the free periods:  
- **Mike**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.  
- **Natalie**: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00.  
- **Oliver**: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  

**Intersection of free slots**:  
- From 9:00-9:30: Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is busy (9:00-9:30). No overlap.  
- From 10:30-11:00: Mike and Oliver are free (10:30-11:30), but Natalie is busy (10:00-11:00). No overlap.  
- From 11:00-11:30: Mike and Oliver are free, but Natalie is free only from 11:00-13:30. Overlap is 11:00-11:30, which is only 30 minutes (not sufficient for a one-hour meeting).  
- From 12:30-13:00: Mike (13:00-15:00) and Oliver (12:30-14:30) are free, but Natalie is free only until 13:30. Overlap is 12:30-13:00, which is 30 minutes (not sufficient).  
- From 13:00-13:30: Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is free only from 12:30-14:30. Overlap is 13:00-13:30, which is 30 minutes (not sufficient).  
- From 14:30-15:00: Mike and Natalie are free, but Oliver is busy (14:30-15:30). No overlap.  
- From 15:30-16:00: Natalie and Oliver are free, but Mike is busy (15:00-16:00). No overlap.  
- From 16:00-17:00: Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all free. This gives a full one-hour slot from 16:00-17:00.  

**Potential slot**: 16:00-17:00.

**Step 4**

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the identified time slot (16:00-17:00) to ensure it meets all constraints, including the one-hour duration and the 9:00-17:00 work hours, and that no participant has conflicting meetings.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Time slot**: 16:00-17:00.  
- **Duration check**: The slot is exactly one hour, satisfying the requirement.  
- **Work hours check**: The slot is within 9:00-17:00.  
- **Participant availability**:  
  - Mike: Free from 16:00-17:00 (no conflict with 9:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-16:00).  
  - Natalie: Free from 16:00-17:00 (no conflict with 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30).  
  - Oliver: Free from 16:00-17:00 (no conflict with 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:30-15:30).  
- **Conclusion**: The 16:00-17:00 slot is valid for all participants.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Mike, Natalie, and Oliver on Monday between 9:00-17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, identified 16:00-17:00).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (completed, 16:00-17:00 is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time.  
[/REVIEW]

---

**Final Answer**: The meeting can be scheduled for Monday from **16:00 to 17:00**, as it is the only one-hour time slot within 9:00-17:00 where Mike, Natalie, and Oliver are all available.
