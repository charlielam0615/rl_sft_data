**Problem Restatement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Zack is busy from 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, and 15:00–16:00; Amy is busy from 10:30–11:30 and 13:30–14:30; Brian is busy from 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, and 14:30–15:30. Find a time slot that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots within the workday (9:00–17:00) for each participant.
2. Find overlapping available time slots for all three participants.
3. Select a one-hour time slot that fits within the overlapping availability.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00 on Monday. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods for Zack, Amy, and Brian.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots:
- **Zack’s busy periods**: 9:00–10:00, 12:00–13:00, 15:00–16:00.
  - **Zack’s free periods**: 10:00–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Amy’s busy periods**: 10:30–11:30, 13:30–14:30.
  - **Amy’s free periods**: 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Brian’s busy periods**: 9:30–10:30, 12:30–13:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - **Brian’s free periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find overlapping one-hour time slots where Zack, Amy, and Brian are all free. This will be achieved by comparing their free periods and identifying common one-hour windows within 9:00–17:00.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find overlapping time slots:
- **Zack’s free periods**: 10:00–12:00, 13:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00.
- **Amy’s free periods**: 9:00–10:30, 11:30–13:30, 14:30–17:00.
- **Brian’s free periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:30, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.
- Compare for overlaps:
  - **9:00–9:30**: Zack (busy), Amy (free), Brian (free). Not viable.
  - **10:00–10:30**: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy). Not viable.
  - **10:30–11:30**: Zack (free), Amy (busy), Brian (free). Not viable.
  - **11:30–12:00**: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free). Viable for 30 minutes, but not one hour.
  - **12:00–12:30**: Zack (busy), Amy (free), Brian (free). Not viable.
  - **12:30–13:00**: Zack (busy), Amy (free), Brian (busy). Not viable.
  - **13:00–13:30**: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy). Not viable.
  - **13:30–14:30**: Zack (free), Amy (busy), Brian (free). Not viable.
  - **14:30–15:00**: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (busy). Not viable.
  - **15:00–15:30**: Zack (busy), Amy (free), Brian (busy). Not viable.
  - **15:30–16:00**: Zack (busy), Amy (free), Brian (free). Not viable.
  - **16:00–17:00**: Zack (free), Amy (free), Brian (free). Viable for one hour.
- **Viable one-hour slot**: 16:00–17:00.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the 16:00–17:00 time slot is free for all participants. This will be achieved by rechecking their schedules for conflicts during this period.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Zack’s schedule at 16:00–17:00**: Free (busy only until 16:00).
- **Amy’s schedule at 16:00–17:00**: Free (no conflicts after 14:30).
- **Brian’s schedule at 16:00–17:00**: Free (no conflicts after 15:30).
- **Conclusion**: The 16:00–17:00 slot is free for all participants.
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Zack, Amy, and Brian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping available time slots (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select a one-hour time slot (completed: 16:00–17:00 selected).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected time slot (completed: 16:00–17:00 confirmed).
