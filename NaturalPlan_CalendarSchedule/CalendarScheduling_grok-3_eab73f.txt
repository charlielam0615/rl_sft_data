**Problem Statement:**  
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules and prioritizing the earliest available time. Diana is free all day. Ethan is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Fiona is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ availability based on their schedules.  
3. Find overlapping available time slots for all participants.  
4. Select the earliest available 30-minute slot that satisfies all constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to determine the availability of Diana, Ethan, and Fiona based on their schedules. This will be achieved by analyzing their busy time slots and identifying free periods within 9:00–17:00 where a 30-minute meeting can be scheduled.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Diana’s availability:** Free all day (9:00–17:00).  
- **Ethan’s busy times:** 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.  
  - **Ethan’s free times:** 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Fiona’s busy times:** 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.  
  - **Fiona’s free times:** 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Common availability (intersection):** Since Diana is free all day, we focus on overlapping free times for Ethan and Fiona:  
  - 10:30–11:30 (Ethan: 10:00–11:30, Fiona: 10:30–12:30).  
  - 13:00–14:00 (Ethan: 12:00–14:00, Fiona: 13:00–15:30).  
  - 16:30–17:00 (Ethan: 15:00–17:00, Fiona: 16:30–17:00).  
All these slots are at least 30 minutes long and within 9:00–17:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to select the earliest available 30-minute time slot from the common availability periods for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona. This will be achieved by comparing the start times of the identified overlapping slots and choosing the earliest one.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
From the common availability slots:  
- 10:30–11:30 (starts at 10:30).  
- 13:00–14:00 (starts at 13:00).  
- 16:30–17:00 (starts at 16:30).  
The earliest slot is 10:30–11:00 (30 minutes, starting at 10:30).  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 4: Validation  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data:** The current goal is to verify that the proposed time slot (10:30–11:00) satisfies all constraints, including the 30-minute duration, the 9:00–17:00 work hours, and the availability of all participants.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
- **Duration check:** The slot 10:30–11:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
- **Time range check:** 10:30–11:00 falls within 9:00–17:00.  
- **Availability check:**  
  - Diana: Free all day (satisfied).  
  - Ethan: Free from 10:00–11:30 (10:30–11:00 is within this period).  
  - Fiona: Free from 10:30–12:30 (10:30–11:00 is within this period).  
The slot satisfies all constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals  
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy:**  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Diana, Ethan, and Fiona on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List participants’ availability (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find overlapping available time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 4: Select the earliest 30-minute slot (completed).  
  - Subgoal 5: Validate the selected slot (completed).  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the final meeting time based on the validated slot.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer:  
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **10:30 to 11:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Diana, Ethan, and Fiona are all available within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
