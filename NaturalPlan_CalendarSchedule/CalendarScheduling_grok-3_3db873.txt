**Problem Restatement:**
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Wendy is available all day. Xavier is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Yvonne is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that works for all participants.

**Step 1: Forward Subgoaling**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all participants’ availability by excluding their busy times.  
3. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
4. Select the earliest available slot that satisfies all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

**Step 2: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Determine the available time slots for all participants.  
**How to Achieve:** Analyze each participant’s schedule, identify their free time slots within 9:00–17:00, and find common 30-minute windows where all are available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find a suitable meeting time, let’s analyze the schedules:  
- **Wendy**: Available 9:00–17:00 (no restrictions).  
- **Xavier**: Busy 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00. Free slots: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.  
- **Yvonne**: Busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30. Free slots: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  

Now, identify overlapping 30-minute slots:  
- **9:00–10:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). *Not viable.*  
- **10:00–10:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). *Not viable.*  
- **10:30–11:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). *Viable for 10:30–11:00 or 11:00–11:30.*  
- **11:30–12:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). *Not viable.*  
- **12:00–12:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). *Viable for 12:00–12:30.*  
- **12:30–13:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). *Not viable.*  
- **13:00–14:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). *Viable for 13:00–13:30 or 13:30–14:00.*  
- **14:00–15:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (busy), Yvonne (free). *Not viable.*  
- **15:00–15:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). *Viable for 15:00–15:30.*  
- **15:30–16:30**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (busy). *Not viable.*  
- **16:30–17:00**: Wendy (free), Xavier (free), Yvonne (free). *Viable for 16:30–17:00.*  

Possible 30-minute slots: 10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
[/IMP]

**Step 3: Reach Goal**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Select the earliest available 30-minute slot for the meeting.  
**How to Achieve:** From the list of viable time slots, choose the earliest one that satisfies the preference for the earliest availability.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the identified slots (10:30–11:00, 11:00–11:30, 12:00–12:30, 13:00–13:30, 13:30–14:00, 15:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00), the earliest is **10:30–11:00**. This slot works for Wendy (free all day), Xavier (free 10:00–11:30), and Yvonne (free 10:30–12:30).  
[/IMP]

**Step 4: Validation**

[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal:** Confirm the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) is valid for all participants.  
**How to Achieve:** Re-check the schedules to ensure no conflicts exist in the chosen slot and verify it meets the 30-minute duration and time range constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verifying the 10:30–11:00 slot:  
- **Wendy**: Free all day, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Xavier**: Free 10:00–11:30, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Yvonne**: Free 10:30–12:30, so 10:30–11:00 is available.  
- **Duration**: The slot is exactly 30 minutes.  
- **Time Range**: 10:30–11:00 falls within 9:00–17:00.  
The slot is valid with no conflicts.

**Final Answer:**
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 10:30–11:00**. This is the earliest 30-minute slot where Wendy, Xavier, and Yvonne are all available, satisfying the constraints of the work hours (9:00–17:00) and their existing schedules.
