### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, ensuring the meeting fits within their available time slots. The existing schedules are:
- **Liam**: Busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- **Mia**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 16:00–17:00.
- **Noah**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
We need to find a one-hour time slot where all three participants are free, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Select a suitable time slot or determine if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for each participant, then derive their free periods within 9:00–17:00 by excluding the busy times. Represent the day in half-hour increments to simplify overlap analysis.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To identify available time slots, we first list the busy periods and then determine the free periods for each participant between 9:00 and 17:00.

- **Liam’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.
  - Free periods (excluding busy times):
    - 9:00–9:30
    - 10:30–12:00
    - 13:00–17:00

- **Mia’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:00–10:00
    - 11:00–13:30
    - 14:30–16:00

- **Noah’s Schedule**:
  - Busy: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.
  - Free periods:
    - 9:30–11:30
    - 12:30–14:30
    - 15:30–17:00

These free periods are derived by excluding the busy times from the 9:00–17:00 window, ensuring all intervals align with the constraints.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free periods of Liam, Mia, and Noah to identify one-hour windows where all are available. Use a timeline or interval comparison to find common slots.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find overlapping one-hour slots, we analyze the free periods:

- **Liam’s Free Periods**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
- **Mia’s Free Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
- **Noah’s Free Periods**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

We now check for one-hour windows where all three are free by examining the day in half-hour increments and identifying continuous one-hour periods:

- **9:00–10:00**:
  - 9:00–9:30: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (busy). Not viable.
  - 9:30–10:00: Liam (busy), Mia (free), Noah (free). Not viable.

- **10:00–11:00**:
  - 10:00–10:30: Liam (busy), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.
  - 10:30–11:00: Liam (free), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.

- **11:00–12:00**:
  - 11:00–11:30: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (free). Viable for start of a one-hour slot.
  - 11:30–12:00: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (busy). Not viable.
  - Check 11:00–12:00: Since Noah is busy 11:30–12:00, this slot is not fully viable.

- **12:00–13:00**:
  - 12:00–12:30: Liam (busy), Mia (free), Noah (busy). Not viable.
  - 12:30–13:00: Liam (busy), Mia (free), Noah (free). Not viable.

- **13:00–14:00**:
  - 13:00–13:30: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (free). Viable for start of a one-hour slot.
  - 13:30–14:00: Liam (free), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.
  - Check 13:00–14:00: Since Mia is busy 13:30–14:00, this slot is not fully viable.

- **14:00–15:00**:
  - 14:00–14:30: Liam (free), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.
  - 14:30–15:00: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (busy). Not viable.

- **15:00–16:00**:
  - 15:00–15:30: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (busy). Not viable.
  - 15:30–16:00: Liam (free), Mia (free), Noah (free). Viable for start of a one-hour slot.
  - Check 15:30–16:30: Mia is busy 16:00–17:00, so not viable.

- **16:00–17:00**:
  - 16:00–16:30: Liam (free), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.
  - 16:30–17:00: Liam (free), Mia (busy), Noah (free). Not viable.

After checking all possible one-hour windows, no continuous one-hour slot exists where Liam, Mia, and Noah are all free.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm whether there is indeed no one-hour slot where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Re-evaluate the free periods and overlaps to ensure no mistakes were made in the analysis. Consider alternative approaches, such as checking specific one-hour windows directly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To validate, we recheck the free periods and overlaps:

- **Free Periods Recap**:
  - Liam: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00
  - Mia: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–16:00
  - Noah: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00

We test key one-hour windows where overlaps seemed possible:
- **11:00–12:00**: All free at 11:00–11:30, but Noah is busy 11:30–12:00.
- **13:00–14:00**: All free at 13:00–13:30, but Mia is busy 13:30–14:00.
- **15:30–16:30**: All free at 15:30–16:00, but Mia is busy 16:00–16:30.

To further confirm, we consider if any continuous one-hour slot was missed. The busy periods create conflicts in every possible one-hour window:
- Early morning (9:00–10:00): Noah’s 9:00–9:30 and Liam’s 9:30–10:30 conflicts.
- Late morning (10:00–12:00): Mia’s 10:00–11:00 and Noah’s 11:30–12:30 conflicts.
- Early afternoon (12:00–14:00): Liam’s 12:00–13:00 and Mia’s 13:30–14:30 conflicts.
- Late afternoon (14:00–17:00): Noah’s 14:30–15:30 and Mia’s 16:00–17:00 conflicts.

The validation confirms no one-hour slot satisfies all constraints.

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- **Main Goal**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Liam, Mia, and Noah on Monday between 9:00–17:00.
  - **Subgoal 1**: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed in Step 2).
  - **Subgoal 2**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (attempted in Step 3, no solution found).
  - **Subgoal 3**: Validate the analysis to confirm no solution exists (completed in Step 4).

**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling task by reporting the result.

The analysis shows no one-hour slot where all participants are free, as confirmed by the validation step.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Liam, Mia, and Noah due to overlapping conflicts in their schedules:
- Liam’s busy periods (9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00), Mia’s busy periods (10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 16:00–17:00), and Noah’s busy periods (9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30) prevent any continuous one-hour overlap.
- Key potential slots (e.g., 11:00–12:00, 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:30) were ruled out due to at least one participant being busy in each window.

To proceed, consider relaxing constraints (e.g., shorter meeting duration, different day, or excluding one participant).
