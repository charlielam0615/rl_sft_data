### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, prioritizing the earliest possible time slot. The constraints are:
- **George's busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30
- **Hannah's busy times**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00
- **Ian's availability**: Entirely free all day
- **Meeting duration**: 30 minutes
- **Preference**: Earliest possible time slot within work hours (9:00–17:00)

We will use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to find a suitable time slot or explain why no solution exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve the scheduling problem, we break it into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00–17:00.  
2. Find overlapping 30-minute time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Select the earliest overlapping time slot that satisfies the 30-minute duration requirement.  
4. Validate the solution or explain if no time slot is feasible.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant and find overlapping 30-minute slots.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy time slots for George and Hannah, determine their free time slots within 9:00–17:00, and identify 30-minute periods where both are free. Since Ian is free all day, we only need to consider George and Hannah’s schedules.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
**George’s busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30  
**George’s free times** (30-minute or longer blocks between 9:00–17:00):  
- 9:30–11:00 (1.5 hours)  
- 11:30–14:00 (2.5 hours)  
- 14:30–17:00 (2.5 hours)  

**Hannah’s busy times**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00  
**Hannah’s free times** (30-minute or longer blocks between 9:00–17:00):  
- 9:00–10:00 (1 hour)  
- 10:30–12:30 (2 hours)  
- 13:00–15:00 (2 hours)  
- 16:00–17:00 (1 hour)  

**Ian’s free times**: Entire day (9:00–17:00), so no constraints.  

**Overlapping free times** (30-minute or longer blocks where both George and Hannah are free):  
- 9:30–10:00 (30 minutes, intersection of 9:30–11:00 and 9:00–10:00)  
- 11:30–12:30 (1 hour, intersection of 11:30–14:00 and 10:30–12:30)  
- 13:00–14:00 (1 hour, intersection of 11:30–14:00 and 13:00–15:00)  
- 16:00–17:00 (1 hour, intersection of 14:30–17:00 and 16:00–17:00)  

Since we need a 30-minute meeting, all these slots are viable. The earliest slot is 9:30–10:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Validate that the 9:30–10:00 slot works for all participants and meets the 30-minute duration requirement.  
**How to Achieve**: Check that 9:30–10:00 does not conflict with George’s or Hannah’s busy times and confirm Ian’s availability. Ensure the slot is within 9:00–17:00 and lasts 30 minutes.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **George**: Busy at 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30. The 9:30–10:00 slot is free (within 9:30–11:00).  
- **Hannah**: Busy at 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:00–16:00. The 9:30–10:00 slot is free (within 9:00–10:00).  
- **Ian**: Free all day, so 9:30–10:00 is available.  
- **Duration and time frame**: The slot is exactly 30 minutes and within 9:00–17:00.  
The 9:30–10:00 slot is valid and satisfies all constraints.  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping 30-minute time slots (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest overlapping slot (9:30–10:00 identified).  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the solution (9:30–10:00 validated).  

**Current Goal**: Confirm the final meeting time and provide the solution.  
The goal hierarchy is updated, and the current goal is to finalize the meeting time based on the validated slot.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The earliest available time for a 30-minute meeting for George, Hannah, and Ian on Monday is **9:30–10:00**. This slot satisfies all constraints: it is within 9:00–17:00, fits the 30-minute duration, and is free for all participants (George, Hannah, and Ian).
