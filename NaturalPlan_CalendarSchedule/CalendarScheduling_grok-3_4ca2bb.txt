**Problem Statement**: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules: Julia is busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:30-13:30, and 15:00-15:30; Kevin is busy from 10:00-11:00, 13:00-14:00, and 16:30-17:00; Laura is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, and 14:30-15:30. Find a time slot that accommodates everyone, or explain why no such slot exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within 9:00-17:00.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Select a suitable time slot or determine if no such slot exists.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy time slots for Julia, Kevin, and Laura, then determine their free time slots within 9:00-17:00 by excluding busy periods.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Julia’s Schedule**: Busy from 9:30-10:30, 12:30-13:30, 15:00-15:30.  
  Free slots: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00.  
- **Kevin’s Schedule**: Busy from 10:00-11:00, 13:00-14:00, 16:30-17:00.  
  Free slots: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:00, 14:00-16:30.  
- **Laura’s Schedule**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:30-15:30.  
  Free slots: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of Julia, Kevin, and Laura to identify any one-hour periods where all are available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To find a common one-hour slot, we compare the free slots:  
- **Julia**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00.  
- **Kevin**: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:00, 14:00-16:30.  
- **Laura**: 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.  

Possible one-hour overlapping slots:  
- **9:00-9:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.  
- **10:30-11:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (11:00-13:00, so free 11:00-11:30), Laura (free). Partial overlap from 11:00-11:30, but not a full hour.  
- **11:30-12:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (busy). Not viable.  
- **12:30-13:00**: Julia (free 12:30-13:30), Kevin (free 12:30-13:00), Laura (free). Full overlap from 12:30-13:00, but only 30 minutes.  
- **13:00-14:00**: Julia (free 13:30-15:00), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.  
- **14:00-15:00**: Julia (free 13:30-15:00), Kevin (free), Laura (free 14:00-14:30). Partial overlap from 14:00-14:30, but only 30 minutes.  
- **15:30-16:30**: Julia (free), Kevin (free), Laura (free). Full one-hour overlap.  
- **16:30-17:00**: Julia (free), Kevin (busy), Laura (free). Not viable.  

The only full one-hour slot where all are free is **15:30-16:30**.

### Step 4: Validation
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Verify that 15:30-16:30 is a valid one-hour slot for all participants.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the schedules to ensure no participant has a conflict during 15:30-16:30.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
- **Julia**: Free from 15:30-17:00 (no conflict, as busy only until 15:30).  
- **Kevin**: Free from 14:00-16:30 (no conflict, as busy only from 16:30).  
- **Laura**: Free from 15:30-17:00 (no conflict, as busy only until 15:30).  
The 15:30-16:30 slot is valid, as all participants are free.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Track Goals
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00-17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, identified 15:30-16:30).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the selected time slot (completed, 15:30-16:30 is valid).  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time.  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Current Goal**: Finalize the meeting time.  
**How to Achieve**: Select the validated one-hour slot and present it as the solution.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The one-hour meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura can be scheduled on Monday from **15:30 to 16:30**, as this is the only time slot where all participants are available.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **15:30 to 16:30**.
