### Problem Restatement
I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Julia’s calendar is completely open. Kevin has meetings from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. Laura is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. The goal is to find the earliest possible 30-minute time slot that works for all participants.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping time slots that are at least 30 minutes long and accommodate all participants.  
3. Select the earliest available time slot from the overlapping options.  
4. Validate the selected time slot against all constraints.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
**How to Achieve**: List the busy and free time slots for Julia, Kevin, and Laura based on their schedules, then calculate the time periods when each is available.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Julia’s Availability**: Julia’s calendar is wide open, so she is available from 9:00 to 17:00.  
- **Kevin’s Availability**: Kevin is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00. His free time slots are:  
  - 10:00–11:30  
  - 12:00–14:00  
  - 15:00–17:00  
- **Laura’s Availability**: Laura is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30. Her free time slots are:  
  - 9:00–10:00  
  - 10:30–12:30  
  - 13:00–15:30  
  - 16:30–17:00  
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping time slots that are at least 30 minutes long and accommodate all participants.  
**How to Achieve**: Compare the free time slots of Julia, Kevin, and Laura to identify periods where all are available, ensuring each slot is at least 30 minutes long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since Julia is available all day, we only need to find overlaps between Kevin’s and Laura’s free time slots that are at least 30 minutes long. Let’s compare their free slots:  

- **Kevin’s free slots**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00  
- **Laura’s free slots**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00  

Now, compute the intersections:  
- **9:00–10:00**: Laura is free, but Kevin is busy (9:00–10:00). No overlap.  
- **10:00–11:30 (Kevin)** vs. **10:30–12:30 (Laura)**: Overlap is 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes).  
- **12:00–14:00 (Kevin)** vs. **10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30 (Laura)**: Overlaps are 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes) and 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes).  
- **15:00–17:00 (Kevin)** vs. **13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00 (Laura)**: Overlap is 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes).  

**Overlapping slots (at least 30 minutes)**:  
- 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes)  
- 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes)  
- 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes)  
- 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes)  
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest available time slot from the overlapping options.  
**How to Achieve**: Review the list of overlapping time slots and choose the one that starts earliest while meeting the 30-minute duration requirement.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The overlapping time slots are:  
- 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes)  
- 12:00–12:30 (30 minutes)  
- 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes)  
- 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes)  

The earliest slot is **10:30–11:00** (30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement for a 30-minute meeting and is the earliest possible time within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Validate that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) works for all participants and meets all constraints.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the selected time slot against each participant’s busy schedule and confirm it falls within the 9:00–17:00 window and is 30 minutes long.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Julia**: Available all day, so 10:30–11:00 is free.  
- **Kevin**: Free from 10:00–11:30, so 10:30–11:00 is free.  
- **Laura**: Free from 10:30–12:30, so 10:30–11:00 is free.  
- **Constraints**: The slot is within 9:00–17:00 and is exactly 30 minutes long.  

The time slot **10:30–11:00** is valid for all participants and meets all constraints.

**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at their earliest availability.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping time slots that are at least 30 minutes long. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest available time slot. (Completed)  
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the selected time slot. (Completed)  

**Current Goal**: The current goal is to confirm the final meeting time, which has been identified as 10:30–11:00.  

All subgoals have been achieved, and the proposed time slot is validated.

### Final Answer
The earliest available time slot for a 30-minute meeting that works for Julia, Kevin, and Laura on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 is **10:30–11:00**.
