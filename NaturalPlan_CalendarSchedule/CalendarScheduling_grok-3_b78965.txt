### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules:
- **Irene**: Busy from 9:30–10:30 and 12:00–13:00.
- **Jack**: Busy from 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, and 15:30–16:30.
- **Kelly**: Busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, and 14:30–15:30.
We aim to find a one-hour time slot where all participants are available. If no such slot exists, we must explain why.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
Break down the goal of scheduling a one-hour meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.  
2. Find overlapping one-hour time slots where all participants are free.  
3. Validate the identified time slot or determine if no solution exists.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the available time slots for each participant. This will be achieved by listing the busy periods and determining the free periods within 9:00–17:00 for Irene, Jack, and Kelly.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To find available time slots, we analyze each participant’s schedule:

- **Irene’s busy times**: 9:30–10:30, 12:00–13:00.  
  **Free times**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.

- **Jack’s busy times**: 10:00–11:00, 13:30–14:30, 15:30–16:30.  
  **Free times**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.

- **Kelly’s busy times**: 9:00–9:30, 11:30–12:30, 14:30–15:30.  
  **Free times**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Next, we need to find a one-hour slot where these free periods overlap.

### Step 3: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find a one-hour time slot where all participants are free by comparing their available time slots and identifying overlaps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We compare the free time slots:  
- **Irene**: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- **Jack**: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- **Kelly**: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.

Possible one-hour overlapping slots (9:00–17:00):  
- **9:00–9:30**: Irene (free), Jack (free), Kelly (busy). **Not possible**.  
- **10:30–11:30**: Irene (10:30–12:00), Jack (11:00–13:30), Kelly (9:30–11:30). Overlap is 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes, too short).  
- **11:00–12:00**: Irene (10:30–12:00), Jack (11:00–13:30), Kelly (9:30–11:30). Overlap is 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes, too short).  
- **12:30–13:30**: Irene (13:00–17:00), Jack (11:00–13:30), Kelly (12:30–14:30). Overlap is 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes, too short).  
- **13:00–14:30**: Irene (13:00–17:00), Jack (11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30), Kelly (12:30–14:30). Overlap is 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes, too short).  
- **14:30–15:30**: Irene (13:00–17:00), Jack (14:30–15:30), Kelly (15:30–17:00). Overlap is 14:30–15:30 (1 hour).  
- **15:30–16:30**: Irene (13:00–17:00), Jack (16:30–17:00), Kelly (15:30–17:00). Overlap is 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes, too short).  
- **16:30–17:00**: Irene (13:00–17:00), Jack (16:30–17:00), Kelly (15:30–17:00). Overlap is 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes, too short).

The only one-hour slot where all are free is **14:30–15:30**.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Validation (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate that the 14:30–15:30 time slot is free for all participants by rechecking their schedules.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Recheck schedules for 14:30–15:30:  
- **Irene**: Free from 13:00–17:00 (includes 14:30–15:30).  
- **Jack**: Free from 14:30–15:30.  
- **Kelly**: Free from 15:30–17:00, but busy from 14:30–15:30.

Correction: Kelly is busy from 14:30–15:30, so this slot is not viable. Reviewing all slots again, no other one-hour slot fully overlaps. For example:  
- **13:00–14:00**: Irene (free), Jack (free until 13:30), Kelly (free). Limited to 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes).  
- **16:30–17:00**: Irene (free), Jack (free), Kelly (free). Only 30 minutes.

No one-hour slot satisfies all constraints.

### Step 5: Track Goals (Review)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Irene, Jack, and Kelly on Monday between 9:00–17:00.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping one-hour time slots (completed, no valid slot found).  
  - Subgoal 3: Validate the identified slot or confirm no solution (completed, no solution).  
**Current Goal**: Conclude the scheduling process by reporting the result.  
**Summary**: No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday is available for all participants due to conflicting schedules.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 6: Reach Goal (Implementation)
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to conclude the scheduling process by explaining why no one-hour time slot is available and providing a final answer.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday works for Irene, Jack, and Kelly. The schedules conflict as follows:  
- Irene’s free slots: 9:00–9:30, 10:30–12:00, 13:00–17:00.  
- Jack’s free slots: 9:00–10:00, 11:00–13:30, 14:30–15:30, 16:30–17:00.  
- Kelly’s free slots: 9:30–11:30, 12:30–14:30, 15:30–17:00.  
The longest overlapping periods (e.g., 13:00–13:30, 16:30–17:00) are only 30 minutes, insufficient for a one-hour meeting. The 14:30–15:30 slot initially seemed viable but fails because Kelly is busy. Thus, no solution exists within the given constraints.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
No one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday is available for Irene, Jack, and Kelly due to overlapping busy periods, with no common one-hour window where all are free.
