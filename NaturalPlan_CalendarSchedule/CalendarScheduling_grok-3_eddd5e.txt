### Problem Statement
Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their existing schedules. Umar is busy from 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, and 14:00–14:30; Vanessa is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:00; William is free all day. The meeting should be scheduled at the earliest possible time that accommodates everyone’s availability.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting into subgoals:  
1. Identify the time range (9:00–17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).  
2. List all time slots within the range, accounting for existing schedules.  
3. Find the earliest 30-minute slot where Umar, Vanessa, and William are all free.  
4. Verify the solution meets all constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify a 30-minute time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 where Umar, Vanessa, and William are all available. To achieve this, list the busy time slots for each participant, determine free time slots, and find the earliest 30-minute slot where all are free.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Busy times**:  
  - Umar: 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30  
  - Vanessa: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00  
  - William: None (free all day)  
- **Available time slots** (30-minute increments between 9:00–17:00, excluding busy times):  
  - 9:30–10:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 10:30–11:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 11:30–12:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 12:00–12:30: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 13:00–13:30: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 13:30–14:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 14:30–15:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 15:00–15:30: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 16:00–16:30: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
  - 16:30–17:00: Umar free, Vanessa free, William free  
- **Earliest slot**: The earliest 30-minute slot where all are free is 9:30–10:00.

### Step 3: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to verify that the proposed time slot (9:30–10:00) satisfies all constraints: it must be within 9:00–17:00, 30 minutes long, and free for Umar, Vanessa, and William.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Check constraints**:  
  - Time range: 9:30–10:00 is within 9:00–17:00.  
  - Duration: 9:30–10:00 is exactly 30 minutes.  
  - Umar’s availability: Umar is busy 9:00–9:30, 11:00–11:30, 14:00–14:30; free at 9:30–10:00.  
  - Vanessa’s availability: Vanessa is busy 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:00; free at 9:30–10:00.  
  - William’s availability: William is free all day, including 9:30–10:00.  
- **Conclusion**: The slot 9:30–10:00 satisfies all constraints.

### Step 4: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00–17:00 at the earliest possible time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Identify the time range and meeting duration (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: List all possible time slots, accounting for schedules (completed).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the earliest 30-minute slot where all are free (completed: 9:30–10:00).  
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the solution meets all constraints (completed).  
**Current Goal**: Confirm the proposed time slot (9:30–10:00) as the final solution.  
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled on Monday from **9:30 to 10:00**, as it is the earliest 30-minute time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 where Umar, Vanessa, and William are all available.
