### Problem Restatement
We need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The goal is to find the earliest possible time slot that fits within everyone’s availability, given the following constraints:
- Umar is available all day.
- Vanessa is busy from 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, and 14:00–15:00.
- William is busy from 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, and 15:30–16:30.
We will use the meta-cognitive action set (Planning, Implementation, Review) to systematically find a solution or explain why no solution exists.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve the scheduling problem, we need to break it down into intermediate subgoals:
1. Identify the available time slots for each participant within the 9:00–17:00 window.
2. Find overlapping time slots where all participants are available for at least 30 minutes.
3. Select the earliest 30-minute time slot that satisfies all constraints.
4. Validate the chosen time slot to ensure it meets the meeting duration and time constraints.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Identify the available time slots for each participant.
**How to Achieve**: List the busy periods for each participant, then determine their available time slots within 9:00–17:00. Since Umar is free all day, focus on Vanessa’s and William’s schedules to find gaps.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Umar’s Availability**: Free from 9:00–17:00 (entire day).
- **Vanessa’s Busy Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 11:30–12:00, 14:00–15:00.
  - Available periods: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.
- **William’s Busy Periods**: 10:00–10:30, 12:30–13:00, 15:30–16:30.
  - Available periods: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.
[/IMP]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Find overlapping time slots where all participants are available for at least 30 minutes.
**How to Achieve**: Compare the available periods of Vanessa and William (since Umar is free all day) to identify common time slots that are at least 30 minutes long.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Vanessa’s Available Periods**: 10:00–11:30, 12:00–14:00, 15:00–17:00.
- **William’s Available Periods**: 9:00–10:00, 10:30–12:30, 13:00–15:30, 16:30–17:00.
- **Overlapping Periods** (considering both):
  - 10:00–11:30 (Vanessa) and 10:30–12:30 (William) → Overlap: 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes).
  - 12:00–14:00 (Vanessa) and 13:00–15:30 (William) → Overlap: 13:00–14:00 (60 minutes).
  - 15:00–17:00 (Vanessa) and 16:30–17:00 (William) → Overlap: 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes).
- All overlaps are at least 30 minutes long and thus viable for the meeting.
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Select the earliest 30-minute time slot that satisfies all constraints.
**How to Achieve**: From the overlapping time slots, choose the earliest one that is at least 30 minutes long, as per the preference for the earliest availability.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- Overlapping time slots: 10:30–11:30, 13:00–14:00, 16:30–17:00.
- Earliest time slot: 10:30–11:30 (60 minutes, can accommodate a 30-minute meeting).
- Select **10:30–11:00** as the earliest 30-minute slot.
[/IMP]

---

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal**: Validate that the selected time slot (10:30–11:00) meets all constraints.
**How to Achieve**: Check that 10:30–11:00 is within 9:00–17:00 and that all participants are free during this period.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
- **Time Constraint**: 10:30–11:00 is within 9:00–17:00. Valid.
- **Umar**: Free all day. Valid.
- **Vanessa**: Free from 10:00–11:30. 10:30–11:00 is within this period. Valid.
- **William**: Free from 10:30–12:30. 10:30–11:00 is within this period. Valid.
- **Duration**: The slot is exactly 30 minutes, matching the meeting duration. Valid.
The time slot 10:30–11:00 satisfies all constraints.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Track Goals
[PLANNING]
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Umar, Vanessa, and William on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 at the earliest availability.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify available time slots for each participant (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Find overlapping time slots of at least 30 minutes (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Select the earliest 30-minute time slot (completed).
  - Subgoal 4: Validate the chosen time slot (completed).
**Current Goal**: Completed (validation confirmed the solution).
**Summary**: The scheduling process is complete, with the meeting scheduled for 10:30–11:00.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The meeting can be scheduled for **Monday, 10:30–11:00**, as this is the earliest 30-minute time slot where Umar, Vanessa, and William are all available within the 9:00–17:00 work hours.
