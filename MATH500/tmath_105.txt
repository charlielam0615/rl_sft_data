Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Extract the number of students for each county in 2005.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the table, the number of students in 2005 for each county is as follows:
- Aiken: 136
- Bamberg: 11
- Barnwell: 29
- Berkeley: 524
- Calhoun: 11
- Cherokee: 19
- Chesterfield: 29
- Colleton: 41

Our goals are:  
1. Extract the number of students for each county in 2005 (done).  
2. Arrange these numbers in ascending order (in progress).  
3. Determine the median by finding the middle value in the ordered list (to do).

Goal of this step: Arrange the 2005 student numbers in ascending order.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The numbers for 2005 are: 136, 11, 29, 524, 11, 19, 29, 41.  

Arranging them in ascending order:  
11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.

I am focusing on determining the median from the ordered list of 2005 student numbers.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the median of the ordered list.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The ordered list of 2005 student numbers is:  
11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.  

Since there are 8 numbers (an even count), the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers in the ordered list.  
The 4th number is 29, and the 5th number is also 29.  

Calculating the median:  
$$
\text{Median} = \frac{29 + 29}{2} = \frac{58}{2} = 29
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the median calculation process, including data extraction, ordering, and arithmetic operations.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Data extraction verification:
- Aiken: 136 (matches table)
- Bamberg: 11 (matches table)
- Barnwell: 29 (matches table)
- Berkeley: 524 (matches table)
- Calhoun: 11 (matches table)
- Cherokee: 19 (matches table)
- Chesterfield: 29 (matches table)
- Colleton: 41 (matches table)
All values correctly extracted from the provided table.

2. Ordering verification:
Raw list: [136, 11, 29, 524, 11, 19, 29, 41]
Sorted list: [11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524]
- First two smallest values (11,11) correctly identified
- Next smallest is 19, then two 29s, followed by 41, 136, and largest value 524
- Total count remains 8, no values lost or duplicated

3. Median calculation verification:
- Even count (8) confirmed
- Positions: (8/2)=4th and 5th elements
- 4th element = 29, 5th element = 29
- (29 + 29)/2 = 58/2 = 29
All arithmetic operations are correct

4. Boundary condition check:
- What if 4th and 5th elements were different? Process remains valid
- What if there were odd number of elements? Would take middle element directly
- Current approach follows standard median calculation rules

No discrepancies found in any verification step.

[ANSWER]
The median number of students in 2005 was $\boxed{29}$.
