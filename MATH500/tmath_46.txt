The polynomial $ z^4 + z^2 + 1 $ can be rewritten using the substitution $ w = z^2 $, which transforms it into $ w^2 + w + 1 = 0 $. This is a quadratic equation in $ w $, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
$$ w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} $$
$$ w = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} $$
Since $ w = z^2 $, we substitute back to find $ z $:
$$ z^2 = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} $$
$$ z = \pm \sqrt{\frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}} $$
These are the four roots of the polynomial. To simplify further, we can express the roots in terms of complex numbers in polar form. The roots are:
$$ z = \pm \sqrt{\frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}} $$
$$ z = \pm \sqrt{\frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}} $$
These roots are complex numbers, and we need to verify if they are $ n $-th roots of unity.

The complex numbers $ \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} $ can be recognized as the 3rd roots of unity. Specifically, these are $ e^{2\pi i/3} $ and $ e^{-2\pi i/3} $, which are the non-real cube roots of unity.  

Now, we take the square roots of these complex numbers to find the roots of the original polynomial $ z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 $. Taking square roots of the cube roots of unity will result in the 6th roots of unity, since the square root of a cube root is a 6th root. This is because $ (e^{2\pi i/3})^{1/2} = e^{\pi i/3} $, and $ (e^{-2\pi i/3})^{1/2} = e^{-\pi i/3} $, which are 6th roots of unity.  

Thus, the four roots of $ z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 $ are all 6th roots of unity.

[REVIEW]
Roots of unity are complex numbers $ z $ such that $ z^n = 1 $ for some positive integer $ n $. The polynomial $ z^4 + z^2 + 1 $ can be rewritten as $ \frac{z^6 - 1}{z^2 - 1} $, which shows that its roots are the 6th roots of unity excluding the 2nd roots of unity (i.e., $ z = 1 $ and $ z = -1 $). This implies that the roots of $ z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0 $ are the primitive 6th roots of unity. The smallest $ n $ such that all roots of the polynomial are $ n $-th roots of unity is therefore $ n = 6 $.

1. The polynomial z^4 + z^2 + 1 can be rewritten as (z^2 + z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1), but this factorization is incorrect. The correct factorization involves recognizing that z^6 - 1 = (z^3 - 1)(z^3 + 1) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)(z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1). Therefore, z^4 + z^2 + 1 is equivalent to (z^6 - 1)/(z^2 - 1). This confirms that the roots are the 6th roots of unity excluding ±1, i.e., the primitive 6th roots of unity.

2. The substitution w = z^2 transforms the equation into w^2 + w + 1 = 0, whose solutions are the primitive 3rd roots of unity. Taking square roots of these yields four distinct complex numbers: e^(πi/3), e^(-πi/3), e^(πi/3 + πi) = e^(4πi/3), and e^(-πi/3 - πi) = e^(-4πi/3). These correspond to the 6th roots of unity at angles π/3, 5π/3, 4π/3, and 2π/3, which are all primitive 6th roots.

3. The minimal n must be 6 because the roots are not 3rd roots (as they are four in number and 3rd roots only have two non-1 roots) nor 2nd roots (which are real). Thus, 6 is the smallest n where all roots satisfy z^n = 1.

The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the properties of roots of unity. The conclusion is correct.
