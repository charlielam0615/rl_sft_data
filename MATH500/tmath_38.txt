Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up a proportion or equation to find the total daily caloric requirement.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $ x $ be the total daily caloric requirement. The snack-size tin of peaches contributes $ 2\% $ of the daily requirement, which is $ 40 $ calories. This can be represented as:

$$
0.02 \times x = 40
$$

To find $ x $, divide both sides of the equation by $ 0.02 $:

$$
x = \frac{40}{0.02}
$$

$$
x = 2000
$$

Thus, the total daily caloric requirement is $ 2000 $ calories.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The given values and the equation used to solve the problem.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The given values are that a snack-size tin of peaches has $ 40 $ calories and represents $ 2\% $ of a person's daily caloric requirement. The equation used to find the total daily caloric requirement is:

$$
0.02 \times x = 40
$$

This equation was solved by dividing both sides by $ 0.02 $, yielding $ x = 2000 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the equation setup and solution for the daily caloric requirement.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The equation $ 0.02 \times x = 40 $ is derived from the statement that 2% of the daily requirement equals 40 calories. Solving for $ x $ by dividing both sides by 0.02 is mathematically valid. Verifying the arithmetic:  

1. $ \frac{40}{0.02} = 2000 $:  
   - Dividing by 0.02 is equivalent to multiplying by 50 (since $ 1/0.02 = 50 $).  
   - $ 40 \times 50 = 2000 $.  

2. Cross-checking with percentage logic:  
   - If 2% = 40 calories, then 1% = 20 calories.  
   - 100% = $ 20 \times 100 = 2000 $ calories.  

Both methods confirm the solution $ x = 2000 $. The reasoning aligns with percentage principles, and no inconsistencies are detected.
