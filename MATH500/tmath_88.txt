Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Analyze the function $ f(x) $ for its behavior in both cases:  
   - For $ x \geq a $, $ f(x) = ax^2 $.  
   - For $ x < a $, $ f(x) = ax + 2a $.  
2. Determine the domain of $ f(x) $:  
   - Since $ f(x) $ is defined for all real numbers, the domain is $ (-\infty, \infty) $.  
3. Evaluate the continuity of $ f(x) $ at $ x = a $:  
   - Check whether $ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a) $.  
4. Analyze the range of $ f(x) $:  
   - For $ x < a $, the function is linear and $ f(x) $ increases without bound as $ x \to \infty $, and decreases without bound as $ x \to -\infty $.  
   - For $ x \geq a $, the function is quadratic and opens upward, so it has a minimum at $ x = a $ and increases to $ \infty $.  
5. Ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at least once:  
   - Determine the constraints on $ a $ such that for every $ y \in \mathbb{R} $, the equation $ f(x) = y $ has at least one solution.  
6. Solve for the largest value of $ a $ satisfying these constraints.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Evaluate the continuity of $ f(x) $ at $ x = a $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To evaluate continuity at $ x = a $, we need to check whether:  
$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
$$  

1. **Left-hand limit** ($ x \to a^- $):  
   For $ x < a $, $ f(x) = ax + 2a $.  
   So,  
   $$
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
   $$  

2. **Right-hand limit** ($ x \to a^+ $):  
   For $ x \geq a $, $ f(x) = ax^2 $.  
   So,  
   $$
   \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
   $$  

3. **Value of the function at $ x = a $**:  
   For $ x = a $, $ f(x) = ax^2 = a^3 $.  

Thus,  
$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a, \quad \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a^3, \quad f(a) = a^3.
$$  

The function is continuous at $ x = a $ if $ a^2 + 2a = a^3 $.  
Rewriting:  
$$
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
$$  
Factoring:  
$$
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
$$  
$$
a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0.
$$  

So, the possible values of $ a $ for which $ f(x) $ is continuous at $ x = a $ are $ a = 0 $, $ a = 2 $, and $ a = -1 $.  

We will revisit this result in the next step to determine how it affects the problem.

Scope of Verification: Correctness of the continuity analysis and its relevance to the problem's requirements.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The previous step correctly evaluated the continuity of $ f(x) $ at $ x = a $, leading to the equation $ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0 $, which factors as $ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 $. The roots $ a = 0, 2, -1 $ are valid for continuity. However, the problem does not require continuity but rather ensures the function's **range** covers all real numbers. The critical condition for this is that the left-hand limit $ a^2 + 2a $ must be **greater than or equal to** the right-hand limit $ a^3 $ to avoid a gap in the range. This leads to the inequality $ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 $, or $ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 $, whose solution $ a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] $ ensures the function's range covers $ \mathbb{R} $. The maximum value of $ a $ in this interval is $ a = 2 $, which satisfies the inequality with equality ($ a^2 + 2a = a^3 $), ensuring no gap. For $ a > 2 $, the inequality fails, creating a gap between the linear and quadratic parts. Thus, the reasoning correctly identifies $ a = 2 $ as the maximal value.  

The continuity analysis was correct but not the primary requirement. The focus on the range condition and the derived inequality correctly resolves the problem.
