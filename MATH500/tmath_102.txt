Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Group terms appropriately to identify potential common factors.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given expression is $ ab + 5b + 2a + 10 $.  

To group terms, we look for pairs with common factors.  
- $ ab $ and $ 5b $ share the factor $ b $.  
- $ 2a $ and $ 10 $ share the factor $ 2 $.  

Group the expression as: $ (ab + 5b) + (2a + 10) $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor out the greatest common factor from each group.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the grouped expression $ (ab + 5b) + (2a + 10) $:  

1. Factor out $ b $ from the first group $ ab + 5b $:  
   $ ab + 5b = b(a + 5) $.  

2. Factor out $ 2 $ from the second group $ 2a + 10 $:  
   $ 2a + 10 = 2(a + 5) $.  

The expression becomes $ b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5) $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine the factored expressions if possible.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expression is now $ b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5) $.  

Notice that both terms share the common binomial factor $ (a + 5) $.  

Factor out $ (a + 5) $ from the entire expression:  
$$
b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5) = (a + 5)(b + 2)
$$
[/IMP]
[PLANNING]
Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that the final factored form $ (a + 5)(b + 2) $ is equivalent to the original expression $ ab + 5b + 2a + 10 $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
To verify correctness, expand $ (a + 5)(b + 2) $:  
$$
(a + 5)(b + 2) = a \cdot b + a \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot b + 5 \cdot 2 = ab + 2a + 5b + 10.
$$  
Rearranging terms: $ ab + 5b + 2a + 10 $, which matches the original expression.  

Additionally, check intermediate steps:  
1. Grouping as $ (ab + 5b) + (2a + 10) $ is valid, as $ ab + 5b $ shares $ b $, and $ 2a + 10 $ shares $ 2 $.  
2. Factoring $ b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5) $ correctly isolates common terms.  
3. Final factorization $ (a + 5)(b + 2) $ groups the shared binomial $ (a + 5) $, which is valid.  

No inconsistencies or errors detected in logic or algebraic manipulation.  
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The factored form of the expression is $ (a + 5)(b + 2) $.
