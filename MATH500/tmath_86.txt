Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Determine the number of possible combinations for one shirt and one pair of pants.
2. Determine the number of possible combinations for each shirt-pants pair with one hat.
3. Calculate the total number of possible outfits.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the number of possible combinations for one shirt and one pair of pants.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the number of combinations for one shirt and one pair of pants, we simply multiply the number of shirts by the number of pants:
$$ \text{Shirt-Pants Combinations} = \text{Number of Shirts} \times \text{Number of Pants} $$
$$ \text{Shirt-Pants Combinations} = 5 \times 6 $$
$$ \text{Shirt-Pants Combinations} = 30 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the number of possible combinations for each shirt-pants pair with one hat.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For each of the 30 shirt-pants combinations, we can pair with any of the 8 hats. Therefore, the total number of combinations for shirt-pants and hat is:  
$$ \text{Total Outfits} = \text{Shirt-Pants Combinations} \times \text{Number of Hats} $$  
$$ \text{Total Outfits} = 30 \times 8 $$  
$$ \text{Total Outfits} = 240 $$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution including calculation logic, multiplication steps, and final total.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
To verify the solution:
1. **First step verification**: Shirt-pants combinations. 5 shirts × 6 pants = 30 combinations. This follows the multiplication principle for independent choices.
2. **Second step verification**: Adding hats. 30 shirt-pants combinations × 8 hats = 240 total outfits. This maintains the independence of choices (each hat pairs with every shirt-pants combination).
3. **Alternative validation**: Calculate directly using all three categories: 5 × 6 × 8 = 240. This matches the previous result.
4. **Error-checking**: No overlapping constraints (e.g., incompatible shirt-hat pairings) are mentioned in the problem, so the multiplication principle applies cleanly.
All calculations and logical steps are consistent with combinatorial principles. No contradictions or errors detected.
