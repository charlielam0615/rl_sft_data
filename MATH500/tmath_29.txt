Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers from 5.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers from 5, we use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to be chosen.

In this case, $n = 5$ and $k = 4$, so the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers from 5 is $C(5, 4) = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!}$.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The combination formula and the result for choosing 4 upper class soldiers from 5.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The combination formula is $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, and the result for choosing 4 upper class soldiers from 5 is $C(5, 4) = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!}$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers from 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the number of ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers from 10, we again use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, $n = 10$ and $k = 8$, so the number of ways is $C(10, 8) = \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!}$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution including combination calculations and multiplication of independent choices.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Combination calculations**:  
   - For upper class soldiers (C(5,4)):  
     $ \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{120}{24 \cdot 1} = 5 $. This is correct because choosing 4 out of 5 distinct items has 5 possible combinations.  
   - For lower class soldiers (C(10,8)):  
     $ \frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \frac{3628800}{40320 \cdot 2} = \frac{3628800}{80640} = 45 $. This aligns with the property $ C(n,k) = C(n, n-k) $, so $ C(10,8) = C(10,2) = 45 $.  

2. **Multiplication of independent choices**:  
   The total number of battalions is the product of the two combinations: $ 5 \times 45 = 225 $. This is valid because the selections of upper and lower class soldiers are independent events.  

3. **Final answer consistency**:  
   All steps logically follow, and intermediate results match expected values for combinations. No contradictions or errors detected.  

Conclusion: All calculations and reasoning are correct.
