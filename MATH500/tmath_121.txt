Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Find a common denominator for the fractions and combine the terms on the left side of the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The denominators in the equation are 2 and 3. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6. To combine the terms, rewrite each fraction with the denominator 6:

$$
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{3x}{6}, \quad \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{6}
$$

Now, substitute into the equation:

$$
\frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = 5
$$

Combine the terms on the left side:

$$
\frac{3x + 2x}{6} = 5
$$

$$
\frac{5x}{6} = 5
$$

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ x $ in the equation $ \frac{5x}{6} = 5 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To isolate $ x $, multiply both sides of the equation by 6:  

$$
6 \cdot \frac{5x}{6} = 6 \cdot 5
$$

$$
5x = 30
$$

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5:

$$
x = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Common denominator verification**:  
   - Original denominators: 2 and 3  
   - LCD calculation: 6 is indeed the least common multiple of 2 and 3.  
   - Fraction conversion:  
     - $ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{3x}{6} $ (correct, numerator scaled by $ 3 $)  
     - $ \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{6} $ (correct, numerator scaled by $ 2 $)  

2. **Combining terms verification**:  
   - $ \frac{3x}{6} + \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{5x}{6} $ (correct, addition of like terms)  

3. **Solving for $ x $**:  
   - Multiply both sides by 6:  
     - $ 6 \cdot \frac{5x}{6} = 5 \cdot 6 $ â†’ $ 5x = 30 $ (correct)  
   - Divide both sides by 5:  
     - $ x = \frac{30}{5} = 6 $ (correct)  

4. **Back-substitution validation**:  
   - Substitute $ x = 6 $ into the original equation:  
     - $ \frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{3} = 3 + 2 = 5 $ (matches the RHS)  

All operations follow algebraic rules, intermediate steps are logically consistent, and the solution satisfies the original equation. No errors detected.
