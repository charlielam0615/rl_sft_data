Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the first part of the compound inequality, $-4 < 2(x - 1)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve $-4 < 2(x - 1)$, we first divide both sides of the inequality by 2 to isolate the expression in parentheses:

$$
-4 < 2(x - 1)
$$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$$
-2 < x - 1
$$

Next, we add 1 to both sides to isolate $x$:

$$
-2 + 1 < x
$$

$$
-1 < x
$$

So, the solution to the first part is $x > -1$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the second part of the compound inequality, $2(x - 1) < 8$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve $2(x - 1) < 8$, we first divide both sides of the inequality by 2 to simplify:

$$
2(x - 1) < 8
$$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$$
x - 1 < 4
$$

Next, we add 1 to both sides to isolate $x$:

$$
x - 1 + 1 < 4 + 1
$$

$$
x < 5
$$

So, the solution to the second part is $x < 5$.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The solutions to the two parts of the compound inequality.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The solution to the first part $-4 < 2(x - 1)$ is $x > -1$. The solution to the second part $2(x - 1) < 8$ is $x < 5$.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine the results of the two parts into the solution in the form $a < x < b$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The solution to the first part is $x > -1$ and the solution to the second part is $x < 5$. Combining these, we find that the compound inequality is satisfied when:

$$
-1 < x < 5
$$

Thus, the solution is in the form $a < x < b$ with $a = -1$ and $b = 5$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the sum $a + b$ where $a = -1$ and $b = 5$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the sum $a + b$, substitute the values of $a = -1$ and $b = 5$:

$$
a + b = -1 + 5
$$

$$
a + b = 4
$$

Thus, the sum $a + b$ is 4.

[VERIFY]
1. **Step 1: Splitting the compound inequality**  
   The original inequality $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$ was split into two parts: $-4 < 2(x - 1)$ and $2(x - 1) < 8$. This is a valid approach for compound inequalities of the form $A < B < C$, as they are logically equivalent to $A < B$ and $B < C$. No errors here.

2. **Step 2: Solving the first inequality**  
   $-4 < 2(x - 1)$ was simplified by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in $-2 < x - 1$. Adding 1 to both sides gives $-1 < x$.  
   - Test case: Let $x = 0$. Substituting into the original first inequality: $2(0 - 1) = -2$, and $-4 < -2$ holds.  
   - Test case: Let $x = -2$. Substituting: $2(-2 - 1) = -6$, and $-4 < -6$ is false. This aligns with $x > -1$.  
   The algebra and test cases confirm correctness.

3. **Step 3: Solving the second inequality**  
   $2(x - 1) < 8$ was simplified by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in $x - 1 < 4$. Adding 1 gives $x < 5$.  
   - Test case: Let $x = 4$. Substituting: $2(4 - 1) = 6 < 8$ holds.  
   - Test case: Let $x = 5$. Substituting: $2(5 - 1) = 8$, which does not satisfy $< 8$. This aligns with $x < 5$.  
   The algebra and test cases confirm correctness.

4. **Step 4: Combining the results**  
   The combined solution $-1 < x < 5$ was derived from $x > -1$ and $x < 5$. This is valid for a compound inequality where both conditions must hold simultaneously.  
   - Test case: Let $x = 3$. Substituting into the original compound inequality: $2(3 - 1) = 4$, and $-4 < 4 < 8$ holds.  
   - Test case: Let $x = -1$. Substituting: $2(-1 - 1) = -4$, and $-4 < -4 < 8$ fails (since $-4$ is not greater than $-4$). This aligns with $x > -1$.  
   The combined solution is correct.

5. **Step 5: Calculating $a + b$**  
   With $a = -1$ and $b = 5$, the sum $a + b = -1 + 5 = 4$ is correct. All steps are arithmetically valid.

**Conclusion**: All steps in the solution process are logically sound, algebraically correct, and verified with test cases. No errors detected.
