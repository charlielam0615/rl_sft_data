What to recall: The formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The formula for the volume $ V $ of a sphere is $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 $, and the formula for the surface area $ A $ is $ A = 4\pi r^2 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up an equation where the volume equals the surface area.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given that the numerical value of the volume equals the numerical value of the surface area. That is,  
$$
\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 4\pi r^2
$$  
We simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $ 4\pi $, assuming $ \pi \neq 0 $ and $ r \neq 0 $:  
$$
\frac{1}{3} r^3 = r^2
$$  
Next, divide both sides by $ r^2 $, assuming $ r \neq 0 $:  
$$
\frac{1}{3} r = 1
$$  
Solving for $ r $:  
$$
r = 3
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Setup**: The original equation $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 4\pi r^2$ is correctly derived from equating volume and surface area formulas.  
2. **Simplification Steps**:  
   - Dividing both sides by $4\pi$ yields $\frac{1}{3}r^3 = r^2$. This is valid as $4\pi \neq 0$.  
   - Dividing both sides by $r^2$ (assuming $r \neq 0$) results in $\frac{1}{3}r = 1$. This step is valid under the assumption $r \neq 0$.  
3. **Solving for $r$**: Solving $\frac{1}{3}r = 1$ gives $r = 3$.  
4. **Edge Case $r = 0$**: While $r = 0$ technically satisfies the equation $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 4\pi r^2$, a sphere with radius 0 is degenerate (a point), which is not physically meaningful. Thus, $r = 3$ is the valid solution.  
5. **Final Verification**: Substituting $r = 3$ into the original formulas:  
   - Volume: $\frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = 36\pi$  
   - Surface Area: $4\pi (3)^2 = 36\pi$  
   Both values are numerically equal, confirming correctness.  
All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
