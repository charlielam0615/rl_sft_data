Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that the decimal conversion of $\frac{3}{20}$ is correct by cross-checking the result through alternative methods and logical consistency.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Alternative method verification**:  
   - Convert $\frac{3}{20}$ to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100. Multiply numerator and denominator by 5:  
     $$
     \frac{3 \times 5}{20 \times 5} = \frac{15}{100} = 0.15
     $$  
     The result matches the initial calculation.  

2. **Long division cross-check**:  
   - Perform $3 \div 20$ manually:  
     - 20 fits into 30 once (1), remainder 10.  
     - Bring down a 0 to make 100. 20 fits into 100 five times (5), remainder 0.  
     - Result: $0.15$.  

3. **Fraction-to-decimal equivalence**:  
   - $\frac{3}{20}$ is equivalent to $3 \times \frac{1}{20}$. Since $\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$, multiplying by 3 gives $0.05 \times 3 = 0.15$.  

All methods consistently yield $0.15$. No errors detected.
