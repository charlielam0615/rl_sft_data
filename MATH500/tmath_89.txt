[IMP]
To find the GCD of 3339 and 2961 using the Euclidean algorithm, perform the following steps:  

1. Divide 3339 by 2961 and find the remainder:  
   $ 3339 = 2961 \times 1 + 378 $.  
2. Now apply the Euclidean algorithm to 2961 and 378:  
   $ 2961 = 378 \times 7 + 315 $.  
3. Apply the algorithm to 378 and 315:  
   $ 378 = 315 \times 1 + 63 $.  
4. Apply the algorithm to 315 and 63:  
   $ 315 = 63 \times 5 + 0 $.  

Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 63.  
Thus, the GCD of 3339 and 2961 is 63.
