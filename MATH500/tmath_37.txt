Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the angle between each vertex of the pentagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A regular pentagon has five equal sides and angles. To determine the angle of rotation required for it to coincide with its original position, we consider its rotational symmetry. The full circle around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since there are five identical positions (one for each vertex), the angle between each vertex is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by 5.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the minimum number of degrees needed to rotate the pentagon so that it coincides with its original position.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The angle between each vertex of the pentagon is 360 degrees divided by 5, which is 72 degrees. Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position is 72 degrees.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the calculated rotation angle for the regular pentagon's rotational symmetry.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The solution posits that the minimum rotation angle is 72°, derived from dividing 360° by 5 sides. To verify this, consider the following:

1. **Rotational symmetry definition**: A shape coincides with its original position when rotated by an angle equal to 360°/n, where n is the number of sides/vertices. For a pentagon, n=5, so 360°/5=72°. This aligns with standard geometric principles.

2. **Vertex alignment**: Each vertex of a regular pentagon is spaced 72° around the center. Rotating by 72° maps each vertex to the next vertex's position, ensuring full coincidence with the original shape.

3. **Smaller angles test**: A rotation angle smaller than 72° (e.g., 36°) would not align vertices. For example, rotating 36° would shift vertices by half the required spacing, leaving them misaligned. Since 36° is not a multiple of 72°, the pentagon cannot coincide with its original position until 72° is reached.

4. **Full-circle validation**: Five 72° rotations sum to 360°, confirming that the pentagon returns to its original orientation after five rotations. This ensures that 72° is the minimal angle for a single step of coincidence.

No contradictions or logical gaps are identified. The reasoning aligns with geometric principles and vertex spacing calculations. The conclusion is consistent and mathematically sound.
