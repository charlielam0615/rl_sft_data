Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the inverse proportionality relationship to find the number of customers for the $2500 television.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
According to the inverse proportionality relationship, we have:
Number of customers ‚àù 1 / Cost of television

Let's represent the number of customers as $ N $ and the cost of the television as $ C $. Then we can write the relationship as:
$$ N = k / C $$
Where $ k $ is the constant of proportionality.

From the given information, we know that when $ C = 1500 $, $ N = 15 $. We can use this to find the value of $ k $:
$$ 15 = k / 1500 $$
Solving for $ k $, we multiply both sides by 1500:
$$ k = 15 * 1500 = 22500 $$

Now, we can use this value of $ k $ to find the number of customers for the television that costs $2500:
$$ N = 22500 / 2500 = 9 $$

Therefore, according to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy a television that costs $2500.

[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem states inverse proportionality, which mathematically requires $ N \times C = k $. The initial equation $ N = k/C $ correctly models this relationship. This is valid.

2. **Constant Calculation**: Using $ 15 = k/1500 $, solving for $ k $ gives $ k = 15 \times 1500 = 22500 $. This step is correct because multiplying both sides by 1500 isolates $ k $.

3. **Final Calculation**: Substituting $ C = 2500 $ into $ N = 22500/2500 $ yields $ N = 9 $. The arithmetic is correct: $ 22500 \div 2500 = 9 $.

4. **Interpretation**: The conclusion that 9 customers would buy the $2500 TV aligns with the inverse proportionality principle. No logical errors in interpreting the result.

All steps are mathematically sound, and the answer is consistent with the problem's requirements. No discrepancies or errors detected.
