Goal of this step: Define the problem mathematically using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The future value of an ordinary annuity, where the payments are made at the end of each period, is given by the formula:

$$
FV = PMT \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right)
$$

Where:
- $FV$ is the future value.
- $PMT$ is the annual payment (in this case, \$20,000).
- $r$ is the annual interest rate.
- $n$ is the number of years (in this case, 3).

The worker wants the future value to be at least \$66,200 after 3 years. So, we can write:

$$
66,200 = 20,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \right)
$$

Our next step is to solve this equation for $r$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $66,200 = 20,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \right)$ for $r$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation:  
$$
66,200 = 20,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \right)
$$  
Dividing both sides by 20,000 gives:  
$$
3.31 = \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r}
$$  
Rewriting the equation:  
$$
3.31r = (1 + r)^3 - 1
$$  
$$
(1 + r)^3 = 3.31r + 1
$$  
This is a nonlinear equation in $r$, and solving it algebraically is complex. We will solve it numerically using trial and error or a root-finding method. We'll try a few values of $r$ to approximate the solution.  

Letâ€™s test $r = 0.10$:  
$$
(1 + 0.10)^3 = 1.331, \quad 3.31(0.10) + 1 = 1.331
$$  
Left-hand side equals right-hand side, so $r = 0.10$ is a solution.  

Thus, the minimal interest rate is $10\%$.  

We will now verify this result to ensure it satisfies the problem's requirement.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that the derived interest rate of 10% satisfies the problem's requirements and that no errors exist in the algebraic manipulation or interpretation of the annuity formula.

1. **Equation Setup Verification**:  
   The future value of an ordinary annuity formula is correctly applied. The formula accounts for annual deposits at the end of each year, which aligns with the problem's description. The equation $66,200 = 20,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r} \right)$ is valid for this scenario.  

2. **Algebraic Manipulation Check**:  
   Dividing both sides by 20,000 to get $3.31 = \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r}$ is correct. Rearranging to $3.31r = (1 + r)^3 - 1$ is also valid. The derived equation is a standard form for solving $r$ in annuity problems.  

3. **Numerical Solution Verification**:  
   Testing $r = 0.10$ (10%) yields:  
   - Left-hand side: $(1 + 0.10)^3 = 1.331$  
   - Right-hand side: $3.31(0.10) + 1 = 1.331$  
   Both sides match, confirming $r = 10\%$ satisfies the equation.  

4. **Minimality Check**:  
   The problem requires the *minimal* interest rate. Testing $r = 9\%$:  
   - $(1 + 0.09)^3 = 1.295029$  
   - $\frac{1.295029 - 1}{0.09} \approx 3.2781$  
   - Future value: $20,000 \times 3.2781 \approx \$65,562$, which is less than \$66,200.  
   Thus, $r = 10\%$ is indeed the minimal rate.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The solution correctly identifies the minimal rate, validates it algebraically and numerically, and confirms that no lower rate satisfies the requirement.
