Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given function is $ y = \frac{4x^3 + 2x - 4}{3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1} $.  

- The degree of the numerator $ 4x^3 + 2x - 4 $ is 3 because the highest power of $ x $ is $ x^3 $.  
- The degree of the denominator $ 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 $ is also 3 because the highest power of $ x $ is $ x^3 $.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the horizontal asymptote rule for rational functions where the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
When the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denominator.  

- The leading coefficient of the numerator $ 4x^3 $ is 4.  
- The leading coefficient of the denominator $ 3x^3 $ is 3.  

Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is given by:  
$$
y = \frac{4}{3}
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm correctness of horizontal asymptote calculation for rational function.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. The original function is $ y = \frac{4x^3 + 2x - 4}{3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1} $. Both numerator and denominator are degree 3 polynomials, as established in previous steps.

2. Horizontal asymptote rules for rational functions state:
   - If degree(numerator) < degree(denominator): y = 0
   - If degree(numerator) > degree(denominator): No horizontal asymptote
   - If degrees are equal: y = ratio of leading coefficients

3. Applying this to the given function:
   - Leading term of numerator: $ 4x^3 $ (coefficient 4)
   - Leading term of denominator: $ 3x^3 $ (coefficient 3)
   - Calculated asymptote: $ y = \frac{4}{3} $

4. Cross-checking with direct substitution for large x:
   - For very large x, lower-degree terms become negligible
   - $ y \approx \frac{4x^3}{3x^3} = \frac{4}{3} $
   - This confirms the asymptotic behavior approaches $ y = \frac{4}{3} $

5. No contradictions in the logic. The calculation follows standard procedures for horizontal asymptotes in rational functions.

Conclusion: The reasoning is consistent with mathematical principles for horizontal asymptotes. No errors detected in the calculation or application of rules.
