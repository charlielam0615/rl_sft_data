Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factor 242 into its prime factors.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factor 242 into its prime components, start by checking divisibility by the smallest primes:  

1. 242 is even, so it is divisible by 2:  
   $ 242 \div 2 = 121 $.  

2. Next, factor 121. Since 121 is not divisible by 2, check for divisibility by 3:  
   $ 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 $, and 4 is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.  

3. Check for divisibility by 5: 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.  

4. Try 11:  
   $ 121 \div 11 = 11 $.  

Thus, the prime factorization of 242 is:  
$ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify $\sqrt{242}$ using its prime factorization.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, the prime factorization of 242 is:  
$$ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 $$  

Now simplify the square root:  
$$ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} $$  

Group the perfect square:  
$$ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2} $$  

Since $\sqrt{11^2} = 11$, we get:  
$$ \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2} $$

[VERIFY]
1. **Prime Factorization Verification**:
   - 242 ÷ 2 = 121 → 2 is a prime factor.
   - 121 ÷ 11 = 11 → 11 is a prime factor.
   - 11 ÷ 11 = 1 → Confirms 11 is a prime factor.
   - Multiplying back: 2 × 11 × 11 = 242 → Valid.

2. **Square Root Simplification Verification**:
   - $\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}$ → Correct factorization.
   - $\sqrt{11^2} = 11$ → Valid property of square roots.
   - Final expression: $11\sqrt{2}$ → Proper grouping of perfect square.

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - Squaring the simplified form: $(11\sqrt{2})^2 = 121 \times 2 = 242$ → Matches original radicand.
   - No intermediate steps contradict mathematical rules.
   
4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - 2 is a prime number with no square factors >1, so $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be simplified further → Final form is fully simplified.
