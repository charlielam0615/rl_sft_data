[IMP]
To factor the polynomial $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4$, we can try to factor it as a quadratic in terms of $x^4$. Let's set $y = x^4$, so the polynomial becomes $y^2 + 3y - 4$.

Factoring this quadratic, we get $(y - 1)(y + 4)$. Substituting back $y = x^4$, we have $(x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4)$.

Now, we need to factor $x^4 - 1$ and $x^4 + 4$ further. $x^4 - 1$ is a difference of squares, so it factors as $(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)$. $x^2 - 1$ is also a difference of squares, so it factors as $(x - 1)(x + 1)$.

Therefore, the complete factorization of $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4$ is $(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 4)$.

1. **Factorization correctness**:  
   - The polynomial was factored as $(x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^4+4)$.  
   - $x^4 + 4$ is reducible over integers, as it factors into $(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$. This step was missed in the initial solution.  
   - The quadratic factors $x^2 + 2x + 2$ and $x^2 - 2x + 2$ are irreducible because their discriminants are $(-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = -4$ and $(-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = -4$, respectively, which are negative.  

2. **Evaluation at $x=1$**:  
   - The initial evaluation missed the additional factors. The correct evaluations are:  
     - $x-1 \rightarrow 0$  
     - $x+1 \rightarrow 2$  
     - $x^2 + 1 \rightarrow 2$  
     - $x^2 + 2x + 2 \rightarrow 5$

What to recall: The irreducibility of $x^4 + 4$ over integers and its correct factorization.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The polynomial $x^4 + 4$ is reducible over the integers. It can be factored using the identity for sum of squares:  
$$
x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).
$$  
Both $x^2 + 2x + 2$ and $x^2 - 2x + 2$ are irreducible over the integers because their discriminants are negative:  
$$
\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4.
$$  
This confirms that the factorization is complete and irreducible.
