From the diagram and previous step:

- Angle $CDA$ is trisected into three equal angles, each labeled $y$. So $CDA = 3y$.

Goal of this step: Use the sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral $ABCD$ to find the sum of angles $BAD$ and $CDA$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always $360^\circ$.  

Given:
- $\angle ABC = 110^\circ$
- $\angle BCD = 100^\circ$

Let $\angle BAD = 3x$ and $\angle CDA = 3y$.

So, the sum of the interior angles is:  
$$
\angle ABC + \angle BCD + \angle BAD + \angle CDA = 110^\circ + 100^\circ + 3x + 3y = 360^\circ
$$

Simplifying:
$$
210^\circ + 3x + 3y = 360^\circ
$$
$$
3x + 3y = 150^\circ
$$
$$
x + y = 50^\circ
$$

Goal of this step: Use the triangle angle sum property to find the measure of angle $AFD$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Angle $AFD$ is formed by the trisectors of angles $BAD$ and $CDA$, specifically the lines $AF$ and $DF$. From the diagram, angle $AFD$ lies at the intersection of the trisectors of $BAD$ and $CDA$, forming triangle $AFD$.  

In triangle $AFD$, the two known angles are $x$ (from trisection of $BAD$) and $y$ (from trisection of $CDA$). The third angle is angle $AFD$, which we are trying to find.  

Using the triangle angle sum property:  
$$
x + y + \angle AFD = 180^\circ
$$  

We know from earlier that:  
$$
x + y = 50^\circ
$$  

Substituting into the triangle sum equation:  
$$
50^\circ + \angle AFD = 180^\circ
$$  
$$
\angle AFD = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
$$

[REVIEW]
From the previous steps, we established that:  
- The sum of the angles in quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $360^\circ$.  
- The angles at $B$ and $C$ are $110^\circ$ and $100^\circ$, respectively.  
- The remaining angles, $\angle BAD = 3x$ and $\angle CDA = 3y$, sum to $150^\circ$, so $x + y = 50^\circ$.  
- Using the triangle angle sum in triangle $AFD$, we found that $\angle AFD = 180^\circ - (x + y) = 130^\circ$.  

This provides the foundation for calculating the final answer.

Self-Verification (Planning)
Scope of verification: All critical aspects of the solution including the derivation of x + y, application of triangle angle sum, and correct identification of angles in triangle AFD.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Quadrilateral angle sum**: The sum of interior angles in quadrilateral ABCD is correctly calculated as 360°. Given angles at B and C (110° and 100°), the remaining angles (3x + 3y) are correctly derived as 150°, leading to x + y = 50°. This step is mathematically valid.

2. **Triangle angle sum application**: The assumption that triangle AFD contains angles x and y is critical. The diagram shows AF and DF as trisectors of BAD and CDA, respectively. Since BAD is trisected into three equal angles (each x), and AF is one of these trisectors, the angle at A in triangle AFD is indeed x. Similarly, DF as a trisector of CDA implies the angle at D in triangle AFD is y. This step is geometrically valid.

3. **Final calculation**: Substituting x + y = 50° into the triangle angle sum (x + y + ∠AFD = 180°) yields ∠AFD = 130°. This algebra is correct and follows logically.

No errors identified in the reasoning. The solution is consistent with geometric principles and the problem's constraints.
