Goal of this step: Use the given condition to determine the product of the roots.

[IMP]
The sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. Let the roots be $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. Then we have:

$$
\log_2(r_1) + \log_2(r_2) + \log_2(r_3) = 5
$$

Using the logarithmic identity $\log_b(m) + \log_b(n) = \log_b(mn)$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\log_2(r_1r_2r_3) = 5
$$

This implies that the product of the roots $r_1r_2r_3$ is $2^5 = 32$.

For a cubic polynomial of the form $8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0$, let the roots be $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. By Vieta's formulas:  

1. The sum of the roots is given by:  
   $$
   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{\text{coefficient of } x^2}{\text{coefficient of } x^3} = -\frac{4a}{8} = -\frac{a}{2}
   $$

2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:  
   $$
   r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = \frac{\text{coefficient of } x}{\text{coefficient of } x^3} = \frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4}
   $$

3. The product of the roots is:  
   $$
   r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{\text{constant term}}{\text{coefficient of } x^3} = -\frac{a}{8}
   $$

From the previous step, we determined that $r_1r_2r_3 = 32$. Substituting into the formula for the product of the roots:  
$$
-\frac{a}{8} = 32
$$

Solving for $a$:  
$$
a = -8 \cdot 32 = -256
$$

1. Verify the logarithmic identity application:
   - Given log₂(r₁) + log₂(r₂) + log₂(r₃) = 5
   - Using log₂(r₁r₂r₃) = 5 is valid because log₂(r₁) + log₂(r₂) + log₂(r₃) = log₂(r₁r₂r₃) by the logarithmic product rule.
   - Therefore, r₁r₂r₃ = 2⁵ = 32 is correct.

2. Verify Vieta's formula application for the product of roots:
   - For cubic equation 8x³ + 4ax² + 2bx + a = 0, the product of roots r₁r₂r₃ = -constant term / leading coefficient = -a/8.
   - This matches standard Vieta's formula: for cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, product of roots is -d/a.
   - Here, the constant term is 'a' and leading coefficient is 8, so -a/8 is correct.

3. Verify the equation -a/8 = 32:
   - Solving for a: multiply both sides by 8: -a = 256 → a = -256.
   - This algebraic manipulation is correct.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected in reasoning or calculations.
