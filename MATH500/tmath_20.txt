Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The definition of complex number multiplication and arithmetic operations.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
In complex numbers, multiplication is performed distributively, and subtraction is done by subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if $ a + bi $ and $ c + di $ are complex numbers, then $ (a + bi) \cdot c = ac + bci $, and $ (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply $1 + 2i$ by 6.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To multiply $1 + 2i$ by 6, apply the distributive property:  
$$
(1 + 2i) \cdot 6 = 1 \cdot 6 + 2i \cdot 6 = 6 + 12i.
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Subtract $3i$ from $6 + 12i$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To subtract $3i$ from $6 + 12i$, we subtract the imaginary parts and keep the real part unchanged:  
$$
(6 + 12i) - 3i = 6 + (12i - 3i) = 6 + 9i.
$$

[REVIEW]
I am currently at the final stage of simplifying the expression $(1 + 2i) \cdot 6 - 3i$. I have completed both subgoals: multiplying $1 + 2i$ by 6 and subtracting $3i$ from the result.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the entire solution process for $(1 + 2i) \cdot 6 - 3i$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Multiplication step verification**:  
   - Original term: $(1 + 2i) \cdot 6$.  
   - Distributive property application: $1 \cdot 6 + 2i \cdot 6 = 6 + 12i$.  
   - This is mathematically valid, as scalar multiplication distributes over addition in complex numbers.  
   - Verified: Correct.

2. **Subtraction step verification**:  
   - Intermediate result: $6 + 12i$.  
   - Subtraction operation: $6 + 12i - 3i$.  
   - Imaginary part computation: $12i - 3i = 9i$.  
   - Real part remains unchanged: $6$.  
   - Verified: Correct.

3. **Final result consistency**:  
   - Final expression: $6 + 9i$.  
   - No logical inconsistencies or arithmetic errors detected in the derivation chain.  
   - Verified: Correct.

4. **Alternative verification via algebra**:  
   - Rewrite the original expression as $(1 + 2i) \cdot 6 + (-3i)$.  
   - Compute $(1 + 2i) \cdot 6 = 6 + 12i$.  
   - Add $-3i$ to $6 + 12i$: $6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + 9i$.  
   - Matches the result.  
   - Verified: Correct.

5. **Edge case check**:  
   - If $i = \sqrt{-1}$, does the arithmetic hold?  
   - The operations involve only real coefficients and standard complex arithmetic rules, which are preserved.  
   - Verified: Correct.

Conclusion: No errors detected in the reasoning or calculations.
