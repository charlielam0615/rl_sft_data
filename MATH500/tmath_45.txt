Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute $\sin A = 2\cos A$ into the identity $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given $\sin A = 2\cos A$. Substitute this into the Pythagorean identity:  

$$
\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1
$$
$$
(2\cos A)^2 + \cos^2 A = 1
$$
$$
4\cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1
$$
$$
5\cos^2 A = 1
$$
$$
\cos^2 A = \frac{1}{5}
$$
$$
\cos A = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
$$

Since angle $A$ is an acute angle in a right triangle, $\cos A > 0$, so $\cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$.  
Now, use $\sin A = 2\cos A$:  

$$
\sin A = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}
$$

Now calculate $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$:  

$$
\tan A = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}} = 2
$$

1. **Identity Substitution Check**:  
   The Pythagorean identity $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$ was correctly substituted with $\sin A = 2\cos A$, leading to:  
   $$
   (2\cos A)^2 + \cos^2 A = 1 \implies 4\cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 5\cos^2 A = 1
   $$  
   This algebraic manipulation is valid and correctly simplifies to $\cos^2 A = \frac{1}{5}$.  

2. **Sign Determination for $\cos A$**:  
   Since angle $A$ is acute ($0^\circ < A < 90^\circ$), $\cos A$ must be positive. The conclusion $\cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ is correct.  

3. **Derivation of $\sin A$**:  
   Using $\sin A = 2\cos A$, the substitution $\sin A = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$ is accurate.  

4. **Calculation of $\tan A$**:  
   The definition $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$ was applied correctly:  
   $$
   \tan A = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}} = 2
   $$  
   This simplification is mathematically valid.  

5. **Triangle Consistency Check**:  
   If the adjacent side is $1$ (from $\cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$) and the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{5}$, then the opposite side must be $2$ (from $\sin A = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$). By the Pythagorean theorem:  
   $$
   1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 = (\sqrt{5})^2
   $$  
   This confirms the triangle is valid.  

**Conclusion**: All steps are logically consistent, algebraically correct, and geometrically valid. No errors detected.
