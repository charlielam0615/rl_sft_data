Goal of this step: Multiply the two polynomials $ (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) $ to obtain the expanded form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To expand $ (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) $, use the distributive property:  
$$
(3t^2)(4t^2) + (3t^2)(bt) + (3t^2)(-2) + (5t)(4t^2) + (5t)(bt) + (5t)(-2) + (a)(4t^2) + (a)(bt) + (a)(-2)
$$

Now compute each term:  
1. $ (3t^2)(4t^2) = 12t^4 $  
2. $ (3t^2)(bt) = 3b t^3 $  
3. $ (3t^2)(-2) = -6t^2 $  
4. $ (5t)(4t^2) = 20t^3 $  
5. $ (5t)(bt) = 5b t^2 $  
6. $ (5t)(-2) = -10t $  
7. $ (a)(4t^2) = 4a t^2 $  
8. $ (a)(bt) = ab t $  
9. $ (a)(-2) = -2a $

Grouping like terms:  
- $ t^4 $: $ 12t^4 $  
- $ t^3 $: $ 3b t^3 + 20t^3 = (3b + 20)t^3 $  
- $ t^2 $: $ -6t^2 + 5b t^2 + 4a t^2 = (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 $  
- $ t $: $ -10t + ab t = (-10 + ab)t $  
- Constant: $ -2a $

Thus, the expanded polynomial is:  
$$
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Compare the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial $12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6$ to form equations for $a$ and $b$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, the expanded polynomial is:  
$$
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
$$  
The given polynomial is:  
$$
12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
$$  
Now, equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms:  

1. Coefficient of $t^3$: $3b + 20 = 26$  
2. Coefficient of $t^2$: $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$  
3. Coefficient of $t$: $-10 + ab = -16$  
4. Constant term: $-2a = 6$  

We will now solve this system of equations to find $a$ and $b$.

Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $a$ and $b$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The system of equations is:  
1. $3b + 20 = 26$  
2. $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$  
3. $-10 + ab = -16$  
4. $-2a = 6$  

Start with equation (4):  
$$
-2a = 6 \Rightarrow a = -3
$$  

Substitute $a = -3$ into equation (2):  
$$
-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8 \Rightarrow -6 + 5b - 12 = -8 \Rightarrow 5b - 18 = -8 \Rightarrow 5b = 10 \Rightarrow b = 2
$$  

Verify this solution with equations (1) and (3):  

Equation (1):  
$$
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26 \Rightarrow \text{Correct}
$$  

Equation (3):  
$$
-10 + ab = -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16 \Rightarrow \text{Correct}
$$  

Thus, $a = -3$ and $b = 2$.

1. **Polynomial Expansion**:  
   - The expanded polynomial was derived correctly by distributing each term. The coefficients for $t^4$, $t^3$, $t^2$, $t$, and the constant term align with standard multiplication rules.  
   - Example: $ (3t^2)(bt) = 3b t^3 $, and grouping terms like $3b t^3 + 20t^3$ is valid.  

2. **Equation Formation**:  
   - Equating coefficients of corresponding terms between the expanded and given polynomials is mathematically sound.  
   - For example, $3b + 20 = 26$ directly derives from matching $t^3$ coefficients.  

3. **Solving for $a$ and $b$**:  
   - Equation (4): $-2a = 6 \Rightarrow a = -3$ is correct.  
   - Substituting $a = -3$ into equation (2):  
     $-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8 \Rightarrow 5b = 10 \Rightarrow b = 2$ is valid.  
   - Verification of equations (1) and (3) confirms consistency:  
     - Equation (1): $3(2) + 20 = 26$ ✔️  
     - Equation (3): $-10 + (-3)(2) = -16$ ✔️  

4. **Final Calculation**:  
   - $a + b = -3 + 2 = -1$ is arithmetic correct.  

All steps are logically consistent, and no errors are detected in the solution process.
