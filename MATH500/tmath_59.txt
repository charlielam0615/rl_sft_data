Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of students who participate in at least one of the clubs.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the number of students who participate in at least one of the clubs, we subtract the number of students who participate in neither from the total number of students in the class.

Number of students who participate in at least one of the clubs = Total number of students - Number of students who participate in neither
Number of students who participate in at least one of the clubs = 50 - 6 = 44.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of students who participate in at least one of the clubs is equal to the sum of the number of students in each club minus the number of students who participate in both.  

Let $ B $ represent the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club. Then:  
$$
\text{Students in at least one club} = \text{MATHCOUNTS participants} + \text{Science club participants} - B
$$  
$$
44 = 28 + 21 - B
$$  
$$
44 = 49 - B
$$  
Solving for $ B $:  
$$
B = 49 - 44 = 5
$$  

Therefore, 5 students participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club.

1. Re-evaluate the problem from the final conclusion to ensure the logic is consistent and correct.  
   1.1 Verify that the calculated overlap satisfies the constraints of the problem.  
   1.2 Check the arithmetic used in calculating the number of students in both clubs.
[/PLANNING]

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the inclusion-exclusion calculation and arithmetic reasoning for the overlapping student counts.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Total students in at least one club**: 50 total students - 6 neither = 44 students. This calculation is correct (50-6=44).

2. **Inclusion-exclusion formula**: 
   $$
   \text{MATHCOUNTS} + \text{Science} - \text{Both} = 44
   $$
   Substituting values:
   $$
   28 + 21 - B = 44 \implies 49 - B = 44 \implies B = 5
   $$
   The algebraic manipulation is valid and error-free.

3. **Cross-verification**:
   - Only MATHCOUNTS: 28 - 5 = 23 students
   - Only Science: 21 - 5 = 16 students
   - Both: 5 students
   - Neither: 6 students
   - Total: 23 + 16 + 5 + 6 = 50 students (matches the total class size)
   This confirms consistency.

4. **Formula validation**: The inclusion-exclusion principle is correctly applied, as $ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ aligns with the problem's constraints.

All calculations and logical steps are correct and consistent. No errors detected.
