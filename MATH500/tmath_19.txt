Solve the quadratic equation $ 3x^2 + 2ax + a = 0 $ using the quadratic formula:  
$$ x = \frac{-2a \pm \sqrt{(2a)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot a}}{2 \cdot 3} $$  
$$ x = \frac{-2a \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 12a}}{6} $$

Goal of this step: Determine the conditions under which the polynomial $ f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 $ has three real roots by analyzing the critical points and function behavior.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
For the polynomial $ f(x) $ to have three real roots, it must have two real critical points (local maximum and minimum), and the function values at these critical points must have opposite signs.  
This ensures the function crosses the x-axis three times.  
Let the critical points be $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $:  
$$ x_1 = \frac{-a + \sqrt{a(a - 3)}}{3} $$  
$$ x_2 = \frac{-a - \sqrt{a(a - 3)}}{3} $$  
Now evaluate $ f(x_1) $ and $ f(x_2) $ and ensure $ f(x_1) \cdot f(x_2) < 0 $.  
This inequality guarantees three real roots.

1. **Derivative Calculation**: The derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 2ax + a is correct. This confirms the first step is valid.

2. **Critical Points Existence**: The discriminant of the derivative is 4a² - 12a = 4a(a - 3). For real critical points, this discriminant must be ≥ 0. Since a > 0 (given), this implies a ≥ 3. However, the user's current reasoning assumes two distinct critical points (a > 3) to apply the f(x₁)·f(x₂) < 0 condition. When a = 3, the derivative has a repeated root (discriminant = 0), leading to a single critical point. At a = 3, the cubic becomes (x + 1)³ = 0, which has a triple real root. This case is valid but unaccounted for in the current plan. The user needs to separately verify that a = 3 satisfies the problem's conditions.

3. **Function Value Sign Condition**: For a > 3, the critical points x₁ and x₂ are distinct. Evaluating f(x₁) and f(x₂) and ensuring their product is negative is correct for guaranteeing three real roots. However, this step assumes a > 3, which may not include the minimal a = 3. The user must reconcile this with the triple-root case.

4. **Conclusion**: The current plan is missing the a = 3 case, which is valid and yields the minimal a. The verification reveals an incomplete consideration of edge cases. The approach is partially correct but requires adjustment to include a = 3.

Substitute $ a = 3 $ into the polynomial:  
$$ f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 $$  
This can be rewritten as:  
$$ f(x) = (x + 1)^3 $$  
This polynomial has a triple root at $ x = -1 $. Since all roots are real (even though they are not distinct), the condition is satisfied.

Scope of this verification: Confirm that a = 3 is the minimal value satisfying the problem's conditions by analyzing the derivative's discriminant and the polynomial's behavior for a < 3.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Derivative Discriminant Analysis**:  
   The discriminant of the derivative $ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + a $ is $ \Delta = 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3) $. For $ a < 3 $, $ \Delta < 0 $, meaning $ f'(x) $ has no real roots. Since $ f'(x) $ is a quadratic opening upwards (coefficient 3 > 0), it is always positive for $ a < 3 $. This implies $ f(x) $ is strictly increasing for $ a < 3 $.  

2. **Behavior of $ f(x) $ for $ a < 3 $**:  
   A strictly increasing cubic polynomial $ f(x) $ will cross the x-axis exactly once, yielding only one real root (and two complex conjugate roots). This violates the problem's requirement of all roots being real.  

3. **Critical Threshold at $ a = 3 $**:  
   At $ a = 3 $, $ f(x) = (x+1)^3 $, which has a triple real root at $ x = -1 $. This satisfies the condition of all roots being real.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The analysis confirms that $ a = 3 $ is the minimal value where the polynomial transitions from having one real root (for $ a < 3 $) to having all real roots (triple root at $ a = 3 $). No smaller $ a $ satisfies the problem's constraints.
