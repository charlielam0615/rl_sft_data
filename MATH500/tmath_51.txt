[IMP]
We can use synthetic division to divide $x^6 - 3$ by $x + 1$. The synthetic division process is as follows:

1. Write the coefficients of the dividend $x^6 - 3$ in descending order of powers of $x$. The coefficients are [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3].
2. Write the opposite of the constant term of the divisor $x + 1$ to the left of the coefficients. The opposite of 1 is -1.
3. Bring down the first coefficient (1) to the bottom row.
4. Multiply the number on the bottom row by the number on the left (-1) and write the result under the next coefficient.
5. Add the numbers in the second column and write the result in the bottom row.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all columns are processed.

The synthetic division process is as follows:

```
-1 |  1  0  0  0  0  0  -3
    |     -1  1  -1  1  -1  1
    ------------------------
      1 -1  1  -1  1  -1  -2
```

The numbers in the bottom row represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, which is $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$, and the last number (-2) is the remainder.

Therefore, the quotient when $x^6 - 3$ is divided by $x + 1$ is $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Validate the synthetic division process, quotient polynomial, remainder, and confirm consistency using alternative methods (Remainder Theorem and polynomial multiplication).
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Remainder Theorem Check**:  
   By the Remainder Theorem, plugging $x = -1$ into the dividend $x^6 - 3$ should yield the remainder:  
   $(-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2$.  
   This matches the synthetic division remainder of $-2$.  

2. **Polynomial Multiplication Check**:  
   The identity $(x + 1) \cdot \text{quotient} + \text{remainder} = x^6 - 3$ must hold.  
   - Quotient: $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$  
   - Compute $(x + 1) \cdot \text{quotient}$:  
     $$
     x \cdot \text{quotient} = x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x \\
     1 \cdot \text{quotient} = x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1
     $$  
     Adding these:  
     $$
     x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 = x^6 - 1
     $$  
     Add remainder $-2$: $x^6 - 1 - 2 = x^6 - 3$, matching the original dividend.  

3. **Coefficient Pattern Consistency**:  
   The synthetic division coefficients $[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -2]$ produce the alternating sign pattern in the quotient polynomial $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$, which aligns with the alternating multiplication by $-1$ during synthetic division.  

All checks confirm correctness: remainder matches via two methods, polynomial multiplication reconstructs the dividend, and coefficient logic is consistent. No discrepancies detected.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the quotient and remainder by cross-checking with the Remainder Theorem and polynomial multiplication.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Remainder Theorem Check**:  
   The divisor is $x + 1$, so the root is $x = -1$. Substituting $x = -1$ into the dividend $x^6 - 3$ gives:  
   $$
   (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2.
   $$  
   This matches the remainder $-2$ obtained from synthetic division.  

2. **Polynomial Multiplication Check**:  
   The quotient is $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$. Multiplying the divisor $(x + 1)$ by the quotient:  
   $$
   (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1).
   $$  
   Expanding step-by-step:  
   - Distribute $x$:  
     $x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x$.  
   - Distribute $1$:  
     $x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$.  
   Combine terms:  
   $$
   x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1.
   $$  
   Simplify:  
   $x^6 - 1$.  
   Add the remainder $-2$:  
   $x^6 - 1 - 2 = x^6 - 3$, which matches the original dividend.  

3. **Coefficient Pattern Consistency**:  
   The synthetic division process used the root $-1$. Each step involved multiplying by $-1$ and adding to the next coefficient, resulting in alternating signs in the quotient polynomial. This pattern is consistent with the steps of synthetic division for a root at $x = -1$.  

No discrepancies were found in the calculations or reasoning. The solution aligns with mathematical principles and verification methods.
