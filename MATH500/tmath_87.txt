Goal of this step: Break the absolute value equation into two separate linear equations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The absolute value equation $|5x-1| = x+3$ can be broken into two cases based on the definition of the absolute value:

Case 1: $5x - 1 = x + 3$ (when $5x - 1 \geq 0$)
Case 2: $-(5x - 1) = x + 3$ (when $5x - 1 < 0$)

Now, we will solve each linear equation in the next step.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve Case 1: $5x - 1 = x + 3$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the equation:  
$$
5x - 1 = x + 3
$$  
Subtract $x$ from both sides:  
$$
4x - 1 = 3
$$  
Add 1 to both sides:  
$$
4x = 4
$$  
Divide both sides by 4:  
$$
x = 1
$$  
Thus, the solution to Case 1 is $x = 1$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve Case 2: $-(5x - 1) = x + 3$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Starting with the equation:  
$$
-(5x - 1) = x + 3
$$  
Distribute the negative sign:  
$$
-5x + 1 = x + 3
$$  
Subtract $x$ from both sides:  
$$
-6x + 1 = 3
$$  
Subtract 1 from both sides:  
$$
-6x = 2
$$  
Divide both sides by $-6$:  
$$
x = -\frac{1}{3}
$$  
Thus, the solution to Case 2 is $x = -\frac{1}{3}$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Verify the solutions $x = 1$ and $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ in the original equation $|5x - 1| = x + 3$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
**Verification for $x = 1$:**  
Left-hand side: $|5(1) - 1| = |5 - 1| = |4| = 4$.  
Right-hand side: $1 + 3 = 4$.  
Since both sides are equal, $x = 1$ is a valid solution.  

**Verification for $x = -\frac{1}{3}$:**  
Left-hand side: $|5(-\frac{1}{3}) - 1| = |-\frac{5}{3} - 1| = |-\frac{8}{3}| = \frac{8}{3}$.  
Right-hand side: $-\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{8}{3}$.  
Since both sides are equal, $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ is also a valid solution.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the largest value among the valid solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The two valid solutions are $x = 1$ and $x = -\frac{1}{3}$. Comparing these values, the largest solution is $x = 1$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All steps in solving the absolute value equation, including case breakdown, solving linear equations, solution verification, and comparison of solutions.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Case breakdown verification**:  
   - The absolute value equation $|5x-1| = x+3$ was split into two cases based on the definition of absolute value.  
   - Case 1 ($5x-1 = x+3$) assumes $5x-1 \geq 0$, which is valid because the absolute value expression $|A|$ equals $A$ when $A \geq 0$.  
   - Case 2 ($-(5x-1) = x+3$) assumes $5x-1 < 0$, which is valid because $|A| = -A$ when $A < 0$.  
   - Both cases are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, covering all possible values of $x$.  

2. **Solving linear equations**:  
   - **Case 1**:  
     $$
     5x - 1 = x + 3 \implies 4x = 4 \implies x = 1.
     $$  
     This is algebraically correct.  
   - **Case 2**:  
     $$
     -5x + 1 = x + 3 \implies -6x = 2 \implies x = -\frac{1}{3}.
     $$  
     This is algebraically correct.  

3. **Verification of solutions**:  
   - For $x = 1$:  
     - Left-hand side: $|5(1) - 1| = |4| = 4$.  
     - Right-hand side: $1 + 3 = 4$.  
     - Equality holds.  
     - Additionally, $5x - 1 = 4 \geq 0$, satisfying the condition for Case 1.  
   - For $x = -\frac{1}{3}$:  
     - Left-hand side: $|5(-\frac{1}{3}) - 1| = |-\frac{8}{3}| = \frac{8}{3}$.  
     - Right-hand side: $-\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{8}{3}$.  
     - Equality holds.  
     - Additionally, $5x - 1 = -\frac{8}{3} < 0$, satisfying the condition for Case 2.  

4. **Comparison of solutions**:  
   - $x = 1$ and $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ are both valid solutions.  
   - Comparing their numerical values, $1 > -\frac{1}{3}$, so $x = 1$ is the largest solution.  

No errors or inconsistencies were found in the reasoning or calculations. The solution is complete and correct.
