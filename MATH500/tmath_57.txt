Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the complex number expression $(1 - i)^8$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To simplify $(1 - i)^8$, we can utilize the polar form of complex numbers. First, we convert $1 - i$ into polar form:
1. Calculate the magnitude (or modulus) of $1 - i$:
$$
|1 - i| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}.
$$
2. Determine the argument (or angle) of $1 - i$. The complex number $1 - i$ lies in the fourth quadrant, and its angle $\theta$ is:
$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-1}{1}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{4}.
$$
Thus, in polar form, $1 - i$ can be written as:
$$
\sqrt{2} \left(\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right).
$$
Now, to raise this to the 8th power, we use De Moivre's Theorem:
$$
(1 - i)^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8 \left(\cos\left(8 \cdot -\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(8 \cdot -\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right).
$$
Simplify the magnitude and the angle:
$$
(\sqrt{2})^8 = (2)^4 = 16.
$$
$$
8 \cdot -\frac{\pi}{4} = -2\pi.
$$
Using periodicity of cosine and sine ($\cos(-2\pi) = \cos(0)$, $\sin(-2\pi) = \sin(0)$):
$$
(1 - i)^8 = 16 (\cos(0) + i \sin(0)) = 16 (1 + 0i) = 16.
$$

Goal of this step: Calculate the magnitude of the simplified result $16$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The simplified result of $(1 - i)^8$ is $16$, which is a real number. The magnitude of a real number is simply its absolute value. Since $16$ is positive, its magnitude is:  
$$
|16| = 16.

[VERIFY]
1. **Magnitude calculation verification**: 
   - The magnitude of $1 - i$ was correctly calculated as $\sqrt{2}$. 
   - $(\sqrt{2})^8 = 16$ is mathematically valid since $(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$, and $2^4 = 16$.

2. **Angle calculation verification**:
   - The argument $-\frac{\pi}{4}$ is correct for $1 - i$ in the fourth quadrant.
   - Multiplying by 8 gives $-2\pi$, which is equivalent to $0$ radians due to periodicity. This leads to $\cos(0) = 1$ and $\sin(0) = 0$, correctly simplifying the expression to $16$.

3. **Final magnitude verification**:
   - The result $16$ is a real number, so its magnitude is indeed $16$.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected in reasoning or calculations.
