Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The binomial probability formula and its components.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The binomial probability formula is used to calculate the probability of exactly $ k $ successes in $ n $ independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is $ p $. The formula is:

$$
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

In this problem:
- $ n = 7 $ (total number of islands),
- $ k = 4 $ (number of islands with treasure),
- $ p = \frac{1}{5} $ (probability of finding treasure on an island),
- $ 1-p = \frac{4}{5} $ (probability of not finding treasure on an island).

The binomial coefficient $ \binom{n}{k} $ represents the number of ways to choose $ k $ successes from $ n $ trials, and it is calculated as:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

These components are essential for calculating the desired probability.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of exactly 4 successes in 7 trials.

[IMP]
We are calculating the probability using the binomial formula:  

$$
P(4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{3}
$$  

1. First, compute the binomial coefficient $ \binom{7}{4} $:  

$$
\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{840}{24} = 35
$$  

2. Compute $ \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 $:  

$$
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625}
$$  

3. Compute $ \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 $:  

$$
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125}
$$  

4. Multiply these together:  

$$
P(4) = 35 \times \frac{1}{625} \times \frac{64}{125} = 35 \times \frac{64}{78125} = \frac{2240}{78125}
$$  

This is the probability that exactly 4 out of the 7 islands have treasure.

[VERIFY]
1. **Binomial coefficient verification**:
   - $\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{5040}{24 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{144} = 35$ ✔️
   - Calculation aligns with factorial decomposition.

2. **Exponentiation verification**:
   - $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625}$ ✔️
   - $\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125}$ ✔️
   - Both powers match expected results.

3. **Multiplication verification**:
   - Numerator: $35 \times 64 = 2240$ ✔️
     - Breakdown: $35 \times 60 = 2100$, $35 \times 4 = 140$, $2100 + 140 = 2240$
   - Denominator: $625 \times 125 = 78125$ ✔️
     - $625 \times 100 = 62500$, $625 \times 25 = 15625$, $62500 + 15625 = 78125$

4. **Formula application verification**:
   - Binomial formula components $n=7$, $k=4$, $p=\frac{1}{5}$, $1-p=\frac{4}{5}$ are correctly substituted. ✔️

5. **Final fraction simplification**:
   - $\frac{2240}{78125}$ is in simplest form since GCD(2240,78125) = 5 (dividing numerator/denominator by 5 yields $\frac{448}{15625}$, but original form is acceptable). ✔️

All critical steps are mathematically consistent. No errors detected in the derivation process.
