Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify how parentheses can alter the order of operations in the expression $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Parentheses can override the default left-to-right evaluation by grouping certain terms together. In this expression, the subtraction operator (-) and addition (+) are at the same precedence level, so they are evaluated left-to-right by default. However, adding parentheses can change the order of subtraction and addition.  

For example:  
- $1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6 = 3$  
- $(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = (7) + 6 = 13$  

The key is to explore all valid groupings that maintain the original order of operations and do not introduce multiplication or rearrangement.

Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Identify all valid parenthetical groupings of the expression $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$.  
2. For each grouping, evaluate the resulting value of the expression.  
3. Compare the values to determine the minimum possible value.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify all valid parenthetical groupings of the expression $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To generate all valid parenthetical groupings, we must consider all the ways to insert parentheses into the expression without changing the order of the operands or the operators. The expression has 6 numbers and 5 operators (4 '+' and 1 '-'), so there are many valid groupings to consider.  

For example, some valid groupings include:  
- $(1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6)$  
- $1 + (2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6$  
- $1 + 2 + (3 - (4 + 5)) + 6$  
- $1 + 2 + 3 - ((4 + 5) + 6)$  

The goal is to systematically explore all such groupings and calculate the resulting values.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The original expression and its constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The original expression is $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$, and we are allowed to add parentheses (but not rearrange terms or operators) to change the value. The goal is to find the minimum possible value obtainable through such groupings.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: Valid ways parentheses can be added to the expression.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Parentheses can be added to any subexpression of the original $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$ as long as the order of the numbers and operators is preserved. For example, grouping $1 + (2 + 3)$ is valid, but rearranging to $(1 + 3) + 2$ is not. Valid groupings must ensure that the parentheses form a syntactically correct mathematical expression.

Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Identify the minimum possible value by testing combinations that prioritize reducing the total sum.  
2. Focus on groupings that isolate the negative term ($-4$) and combine it with the largest possible positive values.  
3. Evaluate the most promising groupings to identify the minimum value.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify groupings that prioritize reducing the total sum by isolating $-4$ and combining it with the largest positive values.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To reduce the total sum, the strategy is to maximize the negative impact of $-4$. This can be achieved by grouping $-4$ with the largest possible positive terms. For example:  

1. Group $-4$ with $5$ and $6$:  
   $1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9$.  

2. Group $-4$ with $5$:  
   $1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3$.  

3. Group $-4$ with $6$:  
   $1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + (5 - 6) = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1$.  

4. Group $-4$ with $3$:  
   $1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6 = 13$.  

The most promising grouping in the above examples is the first one, which yields $-9$. This seems like a strong candidate for the minimum value.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the validity of the grouping $1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = -9$ and whether it represents the minimum possible value.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Calculation Verification**:  
   - Parentheses grouping: $4 + 5 + 6 = 15$.  
   - Remaining terms: $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.  
   - Final computation: $6 - 15 = -9$. The arithmetic is correct.  

2. **Optimality Verification**:  
   - To minimize the total, the largest possible value must be subtracted. The grouping $-(4 + 5 + 6)$ achieves this by subtracting the maximum sum (15) from the remaining terms.  
   - Alternative groupings (e.g., $-(4 + 5)$, $-(4 + 6)$, etc.) subtract smaller values (9 or 10), resulting in higher totals (e.g., $6 - 9 + 6 = 3$, $6 - 10 + 5 = 1$).  
   - No other grouping can subtract a larger value than 15 while preserving the original operator order.  

3. **Constraint Compliance**:  
   - The grouping $1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)$ does not reorder operands or operators. It is syntactically valid.  

**Conclusion**: The grouping is valid, the calculation is correct, and no further reduction is possible under the problem constraints.
