Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the angle in the range $[- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. However, the range of the arcsin function is $[- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, which corresponds to angles in the fourth and first quadrants. Since we are looking for an angle in this range whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$, we need to find an angle in the fourth quadrant.

The reference angle for $\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{\pi}{6}$, as $\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}$. In the fourth quadrant, the sine of an angle is negative, so the angle we are looking for is $-\frac{\pi}{6}$, because $\sin(-\frac{\pi}{6}) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the angle in the range $[- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-\frac{\pi}{6}$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of the angle $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ as the solution to $\arcsin\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Check sine value**: $\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}$, which matches the input argument.  
2. **Range validation**: The range of $\arcsin$ is $\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$. Since $-\frac{\pi}{6} \approx -0.523$ radians and $-\frac{\pi}{2} \approx -1.571$ radians, $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ lies within the valid range.  
3. **Uniqueness**: The sine function is injective (one-to-one) within $\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$. No other angle in this interval satisfies $\sin(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}$ because the reference angle $\frac{\pi}{6}$ corresponds to $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ in this range.  
4. **Quadrant consistency**: The angle $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ corresponds to the fourth quadrant (as negative angles go clockwise), where sine values are negative, aligning with the input $-\frac{1}{2}$.  
All checks confirm the result is valid and unambiguous.
