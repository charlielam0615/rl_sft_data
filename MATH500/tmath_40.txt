2. Use the perimeter of the hexagon to determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.
3. Calculate the length of each side of the octagon using its perimeter.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides. If one side is 16 cm long, then the perimeter is:
$$ \text{Perimeter} = 6 \times 16 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the perimeter of the hexagon to determine the perimeter of the octagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the regular hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also:
$$ \text{Perimeter} = 6 \times 16 = 96 \text{ cm} $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the length of each side of the octagon using its perimeter.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A regular octagon has 8 equal sides. If the perimeter of the octagon is 96 cm, then the length of each side is:  
$$ \text{Side length} = \frac{96}{8} $$  
$$ \text{Side length} = 12 \text{ cm} $$

[VERIFY]
1. **Hexagon perimeter calculation**:  
   A regular hexagon has 6 sides of 16 cm each.  
   $ 6 \times 16 = 96 $ cm.  
   This is correct because perimeter = number of sides Ã— side length.

2. **Octagon perimeter equivalence**:  
   The octagon shares the same perimeter as the hexagon, so its perimeter is also 96 cm.  
   This aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Octagon side length calculation**:  
   A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.  
   $ \frac{96}{8} = 12 $ cm.  
   This is mathematically valid.  

All steps are logically consistent and free of arithmetic errors. The answer is verified to be correct.
