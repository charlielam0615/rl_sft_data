Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total revenue from the cookies.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The math club sells cookies at a rate of three for \$1. To calculate the total revenue from cookies:  

$$
\text{Total cookies sold} = 54  
$$
$$
\text{Revenue per 3 cookies} = \$1  
$$
$$
\text{Number of cookie groups of 3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18  
$$
$$
\text{Revenue from cookies} = 18 \times 1 = \$18  
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total revenue from the cupcakes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The math club sells cupcakes at \$2 each. To calculate the total revenue from cupcakes:  

$$
\text{Total cupcakes sold} = 20  
$$
$$
\text{Price per cupcake} = \$2  
$$
$$
\text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 20 \times 2 = \$40  
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the total revenue from the brownies.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The math club sells brownies at \$1 each. To calculate the total revenue from brownies:  

$$
\text{Total brownies sold} = 35  
$$
$$
\text{Price per brownie} = \$1  
$$
$$
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 35 \times 1 = \$35  
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Add the revenues from all items to find the total revenue.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total revenue is calculated by summing the revenues from cookies, cupcakes, and brownies:  

$$
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from cookies} + \text{Revenue from cupcakes} + \text{Revenue from brownies}  
$$
$$
\text{Total Revenue} = 18 + 40 + 35 = \$93  
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to calculate the profit.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total cost to bake the items is \$15. The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:  

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}  
$$
$$
\text{Profit} = 93 - 15 = \$78  
$$

[VERIFY]
1. Cookie revenue calculation:  
   54 cookies ÷ 3 = 18 groups. 18 × \$1 = \$18. Correct.  
2. Cupcake revenue calculation:  
   20 cupcakes × \$2 = \$40. Correct.  
3. Brownie revenue calculation:  
   35 brownies × \$1 = \$35. Correct.  
4. Total revenue: \$18 + \$40 + \$35 = \$93. Correct.  
5. Profit: \$93 - \$15 = \$78. Correct.  
All arithmetic steps are accurate and logically consistent. No errors detected.
