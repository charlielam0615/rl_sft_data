The set of all odd numbers greater than zero is an infinite set that includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and so on. For the purposes of this problem, we only need to focus on the odd numbers that are also prime numbers and less than 30.

Goal of this step: Determine the intersection of the two sets.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To determine the intersection, I will compare the set of prime numbers less than 30 with the set of odd numbers greater than zero. The prime numbers less than 30 are:  

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.  

The odd numbers greater than zero are:  
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, ...  

The intersection of these two sets includes all numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of prime numbers, the only even prime number is 2, and all other primes are odd. Therefore, all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd and will appear in the intersection.  

The intersection is:  
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.

[IMP]
The intersection of the two sets is: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.  

To count the number of elements, I will simply count them one by one:  
1. 3  
2. 5  
3. 7  
4. 11  
5. 13  
6. 17  
7. 19  
8. 23  
9. 29  

There are 9 elements in the intersection.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the intersection calculation and element counting.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Prime numbers less than 30: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} (10 elements). This list is accurate as all numbers meet the prime definition (divisible only by 1 and themselves).

2. Odd numbers greater than zero: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, ...} (infinite set). The critical realization here is that only primes >2 will intersect with this set, as 2 is the only even prime.

3. Intersection calculation:
   - Excluding 2 (the only even prime) leaves 9 primes: {3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}
   - All these remaining primes are odd numbers >0
   - Counting these yields 9 elements

4. Edge case validation:
   - 1 is in the odd numbers set but not prime (disregarded)
   - 2 is prime but not odd (excluded from intersection)
   - All other primes <30 are odd and thus included

5. Final count verification: 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 (9 distinct numbers). No duplicates, no missing elements.

The logical flow from set definition to intersection calculation to final count is mathematically sound. No errors detected in the reasoning process.
