Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.  
2. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.  
3. Multiply the results of the two combinations to find the total number of ways to form the group.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
This is a combination problem, where the number of ways to choose $ r $ items from $ n $ is given by the formula:  
$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
$$  
For the boys:  
$$
\binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
$$  
So, there are 35 ways to choose 3 boys from 7.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the same combination formula:  
$$
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
$$  
So, there are 6 ways to choose 2 girls from 4.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls to find the total number of ways to form the group.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total number of ways to form the group is the product of the combinations:  
$$
35 \times 6 = 210
$$  
So, there are 210 ways to form a group of 3 boys and 2 girls.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the combination calculations, the independence assumption between boy/girl selections, and the final multiplication step.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Combination calculations**:
   - For boys: $ \binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35 $. This is correct as the formula for combinations is properly applied.
   - For girls: $ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 $. This is also correct.

2. **Independence assumption**: The problem states that the order of selection does not matter, and boys and girls are distinct groups. Since selecting boys and selecting girls are independent events, multiplying their combinations is valid (fundamental counting principle).

3. **Final multiplication**: $ 35 \times 6 = 210 $. This arithmetic is correct.

No inconsistencies or errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The solution aligns with combinatorial principles.
