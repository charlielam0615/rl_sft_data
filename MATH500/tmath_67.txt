Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Define the variables for the square's side length.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the side length of the square be $ s $. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, and the area is $ s^2 $.

When the lengths of two opposite sides are decreased by $40\%$, each of these sides becomes $ s - 0.4s = 0.6s $.

When the lengths of the other two sides are increased by $50\%$, each of these sides becomes $ s + 0.5s = 1.5s $.

The rectangle formed has dimensions $ 0.6s $ and $ 1.5s $, and its area is $ 0.6s \times 1.5s = 0.9s^2 $.

The area of the square is $ s^2 $, and the area of the rectangle is $ 0.9s^2 $.

Now, we need to determine the percentage decrease in area by calculating:
$$
\text{Percentage decrease} = \left( \frac{s^2 - 0.9s^2}{s^2} \right) \times 100
$$

[VERIFY]
1. Original square area: $ s^2 $ - Correct as square area formula.
2. Adjusted sides: 
   - 40% decrease: $ s - 0.4s = 0.6s $ ✓
   - 50% increase: $ s + 0.5s = 1.5s $ ✓
3. Rectangle area: $ 0.6s \times 1.5s = 0.9s^2 $ ✓
4. Area difference: $ s^2 - 0.9s^2 = 0.1s^2 $ ✓
5. Percentage decrease calculation: 
   $$
   \left( \frac{0.1s^2}{s^2} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   $$
   ✓ All terms cancel correctly.
   
All mathematical operations are valid and consistent. The percentage decrease is correctly calculated as 10%. No errors detected in reasoning or calculations.
