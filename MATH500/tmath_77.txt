I am focusing on expressing both sides of the equation $ 2^8 = 4^x $ with the same base. Since $ 4 = 2^2 $, I will rewrite $ 4^x $ as $ (2^2)^x $. This allows me to express both sides of the equation with base 2, which will make it easier to solve for $ x $.

Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Rewrite $ 4^x $ in terms of base $ 2 $: $ 4^x = (2^2)^x $.  
2. Simplify $ (2^2)^x $ to $ 2^{2x} $.  
3. Equate the exponents of both sides: $ 8 = 2x $.  
4. Solve for $ x $: $ x = \frac{8}{2} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Rewrite $ 4^x $ in terms of base 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $ 4 = 2^2 $, we can rewrite $ 4^x $ as $ (2^2)^x $.  
Using the power of a power property, $ (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} $.  
This transforms the equation $ 2^8 = 4^x $ into $ 2^8 = 2^{2x} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ x $ by equating the exponents.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Now that both sides of the equation are expressed with the same base, we can equate the exponents:
$$
8 = 2x
$$
To solve for $ x $, divide both sides by 2:
$$
x = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Base Conversion Check**:  
   - Original equation: $2^8 = 4^x$.  
   - Substituted $4 = 2^2$, resulting in $2^8 = (2^2)^x$.  
   - Applied power rule $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$: $(2^2)^x = 2^{2x}$.  
   - Resulting equation: $2^8 = 2^{2x}$.  
   - **Conclusion**: Base conversion is mathematically valid.

2. **Exponent Equating Check**:  
   - Since bases are equal ($2^8 = 2^{2x}$), exponents must satisfy $8 = 2x$.  
   - Solving $8 = 2x$ gives $x = 4$.  
   - **Conclusion**: Exponent equating is correctly applied.

3. **Solution Validation**:  
   - Substitute $x = 4$ into original equation: $4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^{8}$.  
   - Left side: $2^8$. Right side: $2^8$.  
   - **Conclusion**: Both sides are equal, confirming $x = 4$ is correct.  

4. **Error Analysis**:  
   - No arithmetic or algebraic errors detected.  
   - All logarithmic/exponential rules applied correctly.  
   - **Final Verdict**: $\boxed{correct}$
