The general term in the binomial expansion of $ (a + b)^n $ is given by  
$$
T_k = \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
$$  
For the expression $ \left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 $, the general term is  
$$
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the value of $ k $ such that the exponent of $ x $ in the term $ T_k $ is zero.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The exponent of $ x $ in $ T_k $ is $ 15 - 5k $.  
To find the constant term, we set the exponent to zero:  
$$
15 - 5k = 0
$$  
Solving for $ k $:  
$$
5k = 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 3
$$  
Thus, the constant term corresponds to $ k = 3 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of substituting $ k = 3 $ into the general term and the subsequent calculations for $ T_3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
Let's re-examine the computation of $ T_3 $:

1. **Binomial coefficient**: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ is correct.
2. **Power of 10**: $ 10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100 $ is correct.
3. **Sign factor**: $ (-1)^3 = -1 $ is correct.
4. **Power of 2**: $ \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8} $ is correct.
5. **Multiplication**:
   - $ 10 \times 100 = 1000 $
   - $ 1000 \times (-1) = -1000 $
   - $ -1000 \times \frac{1}{8} = -125 $
   
All intermediate steps and arithmetic operations are valid. The final result $ T_3 = -125 $ is correct. No errors detected in this verification.

\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The constant term is $-125$.
