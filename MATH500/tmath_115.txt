Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the formula for permutations of a multiset to calculate the number of arrangements of the letters in the word ELLIPSE.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The formula for the number of permutations of a multiset is:

$$
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \dots \cdot k_m!}
$$

Where:  
- $ n $ is the total number of items (letters, in this case),  
- $ k_1, k_2, \dots, k_m $ are the frequencies of each distinct item.

For the word ELLIPSE:  
- $ n = 7 $ (total letters),  
- Frequencies:  
  - E appears 2 times,  
  - L appears 2 times,  
  - I, P, and S each appear 1 time.

Substitute into the formula:  

$$
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
$$

Now calculate the factorials:

- $ 7! = 5040 $  
- $ 2! = 2 $  
- $ 1! = 1 $

So the denominator becomes:

$$
2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 4
$$

Now compute the final result:

$$
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Total letters check**:  
   - ELLIPSE has 7 letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Confirmed.  

2. **Repeated letters and frequencies**:  
   - E appears 2 times.  
   - L appears 2 times.  
   - I, P, S appear 1 time each.  
   - Correctly identified.  

3. **Formula application**:  
   - Formula: $ \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} $.  
   - Simplified denominator to $ 2! \cdot 2! = 4 $.  
   - $ 7! = 5040 $, $ 5040 / 4 = 1260 $.  
   - Calculation steps are mathematically valid.  

4. **Critical edge cases**:  
   - No additional repeated letters (e.g., I, P, S are unique).  
   - Correctly excluded 1! terms from denominator (they do not affect the result).  

Conclusion: All steps are logically consistent and mathematically accurate.
