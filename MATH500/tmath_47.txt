Goal of this step: Factor the denominator $x^2 - 5x - 14$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to factor the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we can factor it by finding two numbers that multiply to -14 (the constant term) and add up to -5 (the coefficient of the linear term).

The quadratic expression is $x^2 - 5x - 14$.

We need to find two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. These numbers are -7 and 2 because (-7) * 2 = -14 and (-7) + 2 = -5.

Therefore, the factored form of the denominator is $(x - 7)(x + 2)$.

The factored form of the denominator is $(x - 7)(x + 2)$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes.  

1. $x - 7 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 7$  
2. $x + 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -2$  

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.

[VERIFY]
The function $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}$ has a numerator of degree 1 and a denominator of degree 2. Horizontal asymptote rules state that when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$. However, in the initial implementation step for identifying the horizontal asymptote, the reasoning incorrectly assumed the degrees were equal and used the ratio of leading coefficients ($2/1$). This is a critical error because the degrees are not equal (1 vs. 2), so the horizontal asymptote must be $y = 0$, not $y = 2$. This invalidates the subsequent calculation of $a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 2 = 7$. The correct sum should be $7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$. The error stems from a misapplication of the horizontal asymptote rule, which is a significant flaw in the logic. The vertical asymptotes $x = 7$ and $x = -2$ are correctly derived, but the horizontal asymptote value $c$ is wrong. This verification conclusively shows that the final answer of $a + b + c$ is incorrect due to this miscalculation.

The function is $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}$. The numerator has degree 1, and the denominator has degree 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is the x-axis, i.e., $y = 0$.  

Thus, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.

1. **Vertical Asymptotes (a and b):**  
   The denominator $x^2 - 5x - 14$ factors to $(x - 7)(x + 2)$. Setting each factor to zero gives $x = 7$ and $x = -2$. This is correct because:  
   - $7 \times (-2) = -14$ (matches the constant term).  
   - $7 + (-2) = 5$ (but with a sign correction: the middle term is $-5x$, so the correct sum is $-7 + 2 = -5$).  
   Thus, vertical asymptotes at $x = 7$ and $x = -2$ are valid.  

2. **Horizontal Asymptote (c):**  
   The numerator degree (1) is less than the denominator degree (2). By the horizontal asymptote rule, this implies $y = 0$. The earlier error of assuming equal degrees was corrected, and the current value $c = 0$ is accurate.  

3. **Final Sum Calculation:**  
   Substituting $a = 7$, $b = -2$, and $c = 0$ gives $7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$. All components are verified as correct.  

No inconsistencies or errors detected in the reasoning or calculations. The final answer is consistent with all mathematical principles applied.
