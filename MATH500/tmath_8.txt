Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The distance formula for calculating the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The distance formula is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. It is used to find the distance between any two points in a coordinate plane.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Take the square root of the sum (117) and simplify it into simplest radical form.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
- The square root of 117 is $\sqrt{117}$.  
- Factor 117 into its prime factors: $117 = 9 \times 13 = 3^2 \times 13$.  
- Simplify $\sqrt{117}$ as $\sqrt{3^2 \times 13} = 3\sqrt{13}$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the entire solution process from calculating coordinate differences to simplifying the final radical.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Coordinate difference calculation:
   - x-difference: -4 - 2 = -6 (correct)
   - y-difference: 3 - (-6) = 9 (correct)

2. Squaring operation:
   - (-6)² = 36 (correct)
   - 9² = 81 (correct)
   - Sum: 36 + 81 = 117 (correct)

3. Radical simplification:
   - Prime factorization of 117: 3 × 3 × 13 (correct)
   - √(3² × 13) = 3√13 (correct)

All mathematical operations follow proper arithmetic rules. The application of the distance formula adheres to its standard definition. The simplification of the radical is in simplest form since 13 has no perfect square factors other than 1. No errors detected in any calculation step.
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The distance between the points is $3\sqrt{13}$ units.
