The double sum expression is:
$$
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}.
$$
This is a sum over all positive integers $ j $ and $ k $, where the function depends on the sum $ j + k $. A substitution $ n = j + k $ might help, but it introduces complexity because $ n $ must be at least 2, and for each fixed $ n $, $ k $ ranges from 1 to $ n - 1 $. Rewriting the sum in terms of $ n $, we get:
$$
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3}.
$$
This substitution simplifies the denominator, but we now need to evaluate the inner sum over $ k $. The inner sum is:
$$
\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{n - 1}{n^3}.
$$
Thus, the double sum becomes:
$$
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3}.
$$
This is a single sum that can be simplified further. Letâ€™s proceed to simplify it.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the single sum $ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We simplify the expression $ \frac{n - 1}{n^3} $ as follows:  
$$
\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}.
$$  
Thus, the double sum becomes:  
$$
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right) = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
$$  
Using the definitions of $ p $ and $ q $, we can express the sums as:  
$$
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1, \quad \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
$$  
Substituting these into the expression, we get:  
$$
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.
$$

Scope of this verification: All steps in the solution process, including substitution, algebraic manipulation, and summation transformations.

[VERIFY]
1. **Substitution Validity**: The substitution $ n = j + k $ correctly captures all terms of the original double sum. For each fixed $ n \geq 2 $, $ k $ ranges from 1 to $ n - 1 $, ensuring all valid $ (j, k) $ pairs are included. This step is correct.

2. **Inner Sum Simplification**: The inner sum $ \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{n-1}{n^3} $ is valid because $ \frac{1}{n^3} $ is constant with respect to $ k $. This step is correct.

3. **Algebraic Decomposition**: The decomposition $ \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} $ is algebraically valid. This step is correct.

4. **Summation Splitting**: Splitting the single sum into $ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} $ is valid due to linearity of summation. This step is correct.

5. **Connection to $ p $ and $ q $**: The sums $ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 $ and $ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1 $ are valid because $ p $ and $ q $ include the $ n=1 $ term ($ 1/1^2 = 1 $, $ 1/1^3 = 1 $). Substituting these gives $ (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q $, which is correct.

6. **Final Expression**: The conclusion $ p - q $ follows logically from all prior steps. No errors detected.

All critical steps are consistent and logically valid. The final answer is correctly derived.
