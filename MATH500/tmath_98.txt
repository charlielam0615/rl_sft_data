The given expression is $(-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)$. Removing the parentheses, we obtain:
$$-k + 4 - 2 + 3k$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Combine like terms.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Now, we combine the like terms. The terms involving $k$ are $-k$ and $3k$, and the constant terms are $4$ and $-2$. Combining these:
$$
(-k + 3k) + (4 - 2)
$$
$$
= 2k + 2
$$

1. **Algebraic Validation**:  
   Original expression: $(-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)$.  
   After removing parentheses: $-k + 4 - 2 + 3k$.  
   Combining like terms:  
   - $-k + 3k = 2k$  
   - $4 - 2 = 2$  
   Resulting in $2k + 2$. This matches the derived expression.  

2. **Numerical Substitution**:  
   - Let $k = 1$:  
     Original: $(-1 + 4) + (-2 + 3(1)) = 3 + 1 = 4$.  
     Simplified: $2(1) + 2 = 4$.  
   - Let $k = 0$:  
     Original: $(-0 + 4) + (-2 + 3(0)) = 4 - 2 = 2$.  
     Simplified: $2(0) + 2 = 2$.  
   - Let $k = -1$:  
     Original: $(-(-1) + 4) + (-2 + 3(-1)) = (1 + 4) + (-2 - 3) = 5 - 5 = 0$.  
     Simplified: $2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0$.  

   All substitutions confirm the equivalence.  

3. **Error Analysis**:  
   No discrepancies between algebraic manipulation and numerical tests. No missing terms or sign errors detected.  

**Conclusion**: The simplification is correct.
