Goal of this step: Analyze the given logarithmic equation.

We are given the equation $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$. 

First, we simplify the right-hand side using the logarithmic identity $\log(a^b) = b\log(a)$, so $2\log(x+2) = \log((x+2)^2)$. Thus, the equation becomes:
$$
\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2)
$$

Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:
$$
kx = (x+2)^2
$$

This is a quadratic equation in $x$. We will solve it to find the values of $x$ in terms of $k$.

The logarithmic functions $\log(kx)$ and $\log(x+2)$ are defined only when their arguments are positive. Therefore, the domain requires:  
1. $kx > 0$,  
2. $x + 2 > 0$.  

From condition 2, $x > -2$.  
From condition 1, $kx > 0$. This condition depends on the sign of $k$:  
- If $k > 0$, then $x > 0$.  
- If $k < 0$, then $x < 0$.  

Combining with $x > -2$, the domain is:  
- If $k > 0$, then $x > 0$.  
- If $k < 0$, then $-2 < x < 0$.  
- If $k = 0$, $\log(kx)$ is undefined, so $k = 0$ is excluded.  

Thus, the domain is $x > 0$ for $k > 0$, and $-2 < x < 0$ for $k < 0$.

We have the simplified equation:  
$$
kx = (x+2)^2
$$  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
$$
kx = x^2 + 4x + 4
$$  
Rearranging terms:  
$$
x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
$$  
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we want to determine for which values of $k$ it has exactly one real solution. A quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant of the quadratic $x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0$ is:  
$$
\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4(1)(4) = (4-k)^2 - 16
$$  
We set $\Delta = 0$ to find the values of $k$ for which the equation has exactly one real solution:  
$$
(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0  
$$  
$$
(4-k)^2 = 16  
$$  
$$
4-k = \pm 4  
$$  
$$
k = 4 \pm 4  
$$  
$$
k = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad k = 8  
$$  
Thus, the equation has exactly one real solution when $k = 0$ or $k = 8$.

[VERIFY]
The verification reveals a critical oversight in the initial solution. The approach only considered the discriminant being zero (leading to k=8) but failed to account for cases where the quadratic equation has two real roots, with exactly one valid in the domain. For k < 0, the quadratic equation yields two negative roots, but only one lies within the domain (-2 < x < 0). This contributes 500 valid integer values (k = -500 to -1). Additionally, k=8 is valid (with one solution at x=2). The initial solution incorrectly excluded k < 0 and only included k=8, leading to an undercount. The problem also mistakenly included k=0, which is invalid due to the undefined logarithm.  

The correct total number of valid integer values is 500 (for k < 0) + 1 (for k=8) = 501. The initial solution omitted this key analysis, resulting in an error.
