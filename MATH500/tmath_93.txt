Goal of this step: Complete the square for the $x$-terms and $y$-terms in the given circle equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The given equation is $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$.

To complete the square for the $x$-terms, we look at $x^2 - 10x$. We need to add and subtract $(\frac{10}{2})^2 = 25$.

To complete the square for the $y$-terms, we look at $y^2 + 6y$. We need to add and subtract $(\frac{6}{2})^2 = 9$.

Now, we rewrite the equation with the completed squares:
$$
(x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) + c = 25 + 9
$$
$$
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + c = 34
$$
$$
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Rewrite the equation in standard form to identify the radius.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The standard form of a circle is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. From the previous step, the equation is:  
$$
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
$$  
This matches the standard form, where $r^2 = 34 - c$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $c$ such that the radius of the circle is 1.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given that the radius $r = 1$. From the previous step, we know that $r^2 = 34 - c$.  

Substitute $r = 1$ into the equation:  
$$
1^2 = 34 - c
$$  
$$
1 = 34 - c
$$  
Solving for $c$:  
$$
c = 34 - 1 = 33
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All steps in completing the square, deriving the standard form, and solving for c.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Completing the square for x-terms:
   - Original expression: x² -10x
   - Half of -10 is -5, squared is 25. Correct.
   - Added 25 to both sides. Correct.

2. Completing the square for y-terms:
   - Original expression: y² +6y
   - Half of 6 is 3, squared is 9. Correct.
   - Added 9 to both sides. Correct.

3. Rewriting the equation:
   - Left side becomes (x-5)² + (y+3)² + c. Correct.
   - Right side becomes 25 + 9 = 34. Correct.
   - Final equation: (x-5)² + (y+3)² = 34 - c. Correct.

4. Solving for c:
   - Given r = 1, so r² = 1. Correct.
   - Equation 34 - c = 1. Correct.
   - Solution c = 33. Correct.

All algebraic manipulations and substitutions are valid. No arithmetic or sign errors detected. The final value c=33 indeed results in a circle of radius 1.
\boxed{correct}
[/VERIFY]
[ANSWER]
The value of $ c $ is 33. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{33}$.
