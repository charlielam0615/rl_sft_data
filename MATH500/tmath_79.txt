What to recall: Prime factorization of $72$.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The prime factorization of $72$ involves breaking it down into its prime number components. $72$ can be divided by $2$ to get $36$, then $18$, then $9$, and finally $9$ can be divided into $3 \cdot 3$. So, the prime factorization of $72$ is $2^3 \cdot 3^2$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Match the powers of $3$ on both sides of the equation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now have the equation:  
$$
8 \cdot 3^x = 72
$$  
From the prime factorization, $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$, so the equation becomes:  
$$
8 \cdot 3^x = 8 \cdot 3^2
$$  
By dividing both sides by $8$, we get:  
$$
3^x = 3^2
$$  
Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:  
$$
x = 2
$$

1. **Initial simplification check:**  
   Calculated $2^3 = 8$ (correct, since $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$).  

2. **Prime factorization of 72:**  
   - $72 \div 2 = 36$  
   - $36 \div 2 = 18$  
   - $18 \div 2 = 9$  
   - $9 = 3 \cdot 3$  
   This yields $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$ (correct).  

3. **Equation substitution:**  
   Substituted $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$ into the original equation:  
   $$
   2^3 \cdot 3^x = 2^3 \cdot 3^2
   $$  
   Simplified to $3^x = 3^2$ by dividing both sides by $2^3$ (valid operation).  

4. **Exponent matching:**  
   Since $3^x = 3^2$, $x = 2$ (correct, as exponential equality with same base implies exponent equality).  

5. **Back-substitution test:**  
   Plugging $x = 2$ into the original equation:  
   $$
   2^3 \cdot 3^2 = 8 \cdot 9 = 72
   $$  
   Matches the right-hand side (valid).  

**Conclusion:** All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.
