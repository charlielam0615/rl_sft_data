Goal of this step: Calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of 6432 and 132 using the Euclidean algorithm.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the GCF of 6432 and 132 using the Euclidean algorithm:  

1. Divide 6432 by 132 and find the remainder.  
   $6432 \div 132 = 48$ with a remainder of $6432 - (132 \times 48) = 6432 - 6336 = 96$.  
2. Replace the numbers with 132 and 96, and repeat the process.  
   $132 \div 96 = 1$ with a remainder of $132 - (96 \times 1) = 132 - 96 = 36$.  
3. Replace the numbers with 96 and 36, and repeat the process.  
   $96 \div 36 = 2$ with a remainder of $96 - (36 \times 2) = 96 - 72 = 24$.  
4. Replace the numbers with 36 and 24, and repeat the process.  
   $36 \div 24 = 1$ with a remainder of $36 - (24 \times 1) = 36 - 24 = 12$.  
5. Replace the numbers with 24 and 12, and repeat the process.  
   $24 \div 12 = 2$ with a remainder of $24 - (12 \times 2) = 24 - 24 = 0$.  

The remainder is now 0, so the GCF of 6432 and 132 is 12.

[VERIFY]
1. GCF Calculation Verification:
   - 6432 ÷ 132 = 48 with remainder 96 (6432 - (132×48) = 96) ✓
   - 132 ÷ 96 = 1 with remainder 36 (132 - 96 = 36) ✓
   - 96 ÷ 36 = 2 with remainder 24 (96 - 72 = 24) ✓
   - 36 ÷ 24 = 1 with remainder 12 (36 - 24 = 12) ✓
   - 24 ÷ 12 = 2 with remainder 0 ✓
   Final GCF = 12 (confirmed through 5 iterative steps of Euclidean algorithm)

2. Addition Verification:
   - 12 (GCF) + 11 = 23 (basic arithmetic operation confirmed)
   
All mathematical operations executed correctly with consistent results across verification steps.
