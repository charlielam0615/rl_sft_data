Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Define variables for the weights of treeks, squigs, and goolees.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let's define the variables as follows:

- Let $ t $ represent the weight of one treek.
- Let $ s $ represent the weight of one squig.
- Let $ g $ represent the weight of one goolee.

Now, we can use these variables to translate the problem statements into equations.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The problem statements and previously defined variables.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The problem states:
- Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee: $ 10t = 3s + g $.
- Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig: $ 2t + g = s $.

Previously, we defined:
- $ t $: weight of one treek.
- $ s $: weight of one squig.
- $ g $: weight of one goolee.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Translate the second problem statement into an equation and solve for one variable in terms of the others.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the second problem statement, we have the equation:

$$ 2t + g = s $$

We can solve this equation for $ g $ in terms of $ t $ and $ s $:

$$ g = s - 2t $$

Now we substitute this expression for $ g $ into the first equation.

Goal of this step: Substitute the expression for $ g $ into the first equation and solve for the relationship between $ t $ and $ s $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The first equation is:  
$$ 10t = 3s + g $$  

We substitute $ g = s - 2t $ into this equation:  
$$ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) $$  

Simplify the right-hand side:  
$$ 10t = 3s + s - 2t $$  
$$ 10t = 4s - 2t $$  

Now, add $ 2t $ to both sides to isolate terms involving $ t $ on one side:  
$$ 12t = 4s $$  

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for $ s $ in terms of $ t $:  
$$ 3t = s $$  

Thus, the weight of one squig equals the weight of three treeks.

1. Perform backward subgoaling to trace the solution back to the original question.  
   1.1 Confirm the derived relationship between squigs and treeks.  
   1.2 Ensure this conclusion aligns with the problem's constraints.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All algebraic steps and consistency with original problem constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
Let's verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Equation Consistency Check**:
   - Original equations:
     - 10t = 3s + g (Equation 1)
     - 2t + g = s (Equation 2)
   - Derived relationship: s = 3t
   - Substituting s = 3t into Equation 2: 2t + g = 3t → g = t
   - Substituting s = 3t and g = t into Equation 1: 10t = 3(3t) + t → 10t = 9t + t → 10t = 10t ✓

2. **Algebraic Step Validation**:
   - Substituted g = s - 2t into Equation 1 correctly: 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) → 10t = 4s - 2t ✓
   - Added 2t to both sides: 12t = 4s ✓
   - Divided by 4: 3t = s ✓

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The derived relationship s = 3t directly answers the question "how many treeks equals one squig" without contradictions.
   - All substitutions and simplifications follow valid algebraic rules.

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - If t = 0 (edge case), then s = 0 and g = 0, which trivially satisfies both equations.
   - For t > 0, the solution remains valid as shown in the consistency check.

The solution is mathematically sound and fully consistent with the problem's constraints.
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The combined weight of 3 treeks equals the weight of one squig. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{3}$.
