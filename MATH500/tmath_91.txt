I am focusing on determining the domain of $ f(x) $ such that the expression under the square root is non-negative and the denominator is not zero.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The constraints for the domain of $ f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the domain of $ f(x) $ here: The square root function $ \sqrt{x-1} $ is defined only when $ x-1 \geq 0 $, and the denominator $ x-2 $ cannot be zero.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the domain constraints for $ f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The square root function $ \sqrt{x-1} $ is defined only when $ x-1 \geq 0 $, which gives $ x \geq 1 $. The denominator $ x-2 $ must not be zero, so $ x \neq 2 $. 

Combining these, the domain of $ f(x) $ is $ x \geq 1 $ and $ x \neq 2 $.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The domain of $ f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} $ and the constraints for real-number outputs.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
I am listing relevant information for the domain of $ f(x) $ here:  
1. The square root $ \sqrt{x-1} $ is defined for $ x \geq 1 $.  
2. The denominator $ x-2 $ cannot be zero, so $ x \neq 2 $.  
3. Therefore, the domain of $ f(x) $ is $ x \in [1, 2) \cup (2, \infty) $.

Goal of this step: Identify the smallest integer $ x $ such that $ x \geq 1 $ and $ x \neq 2 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The smallest integer $ x $ satisfying $ x \geq 1 $ is $ x = 1 $. Since $ x = 1 $ does not violate $ x \neq 2 $, it is valid.  
Thus, $ x = 1 $ is the smallest integer satisfying the domain constraints.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm that x=1 satisfies the domain constraints and produces a real number output for f(x).
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Check domain constraints for x=1:
   - Square root condition: x-1 ≥ 0 → 1-1 = 0 ≥ 0 ✅
   - Denominator condition: x-2 ≠ 0 → 1-2 = -1 ≠ 0 ✅

2. Evaluate f(1):
   - Numerator: √(1-1) = √0 = 0 (real number)
   - Denominator: 1-2 = -1 (non-zero real number)
   - Result: 0/-1 = 0 (real number) ✅

3. Confirm there's no smaller integer:
   - The smallest integer ≥1 is 1 itself.
   - No integer less than 1 satisfies x≥1 ❌

All constraints are satisfied. No contradictions detected.
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The smallest possible integer value for $ x $ is $ \boxed{1} $.
