Goal of this step: Determine the degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side.

[IMP]
The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $ x $ in the polynomial. In the polynomial $ 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 $, the highest power of $ x $ is $ x^4 $. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 4.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side to determine the degree of $ f(x) $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The left-hand side of the equation is $ (x-1) \cdot f(x) $. The degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees. The degree of $ x-1 $ is 1. Let the degree of $ f(x) $ be $ d $. Then, the degree of $ (x-1) \cdot f(x) $ is $ 1 + d $. Since the degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 4, we equate:  
$$
1 + d = 4.
$$  
Solving this gives $ d = 3 $. Therefore, the degree of $ f(x) $ is 3.

[VERIFY]
The solution hinges on two key steps: determining the degree of the right-hand polynomial and applying the degree addition rule for polynomial products. 

1. **Right-hand polynomial degree**: The polynomial $3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17$ clearly has degree 4 due to the $x^4$ term. This is straightforward and correct.

2. **Degree addition rule**: For two polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$, the degree of their product is $\deg(P) + \deg(Q)$. Here, $(x-1)$ has degree 1, and the product has degree 4. Solving $1 + \deg(f) = 4$ gives $\deg(f) = 3$. This logic is sound under standard polynomial multiplication rules.

Potential edge cases (e.g., cancellation of leading terms) are irrelevant here because the problem explicitly provides the product polynomial, which retains the $x^4$ term. Thus, no cancellation occurred, and the reasoning holds. The conclusion is consistent with polynomial arithmetic principles.
