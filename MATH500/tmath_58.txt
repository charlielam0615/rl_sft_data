I am recalling that expressions like $99^2 + 99 + 1$ can be rewritten using algebraic identities. Specifically, $99^2 + 99 + 1$ can be simplified by factoring or by recognizing patterns in the expression. The identity $a^2 + a + 1$ can be helpful for such expressions, and further simplification may lead to easier mental computation.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the expression $99^2 + 99 + 1$ using an algebraic identity.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start by recognizing that the expression $99^2 + 99 + 1$ can be simplified using the identity for $a^2 + a + 1$, which is not directly factorable but can be rewritten to make mental calculation easier.  

Letâ€™s compute step by step:  

1. Compute $99^2$:  
   $99^2 = (100 - 1)^2$.  
   Using the binomial square identity $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we get:  
   $$
   99^2 = 100^2 - 2(100)(1) + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.
   $$

2. Add $99$ to the result:  
   $$
   9801 + 99 = 9900.
   $$

3. Finally, add $1$:  
   $$
   9900 + 1 = 9901.
   $$

Thus, the simplified result is $9901$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Binomial expansion verification**:  
   - $ (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 $  
     This aligns with the identity $ (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 $, so the calculation $ 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801 $ is correct.  

2. **Addition of $99$**:  
   - $ 9801 + 99 = 9900 $.  
     This is valid because $ 9801 + 99 = 9800 + (1 + 99) = 9800 + 100 = 9900 $.  

3. **Final addition of $1$**:  
   - $ 9900 + 1 = 9901 $.  
     Straightforward arithmetic.  

4. **Alternative method using distributive property**:  
   - $ 99^2 + 99 = 99(99 + 1) = 99 \cdot 100 = 9900 $.  
     Adding $1$ gives $ 9900 + 1 = 9901 $.  
     This method cross-confirms the result without relying on binomial expansion.  

Both approaches yield the same result, and all intermediate steps are logically consistent.
