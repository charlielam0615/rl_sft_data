Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert the binary number $10101001110_{2}$ to base ten.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert $10101001110_{2}$ to base ten, interpret each binary digit as a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit. The binary number is:  
$$
1 \cdot 2^{10} + 0 \cdot 2^9 + 1 \cdot 2^8 + 0 \cdot 2^7 + 1 \cdot 2^6 + 0 \cdot 2^5 + 0 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0
$$  
Now compute the decimal value:  
$$
1 \cdot 2^{10} = 1024, \quad 1 \cdot 2^8 = 256, \quad 1 \cdot 2^6 = 64, \quad 1 \cdot 2^3 = 8, \quad 1 \cdot 2^2 = 4, \quad 1 \cdot 2^1 = 2
$$  
Summing these values:  
$$
1024 + 256 + 64 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 1358
$$  
Thus, $10101001110_{2} = 1358_{10}$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert the base ten number $1358_{10}$ to base eight.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert $1358_{10}$ to base eight, perform successive division by 8 and record the remainders:  
1. $1358 \div 8 = 169$ remainder $6$  
2. $169 \div 8 = 21$ remainder $1$  
3. $21 \div 8 = 2$ remainder $5$  
4. $2 \div 8 = 0$ remainder $2$  

Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives the octal representation: $2516_{8}$.

[VERIFY]
First, verify the binary-to-decimal conversion. The binary number 10101001110 has 11 digits, so the leftmost digit corresponds to 2¹⁰ (1024). Calculating each position:

1×2¹⁰ = 1024  
0×2⁹ = 0  
1×2⁸ = 256  
0×2⁷ = 0  
1×2⁶ = 64  
0×2⁵ = 0  
0×2⁴ = 0  
1×2³ = 8  
1×2² = 4  
1×2¹ = 2  
0×2⁰ = 0  

Summing: 1024 + 256 = 1280; 1280 + 64 = 1344; 1344 + 8 = 1352; 1352 + 4 = 1356; 1356 + 2 = 1358. The decimal value 1358 is correct.

Next, verify the decimal-to-octal conversion. Dividing 1358 by 8:  
1358 ÷ 8 = 169 remainder 6  
169 ÷ 8 = 21 remainder 1  
21 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 5  
2 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 2  

Reading remainders from last to first: 2 5 1 6 → 2516₈. Converting 2516₈ back to decimal:  
2×8³ = 1024  
5×8² = 320  
1×8¹ = 8  
6×8⁰ = 6  
Total: 1024 + 320 = 1344; 1344 + 8 = 1352; 1352 + 6 = 1358. This matches the original decimal value. Both conversions are consistent and correct.
