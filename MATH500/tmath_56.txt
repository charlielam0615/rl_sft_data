Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The formula for the sum of the first $ N $ positive odd numbers.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The sum of the first $ N $ positive odd numbers is given by the formula $ S = N^2 $. This is a well-known mathematical identity where the sum of an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers results in a perfect square.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up the equation using the formula $ S = N^2 $ and the given sum $ S = 121 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given that the sum $ S = N^2 $, and the sum is given as 121, we substitute into the equation:  
$$
N^2 = 121
$$  
To solve for $ N $, we take the square root of both sides:  
$$
N = \sqrt{121}
$$  
$$
N = 11
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the solution steps, including the application of the formula, algebraic manipulation, and numerical calculation.

[VERIFY]
1. **Formula validation**: The identity "sum of first N odd numbers equals N²" is a fundamental mathematical theorem. For example:
   - N=1: 1 = 1² ✅
   - N=2: 1+3=4=2² ✅
   - N=3: 1+3+5=9=3² ✅
   This pattern holds universally for all positive integers N.

2. **Equation setup**: Given S=121, the equation becomes N²=121. This substitution is valid because the problem explicitly states the sum equals 121.

3. **Square root calculation**:
   - √121 = 11 (since 11×11=121 and 11>0)
   - Negative root (-11) is discarded because N represents a count of positive integers.

4. **Final consistency check**:
   - Plugging N=11 back into the formula: 11²=121 ✅
   - The sequence of first 11 odd numbers would be: 1,3,5,...,21 (since the Nth odd number is 2N-1; 2×11-1=21)
   - Sum of this sequence: (1+21)×11/2 = 22×11/2 = 121 ✅

All steps are logically sound and numerically consistent. No errors detected in reasoning or calculation.
