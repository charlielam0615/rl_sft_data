Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Generate numbers that only use the digits 0 and 2 and check for the smallest one that is divisible by 30.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Start by generating numbers with only the digits 0 and 2:
- 2 (not divisible by 10)
- 20 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 2, not divisible by 3)
- 22 (not divisible by 10)
- 200 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 2, not divisible by 3)
- 202 (not divisible by 10)
- 220 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 4, not divisible by 3)
- 2000 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 2, not divisible by 3)
- 2002 (not divisible by 10)
- 2020 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 4, not divisible by 3)
- 2022 (not divisible by 10)
- 2200 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 4, not divisible by 3)
- 2202 (not divisible by 10)
- 2220 (divisible by 10, sum of digits = 6, divisible by 3)

The number 2220 is the smallest positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the solution process and the final answer.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Divisibility by 30**: 2220 ends with 0 (divisible by 10). The sum of its digits is 2+2+2+0=6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 2220 is divisible by both 3 and 10, satisfying the requirement for 30.

2. **Digit Constraints**: 2220 contains only digits 0 and 2, which aligns with the problem's restriction.

3. **Minimality Check**: The generated sequence of numbers using 0/2 digits in ascending order was systematically evaluated. All smaller candidates (20, 200, 220, etc.) failed the divisibility-by-3 check. The next possible number after 2220 would be longer (e.g., 22200), which is larger. Thus, 2220 is the minimal valid number.

4. **No Omissions in Search**: The search process incrementally builds numbers with 0/2 digits, ensuring no smaller valid number is overlooked. The order of evaluation (20, 200, 220, ..., 2220) is correct and exhaustive for the given digit constraints.

All verification checks confirm the solution is correct. No errors detected in reasoning or calculations.
