The volume $ V $ of water in a cylinder is given by the formula:  
$$
V = \pi r^2 h
$$  
where $ r $ is the radius of the base and $ h $ is the height (or water level) of the cylinder.  

Since the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, and the volume is increasing at a rate of $ 20\pi $ cubic meters per hour, we can use the derivative (rate of change) form of the formula:  
$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
$$  
Here, $ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi $ and $ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 $. Substituting these values into the equation:  
$$
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
$$  
Divide both sides of the equation by $ \pi $:  
$$
20 = 4r^2
$$  
Solve for $ r^2 $:  
$$
r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5
$$  
Take the square root of both sides:  
$$
r = \sqrt{5}
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Formula Application**: The volume of a cylinder is correctly given by $ V = \pi r^2 h $. When differentiating with respect to time $ t $, the chain rule yields $ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} $, assuming $ r $ is constant (as the tank's radius does not change during filling). This step is valid.

2. **Substitution of Values**: The given rates $ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi $ and $ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 $ are correctly substituted into the equation. The algebraic manipulation $ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 $ is accurate.

3. **Simplification**: Dividing both sides by $ \pi $ to obtain $ 20 = 4r^2 $ is correct. Solving for $ r^2 = 5 $ and taking the square root to find $ r = \sqrt{5} $ is mathematically sound.

4. **Unit Consistency**: The units of $ \frac{dV}{dt} $ (m³/h) and $ \frac{dh}{dt} $ (m/h) are consistent with the derived equation $ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} $, as $ \pi r^2 $ (m²) multiplied by $ \frac{dh}{dt} $ (m/h) yields m³/h.

5. **Final Answer**: The radius $ \sqrt{5} $ meters is in simplest radical form, as required by the problem.
