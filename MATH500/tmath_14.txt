Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Identify the known and unknown sides in triangle $ DEF $.
   1.1. $ \sin D = 0.7 $ is given, which relates the opposite side ($ EF $) and the hypotenuse ($ DF $).
   1.2. Side $ EF = 7 $ is given.
   1.3. Side $ DE $ is the adjacent side to angle $ D $, and its length is to be determined.
2. Use the sine definition to find $ DF $, the hypotenuse.
   2.1. Recall $ \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF} $.
   2.2. Solve for $ DF $.
3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $ DE $, the adjacent side.
   3.1. Recall $ DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the definition of sine to calculate the hypotenuse $ DF $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given:  
$$ \sin D = 0.7 = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF} $$  
We also know $ EF = 7 $.  

Substitute into the equation:  
$$ 0.7 = \frac{7}{DF} $$  

Solving for $ DF $:  
$$ DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $ DE $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now know:  
- $ DF = 10 $ (hypotenuse),  
- $ EF = 7 $ (opposite side).  

Using the Pythagorean Theorem:  
$$ DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2 $$  
$$ 10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 $$  
$$ 100 = DE^2 + 49 $$  

Solving for $ DE^2 $:  
$$ DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51 $$  

Taking the square root:  
$$ DE = \sqrt{51} $$

Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution for DE using trigonometric definitions and Pythagorean theorem.

[VERIFY]
1. **Sine definition verification**:
   - Given sin D = 0.7 = EF/DF = 7/DF
   - Calculation: DF = 7/0.7 = 10
   - This is mathematically valid as 7 ÷ 0.7 = 10.

2. **Pythagorean theorem verification**:
   - DF² = DE² + EF² → 10² = DE² + 7²
   - 100 = DE² + 49 → DE² = 51 → DE = √51
   - The algebraic manipulation is correct: 100 - 49 = 51, and square root of 51 is valid.

3. **Triangle configuration validation**:
   - Asymptote code defines DEF as right-angled at E (rightanglemark(D,E,F))
   - Coordinates confirm DE is horizontal (from (sqrt(51),7) to (0,7)) and EF is vertical (from (0,7) to (0,0))
   - Therefore, angle D has opposite side EF (7) and adjacent side DE (√51), consistent with calculations.

All steps are logically consistent with trigonometric principles and geometric configuration. No contradictions or errors detected.
