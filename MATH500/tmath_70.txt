Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Convert both base 9 numbers to base 10.
    1.1 Convert $58_9$ to base 10.
    1.2 Convert $18_9$ to base 10.
2. Subtract the base 10 equivalents.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $58_9$ to base 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The number $58_9$ can be expanded in base 10 as follows:  
$$5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53$$  
Thus, $58_9 = 53_{10}$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $18_9$ to base 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The number $18_9$ can be expanded in base 10 as follows:  
$$1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17$$  
Thus, $18_9 = 17_{10}$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Subtract the base 10 equivalents of the numbers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We now subtract $17_{10}$ from $53_{10}$:  
$$53 - 17 = 36$$  
Thus, the result in base 10 is $36_{10}$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $36_{10}$ to base $9$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert $36_{10}$ to base $9$, divide $36$ by $9$ and record the quotient and remainder:  
$$36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0$$  
So, $36_{10} = 40_9$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Conversion of 58₉ to base 10**:  
   5×9¹ + 8×9⁰ = 45 + 8 = 53.  
   ✅ Correct.

2. **Conversion of 18₉ to base 10**:  
   1×9¹ + 8×9⁰ = 9 + 8 = 17.  
   ✅ Correct.

3. **Subtraction in base 10**:  
   53 - 17 = 36.  
   ✅ Correct.

4. **Conversion of 36 to base 9**:  
   36 ÷ 9 = 4 with remainder 0 → 40₉.  
   ✅ Correct.
