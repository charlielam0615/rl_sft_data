Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $24^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate $24^2$, I use the formula for squaring a number:  
$24^2 = 24 \times 24$.  
Performing the multiplication step-by-step:  
$24 \times 24 = 576$.

[IMP]
We already have $26^2 = 676$ and $24^2 = 576$.  
Now, subtract:  
$676 - 576 = 100$.

The result from the previous step is $100$.  
Now, subtract $10$:  
$100 - 10 = 90$.

[VERIFY]
1. **Step 1: $26^2 = 676$**  
   - Verified via standard multiplication: $26 \times 26 = 676$.  
2. **Step 2: $24^2 = 576$**  
   - Verified via standard multiplication: $24 \times 24 = 576$.  
3. **Step 3: $676 - 576 = 100$**  
   - Subtraction is correct.  
4. **Step 4: $100 - 10 = 90$**  
   - Subtraction is correct.  
5. **Step 5: $90^2 = 8100$**  
   - Verified via standard multiplication: $90 \times 90 = 8100$.  
6. **Step 6: $8100 - 10^2 = 8100 - 100 = 8000$**  
   - Subtraction is correct.
