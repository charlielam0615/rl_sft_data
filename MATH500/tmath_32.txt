Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the problem: Determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a round table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together.
2. Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single "block" or unit to simplify the problem.
3. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the "block" with the remaining 5 people around the round table.
4. Calculate the number of internal arrangements within the "block" (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas).
5. Multiply the results from steps 3 and 4 to find the total number of distinct seating arrangements.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the "block" with the remaining 5 people around the round table.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
In a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange $ n $ distinct objects is $(n-1)!$. This is because one object can be fixed as a reference point, and the remaining $ n-1 $ objects are arranged relative to it.

Here, we treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single "block", so we are effectively arranging 6 units around the table (1 block + 5 people). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around the table is:

$$
(6-1)! = 5! = 120
$$

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The number of internal arrangements within the "block" (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas).
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The number of internal arrangements within the "block" (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) is the number of permutations of 3 people. This is calculated as $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply the number of arrangements of the 6 units by the number of internal arrangements within the "block" to find the total number of distinct seating arrangements.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We previously calculated that there are $ 120 $ ways to arrange the 6 units (1 block + 5 people) around the table, and $ 6 $ ways to arrange the 3 people within the block.  

The total number of distinct seating arrangements is:

$$
120 \times 6 = 720
$$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution (block arrangement, internal permutations, and final multiplication).
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Circular arrangement logic**: The formula $(n-1)!$ for circular permutations is correctly applied to 6 units (1 block + 5 people), yielding $5! = 120$. This accounts for rotational symmetry by fixing one unit as a reference.

2. **Internal block permutations**: The 3! = 6 arrangements for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block are valid, as their order relative to each other matters.

3. **Multiplication principle**: The total arrangements are calculated as $120 \times 6 = 720$, which correctly combines the two independent choices (arranging the block + others and arranging the block internally).

4. **No overcounting**: The block is treated as a single unit in the circular arrangement, ensuring rotational duplicates are eliminated. Internal permutations are distinct and do not reintroduce rotational symmetry.

5. **Edge case validation**: If all 8 people were distinct and no constraints existed, the total circular arrangements would be $7! = 5040$. Since 720 is a reasonable subset of these arrangements where 3 specific people are grouped, the result is plausible.

All steps align with combinatorial principles for circular permutations with grouping constraints. No logical inconsistencies or calculation errors are identified.
