Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the numerator by computing $2.5^2 - 0.7^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
First, calculate $2.5^2 = 6.25$ and $0.7^2 = 0.49$.  
Then, subtract: $6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76$.  
The numerator becomes $\sqrt{5.76}$.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Take the square root of the result from the numerator, which is $\sqrt{5.76}$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We compute $\sqrt{5.76}$.  
Since $2.4^2 = 5.76$, it follows that $\sqrt{5.76} = 2.4$.  
Thus, the numerator is simplified to $2.4$.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Simplify the denominator by computing $2.7 - 2.5$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We calculate $2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2$.  
Thus, the denominator is simplified to $0.2$.

Track Goals (Review)
Our goals are:  
1. Simplify the numerator by computing $2.5^2 - 0.7^2$ (done).  
2. Take the square root of the result from step 1 (done).  
3. Simplify the denominator by computing $2.7 - 2.5$ (done).  
4. Divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3 (to do).
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The numerator has been simplified to $2.4$, and the denominator has been simplified to $0.2$. The next step is to divide these two results to simplify the entire expression.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Divide the simplified numerator ($2.4$) by the simplified denominator ($0.2$).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We perform the division:  
$$
\frac{2.4}{0.2} = 12
$$  
Thus, the simplified value of the expression is $12$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify all steps in the solution process for correctness, including calculations in the numerator, denominator, and final division.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Numerator verification:  
   - $2.5^2 = 6.25$ (correct)  
   - $0.7^2 = 0.49$ (correct)  
   - $6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76$ (correct)  
   - $\sqrt{5.76} = 2.4$ (correct, since $2.4^2 = 5.76$)  

2. Denominator verification:  
   - $2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2$ (correct)  

3. Final division verification:  
   - $\frac{2.4}{0.2}$:  
     - Multiply numerator and denominator by 10: $\frac{24}{2} = 12$ (correct)  

All intermediate steps and arithmetic operations were performed accurately. The logic follows a clear sequence without gaps or errors. The final result is consistent with the calculations.
