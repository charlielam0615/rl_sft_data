Goal of this step: Find all the proper divisors of 284.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find all the proper divisors of 284, we start by finding all positive integers that divide 284 evenly (excluding 284 itself). A method to do this is to iterate through numbers from 1 to $\sqrt{284}$ and check for divisibility, then list corresponding pairs.  

We start by checking divisibility:  
- 1 divides 284 → 1 and 284  
- 2 divides 284 → 2 and 142  
- 4 divides 284 → 4 and 71  

Since 71 is a prime number, we stop here because any further factors would exceed $\sqrt{284}$.  

Thus, the proper divisors of 284 are: 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.

We calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284:  

$$ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 $$  

So, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

Self-Verification: Critical assessment of the entire solution process for correctness and completeness.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The verification process must critically evaluate all steps. 

1. **Proper Divisors of 284**:  
   - The divisors listed (1, 2, 4, 71, 142) are correct.  
   - Calculation of their sum:  
     $1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220$.  
     This is accurate.  

2. **Proper Divisors of 220**:  
   - Divisors listed (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110) are correct.  
   - Sum calculation:  
     $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284$.  
     This matches the amicable pair property between 220 and 284.  

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The problem asks for the sum of the proper divisors of 220 (derived from the sum of 284's divisors). The result (284) is mathematically correct and aligns with known amicable pair relationships.  

No errors detected in logic, calculations, or final answer.
