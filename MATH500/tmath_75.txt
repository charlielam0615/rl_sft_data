Goal of this step: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when two 6-sided dice are thrown.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Each die has 6 sides, numbered from 1 to 6. When two dice are thrown, each die is independent of the other. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:  

$$
6 \times 6 = 36
$$  

So, there are 36 total possible outcomes.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Identify the outcomes where the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To determine the favorable outcomes, we need to consider when the product of the numbers on the two dice is divisible by 5. A product is divisible by 5 if at least one of the numbers is 5.  

So, we need to count all the outcomes where at least one die shows a 5.  

- If the first die is 5, the second die can be any of the numbers 1 through 6, which gives 6 outcomes: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).  
- If the second die is 5, the first die can be any of the numbers 1 through 6, which gives another 6 outcomes: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).  

However, the outcome (5,5) is counted twice in the above cases, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.  

$$
6 + 6 - 1 = 11
$$  

Therefore, there are 11 outcomes where the product is a multiple of 5.

Goal of this step: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The probability is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:  

$$
\frac{11}{36}
$$  

This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the favorable outcomes count and the probability calculation.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The solution claims there are 11 favorable outcomes where the product is a multiple of 5. Let's re-examine this count by enumerating all possible pairs containing at least one 5:

Pairs with first die = 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) → 6 outcomes.
Pairs with second die = 5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (6,5) → 5 outcomes (excluding (5,5) already counted).

Total unique favorable outcomes: 6 + 5 = 11. This matches the solution's count. 

Next, verify that these 11 outcomes indeed produce products divisible by 5:
- 5*1=5, 5*2=10, 5*3=15, 5*4=20, 5*5=25, 5*6=30 (all divisible by 5).
- 1*5=5, 2*5=10, 3*5=15, 4*5=20, 6*5=30 (all divisible by 5).

No other outcomes (e.g., (5,5)) are double-counted beyond the single overlap correction. The probability calculation (11/36) is accurate and fully simplified since 11 is prime and 36 is not a multiple of 11. All logical steps are consistent and error-free.

The probability is $\boxed{\dfrac{11}{36}}$.
