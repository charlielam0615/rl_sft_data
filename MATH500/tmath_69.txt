Goal of this step: Determine the properties of $ z $ given $ z^5 = 1 $ and $ z \neq 1 $.

[IMP]
Given that $ z^5 = 1 $, we know that $ z $ is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the complex numbers that satisfy the equation $ z^5 = 1 $. These roots are $ 1, z, z^2, z^3, z^4 $, where $ z $ is a primitive 5th root of unity, and $ z \neq 1 $.

The roots can be written in the form $ z = e^{2\pi i k/5} $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 $. Since $ z \neq 1 $, we are looking at $ z = e^{2\pi i/5} $, $ z^2 = e^{4\pi i/5} $, $ z^3 = e^{6\pi i/5} $, and $ z^4 = e^{8\pi i/5} $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the properties of complex roots of unity to simplify the expression $ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The complex number $ z $ satisfies $ z^5 = 1 $, so $ z \neq 1 $ is a primitive 5th root of unity. Since $ z^5 = 1 $, the sum of all 5th roots of unity is 0:
$$
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0.
$$
This gives us the identity:
$$
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.
$$

Now, we simplify $ \frac{1}{z} $ and $ \frac{1}{z^2} $ using the property $ z^5 = 1 $. Since $ z^5 = 1 $, we have $ z^{-1} = z^4 $ and $ z^{-2} = z^3 $. Therefore:
$$
\frac{1}{z} = z^4 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3.
$$

Substituting into the expression, we get:
$$
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
$$

From the earlier identity $ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 $, we directly obtain:
$$
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.
$$

Thus, the value of the expression is $-1$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the logical steps and substitutions used in simplifying the expression $ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Roots of Unity Identity**: The sum $ 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 $ is a standard identity for 5th roots of unity. This is correct because the sum of all $ n $th roots of unity is zero for $ n \geq 2 $. This confirms $ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 $.

2. **Reciprocal Substitutions**: The step $ \frac{1}{z} = z^4 $ and $ \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 $ relies on $ z^5 = 1 $. Since $ z^5 = 1 $, multiplying both sides by $ z^{-1} $ gives $ z^4 = z^{-1} $, and similarly $ z^3 = z^{-2} $. This is valid.

3. **Expression Substitution**: Substituting $ \frac{1}{z} \to z^4 $ and $ \frac{1}{z^2} \to z^3 $ into the original expression yields $ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 $, which is equivalent to $ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 $. This matches the left-hand side of the identity $ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 $, so the conclusion $ -1 $ is correct.

4. **No Omitted Cases**: The solution does not depend on the specific choice of $ z $ (e.g., $ z = e^{2\pi i/5} $) because all non-1 5th roots of unity satisfy the same algebraic relationships. The result is consistent across all such $ z $.

No inconsistencies or errors in reasoning are detected. The critical steps align with established properties of roots of unity, and substitutions are logically valid.
