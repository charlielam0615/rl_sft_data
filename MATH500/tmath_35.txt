We substitute $ n = 2 $ into the expression:  
$$
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = (4)(6)(8).

Goal of this step: Simplify each term modulo 7.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We simplify each term modulo 7:
$$
4 \mod 7 = 4, \quad 6 \mod 7 = 6, \quad 8 \mod 7 = 1.
$$
So the expression becomes:
$$
(4)(6)(1).

Goal of this step: Multiply the simplified terms modulo 7.

[IMP]
We calculate the product modulo 7:
$$
4 \times 6 \times 1 = 24.
$$
Now simplify $ 24 \mod 7 $:
$$
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.
$$
So,
$$
24 \mod 7 = 3.
$$

Goal of this step: Find the remainder when the product is divided by 7.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we found that the product modulo 7 is $ 24 \mod 7 = 3 $.  

Therefore, the remainder when $ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) $ is divided by 7 is $ 3 $.

[VERIFY]
1. **Substitution Check**:  
   Given $ n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $, substituting $ n = 2 $ into $ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) $ yields $ (4)(6)(8) $. This is correct because $ n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $ implies $ n = 7k + 2 $, and the additive constants (2, 4, 6) are directly added to $ n $.

2. **Modulo Simplification Check**:  
   - $ 4 \mod 7 = 4 $: Valid, as 4 < 7.  
   - $ 6 \mod 7 = 6 $: Valid, as 6 < 7.  
   - $ 8 \mod 7 = 1 $: Correct, since $ 8 - 7 = 1 $.  
   The simplified terms $ 4 \times 6 \times 1 $ are accurate.

3. **Multiplication Modulo 7 Check**:  
   - $ 4 \times 6 = 24 $: Correct.  
   - $ 24 \mod 7 = 3 $: Valid, as $ 7 \times 3 = 21 $, and $ 24 - 21 = 3 $.  
   - Final multiplication $ 3 \times 1 = 3 $: Correct.  

4. **Conclusion Check**:  
   The final remainder is 3, which aligns with all steps. No contradictions or errors detected in the reasoning chain. The modular arithmetic operations were applied correctly at each stage.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid.
