Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Substitute the known values into the volume formula.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Given the formula for the volume of a cylinder $ V = \pi r^2 h $, and the known values $ V = 45\pi $ and $ r = 3 $, substitute these into the formula:  

$$ 45\pi = \pi (3)^2 h $$  

Simplify the right-hand side:  

$$ 45\pi = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot h $$  

$$ 45\pi = 9\pi h $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for the unknown height $ h $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve for $ h $, divide both sides of the equation $ 45\pi = 9\pi h $ by $ 9\pi $:  

$$ h = \frac{45\pi}{9\pi} $$  

Simplify the expression:  

$$ h = \frac{45}{9} $$  

$$ h = 5 $$  

Thus, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All steps in solving for the height $ h $, including formula application, substitution, algebraic manipulation, and arithmetic.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Formula correctness**: The volume of a cylinder is $ V = \pi r^2 h $. This is a standard geometric formula and is correctly applied here.  
2. **Substitution accuracy**: The problem states $ V = 45\pi $ and $ r = 3 $. Substituting into the formula:  
   $$ 45\pi = \pi (3)^2 h $$  
   Simplifies to $ 45\pi = 9\pi h $, which is correct.  
3. **Algebraic manipulation**: Dividing both sides by $ 9\pi $:  
   $$ h = \frac{45\pi}{9\pi} = \frac{45}{9} = 5 $$  
   This step is valid because $ \pi \neq 0 $, and the arithmetic $ 45 \div 9 = 5 $ is correct.  
4. **Unit consistency**: The radius is given in centimeters, and the final answer for height is in centimeters, which is consistent.  
5. **Cross-check**: Reversing the calculation: If $ h = 5 $, then $ V = \pi (3)^2 (5) = 45\pi $, matching the given volume.  

No inconsistencies or errors are found in the reasoning or calculations.
