[REVIEW]
The problem states that Denali and Nate are paid for walking dogs. Initially, Denali walks $16$ dogs and Nate walks $12$ dogs. Two scenarios are presented:

1. **Scenario 1:** Denali starts walking $4x$ more dogs, while Nate continues to walk $12$ dogs.
2. **Scenario 2:** $x$ of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.

In both scenarios, the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same. This implies that their pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs they walk. 

The pay ratio is defined as the number of dogs each walks. So we equate the pay ratios under both scenarios:

- Scenario 1 pay ratio: $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} $
- Scenario 2 pay ratio: $ \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $

Since the pay ratios are the same, we set up the equation:
$$
\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x}
$$

What to recall: The derived equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $, which represents the equality of pay ratios under the two scenarios.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The equation to solve is:  
$$
\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x}
$$  
This equation arises from the condition that the pay ratios remain the same under both scenarios, where pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs each person walks.

What to recall: The derived equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $, and the reasoning behind it.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $ was derived based on the condition that Denali's and Nate's pay ratios remain the same in two scenarios:  
1. Denali walks $ 4x $ more dogs while Nate's count remains at $ 12 $.  
2. $ x $ of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.  

In both scenarios, the pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs walked, and the problem states the pay ratios are equal. This led to the equation.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve the equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $, cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:  
$$
(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12)
$$  

Expand both sides:  
Left side:  
$$
(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 16 \cdot 12 - 16x + 4x \cdot 12 - 4x^2 = 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 32x - 4x^2
$$  

Right side:  
$$
(16 + x)(12) = 16 \cdot 12 + x \cdot 12 = 192 + 12x
$$  

Now equate both sides:  
$$
192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x
$$  

Subtract $ 192 $ from both sides:  
$$
32x - 4x^2 = 12x
$$  

Simplify:  
$$
32x - 12x - 4x^2 = 0 \Rightarrow 20x - 4x^2 = 0
$$  

Factor out $ 4x $:  
$$
4x(5 - x) = 0
$$  

Solve for $ x $:  
$$
4x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 5
$$  

Since the problem specifies $ x \neq 0 $, the solution is:  
$$
x = 5
$$

1. **Algebraic Solution Verification**:  
   The equation $ \frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \frac{16 + x}{12 - x} $ was solved by cross-multiplying, expanding, and simplifying. The steps were rechecked:
   - Cross-multiplication: $ (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12) $ → Correct.
   - Expansion: Left side $ 192 + 32x - 4x^2 $, right side $ 192 + 12x $ → Correct.
   - Simplification: $ 32x - 4x^2 = 12x $ → $ 20x - 4x^2 = 0 $ → $ 4x(5 - x) = 0 $ → $ x = 0 $ or $ x = 5 $ → Correct.
   - Exclusion of $ x = 0 $ as per problem constraints → $ x = 5 $.

2. **Pay Ratio Verification**:  
   Substitute $ x = 5 $ into both scenarios:
   - **Scenario 1**: Denali walks $ 16 + 4(5) = 36 $ dogs, Nate walks $ 12 $ dogs. Ratio: $ 36/12 = 3 $.
   - **Scenario 2**: Denali walks $ 16 + 5 = 21 $ dogs, Nate walks $ 12 - 5 = 7 $ dogs. Ratio: $ 21/7 = 3 $.
   Both ratios are equal, confirming the solution satisfies the original condition.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   No errors detected in algebraic steps or substitution. The solution $ x = 5 $ is valid and meets all problem constraints.
