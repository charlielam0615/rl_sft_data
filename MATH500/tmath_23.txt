Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Isolate the square root term in the equation $x = \sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To isolate the square root term, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:  
$$
x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x}
$$  
This simplifies the equation and isolates the square root term.

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Square both sides of the equation $x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x}$ to eliminate the square root.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Squaring both sides of the equation $x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x}$ gives:  
$$
(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x
$$  
Expanding the left-hand side:  
$$
x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x
$$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Bring all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation:  
$$
x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0
$$  
Simplify the terms:  
$$
x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0
$$  
Now, factor the quadratic equation:  
$$
(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0
$$  
This gives the potential solutions $x = 1$ and $x = 5$.

[REVIEW]
I am focusing on verifying the solutions $x = 1$ and $x = 5$ by substituting them back into the original equation $x = \sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check whether the solutions $x = 1$ and $x = 5$ satisfy the original equation $x = \sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
For $x = 1$:  
Left-hand side (LHS): $x = 1$.  
Right-hand side (RHS): $\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 = \sqrt{9} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7$.  
Since $1 \neq 7$, $x = 1$ is **not** a valid solution.  

For $x = 5$:  
LHS: $x = 5$.  
RHS: $\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 = \sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 = \sqrt{1} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5$.  
Since $5 = 5$, $x = 5$ is a valid solution.  

The solution $x = 1$ arises from squaring both sides, which can introduce extraneous roots. Only $x = 5$ satisfies the original equation.

\boxed{correct}
[/VERIFY]
[ANSWER]
The only solution is $x = 5$.
