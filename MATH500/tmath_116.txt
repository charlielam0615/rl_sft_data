Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express both sides of the equation with the same base.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation $ 2^{2x} = 256^\frac{1}{2} $.

First, we express 256 as a power of 2:
$ 256 = 2^8 $.

Therefore, $ 256^\frac{1}{2} = (2^8)^\frac{1}{2} $.

Using the property $ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $, we get:
$ (2^8)^\frac{1}{2} = 2^{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^4 $.

Now, the equation becomes:
$ 2^{2x} = 2^4 $.

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:
$ 2x = 4 $.

Solving for $ x $, we get:
$ x = 2 $.

1. **Conversion of 256 to base 2**:  
   256 is indeed 2^8 since 2^8 = 256. This step is correct.

2. **Application of exponent rule for 256^(1/2)**:  
   (2^8)^(1/2) = 2^(8*(1/2)) = 2^4. This uses the rule (a^m)^n = a^(m*n) correctly. The calculation 8*(1/2) = 4 is valid.

3. **Equating exponents**:  
   After simplifying both sides to 2^{2x} = 2^4, the logic of equating exponents (since the bases are equal) is mathematically sound. This leads to 2x = 4.

4. **Solving for x**:  
   Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 2. This is a basic algebraic step with no errors.

5. **Substitution check**:  
   Substituting x = 2 into the original equation:  
   Left side: 2^(2*2) = 2^4 = 16.  
   Right side: 256^(1/2) = âˆš256 = 16.  
   Both sides are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

No inconsistencies or errors were found in any of the steps. The reasoning is logically consistent, and the final answer satisfies the original equation.
