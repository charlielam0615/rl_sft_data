Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Understand the domain of the function $\log x^2$.
2. Determine the values of $a$ and $b$ for which the domain is $x < a$ or $x > b$.
3. Calculate $a + b$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Understand the domain of the function $\log x^2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The function $\log x^2$ is defined when $x^2 > 0$, since the argument of a logarithm must be positive. Solving $x^2 > 0$ gives $x \neq 0$. Therefore, the domain of $\log x^2$ is all real numbers except $x = 0$, which can be expressed as $x < 0$ or $x > 0$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the values of $ a $ and $ b $ for which the domain is $ x < a $ or $ x > b $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From the previous step, we determined that the domain of $ \log x^2 $ is all real numbers except $ x = 0 $, which can be written as $ x < 0 $ or $ x > 0 $. This matches the structure $ x < a $ or $ x > b $, where $ a = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate $ a + b $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since $ a = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $, the sum $ a + b $ is $ 0 + 0 = 0 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of the solution (domain analysis, parameter identification, sum calculation)
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Domain analysis: The function $\log x^2$ requires $x^2 > 0$. This is true for all $x \neq 0$, correctly identified as $x < 0$ or $x > 0$. The reasoning here is sound.

2. Parameter identification: Matching the domain $x < 0$ or $x > 0$ to the given form $x < a$ or $x > b$ leads to $a = 0$ and $b = 0$. This is correct because the boundary between the two intervals is at $x = 0$, which is excluded from the domain.

3. Sum calculation: $a + b = 0 + 0 = 0$ is a direct and correct arithmetic result.

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No contradictions or errors detected in the reasoning process.
