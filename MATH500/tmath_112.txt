Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The denominator is $2 + \sqrt{3}$, so its conjugate is $2 - \sqrt{3}$. We will multiply both the numerator and the denominator of the expression $\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}}$ by $2 - \sqrt{3}$:

$$
\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2 - \sqrt{3}}
$$

Now compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: $(1+\sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{3})$  
Denominator: $(2 + \sqrt{3})(2 - \sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$

So the denominator simplifies to $1$.  
Now expand the numerator:  

$$
(1)(2 - \sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{2}(2 - \sqrt{3}) = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}
$$

The numerator becomes:  
$$
2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}
$$

Thus, the expression becomes:  
$$
\frac{2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}{1} = 2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert the simplified expression $2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}$ into the form $A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the expression:  
$$
2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}
$$  

We aim to rewrite this in the form $A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})$.  

Group the terms to identify potential factoring:  
$$
= (2 + 2\sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6})
$$  

Factor $2$ out of the first group:  
$$
= 2(1 + \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6})
$$  

Now observe:  
- $A = 2$,  
- $B = 2$,  
- $C = 3$,  
- $D = 6$.  

Thus, the expression is now in the form $A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the expression conversion to the form $A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})$.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
We start with the simplified expression $2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}$. The goal is to verify that this can be rewritten as $A(1+\sqrt{B})-(\sqrt{C}+\sqrt{D})$ with $A=2$, $B=2$, $C=3$, and $D=6$.

1. **Grouping Terms**:  
   The expression is grouped as $(2 + 2\sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6})$.  
   - The positive terms $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$ are correctly grouped together.  
   - The negative terms $-\sqrt{3}$ and $-\sqrt{6}$ are correctly grouped as $-(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6})$.  

2. **Factoring**:  
   Factoring $2$ from $(2 + 2\sqrt{2})$ gives $2(1 + \sqrt{2})$.  
   - This is valid since $2(1) = 2$ and $2(\sqrt{2}) = 2\sqrt{2}$.  

3. **Matching Target Form**:  
   The expression becomes $2(1 + \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6})$, which directly matches the target form with $A=2$, $B=2$, $C=3$, and $D=6$.  

4. **Validation of Parameters**:  
   - $A=2$, $B=2$, $C=3$, and $D=6$ are all positive integers.  
   - The sum $A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13$.  

5. **Consistency Check**:  
   Reconstructing the original expression from the target form:  
   $2(1 + \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}) = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6}$, which matches the simplified expression.  

No inconsistencies or errors are found in the derivation or parameter assignment. The conversion is valid.
