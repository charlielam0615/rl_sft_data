In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal.  

Let's denote the given points as follows:  
A = (5, 3)  
B = (6, 8)  
C = (7, 4)  
D = (x, y)  

Assume that the diagonals are AC and BD.  

1. Calculate the midpoint of diagonal AC.  
Midpoint of AC = $\left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)$  

2. Since the midpoint of diagonal BD must also be (6, 3.5), we can solve for (x, y) using the midpoint formula:  
$$
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
$$  

3. Solve the system of equations:  
$$
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = 3.5
$$  

From the first equation:  
$$
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \Rightarrow 6 + x = 12 \Rightarrow x = 6
$$  

From the second equation:  
$$
\frac{8 + y}{2} = 3.5 \Rightarrow 8 + y = 7 \Rightarrow y = -1
$$  

Thus, the missing coordinate is (6, -1). However, the problem states that $x > 7$, and $x = 6$ does not satisfy this condition.  

Letâ€™s now assume the diagonals are AB and CD.  
1. Calculate the midpoint of diagonal AB:  
$$
\left( \frac{5 + 6}{2}, \frac{3 + 8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
$$  

2. The midpoint of diagonal CD must also be (5.5, 5.5). Solve for (x, y):  
$$
\left( \frac{7 + x}{2}, \frac{4 + y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
$$  

Solving the equations:  
$$
\frac{7 + x}{2} = 5.5 \Rightarrow 7 + x = 11 \Rightarrow x = 4
$$  
$$
\frac{4 + y}{2} = 5.5 \Rightarrow 4 + y = 11 \Rightarrow y = 7
$$  

Thus, the missing coordinate is (4, 7). Again, $x = 4$ does not satisfy $x > 7$.  

Now assume the diagonals are BC and AD.  
1. Calculate the midpoint of diagonal BC:  
$$
\left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, \frac{12}{2} \right) = (6.5, 6)
$$  

2. Solve for (x, y) using the midpoint formula:  
$$
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = (6.5, 6)
$$  

Solving the equations:  
$$
\frac{5 + x}{2} = 6.5 \Rightarrow 5 + x = 13 \Rightarrow x = 8
$$  
$$
\frac{3 + y}{2} = 6 \Rightarrow 3 + y = 12 \Rightarrow y = 9
$$  

Thus, the missing coordinate is (8, 9). This satisfies $x > 7$.  

Now calculate $x + y = 8 + 9 = 17$.

[REVIEW]
I am summarizing the progress of the goals:  
- The properties of a parallelogram (equal midpoints of diagonals) were used to determine the missing coordinate.  
- The midpoint formula was applied to three possible diagonal pairings, and only one solution satisfied the condition $x > 7$.  
- The final missing coordinate is (8, 9), and the sum $x + y = 17$ was computed.

[VERIFY]
1. Diagonal pairing verification:
   - First case (AC & BD): Midpoint of AC correctly calculated as (6, 3.5). Equations for BD's midpoint (6 + x)/2 = 6 and (8 + y)/2 = 3.5 were solved correctly, yielding x=6 and y=-1. The x>7 constraint is violated here.
   
   - Second case (AB & CD): Midpoint of AB correctly calculated as (5.5, 5.5). Equations for CD's midpoint (7 + x)/2 = 5.5 and (4 + y)/2 = 5.5 were solved correctly, yielding x=4 and y=7. The x>7 constraint is violated here.
   
   - Third case (BC & AD): Midpoint of BC correctly calculated as (6.5, 6). Equations for AD's midpoint (5 + x)/2 = 6.5 and (3 + y)/2 = 6 were solved correctly, yielding x=8 and y=9. The x>7 constraint is satisfied here.

2. Calculation verification:
   - For x=8 and y=9: The sum x+y=17 is correctly computed.
   
3. Logical consistency verification:
   - The property that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other was correctly applied.
   - All three possible diagonal pairings were exhaustively tested.
   - Only the third case satisfies the x>7 constraint.

4. Final answer verification:
   - The solution (8,9) forms a valid parallelogram with the given points.
   - All mathematical operations were performed correctly.
   - The conclusion x+y=17 is valid.
   
No errors detected in calculations, logic, or constraint satisfaction.
