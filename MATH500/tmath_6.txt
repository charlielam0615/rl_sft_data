What to recall: The definition of perfect cubes and the formula for the sum of three consecutive integers.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as $n^3$ where $n$ is an integer. The sum of three consecutive integers $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$ can be expressed as $3x + 3$ or $3(x + 1)$.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Set up and solve the equation $3(x + 1) = n^3$ to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We are given that the sum of three consecutive integers is $3(x + 1)$. We want this to be a perfect cube, so we set up the equation:

$$
3(x + 1) = n^3
$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$
x + 1 = \frac{n^3}{3} \Rightarrow x = \frac{n^3}{3} - 1
$$

For $x$ to be an integer, $n^3$ must be divisible by 3. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3$ is divisible by 3 is $n = 3$. Let's test this value.

$$
n = 3 \Rightarrow n^3 = 27
$$

Substitute into the equation:

$$
x = \frac{27}{3} - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
$$

So, the three consecutive integers are $8, 9, 10$, and their sum is:

$$
8 + 9 + 10 = 27
$$

Indeed, $27 = 3^3$, a perfect cube.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check whether 27 is indeed the smallest positive perfect cube expressible as the sum of three consecutive integers, and whether the reasoning is logically sound.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Validity**: The sum of three consecutive integers $x, x+1, x+2$ is correctly calculated as $3x + 3 = 3(x+1)$. Setting this equal to $n^3$ aligns with the problem's requirements.

2. **Divisibility Condition**: For $3(x+1) = n^3$ to hold, $n^3$ must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is prime, $n$ must be divisible by 3. This logic is correct (by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic).

3. **Smallest $n$**: The smallest positive integer $n$ divisible by 3 is $n = 3$, yielding $n^3 = 27$. Substituting back gives $x = 8$, leading to the integers $8, 9, 10$, whose sum is indeed $27$. This is correct.

4. **No Smaller Solutions**: 
   - For $n=1$: $n^3=1$. Solving $3(x+1)=1$ gives $x = -\frac{2}{3}$, which is not an integer.
   - For $n=2$: $n^3=8$. Solving $3(x+1)=8$ gives $x = \frac{5}{3}$, also not an integer.
   - Thus, $n=3$ is the smallest valid value.

5. **Conclusion**: The reasoning is consistent and covers all critical steps. No errors are detected.
