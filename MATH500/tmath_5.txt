Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the side length of the triangle.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal. Given the perimeter of the triangle is 21 inches, we can calculate the side length by dividing the perimeter by 3.

Let $ s $ be the side length of the triangle.
$$ s = \frac{21}{3} $$
$$ s = 7 $$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the side length of the regular hexagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. In this case, the side length of each triangle corresponds to the side length of the hexagon.

Since the side length of the triangle is 7 inches, the side length of the hexagon is also 7 inches.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A regular hexagon has six sides, and all sides are equal in length. Since the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches, the perimeter is six times the side length.

Let $ P $ be the perimeter of the hexagon.
$$ P = 6 \times 7 $$
$$ P = 42 $$

[VERIFY]
1. **Triangle-Hexagon Relationship**: A regular hexagon divided into six equilateral triangles implies each triangle's side corresponds to the hexagon's side. This is valid because the radius of a regular hexagon equals its side length, making all sides of the triangles equal to the hexagon's side. This step is logically sound.

2. **Triangle Side Length Calculation**: The triangle's perimeter is 21 inches. For an equilateral triangle, side length $ s = \frac{21}{3} = 7 $. This arithmetic is correct and aligns with the definition of an equilateral triangle.

3. **Hexagon Side Length Inference**: Since the triangle's side equals the hexagon's side, the hexagon's side length is correctly identified as 7 inches. This follows directly from the geometric relationship described.

4. **Hexagon Perimeter Calculation**: A regular hexagon has six sides, so perimeter $ P = 6 \times 7 = 42 $. The multiplication is accurate, and the conclusion matches the problem's requirements.

All steps are mathematically consistent, and there are no contradictions or errors in the reasoning. The final answer is $\boxed{correct}$.
