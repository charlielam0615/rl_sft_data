Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $6_8$ to base 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$6_8$ in base 8 means $6 \times 8^0$ in base 10. Therefore, $6_8$ equals $6$ in base 10.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $7_8$ to base 10.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$7_8$ in base 8 means $7 \times 8^0$ in base 10. Therefore, $7_8$ equals $7$ in base 10.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Multiply the base 10 equivalents of $6_8$ and $7_8$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The base 10 equivalents are $6$ and $7$. Multiplying them gives:  
$$
6 \cdot 7 = 42
$$

I am focusing on the next step, which is to convert the product $42$ from base 10 to base 8.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Convert $42$ from base 10 to base 8.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To convert $42$ to base 8:  
1. Divide $42$ by $8$:  
   $$
   42 \div 8 = 5 \text{ remainder } 2
   $$  
2. The quotient is $5$ and the remainder is $2$.  
3. Thus, $42$ in base 10 is equal to $52_8$ in base 8.

[VERIFY]
1. **Base 8 to Decimal Conversion:**
   - $6_8 = 6_{10}$: Correct, since a single digit in base 8 equals its decimal value.
   - $7_8 = 7_{10}$: Correct, same reasoning as above.

2. **Multiplication in Decimal:**
   - $6 \times 7 = 42$: Correct arithmetic.

3. **Decimal to Base 8 Conversion:**
   - $42 \div 8 = 5$ remainder $2$: Correct calculation.
   - $52_8$: Valid base 8 representation, as $5 \times 8 + 2 = 42$.

All steps align with mathematical principles and produce consistent results. No contradictions or errors detected.
