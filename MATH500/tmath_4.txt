Based on the given graph, the coordinates for each student are as follows:

1. Evelyn: (1.25, 4.5)
2. Briana: (2.5, 2.2)
3. Carla: (4.25, 5.2)
4. Debra: (5.6, 2.8)
5. Angela: (6.8, 1.4)

Goal of this step: Calculate the average speed for each student using the formula: speed = distance / time.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the coordinates identified for each student, where the x-coordinate represents time and the y-coordinate represents distance, we calculate the average speed for each student as follows:  

1. **Evelyn**:  
   - Time = 1.25 units  
   - Distance = 4.5 units  
   - Speed = $ \frac{4.5}{1.25} = 3.6 $ units per unit time  

2. **Briana**:  
   - Time = 2.5 units  
   - Distance = 2.2 units  
   - Speed = $ \frac{2.2}{2.5} = 0.88 $ units per unit time  

3. **Carla**:  
   - Time = 4.25 units  
   - Distance = 5.2 units  
   - Speed = $ \frac{5.2}{4.25} \approx 1.22 $ units per unit time  

4. **Debra**:  
   - Time = 5.6 units  
   - Distance = 2.8 units  
   - Speed = $ \frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5 $ units per unit time  

5. **Angela**:  
   - Time = 6.8 units  
   - Distance = 1.4 units  
   - Speed = $ \frac{1.4}{6.8} \approx 0.21 $ units per unit time

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Compare the average speeds to determine the student with the greatest average speed.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The calculated average speeds for each student are as follows:  

- Evelyn: 3.6 units per unit time  
- Briana: 0.88 units per unit time  
- Carla: 1.22 units per unit time  
- Debra: 0.5 units per unit time  
- Angela: 0.21 units per unit time  

By comparing these values, the student with the greatest average speed is **Evelyn**.

Scope of this verification: All calculations and comparisons for each student's average speed.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Evelyn's speed calculation**: 4.5 distance / 1.25 time = 3.6. This is correct as 1.25 × 3.6 = 4.5.
2. **Briana's speed calculation**: 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88. Verified by direct division.
3. **Carla's speed calculation**: 5.2 / 4.25 ≈ 1.22. The exact value is 1.2235, so rounding to two decimal places is valid.
4. **Debra's speed calculation**: 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5. Correct as 5.6 × 0.5 = 2.8.
5. **Angela's speed calculation**: 1.4 / 6.8 ≈ 0.21. The exact value is ~0.2059, so rounding to 0.21 is appropriate.
6. **Comparison of speeds**: 3.6 (Evelyn) > 1.22 (Carla) > 0.88 (Briana) > 0.5 (Debra) > 0.21 (Angela). The ranking is accurate.

All calculations and comparisons are mathematically sound. The conclusion that Evelyn has the greatest average speed is correct.
