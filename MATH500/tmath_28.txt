Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Apply the mathematical transformation for a $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise rotation to the given complex number $7 + 2i$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise rotation of a complex number $z = a + bi$ around the origin can be achieved by multiplying $z$ by $i$ (since multiplication by $i$ corresponds to a rotation of $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise in the complex plane).

Given the complex number $7 + 2i$, multiply it by $i$:
$$
(7 + 2i) \cdot i
$$

Using the distributive property:
$$
7i + 2i^2
$$

Recall that $i^2 = -1$, so:
$$
7i + 2(-1) = 7i - 2
$$

Rewriting in standard form $a + bi$:
$$
-2 + 7i
$$

Thus, the resulting complex number after a $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise rotation is $-2 + 7i$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the transformation from multiplying $7 + 2i$ by $i$ to obtain the rotated complex number.

[VERIFY]
1. **Mathematical Transformation Check**:  
   The rotation of a complex number $z = a + bi$ by $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise is defined as $z \cdot i$. Applying this to $7 + 2i$:  
   $$
   (7 + 2i) \cdot i = 7i + 2i^2 = 7i + 2(-1) = -2 + 7i.
   $$  
   This aligns with the known formula for rotation via multiplication by $i$.  

2. **Coordinate Transformation Cross-Check**:  
   The original complex number $7 + 2i$ corresponds to the Cartesian coordinate $(7, 2)$. A $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise rotation transforms $(x, y)$ to $(-y, x)$. Applying this:  
   $$
   (-2, 7) \quad \text{(which maps to the complex number $-2 + 7i$)}.
   $$  
   This matches the result from the algebraic computation.  

3. **Consistency Between Methods**:  
   Both algebraic multiplication by $i$ and geometric coordinate transformation yield the same result, confirming internal consistency.  

No discrepancies are found in the reasoning or calculations. The result is verified as correct.
