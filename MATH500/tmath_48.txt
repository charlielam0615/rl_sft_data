Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Write the equation that represents the problem.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $ x $ be the power of 4 that equals 8. The equation is:
$$ 4^x = 8 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express 8 as a power of 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know that $ 8 = 2^3 $, so the equation becomes:  
$$ 4^x = 2^3 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Express 4 as a power of 2.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We know that $ 4 = 2^2 $, so the equation becomes:  
$$ (2^2)^x = 2^3 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The properties of exponents, particularly the rule $ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The exponent rule $ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $ states that when a power is raised to another power, we multiply the exponents. This is relevant for simplifying the equation $ (2^2)^x = 2^3 $.
[/REVIEW]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the exponent rule to simplify $ (2^2)^x = 2^3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Applying the rule $ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:  
$$ 2^{2x} = 2^3 $$
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve for $ x $ in the equation $ 2^{2x} = 2^3 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore:  
$$ 2x = 3 $$  
Solving for $ x $:  
$$ x = \frac{3}{2} $$

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: All critical aspects of solving $ 4^x = 8 $, including equation setup, exponent conversions, application of exponent rules, and algebraic solving.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Setup**: The problem asks for the power of 4 equal to 8. Defining $ 4^x = 8 $ is correct.  
2. **Expressing 8 as $ 2^3 $**: Valid, as $ 2^3 = 8 $.  
3. **Expressing 4 as $ 2^2 $**: Valid, as $ 2^2 = 4 $.  
4. **Exponent Rule Application**: $ (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} $ is correct per the rule $ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $.  
5. **Equating Exponents**: Since $ 2^{2x} = 2^3 $, equating $ 2x = 3 $ is valid for identical bases.  
6. **Solving for $ x $**: $ x = \frac{3}{2} $ follows logically.  
7. **Back-Substitution Check**: $ 4^{3/2} = (2^2)^{3/2} = 2^{3} = 8 $, confirming correctness.  

All steps are logically consistent and mathematically valid. No errors detected.  
\boxed{correct}
