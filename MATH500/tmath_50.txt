Goal of this step: Determine the total number of coins after redistributing.

Let's denote the number of coins in each of the original seven bags as $ x $. The total number of coins before finding the additional bag is $ 7x $. After finding the additional bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins becomes $ 7x + 53 $.

We are told that all eight bags have the same number of coins after redistribution, and the total number of coins is more than 200. Let's denote the number of coins in each of the eight bags after redistribution as $ y $. Thus, the total number of coins after redistribution is $ 8y $.

We are given the equation:
$$ 7x + 53 = 8y $$

We need to find the smallest integer value of $ x $ such that $ 8y $ is greater than 200. Let's solve for $ y $ in terms of $ x $:
$$ y = \frac{7x + 53}{8} $$

We want $ y $ to be an integer, so $ 7x + 53 $ must be divisible by 8. Let's solve for the smallest $ x $ that satisfies this condition.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Find the smallest integer $ x $ such that $ 7x + 53 $ is divisible by 8 and $ 8y > 200 $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We need $ 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} $. Simplify the equation modulo 8:  
$$ 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} $$  
Since $ 7 \equiv -1 \pmod{8} $, we rewrite it as:  
$$ -x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} $$  
$$ -x \equiv -53 \pmod{8} $$  
$$ x \equiv 53 \pmod{8} $$  

Now, compute $ 53 \mod 8 $:  
$$ 53 \div 8 = 6 \text{ remainder } 5 $$  
Thus:  
$$ x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} $$  

So, the smallest $ x $ satisfying this congruence is $ x = 5 $. But we need to ensure the total coins $ 8y = 7x + 53 $ is greater than 200. Let's start checking values of $ x $ congruent to 5 modulo 8 to find the smallest valid $ x $:  

- Try $ x = 5 $:  
  $ 7x + 53 = 35 + 53 = 88 $, and $ 88 < 200 $. Not valid.  

- Try $ x = 13 $:  
  $ 7x + 53 = 91 + 53 = 144 $, and $ 144 < 200 $. Not valid.  

- Try $ x = 21 $:  
  $ 7x + 53 = 147 + 53 = 200 $, and $ 200 \not> 200 $. Not valid.  

- Try $ x = 29 $:  
  $ 7x + 53 = 203 + 53 = 256 $, and $ 256 > 200 $. Valid.  

So, the smallest $ x $ is $ 29 $.

[REVIEW]
I am focusing on the current subgoal: finding the smallest integer $ x $ such that $ 7x + 53 $ is divisible by 8 and $ 8y > 200 $. The solution suggests that $ x = 29 $ is the smallest value satisfying these conditions. The next step is to track progress and prepare for verification.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The conditions of the problem and the values derived so far.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
The problem states that there are initially seven bags with $ x $ coins each, and a new bag of 53 coins is added, making a total of $ 7x + 53 $ coins. After redistribution, these coins are evenly distributed into eight bags, so $ 7x + 53 $ must be divisible by 8. Additionally, the total number of coins must be greater than 200.  

The smallest $ x $ that satisfies these conditions is $ x = 29 $, which results in $ 7x + 53 = 256 $, and $ 256 \div 8 = 32 $, meaning each of the eight bags has 32 coins.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check the correctness of the solution for x=29, the total coins calculation, and the satisfaction of all problem constraints.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Equation Validation**:  
   The equation $ 7x + 53 = 8y $ is correctly derived from the problem statement. For $ x = 29 $:  
   $ 7(29) + 53 = 203 + 53 = 256 $.  
   Dividing $ 256 $ by $ 8 $ gives $ y = 32 $, which is an integer. This confirms divisibility.  

2. **Constraint Check (Total Coins > 200)**:  
   $ 256 > 200 $, satisfying the requirement.  

3. **Smallest $ x $ Verification**:  
   - $ x = 5 $: $ 7(5) + 53 = 88 $ (invalid, <200).  
   - $ x = 13 $: $ 7(13) + 53 = 144 $ (invalid, <200).  
   - $ x = 21 $: $ 7(21) + 53 = 200 $ (invalid, not >200).  
   - $ x = 29 $: $ 7(29) + 53 = 256 $ (valid).  
   No smaller $ x $ in the sequence $ x \equiv 5 \mod 8 $ satisfies the constraints.  

4. **Original Problem Mapping**:  
   The problem asks for the original number of coins ($ 7x $) before adding the 53-coin bag. For $ x = 29 $:  
   $ 7 \times 29 = 203 $. This aligns with the solution.  

All steps are logically consistent, and all constraints are satisfied. The solution is valid.
