Goal of this step: Use the identity for the tangent of the sum of angles to simplify the equation.

[IMP]
The identity for the tangent of the sum of angles is $\tan(a + b) = \frac{\tan a + \tan b}{1 - \tan a \tan b}$. However, in this case, we have a product of tangents equal to the sum of the same tangents. This is a specific case that can be recognized as the identity for the tangent of the sum of three angles, where the sum of the angles is $180^\circ$ because $\tan(180^\circ) = 0$.

Let's denote $\tan 53^\circ$ as $A$, $\tan 81^\circ$ as $B$, and $\tan x^\circ$ as $C$. The equation becomes $A \cdot B \cdot C = A + B + C$.

Given that $\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan x^\circ$, we can directly infer that $x^\circ$ must be such that the sum of the angles $53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$.

Solving for $x^\circ$, we have:
$$53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$$
$$134^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$$
$$x^\circ = 180^\circ - 134^\circ$$
$$x^\circ = 46^\circ$$

Therefore, the value of $x$ is $46^\circ$.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Verify the correctness of the identity used and the derived solution for $ x $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The solution hinges on the identity $ \tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C $ when $ A + B + C = 180^\circ $. This identity is valid for angles of a triangle (i.e., when $ A + B + C = 180^\circ $) because $ \tan(A + B + C) $ is undefined (as $ 180^\circ $ is a multiple of $ \pi $), and the identity arises from the tangent addition formula extended to three angles. 

To verify this:
1. **Check the identity**: For $ A + B + C = 180^\circ $, rearrange $ \tan(A + B + C) = 0 $. Using the tangent addition formula iteratively for three angles, the numerator simplifies to $ \tan A + \tan B + \tan C - \tan A \tan B \tan C $, which equals zero. Hence, $ \tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C $.
2. **Check angle sum**: $ 53^\circ + 81^\circ + 46^\circ = 180^\circ $, satisfying the identity's condition.
3. **Check uniqueness**: Within $ 0 < x < 180 $, $ x = 46^\circ $ is the only solution because adding 180° to 46° would exceed the domain.

No contradictions or errors are found in the reasoning. The identity is correctly applied, and the derived solution satisfies all conditions.
