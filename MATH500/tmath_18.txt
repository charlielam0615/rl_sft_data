In the diagram, we are given that segment $\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through point $A$, and $AB = BC$. From the diagram, we see that point $A$ is at the top of a vertical segment, and points $B$ and $C$ lie on the base of the diagram. The angle at point $A$, labeled as $124^\circ$, is an obtuse angle.

Since $\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, and we know that $AB$ connects point $A$ to point $B$, we can consider triangle $ABC$ to be isosceles with $AB = BC$. This is a key observation, as in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal.

The angle at point $A$ is $124^\circ$, which is an exterior angle of triangle $ABC$. The property of exterior angles in a triangle states that the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, the sum of the angles at points $B$ and $C$ is $124^\circ$.

Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB = BC$, the base angles at $B$ and $C$ are equal. Let the measure of each base angle be $x^\circ$. Then we have:

$$2x = 124$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = \frac{124}{2} = 62$$

Therefore, the measure of each base angle, and hence the value of $x$, is $62^\circ$.

To solve the problem, we interpret the given geometric configuration carefully. The triangle is defined with the property that **AB = BC** and **the angle at vertex A is 124 degrees**. The question is to determine the value of angle **x**, which is marked at the base of the triangle — specifically at vertex **B**.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Triangle

- **AB = BC** → This tells us that triangle **ABC** is **isosceles**, with sides **AB** and **BC** being equal.
- Therefore, the **angles opposite** these equal sides must also be equal.
  - That is, **∠A = ∠C**.

---

### Step 2: Applying the Exterior Angle Theorem

- The **124° angle at vertex A** is **not** the interior angle of the triangle. It is the **angle between side AB and a horizontal line** through point A.
- Since **BC is horizontal**, and the line through A is also horizontal, these two lines are **parallel**.
- **AB is a transversal** that intersects both the horizontal line and BC.
- This creates **alternate interior angles** — the angle at vertex A between AB and the horizontal line is equal to the **interior angle at vertex B** between AB and BC.

So, we can **conclude**:
- The **interior angle at vertex B is 124°**.

---

### Step 3: Using the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem

- The sum of the interior angles of triangle **ABC** is **180°**.
- From earlier: **∠B = 124°**, and **AB = BC**, so **∠A = ∠C**.
- Let each of ∠A and ∠C be **x**.

Now, we can set up the equation:
$$
x + x + 124° = 180°
\Rightarrow 2x = 56°
\Rightarrow x = 28°
$$

So, **∠A = ∠C = 28°**, and **∠B = 124°**.

---

### Step 4: Determining the Value of x

- The problem asks for the value of **x**, which is **labeled at the base** of the triangle — that is, **at vertex B**.
- As computed above, **∠B = 124°**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{124}

1. **Triangle Configuration**:  
   - The problem states AB = BC and that BC is parallel to the horizontal line through A.  
   - In triangle ABC, AB = BC implies it is isosceles with AB = BC.  
   - The base angles (opposite equal sides) should be at A and C.  

2. **Angle at A**:  
   - The 124° angle at A is between AB and the horizontal line through A. This is **not** the interior angle of triangle ABC but an **exterior angle** formed by AB and the horizontal line.  
   - By the **alternate interior angles theorem**, the angle between AB and BC at B is also 124°, as BC is parallel to the horizontal line.  
   - Therefore, **angle at B = 124°**, and this is the interior angle of triangle ABC.  

3. **Triangle Angle Sum**:  
   - In triangle ABC, angles at A and C are equal (since AB = BC).  
   - Let angles at A and C be $ x $. Then:  
     $$
     x + x + 124° = 180° \Rightarrow 2x = 56° \Rightarrow x = 28°
     $$  
   - This means **∠A = ∠C = 28°**, and **∠B = 124°**.  

4. **Labeling of x**:  
   - The problem specifies that x is the angle labeled at the base of the diagram. In the Asymptote code, x is located at (4.5, 3), which lies on the horizontal line through A. This aligns with the **124° angle at A** between AB and the horizontal line.  

5. **Consistency Check**:  
   - The alternate interior angles logic ensures angle at B = 124°.  
   - The triangle angle sum confirms angles at A and C are 28°.  
   - The labeling of x at the horizontal line through A confirms x = 124°.  

**Conclusion**: The solution correctly identifies the 124° angle at B as the interior angle of triangle ABC, applies triangle properties, and aligns with the diagram's labeling.

[VERIFY]
1. **Triangle Configuration**:  
   - AB = BC implies triangle ABC is isosceles with base AC.  
   - The equal sides (AB = BC) mean the base angles at A and C are equal.  

2. **Angle at A (124°)**:  
   - The 124° angle is between AB and the horizontal line through A. Since BC is parallel to this horizontal line, the angle between AB and BC at B is also 124° (alternate interior angles).  
   - This makes the interior angle at B = 124°.  

3. **Triangle Angle Sum**:  
   - Sum of interior angles in triangle ABC: 180°.  
   - ∠B = 124°, so ∠A + ∠C = 56°. Since ∠A = ∠C (isosceles triangle), each is 28°.  

4. **Labeling of x**:  
   - The problem explicitly labels x at the horizontal line through A (Asymptote code: (4.5, 3)). This is the 124° angle between AB and the horizontal line, which is the **exterior angle at A**.  
   - The exterior angle at A (124°) equals the interior angle at B (124°), confirming consistency.  

5. **Critical Alignment**:  
   - The solution correctly identifies the exterior angle at A as 124°, which is the same as the interior angle at B due to parallel lines and transversal AB.  
   - The triangle's angle sum and isosceles property are applied correctly.
