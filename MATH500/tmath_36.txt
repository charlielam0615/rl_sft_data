The equation is $(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$ 

Let $ a = x - 3 $ and $ b = x - 7 $. Then the left-hand side becomes $ a^3 + b^3 $, and the right-hand side is $ (a + b)^3 $, since $ a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10 $.

Using the identity $ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 $, we observe that the equation becomes an identity because both sides are equal. This identity is valid only when $ ab = 0 $, i.e., when either $ a = 0 $ or $ b = 0 $.

Thus, we solve for $ a = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $:
1. $ x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3 $
2. $ x - 7 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 7 $

Therefore, the roots of the equation are $ x = 3 $ and $ x = 7 $.

The solution incorrectly applied the identity $ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 $, which is mathematically invalid except in trivial cases. The correct identity is $ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) $, and $ (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 $. Equating $ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 $ implies $ 3a^2b + 3ab^2 = 0 $, i.e., $ ab(a + b) = 0 $, which is not equivalent to $ ab = 0 $ as claimed. This leads to an incomplete solution.  

Testing $ x = 3 $:  
Left: $ (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64 $.  
Right: $ (2(3)-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64 $. Valid.  

Testing $ x = 7 $:  
Left: $ (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3 = 4^3 + 0 = 64 $.  
Right: $ (2(7)-10)^3 = 4^3 = 64 $. Valid.  

Testing $ x = 5 $:  
Left: $ (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 - 8 = 0 $.  
Right: $ (2(5)-10)^3 = 0^3 = 0 $. Valid.  

The correct roots are $ x = 3, 5, 7 $. The original reasoning missed $ x = 5 $ due to incorrect identity usage.

1. Correctly expand each term of the equation using binomial expansion.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Expand each term of the equation using binomial expansion.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We start with the equation:  
$$
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3
$$

### Step 1: Expand each cube  
Using the binomial expansion:  
- $ (x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 $  
- $ (x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343 $  
- $ (2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - 3(2x)^2(10) + 3(2x)(10)^2 - (10)^3 $  
  $ = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000 $

### Step 2: Add the expanded left-hand side  
$$
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)
$$  
$$
= 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370
$$

### Step 3: Write the full equation  
$$
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
$$

### Step 4: Bring all terms to one side to form a polynomial  
$$
(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370) - (8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000) = 0
$$  
$$
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0
$$  
$$
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0
$$

### Step 5: Simplify the polynomial  
Divide through by -6:  
$$
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0
$$

Now we have the simplified cubic equation:  
$$
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0
$$
