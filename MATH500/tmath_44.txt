[REVIEW]
I am currently focusing on the overall structure of the problem and the steps required to solve it. The next step is to analyze the net displacement in the south and east directions.

Recall Info (Review)
What to recall: The distances Bill walked in each direction.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Bill walked $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. Therefore, the net distance he walked south is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$ mile, and the distance east is $\frac{3}{4}$ mile. These represent the legs of a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being the direct distance from the starting point.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the direct distance from the starting point using the Pythagorean theorem.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To calculate the direct distance from the starting point, we treat the net displacements as the legs of a right triangle. The net southward displacement is 1 mile, and the eastward displacement is $\frac{3}{4}$ mile.  

Using the Pythagorean theorem:  
$$
\text{Direct distance} = \sqrt{(\text{southward displacement})^2 + (\text{eastward displacement})^2}
$$  
$$
\text{Direct distance} = \sqrt{(1)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2}
$$  
$$
\text{Direct distance} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{9}{16}}
$$  
$$
\text{Direct distance} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{16}} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \text{ miles}
$$

[VERIFY]
1. **Net displacements**:  
   - Southward: $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 $ mile (correct).  
   - Eastward: $ \frac{3}{4} $ mile (correct).  

2. **Pythagorean theorem application**:  
   - Formula: $ \sqrt{(\text{south})^2 + (\text{east})^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} $.  
   - Calculation:  
     $ 1^2 = 1 $,  
     $ \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{16} $,  
     Sum: $ 1 + \frac{9}{16} = \frac{25}{16} $,  
     Square root: $ \sqrt{\frac{25}{16}} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 $.  

3. **Final answer formatting**:  
   - $ 1.25 $ is already to the nearest hundredth (no rounding error).  

All steps align with the problem's requirements. No inconsistencies or errors detected.
