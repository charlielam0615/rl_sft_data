Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Recall the mathematical rule for dividing by a fraction.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
When dividing by a fraction, the rule is to multiply by its reciprocal.  
That is, for any number $ a $ divided by a fraction $ \frac{b}{c} $, the result is $ a \times \frac{c}{b} $.  

Applying this to the given problem:  
To divide $10$ by $ \frac{2}{3} $, we multiply $10$ by the reciprocal of $ \frac{2}{3} $, which is $ \frac{3}{2} $.  

Thus, the number by which 10 should be multiplied is $ \frac{3}{2} $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the rule "divide by a fraction by multiplying by its reciprocal" and its application to 10 ÷ 2/3.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. **Rule validation**: The mathematical principle "dividing by a fraction equals multiplying by its reciprocal" is a fundamental arithmetic rule. For example, 4 ÷ (1/2) = 4 × 2 = 8, which is correct. This confirms the rule is valid.  
2. **Application to the problem**:  
   - Given 10 ÷ (2/3), applying the rule requires multiplying 10 by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2.  
   - Calculation: 10 × (3/2) = (10×3)/2 = 30/2 = 15.  
   - Cross-check: If 10 ÷ (2/3) = 15, then 15 × (2/3) should equal 10. 15 × (2/3) = 30/3 = 10, which is correct.  
3. **Conclusion**: The reasoning aligns with both the rule and numerical verification.  
\boxed{correct}
