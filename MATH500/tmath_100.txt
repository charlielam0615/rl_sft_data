[IMP]
A cyclic hexagon is a hexagon where all its vertices lie on a single circle. In a cyclic polygon, the sum of the measures of opposite angles is equal to 180 degrees. 

For a cyclic hexagon $ABCDEF$, the following property holds:
$$ \angle A + \angle C + \angle E = \angle B + \angle D + \angle F = 540^\circ $$

This is because the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $ (6-2) \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ $, and since the hexagon is cyclic, the sum is evenly split among the two sets of three opposite angles.

Given:
- $ \angle B = 110^\circ $
- $ \angle F = 105^\circ $
- $ \angle D = \alpha $

We can use the property of the cyclic hexagon to find $ \alpha $.

From the cyclic hexagon property, we know:  
$$ \angle B + \angle D + \angle F = 540^\circ $$  

Substituting the known values:  
$$ 110^\circ + \alpha + 105^\circ = 540^\circ $$  

Simplify the equation:  
$$ 215^\circ + \alpha = 540^\circ $$  

Solving for $ \alpha $:  
$$ \alpha = 540^\circ - 215^\circ $$  
$$ \alpha = 325^\circ $$

The critical error lies in the cyclic hexagon angle sum property. For any cyclic polygon with an even number of sides, the sum of every other angle must equal half the total interior angle sum. For a hexagon, total interior angles are (6-2)×180°=720°, so each alternating angle group (A+C+E and B+D+F) should sum to 720°÷2=360°, not 540° as previously claimed. 

Using the correct sum of 360° for B+D+F:
110° (angle B) + α (angle D) + 105° (angle F) = 360°
215° + α = 360°
α = 360° - 215° = 145°

This contradicts the initial calculation of 325°, which violated basic geometric principles. The error originated from misapplying the cyclic polygon properties. The conclusion that α=325° is therefore invalid.

The initial error stemmed from misapplying the cyclic hexagon angle sum property. For a cyclic hexagon, the sum of **every other** interior angle (i.e., alternating angles) must equal half the total interior angle sum. The total interior angles of a hexagon are calculated as:  
$$
(6 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
$$  
For a cyclic hexagon, the sum of three non-consecutive angles (e.g., $ \angle B + \angle D + \angle F $) must equal **360°**, not 540° as previously claimed. This is because the alternating angles split the total sum evenly.  

Given $ \angle B = 110^\circ $, $ \angle F = 105^\circ $, and $ \angle D = \alpha $, the corrected equation becomes:  
$$
110^\circ + \alpha + 105^\circ = 360^\circ
$$  
$$
215^\circ + \alpha = 360^\circ
$$  
$$
\alpha = 360^\circ - 215^\circ = 145^\circ
$$  
This result satisfies the geometric constraints of a cyclic hexagon. The previous conclusion of $ 325^\circ $ violated the fundamental angle sum property of cyclic polygons. The revised calculation aligns with the corrected property and ensures the total interior angles sum to $ 720^\circ $.
