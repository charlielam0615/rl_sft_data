The given equation is  
$$
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}.
$$  
The denominator on the right-hand side can be factored:  
$$
x^2 + 5x - 24 = (x+8)(x-3).
$$  
This matches the denominator of the left-hand side when combining the two terms over a common denominator:  
$$
\frac{C(x+8) + D(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{4x - 23}{(x+8)(x-3)}.
$$  
Since the denominators are equal, we can now equate the numerators:  
$$
C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23.
$$  
Expand the left-hand side:  
$$
Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23.
$$  
Group like terms:  
$$
(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23.
$$  
Now, set up the system of equations by equating the coefficients of $ x $ and the constant terms:  
1. $ C + D = 4 $,  
2. $ 8C - 3D = -23 $.

Goal of this step: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $ C $ and $ D $.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have the system of equations:  
1. $ C + D = 4 $,  
2. $ 8C - 3D = -23 $.  

From the first equation, solve for $ C $:  
$$
C = 4 - D.
$$  

Substitute $ C = 4 - D $ into the second equation:  
$$
8(4 - D) - 3D = -23.
$$  
Simplify the left-hand side:  
$$
32 - 8D - 3D = -23.
$$  
Combine like terms:  
$$
32 - 11D = -23.
$$  
Solve for $ D $:  
$$
-11D = -23 - 32 = -55 \quad \Rightarrow \quad D = \frac{-55}{-11} = 5.
$$  

Now substitute $ D = 5 $ into the first equation to find $ C $:  
$$
C + 5 = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = 4 - 5 = -1.
$$  

Thus, $ C = -1 $ and $ D = 5 $.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check correctness of solving the system of equations and the final values of $ C $ and $ D $.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Verifying the system of equations:
   - From $ C + D = 4 $ and $ 8C - 3D = -23 $, solving yields $ C = -1 $, $ D = 5 $.  
   - Substituting back:  
     $ C + D = -1 + 5 = 4 $ ✓  
     $ 8C - 3D = 8(-1) - 3(5) = -8 -15 = -23 $ ✓  

2. Verifying the original equation with $ C = -1 $, $ D = 5 $:  
   Left-hand side:  
   $$
   \frac{-1}{x-3} + \frac{5}{x+8} = \frac{-1(x+8) + 5(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{-x -8 +5x -15}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{4x -23}{(x-3)(x+8)}
   $$  
   Matches the right-hand side ✓  

3. Product $ CD = (-1)(5) = -5 $ is consistent with the solution.  

All steps are logically consistent and algebraically correct.
