Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Understand the direction of spinning (clockwise or counterclockwise).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The figure skater begins to spin to her right. Spinning to the right means she is spinning clockwise.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the number of full 360-degree rotations in 2250 degrees.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To find the number of full rotations, divide 2250 degrees by 360 degrees:  
$$ 2250 \div 360 = 6.25 $$  
This means the skater completes 6 full rotations and has an additional 0.25 of a rotation.
[/IMP]

[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Calculate the remaining degrees after full rotations.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A full rotation is 360 degrees. The skater spins 2250 degrees. To find the remaining degrees after 6 full rotations, calculate:  
$$ 2250 - (6 \times 360) = 2250 - 2160 = 90 $$  
The skater has an additional 90 degrees to spin after 6 full rotations.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the final direction based on the remaining degrees.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The skater is facing north initially and spins clockwise. A clockwise rotation of 90 degrees from north results in her facing east.  
Thus, after spinning 2250 degrees, the skater is facing east.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Confirm the correctness of the final direction calculation based on remaining degrees.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The critical steps to verify are:  
1. **Rotation direction**: Spinning to the right (clockwise) is correctly established.  
2. **Remaining degrees**: 2250° - (6×360°) = 90° is mathematically accurate.  
3. **Direction mapping**: A 90° clockwise rotation from north (initial direction) should result in east.  
   - Clockwise rotation sequence:  
     - 0°: North  
     - 90°: East  
     - 180°: South  
     - 270°: West  
     - 360°: North (full rotation).  
   - 90° aligns with the "East" direction in this sequence.  
4. **Final conclusion**: The logic consistently follows the rotation rules and arithmetic.  
No contradictions or errors are detected in the reasoning chain. The final direction "east" is correctly derived.  
\boxed{correct}

[ANSWER]
The figure skater is facing east when she finishes her spin.
