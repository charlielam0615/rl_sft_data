Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Determine the coordinates of points $ A $ and $ B $ that maximize the slope.

The slope of a line through points $ A = (x_1, y_1) $ and $ B = (x_2, y_2) $ is given by the formula:  
$$
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
To maximize the slope, we want to maximize the numerator $ y_2 - y_1 $ and minimize the denominator $ x_2 - x_1 $.  

Given that:  
- Point $ A $ lies within or on the square with opposite corners at $ (0,0) $ and $ (2,2) $, so $ 0 \leq x_1 \leq 2 $ and $ 0 \leq y_1 \leq 2 $.  
- Point $ B $ lies within or on the square with opposite corners at $ (4,2) $ and $ (5,3) $, so $ 4 \leq x_2 \leq 5 $ and $ 2 \leq y_2 \leq 3 $.  

To maximize $ y_2 - y_1 $, we choose the maximum possible value of $ y_2 $ and the minimum possible value of $ y_1 $. That is:  
- $ y_2 = 3 $ (maximum for $ B $)  
- $ y_1 = 0 $ (minimum for $ A $)  

To minimize $ x_2 - x_1 $, we choose the minimum possible value of $ x_2 $ and the maximum possible value of $ x_1 $. That is:  
- $ x_2 = 4 $ (minimum for $ B $)  
- $ x_1 = 2 $ (maximum for $ A $)  

Thus, the maximum slope is:  
$$
\text{slope} = \frac{3 - 0}{4 - 2} = \frac{3}{2}
$$

Subgoal Breakdown (Planning)
1. Analyze whether the chosen points $ A = (2, 0) $ and $ B = (4, 3) $ indeed yield the maximum slope.  
2. Consider alternative coordinate choices for $ A $ and $ B $ to ensure the maximum slope is not missed.  
3. Perform a self-verification to confirm the correctness of the reasoning.

Self-Verification (Verification)
Scope of this verification: Check whether choosing points $ A = (2, 0) $ and $ B = (4, 3) $ truly yields the maximum slope, and whether alternative configurations could produce a higher value.
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
The reasoning claims that the maximum slope occurs when $ y_2 - y_1 $ is maximized (i.e., $ y_2 = 3 $, $ y_1 = 0 $) and $ x_2 - x_1 $ is minimized (i.e., $ x_2 = 4 $, $ x_1 = 2 $). Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Numerator Maximization**:  
   - The maximum $ y_2 $ for point $ B $ is 3 (top of its square).  
   - The minimum $ y_1 $ for point $ A $ is 0 (bottom of its square).  
   - Thus, $ y_2 - y_1 = 3 - 0 = 3 $, which is indeed the largest possible difference in $ y $-coordinates.  

2. **Denominator Minimization**:  
   - The minimum $ x_2 $ for point $ B $ is 4 (left edge of its square).  
   - The maximum $ x_1 $ for point $ A $ is 2 (right edge of its square).  
   - Thus, $ x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 2 = 2 $, which is the smallest possible difference in $ x $-coordinates.  

3. **Slope Calculation**:  
   - $ \text{slope} = \frac{3}{2} $.  

**Edge Case Analysis**:  
- If point $ B $ is at $ (4, 3) $ and point $ A $ is at $ (2, 0) $, the slope is $ \frac{3}{2} $.  
- If point $ B $ is at $ (5, 3) $ and point $ A $ is at $ (0, 0) $, the slope is $ \frac{3 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{3}{5} $, which is smaller.  
- If point $ B $ is at $ (4, 2) $ and point $ A $ is at $ (2, 2) $, the slope is $ \frac{2 - 2}{4 - 2} = 0 $, which is smaller.  
- If point $ B $ is at $ (4, 3) $ and point $ A $ is at $ (2, 2) $, the slope is $ \frac{3 - 2}{4 - 2} = \frac{1}{2} $, still smaller.  

**Conclusion**:  
The configuration $ A = (2, 0) $, $ B = (4, 3) $ achieves the maximum possible slope of $ \frac{3}{2} $. All alternative configurations either reduce the numerator or increase the denominator, resulting in a smaller slope. The reasoning is logically consistent and accounts for all constraints.
