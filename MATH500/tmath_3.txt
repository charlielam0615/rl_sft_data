Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Factorize 196 into its prime factors.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To factorize 196, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. $ 196 \div 2 = 98 $
2. $ 98 \div 2 = 49 $

Now we try dividing 49 by 2, but it does not divide evenly. The next prime number is 3, which also does not divide 49 evenly. The next prime number is 7, and $ 49 \div 7 = 7 $.

So, the prime factorization of 196 is $ 2^2 \times 7^2 $.

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Use the prime factorization to calculate the number of positive whole-number divisors.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The formula to calculate the number of positive divisors of a number from its prime factorization $ n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} $ is:  

$$
(e_1 + 1) \times (e_2 + 1) \times \ldots \times (e_k + 1)
$$

From the previous step, the prime factorization of 196 is $ 2^2 \times 7^2 $. Using the formula:

$$
(2 + 1) \times (2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9
$$

So, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.

Scope of this verification: All steps in calculating the number of positive divisors of 196
[/PLANNING]
[VERIFY]
1. Prime factorization verification:
   - 196 ÷ 2 = 98
   - 98 ÷ 2 = 49
   - 49 ÷ 7 = 7
   - 7 ÷ 7 = 1
   This confirms 196 = 2² × 7²

2. Divisor formula verification:
   The formula (e₁+1)(e₂+1)...(eₙ+1) is standard for counting divisors from prime factorization. For 2²×7², this gives (2+1)(2+1)=9.

3. Direct enumeration verification:
   Listing all possible divisors by combining exponents:
   - 2⁰×7⁰ = 1
   - 2⁰×7¹ = 7
   - 2⁰×7² = 49
   - 2¹×7⁰ = 2
   - 2¹×7¹ = 14
   - 2¹×7² = 98
   - 2²×7⁰ = 4
   - 2²×7¹ = 28
   - 2²×7² = 196
   Total = 9 distinct positive divisors

All verification methods consistently show 9 positive divisors. No contradictions or errors detected in calculations or logic.
