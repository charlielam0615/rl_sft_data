Goal of this step: Square both sides of the equation $\sqrt{3x-5}=2$ to eliminate the square root.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Squaring both sides of the equation yields:
$$
(\sqrt{3x-5})^2 = 2^2
$$
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Solve the resulting linear equation $3x - 5 = 4$ for $x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
To solve $3x - 5 = 4$, add 5 to both sides:
$$
3x = 9
$$
Then divide both sides by 3:
$$
x = 3
$$

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Goal of this step: Verify the solution $x = 3$ by substituting it back into the original equation $\sqrt{3x-5}=2$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Substitute $x = 3$ into the original equation:
$$
\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{9 - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2
$$
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that $x = 3$ satisfies the original equation.

[VERIFY]
1. **Squaring both sides**:  
   Original equation: $\sqrt{3x-5}=2$.  
   Squaring both sides: $(\sqrt{3x-5})^2 = 2^2 \implies 3x - 5 = 4$.  
   This step is valid because squaring preserves equality when both sides are non-negative, which they are here (LHS is a square root ≥ 0, RHS is 2 ≥ 0).  

2. **Solving the linear equation**:  
   $3x - 5 = 4 \implies 3x = 9 \implies x = 3$.  
   Algebraic steps are correct: adding 5 to both sides and dividing by 3 are valid operations.  

3. **Verification in original equation**:  
   Substituting $x = 3$ into $\sqrt{3x-5}$:  
   $\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{9 - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2$.  
   This matches the RHS (2), confirming validity.  

4. **Extraneous solution check**:  
   Squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, the solution $x = 3$ satisfies the domain requirement $3x - 5 \geq 0$ (i.e., $x \geq \frac{5}{3}$) and the original equation. No extraneous solutions exist here.  

All steps are logically consistent, algebraically sound, and verified.
