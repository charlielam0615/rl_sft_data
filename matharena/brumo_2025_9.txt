### Problem Statement
We need to determine how many positive integer divisors of \( 63^{10} \) do not end in the digit 1. This is a number theory problem that involves finding the total number of divisors of \( 63^{10} \), identifying which of those divisors end in the digit 1, and then subtracting that count from the total to find the number of divisors that do not end in 1.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve the problem, break it down into forward-looking intermediate subgoals:  
1. Compute the total number of positive integer divisors of \( 63^{10} \).  
2. Determine the condition for a divisor to end in the digit 1.  
3. Count the number of divisors that end in the digit 1.  
4. Subtract the count of divisors ending in 1 from the total number of divisors to find those that do not end in 1.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the total number of positive integer divisors of \( 63^{10} \). This can be achieved by finding the prime factorization of \( 63^{10} \) and using the divisor function formula.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
To find the number of positive divisors of \( 63^{10} \), first factorize 63:  
\[ 63 = 3^2 \cdot 7^1 \]  
Thus,  
\[ 63^{10} = (3^2 \cdot 7^1)^{10} = 3^{20} \cdot 7^{10} \]  
The number of positive divisors of a number \( p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \) is given by \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \). Here, the exponents are 20 for 3 and 10 for 7, so the total number of divisors is:  
\[ (20 + 1)(10 + 1) = 21 \cdot 11 = 231 \]  
Thus, \( 63^{10} \) has 231 positive divisors.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the condition for a divisor of \( 63^{10} = 3^{20} \cdot 7^{10} \) to end in the digit 1. This requires analyzing the last digit of a divisor, which depends on its prime factorization modulo 10.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
A divisor of \( 63^{10} = 3^{20} \cdot 7^{10} \) has the form \( 3^a \cdot 7^b \), where \( 0 \leq a \leq 20 \) and \( 0 \leq b \leq 10 \). We need to find when \( 3^a \cdot 7^b \mod 10 = 1 \).  
Compute the last digits of powers of 3 and 7:  
- For 3: \( 3^1 \equiv 3, 3^2 \equiv 9, 3^3 \equiv 7, 3^4 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \). The cycle length is 4, so \( 3^a \mod 10 \) depends on \( a \mod 4 \):  
  - \( a \equiv 0 \mod 4 \): \( 3^a \equiv 1 \mod 10 \)  
  - \( a \equiv 1 \mod 4 \): \( 3^a \equiv 3 \mod 10 \)  
  - \( a \equiv 2 \mod 4 \): \( 3^a \equiv 9 \mod 10 \)  
  - \( a \equiv 3 \mod 4 \): \( 3^a \equiv 7 \mod 10 \)  
- For 7: \( 7^1 \equiv 7, 7^2 \equiv 9, 7^3 \equiv 3, 7^4 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \). The cycle length is 4, so \( 7^b \mod 10 \) follows the same pattern as 3.  
The last digit of \( 3^a \cdot 7^b \) is \( (3^a \mod 10) \cdot (7^b \mod 10) \mod 10 \). We need:  
\[ (3^a \mod 10) \cdot (7^b \mod 10) \equiv 1 \mod 10 \]  
Test combinations of last digits (1, 3, 7, 9) multiplied modulo 10 to get 1:  
- \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)  
- \( 3 \cdot 7 = 21 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \)  
- \( 7 \cdot 3 = 21 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \)  
- \( 9 \cdot 9 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \)  
Thus, \( 3^a \cdot 7^b \equiv 1 \mod 10 \) when:  
- \( a \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 0 \mod 4 \) (both end in 1)  
- \( a \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 3 \mod 4 \) (3 · 7 = 1)  
- \( a \equiv 3 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 1 \mod 4 \) (7 · 3 = 1)  
- \( a \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 2 \mod 4 \) (9 · 9 = 1)

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to count the number of divisors of \( 63^{10} = 3^{20} \cdot 7^{10} \) that end in 1, based on the condition \( (a \mod 4, b \mod 4) = (0,0), (1,3), (3,1), (2,2) \). This involves counting valid pairs \( (a, b) \) for each case.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
For a divisor \( 3^a \cdot 7^b \), we have \( 0 \leq a \leq 20 \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 10 \). Count valid pairs \( (a, b) \) for each condition:  
1. **Case 1: \( a \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)**  
   - \( a = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 \): \( \lfloor 20/4 \rfloor + 1 = 6 \) values.  
   - \( b = 0, 4, 8 \): \( \lfloor 10/4 \rfloor + 1 = 3 \) values.  
   - Number of pairs: \( 6 \cdot 3 = 18 \).  
2. **Case 2: \( a \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)**  
   - \( a = 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 \): \( \lfloor (20-1)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 5 \) values.  
   - \( b = 3, 7 \): \( \lfloor (10-3)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 2 \) values.  
   - Number of pairs: \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \).  
3. **Case 3: \( a \equiv 3 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)**  
   - \( a = 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 \): \( \lfloor (20-3)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 5 \) values.  
   - \( b = 1, 5, 9 \): \( \lfloor (10-1)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 3 \) values.  
   - Number of pairs: \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \).  
4. **Case 4: \( a \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( b \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)**  
   - \( a = 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 \): \( \lfloor (20-2)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 5 \) values.  
   - \( b = 2, 6, 10 \): \( \lfloor (10-2)/4 \rfloor + 1 = 3 \) values.  
   - Number of pairs: \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \).  
Total divisors ending in 1:  
\[ 18 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 58 \]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the count of divisors ending in 1 (58 divisors). This involves checking the calculations for each case and ensuring all possible pairs are covered.  
[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Recompute the number of pairs for each case:  
- **Case 1**: \( a = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 \) (6 values), \( b = 0, 4, 8 \) (3 values). \( 6 \cdot 3 = 18 \).  
- **Case 2**: \( a = 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 \) (5 values), \( b = 3, 7 \) (2 values). \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \).  
- **Case 3**: \( a = 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 \) (5 values), \( b = 1, 5, 9 \) (3 values). \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \).  
- **Case 4**: \( a = 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 \) (5 values), \( b = 2, 6, 10 \) (3 values). \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \).  
Total: \( 18 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 58 \).  
Check coverage: The exponents \( a \mod 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3 \) and \( b \mod 4 = 0, 1, 2, 3 \) cover all possible pairs since the cycles are of length 4. The total number of pairs is \( 21 \cdot 11 = 231 \), and we only count specific combinations, so the calculation appears consistent.
