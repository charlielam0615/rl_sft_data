**Problem Restatement**: We need to determine the radius of the 100th concentric circle, \( C_{100} \), in a sequence of 100 concentric circles labeled \( C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{100} \). Each circle \( C_n \) is inscribed in an equilateral triangle, and the vertices of this triangle lie on the next circle, \( C_{n+1} \). The radius of the first circle, \( C_1 \), is given as 1. We need to find the radius of \( C_{100} \).

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set (Planning, Implementation, Review), following the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)  
To solve for the radius of \( C_{100} \), break down the problem into manageable subgoals:  
1. Understand the geometric relationship between a circle \( C_n \) inscribed in an equilateral triangle and the next circle \( C_{n+1} \) that passes through the triangle’s vertices.  
2. Derive a formula for the radius of \( C_{n+1} \) in terms of the radius of \( C_n \).  
3. Apply the formula iteratively or find a general expression for the radius of \( C_n \).  
4. Compute the radius of \( C_{100} \) using the initial condition that the radius of \( C_1 \) is 1.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to understand the geometric relationship between a circle \( C_n \) inscribed in an equilateral triangle and the circle \( C_{n+1} \) that passes through the triangle’s vertices. To achieve this, analyze the geometry of an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle and determine how the vertices of the triangle relate to the next circle.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Consider an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \). The radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) of an equilateral triangle is given by:  
\[ r = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{6} \]  
This circle, say \( C_n \), has radius \( r_n \). The vertices of the triangle lie on the next circle, \( C_{n+1} \), with radius \( r_{n+1} \). Since \( C_{n+1} \) passes through the triangle’s vertices, the distance from the center of the circles (all concentric, so same center) to each vertex equals \( r_{n+1} \). In an equilateral triangle, the distance from the center to a vertex is the circumradius (radius of the circumscribed circle), given by:  
\[ R = \frac{s}{\sqrt{3}} \]  
Thus, if \( C_n \) is the inscribed circle with radius \( r_n \), the triangle’s vertices lie on \( C_{n+1} \), so the circumradius of the triangle equals \( r_{n+1} \). We need to relate \( r_n \), the inradius, to \( r_{n+1} \), the circumradius of the same triangle.  
Using the formulas:  
- Inradius: \( r_n = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{6} \), so \( s = \frac{6 r_n}{\sqrt{3}} = 2 \sqrt{3} r_n \).  
- Circumradius: \( r_{n+1} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} r_n}{\sqrt{3}} = 2 r_n \).  
Thus, the radius of \( C_{n+1} \) is:  
\[ r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \]  
This suggests a recursive relationship where each circle’s radius is twice that of the previous circle.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the recursive relationship \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \). Verify this by checking the geometric setup and testing with initial conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
To validate \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \), reconsider the geometry. The circle \( C_n \) is inscribed in an equilateral triangle, touching all three sides, and the triangle’s vertices lie on \( C_{n+1} \). The derived relationship \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \) comes from equating the triangle’s inradius to \( r_n \) and its circumradius to \( r_{n+1} \).  
Test with \( n = 1 \):  
- \( C_1 \) has radius \( r_1 = 1 \).  
- The equilateral triangle has inradius \( r_1 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{6} = 1 \), so \( s = 2 \sqrt{3} \).  
- The circumradius is \( r_2 = \frac{s}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 2 \).  
Thus, \( r_2 = 2 r_1 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \), which fits the pattern.  
The relationship holds geometrically, as the circumradius of an equilateral triangle is always twice its inradius (\( R = 2r \)), confirming \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \).

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Track Goals (Review)  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Find the radius of \( C_{100} \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the geometric relationship between \( C_n \) and \( C_{n+1} \) (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Derive the formula for \( r_{n+1} \) in terms of \( r_n \) (completed: \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Apply the formula to find \( r_{100} \) (pending).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the final numerical value (pending).  
**Current Goal**: Apply the recursive formula to find the radius of \( C_{100} \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to apply the recursive formula \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \) to find the radius of \( C_{100} \), given \( r_1 = 1 \). Use the recursive relationship to derive a general expression for \( r_n \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The recursive formula is \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \), with \( r_1 = 1 \).  
Iterate:  
- \( r_2 = 2 r_1 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \).  
- \( r_3 = 2 r_2 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 = 2^2 \).  
- \( r_4 = 2 r_3 = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 = 2^3 \).  
This suggests \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \).  
Verify the pattern:  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( r_1 = 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1 \), correct.  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( r_2 = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2 \), correct.  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( r_3 = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4 \), correct.  
General formula: \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \).  
For \( n = 100 \):  
\[ r_{100} = 2^{100-1} = 2^{99} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Validation (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the general formula \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \) and ensure it correctly applies to find \( r_{100} \). Check the derivation and test with additional values.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
The formula \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \) comes from the recursive relation \( r_{n+1} = 2 r_n \). To validate:  
- Derive explicitly: Start with \( r_1 = 1 \).  
  - \( r_2 = 2 r_1 = 2 \).  
  - \( r_3 = 2 r_2 = 2 \cdot 2 = 2^2 \).  
  - \( r_4 = 2 r_3 = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 2^3 \).  
  The pattern confirms \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \).  
- Test for \( n = 5 \): \( r_5 = 2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16 \). From recursion: \( r_4 = 8 \), \( r_5 = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 \), correct.  
For \( n = 100 \):  
\[ r_{100} = 2^{99} \]  
This is consistent with the recursive application. The formula is valid.  
[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action**: Reach Goal (Implementation)  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the numerical value of \( r_{100} = 2^{99} \) to provide the final answer.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using the formula \( r_n = 2^{n-1} \), for \( n = 100 \):  
\[ r_{100} = 2^{100-1} = 2^{99} \]  
To express numerically:  
\[ 2^{99} = 2^{90} \cdot 2^9 = (2^{10})^{9} \cdot 2^9 = 1024^9 \cdot 512 \]  
Calculating \( 2^{99} \):  
\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \]  
\[ 2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 \approx 1.048576 \times 10^6 \]  
\[ 2^{90} = (2^{10})^9 \approx (1.048576 \times 10^6)^9 \approx 1.237940 \times 10^{27} \]  
\[ 2^9 = 512 \]  
\[ 2^{99} = 2^{90} \cdot 2^9 \approx 1.237940 \times 10^{27} \cdot 512 \approx 6.33825 \times 10^{29} \]  
Thus, the radius of \( C_{100} \) is approximately \( 6.33825 \times 10^{29} \).  
[/IMP]

[REVIEW]

**Current Goal**: All subgoals completed; finalize the solution.
