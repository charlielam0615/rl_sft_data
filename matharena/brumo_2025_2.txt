### Problem Restatement
We need to find the common ratio \( r \) of an infinite geometric sequence whose first term is \( a \) and sum is 91. A new infinite geometric sequence starts with the same first term \( a \) but has a common ratio of \( r^3 \), and its sum is 81. We must determine the value of \( r \).

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to solve for the common ratio \( r \).

Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals in a nested format, reflecting the recent planning:

  - **Subgoal 1**: Derive the sum formula for the original sequence and set up an equation with sum 91.
  - **Subgoal 2**: Derive the sum formula for the new sequence with common ratio \( r^3 \) and set up an equation with sum 81.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Derive the sum formula for the original infinite geometric sequence and set up an equation with sum 91.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \), and apply the given sum of 91.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) (where \( |r| < 1 \)) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

Given the sum of the original sequence is 91, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{1 - r} = 91 \quad (1)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Derive the sum formula for the new sequence with common ratio \( r^3 \) and set up an equation with sum 81.  
**How to Achieve**: Apply the same sum formula for the new sequence with the common ratio \( r^3 \) and sum 81.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The new sequence has the same first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r^3 \). Its sum is given as 81:

\[
\frac{a}{1 - r^3} = 81 \quad (2)
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the system of equations to find \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use equations (1) and (2) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( r \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From equation (1):

\[
a = 91(1 - r) \quad (3)
\]

From equation (2):

\[
a = 81(1 - r^3) \quad (4)
\]

Equate the two expressions for \( a \):

\[
91(1 - r) = 81(1 - r^3)
\]

Divide both sides by 1 (assuming the denominators are non-zero):

\[
91 - 91r = 81 - 81r^3
\]

Rearrange all terms to one side:

\[
91 - 81 + 81r^3 - 91r = 0
\]

\[
81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0 \quad (5)
\]

Multiply through by 1000 to eliminate decimals (if needed for clarity, but here we proceed directly):

This is a cubic equation in \( r \):

\[
81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0
\]

To solve, we can try the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 10 divided by factors of 81: \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 5, \pm 10, \pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{2}{3}, \pm \frac{5}{3}, \pm \frac{10}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{9}, \pm \frac{2}{9}, \pm \frac{5}{9}, \pm \frac{10}{9} \).

Testing \( r = \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
81\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 - 91\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 10 = 81 \cdot \frac{1}{27} - \frac{91}{3} + 10
\]

\[
= 3 - \frac{91}{3} + \frac{30}{3} = \frac{9 - 91 + 30}{3} = \frac{-52}{3} \neq 0
\]

Testing \( r = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}
\]

\[
81 \cdot \frac{8}{27} - 91 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 10 = \frac{648}{27} - \frac{182}{3} + \frac{30}{3}
\]

\[
= 24 - \frac{182}{3} + \frac{30}{3} = 24 - \frac{152}{3}
\]

\[
= \frac{72 - 152}{3} = -\frac{80}{3} \neq 0
\]

Instead, let’s try solving numerically or factorizing. Assume the cubic might have roots that satisfy \( |r| < 1 \). Using a numerical solver or further testing (e.g., via polynomial division or software for precision), we find:

\[
r = \frac{1}{3}
\]

(After testing multiple values, \( r = \frac{1}{3} \) was incorrect above; let’s proceed and verify later steps, indicating a need to backtrack if necessary.)

Let’s try solving the cubic more carefully. Divide the equation by a constant to simplify (optional, but let’s proceed directly). Instead, let’s substitute back to check consistency.

From equations (3) and (4), let’s express \( a \) and solve correctly. Assume \( r = \frac{10}{9} \) (from Rational Root Theorem possibilities):

\[
\left(\frac{10}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{1000}{729}
\]

\[
81 \cdot \frac{1000}{729} - 91 \cdot \frac{10}{9} + 10
\]

\[
= \frac{81000}{729} - \frac{910}{9} + \frac{90}{9}
\]

\[
= \frac{81000 - 729 \cdot 910 + 729 \cdot 90}{729}
\]

\[
= \frac{81000 - 66339 + 6561}{729} = \frac{21222}{729} = \frac{7272}{729} \approx 10
\]

This suggests a calculation error. Let’s correct our approach in the next step by backtracking.
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Backtrack
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
Return to the cubic equation setup to correct the solving process, as the root testing led to inconsistencies.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Revisit the cubic equation:

\[
81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0
\]

Recompute using the Rational Root Theorem carefully or numerical methods to ensure accuracy.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve the cubic equation \( 81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0 \) accurately to find \( r \).  
**How to Achieve**: Retry solving the cubic equation using numerical methods or further rational root testing, ensuring precision.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let’s try \( r = \frac{10}{9} \) again with precise calculations:

\[
r^3 = \left(\frac{10}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{1000}{729}
\]

\[
81 \cdot \frac{1000}{729} = \frac{81000}{729} = \frac{1000}{9}
\]

\[
91 \cdot \frac{10}{9} = \frac{910}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{1000}{9} - \frac{910}{9} + \frac{90}{9} = \frac{1000 - 910 + 90}{9} = \frac{180}{9} = 20 \neq 0
\]

Try \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \):

\[
\left(-\frac{10}{9}\right)^3 = -\frac{1000}{729}
\]

\[
81 \cdot \left(-\frac{1000}{729}\right) = -\frac{81000}{729} = -\frac{1000}{9}
\]

\[
91 \cdot \left(-\frac{10}{9}\right) = -\frac{910}{9}
\]

\[
-\frac{1000}{9} - \left(-\frac{910}{9}\right) + \frac{90}{9} = \frac{-1000 + 910 + 90}{9} = \frac{0}{9} = 0
\]

This satisfies the equation:

\[
81\left(-\frac{10}{9}\right)^3 - 91\left(-\frac{10}{9}\right) + 10 = 0
\]

So, \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \) is a root. Factor the cubic to find other roots:

Use synthetic division with \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
-\frac{10}{9} & 81 & 0 & -91 & 10 \\
& & -90 & 100 & -10 \\
\hline
& 81 & -90 & 9 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Quotient is \( 81r^2 - 90r + 9 \). Simplify:

\[
81r^2 - 90r + 9 = 0
\]

\[
9(9r^2 - 10r + 1) = 0
\]

\[
9r^2 - 10r + 1 = 0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 = 100 - 36 = 64
\]

\[
r = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{64}}{18} = \frac{10 \pm 8}{18}
\]

\[
r = \frac{18}{18} = 1, \quad r = \frac{2}{18} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Roots are \( r = -\frac{10}{9}, 1, \frac{1}{9} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 8: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the solutions \( r = -\frac{10}{9}, 1, \frac{1}{9} \) are valid for the infinite geometric series and satisfy both sequences’ sums.  
**How to Achieve**: Check \( |r| < 1 \) and \( |r^3| < 1 \), and substitute back into equations (1) and (2) to ensure consistency with \( a \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum of an infinite geometric series requires \( |r| < 1 \).

- **For \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \)**:

\[
|r| = \frac{10}{9} > 1
\]

This does not satisfy the convergence condition, so \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \) is invalid.

- **For \( r = 1 \)**:

\[
|r| = 1
\]

The series does not converge (sum becomes infinite), so \( r = 1 \) is invalid.

- **For \( r = \frac{1}{9} \)**:

\[
|r| = \frac{1}{9} < 1
\]

\[
r^3 = \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{729}
\]

\[
|r^3| = \frac{1}{729} < 1
\]

This satisfies convergence for both sequences. Substitute \( r = \frac{1}{9} \) into equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1):

\[
a = 91 \left(1 - \frac{1}{9}\right) = 91 \cdot \frac{8}{9} = \frac{728}{9}
\]

Equation (2):

\[
1 - r^3 = 1 - \frac{1}{729} = \frac{728}{729}
\]

\[
a = 81 \cdot \frac{729}{728}
\]

Check if:

\[
\frac{728}{9} = 81 \cdot \frac{729}{728}
\]

\[
\frac{728}{9} \cdot \frac{728}{729} = \frac{81 \cdot 729}{728} \cdot \frac{728}{729} = 81
\]

\[
\frac{728 \cdot 728}{9 \cdot 729} = \frac{81 \cdot 1}{1} = 81
\]

This does not equal \( \frac{728}{9} \approx 80.888 \), indicating a need to backtrack.
[/IMP]

### Step 9: Backtrack
[PLANNING]
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
The substitution of \( r = \frac{1}{9} \) led to inconsistent values for \( a \), suggesting an error in the cubic equation or assumptions. Re-evaluate the equation setup.
[/PLANNING]

[PLANNING]
Reconsider the system of equations (1) and (2):

\[
\frac{a}{1 - r} = 91
\]

\[
\frac{a}{1 - r^3} = 81
\]

Divide equation (1) by equation (2):

\[
\frac{\frac{a}{1 - r}}{\frac{a}{1 - r^3}} = \frac{91}{81}
\]

\[
\frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = \frac{91}{81}
\]

\[
1 - r^3 = \frac{91}{81}(1 - r)
\]

\[
81 - 81r^3 = 91 - 91r
\]

\[
91r - 81r^3 = 91 - 81
\]

\[
81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0
\]

This matches our cubic equation, confirming correctness. The error lies in the final substitution. Let’s resolve the cubic correctly.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 10: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Re-solve the cubic equation \( 81r^3 - 91r + 10 = 0 \) and verify with correct roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Use the correct roots from Step 7 and substitute back carefully.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Roots from Step 7: \( r = -\frac{10}{9}, 1, \frac{1}{9} \). Only \( r = \frac{1}{9} \) satisfies \( |r| < 1 \).

Try a new approach to solve the system directly:

From:

\[
a = 91(1 - r)
\]

\[
a = 81(1 - r^3)
\]

\[
91(1 - r) = 81(1 - r^3)
\]

\[
\frac{1 - r^3}{1 - r} = \frac{91}{81}
\]

Since:

\[
1 - r^3 = (1 - r)(1 + r + r^2)
\]

\[
\frac{(1 - r)(1 + r + r^2)}{1 - r} = \frac{91}{81}
\]

\[
1 + r + r^2 = \frac{91}{81}
\]

\[
r^2 + r + 1 - \frac{91}{81} = 0
\]

\[
r^2 + r + \frac{81 - 91}{81} = 0
\]

\[
r^2 + r - \frac{10}{81} = 0
\]

Multiply by 81:

\[
81r^2 + 81r - 10 = 0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta = 81^2 + 4 \cdot 81 \cdot 10 = 6561 + 3240 = 9801 = 99^2
\]

\[
r = \frac{-81 \pm 99}{162}
\]

\[
r = \frac{18}{162} = \frac{1}{9}, \quad r = \frac{-180}{162} = -\frac{10}{9}
\]

Test \( r = \frac{1}{9} \):

\[
a = 91 \left(1 - \frac{1}{9}\right) = 91 \cdot \frac{8}{9} = \frac{728}{9}
\]

\[
r^3 = \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{729}
\]

\[
a = 81 \left(1 - \frac{1}{729}\right) = 81 \cdot \frac{728}{729} = \frac{81 \cdot 728}{729} = \frac{728}{9}
\]

Both equations yield the same \( a \), confirming consistency.
[/IMP]

### Step 11: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm \( r = \frac{1}{9} \) is the correct solution and check for other valid roots.  
**How to Achieve**: Verify convergence and test the other root \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( r = \frac{1}{9} \):

\[
|r| = \frac{1}{9} < 1, \quad |r^3| = \frac{1}{729} < 1
\]

Convergence is satisfied. The first term:

\[
a = \frac{728}{9}
\]

Satisfies both:

\[
\frac{\frac{728}{9}}{1 - \frac{1}{9}} = \frac{\frac{728}{9}}{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{728}{8} = 91
\]

\[
\frac{\frac{728}{9}}{1 - \frac{1}{729}} = \frac{\frac{728}{9}}{\frac{728}{729}} = \frac{728}{9} \cdot \frac{729}{728} = 81
\]

This is consistent.

For \( r = -\frac{10}{9} \):

\[
|r| = \frac{10}{9} > 1
\]

Invalid for convergence.

Thus, \( r = \frac{1}{9} \) is the only valid solution.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The common ratio of the original sequence is \( \frac{1}{9} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
\]
