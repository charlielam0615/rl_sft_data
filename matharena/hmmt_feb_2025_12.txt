### Problem Statement
Kevin the frog in on the bottom-left lily pad of a $3 \times 3$ grid of lily pads, and his home is at the topright lily pad. He can only jump between two lily pads which are horizontally or vertically adjacent. Compute the number of ways to remove $4$ of the lily pads so that the bottom-left and top-right lily pads both remain, but Kelvin cannot get home.
Type (The type of the question): ['Combinatorics']

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
The overall goal is to find the number of ways to remove 4 lily pads such that the start and end pads remain, but Kevin cannot get home. To achieve this, I will break down the problem into the following subgoals:
1.  Identify all lily pads that can be removed.
2.  Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set.
3.  For each combination of 4 removed lily pads, check if a path still exists from the bottom-left lily pad to the top-right lily pad.
4.  Count the combinations where no path exists.

Here is the current hierarchy of goals:
- Overall Goal: Compute the number of ways to remove 4 lily pads such that (0,0) and (2,2) remain, but Kevin cannot get home.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all lily pads that can be removed.
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set.
  - Subgoal 3: For each combination of 4 removed lily pads, check if a path still exists from (0,0) to (2,2).
  - Subgoal 4: Count the combinations where no path exists.

The current goal is **Subgoal 1: Identify all lily pads that can be removed.**
[/REVIEW]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify all lily pads that can be removed.
How to achieve it: The grid is $3 \times 3$, so there are 9 lily pads in total. The problem states that the bottom-left (0,0) and top-right (2,2) lily pads must remain. Therefore, the removable lily pads are all pads except (0,0) and (2,2). I will list these coordinates.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The $3 \times 3$ grid lily pads can be represented by coordinates $(x, y)$ where $x, y \in \{0, 1, 2\}$.
Total lily pads:
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1)
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2)

The bottom-left lily pad is (0,0) and the top-right lily pad is (2,2). These two must remain.
The lily pads that can be removed are the remaining $9 - 2 = 7$ pads:
1.  (0,1)
2.  (0,2)
3.  (1,0)
4.  (1,1)
5.  (1,2)
6.  (2,0)
7.  (2,1)

The current goal is **Subgoal 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set.**
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set.
How to achieve it: There are 7 removable lily pads identified in the previous step. The problem requires removing 4 of these. This is a combination problem, specifically "7 choose 4", denoted as $\binom{7}{4}$. I will calculate this value.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The number of removable lily pads is 7.
The number of lily pads to be removed is 4.
The total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the 7 available is given by the combination formula:
$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
In this case, $n=7$ and $k=4$.
$\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)(3 \times 2 \times 1)} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 7 \times 5 = 35$.
There are 35 total ways to remove 4 lily pads from the 7 available.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Subgoal 3 requires checking connectivity for 35 combinations. This is a large number for a manual simulation step-by-step for each combination. Instead of exhaustively checking each combination, I will adjust the subgoals to refine the approach. A more efficient way might be to identify "cut sets" or to enumerate paths and see which removals block them.

Revised Subgoals:
1.  Identify all lily pads that can be removed. (Completed)
2.  Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set. (Completed)
3.  Characterize the types of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) and identify critical nodes/sets of nodes whose removal would disconnect the path.
4.  Systematically enumerate combinations of 4 removed lily pads that result in disconnection. This might involve considering small cut sets and building upon them, or directly counting the "connected" cases and subtracting from the total.
5.  Count the combinations where no path exists. (This is the final count from the previous Subgoal 4, but now achieved through a different path).

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Characterize the types of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) and identify critical nodes/sets of nodes whose removal would disconnect the path.
How to achieve it: I will visualize the grid and possible paths. Paths from (0,0) to (2,2) must involve moving only right or up. The minimum number of steps is 4 (e.g., R-R-U-U). I will identify nodes that are crucial to connectivity.
The removable nodes are:
R = {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}
Nodes that *must* remain: S=(0,0), T=(2,2).

I will analyze "bottleneck" nodes or sets of nodes whose removal would disconnect S from T.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The grid can be visualized as layers based on Manhattan distance from (0,0) or (2,2).
Nodes and their neighbors (excluding (0,0) and (2,2) for removed pads):
(0,0) connects to (1,0) and (0,1).
(2,2) connects to (1,2) and (2,1).

Consider the nodes that form "cross-sections" of the grid that any path must traverse.
A minimal path from (0,0) to (2,2) requires 2 steps right and 2 steps up (total 4 steps).
Example paths:
(0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)
(0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2)
(0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2)
(0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2)
(0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2)
(0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)

The "inner" $2 \times 2$ square of removable nodes is:
(1,0) (2,0)
(1,1) (2,1)
(1,2) (2,2)

No, this is not a good way to characterize. Let's think about cut sets.
To disconnect (0,0) from (2,2), we need to remove a set of nodes such that all paths are blocked.
The "middle" nodes are often critical.
Consider the nodes: (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,1).

The nodes (1,0) and (0,1) are direct neighbors of (0,0).
The nodes (1,2) and (2,1) are direct neighbors of (2,2).

To disconnect (0,0) from (2,2), we must remove all paths.
Consider a "cut" line.
A common approach for grid graphs is to look at nodes that lie on a diagonal or anti-diagonal that separates the source from the sink.
The nodes that form an "anti-diagonal" from bottom-left to top-right are:
{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)} - Removing these 3 nodes disconnects (0,0) from (2,2) if (0,0) and (2,2) are the only nodes remaining on their respective sides.
If we remove these 3, we still need to remove 1 more pad.
Let's call this set $C_1 = \{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$. These are 3 pads. If we remove these, we need to remove one more pad. Any path must cross this diagonal.

Another set of critical nodes:
$C_2 = \{(0,1), (1,0)\}$ - These are the direct neighbors of (0,0). If both are removed, (0,0) is isolated. But we only remove 4 pads. If we remove (0,1) and (1,0), we need to remove 2 more. This would disconnect (0,0) immediately.

Let's list the removable nodes and their connectivity:
Pads: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)
S=(0,0), T=(2,2)

Paths generally go "up" and "right".
Consider nodes in layers based on sum of coordinates (distance from (0,0) in typical grid path):
Layer 0: (0,0)
Layer 1: (1,0), (0,1)
Layer 2: (2,0), (1,1), (0,2)
Layer 3: (2,1), (1,2)
Layer 4: (2,2)

To disconnect, we need to remove a set of nodes that forms a cut between (0,0) and (2,2).
Minimum cut in this graph is 2 nodes (e.g., (1,1) and (0,2) or (1,1) and (2,0) or (1,0) and (0,1) - no, these are not cut sets by themselves).
Minimum node cut sets between (0,0) and (2,2) are typically:
- A set of 2 nodes: e.g., {(1,1), (0,2)} and {(1,1), (2,0)} are not direct cut sets.
- Sets of 3 nodes: e.g., $S_1 = \{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$. If we remove these 3, and (0,0) and (2,2) remain, all paths are blocked.
  - If $S_1$ is removed, we have 4 pads to remove. We have removed 3. We can remove 1 more pad from the remaining 4 removable pads: {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}.
  - Number of ways: $\binom{4}{1} = 4$. So, 4 combinations of 4 pads removed.
    Example: $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1)\}$
- $S_2 = \{(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)\}$ - this set does not disconnect (0,0) from (2,2). E.g., (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2)
- $S_3 = \{(1,0), (0,2), (2,1)\}$ - this set does not disconnect (0,0) from (2,2). E.g., (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2)

Let's use the max-flow min-cut theorem intuition. The minimum cut would be the minimum number of nodes to remove.
The grid has 2 disjoint paths of length 4, e.g., (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2) and (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2).
These paths share (1,1).
If (1,1) is removed, then we must block paths that avoid (1,1).
Path 1: (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)
Path 2: (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)

If (1,1) is *not* removed, then it's very central and likely to be part of a path.
If (1,1) *is* removed, we have removed 1 pad, need to remove 3 more. The remaining 6 removable pads are:
{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}
If (1,1) is removed, paths must go around it.
Paths from (0,0) to (2,2) must pass through either (1,0) or (0,1).
And must pass through either (1,2) or (2,1).

Consider the small number of nodes that must be removed.
A disconnection happens if:
1. (0,0) is isolated (its neighbors (1,0) and (0,1) are removed). This is 2 pads. Need to remove 2 more.
   Case 1: Remove {(1,0), (0,1)}. Remaining 5 removable pads: {(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}.
   We need to remove 2 more from these 5. $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.
   In these 10 ways, (0,0) is isolated. So Kevin cannot get home.
   This gives 10 ways.

2. (2,2) is isolated (its neighbors (1,2) and (2,1) are removed). This is 2 pads. Need to remove 2 more.
   Case 2: Remove {(1,2), (2,1)}. Remaining 5 removable pads: {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}.
   We need to remove 2 more from these 5. $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.
   In these 10 ways, (2,2) is isolated. So Kevin cannot get home.
   This gives 10 ways.

Are there overlaps between Case 1 and Case 2?
Overlap means removing {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)}. This is exactly 4 pads. This combination is counted in both cases.
This specific combination means (0,0) is isolated AND (2,2) is isolated. This is 1 way.
So, total ways from Case 1 or Case 2 = $10 + 10 - 1 = 19$.

3. Neither (0,0) nor (2,2) are isolated, but the path is still blocked.
   This means the 4 removed pads form a "cut" through the middle of the grid.
   The minimum number of nodes to completely separate (0,0) from (2,2) is 3 nodes, forming a diagonal cut.
   Let's list the critical "diagonal" cut sets of 3 nodes:
   - $D_1 = \{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$ (anti-diagonal from top-left to bottom-right).
     If these 3 are removed, 1 pad more needs to be removed from the remaining 4 removable pads:
     R \ $D_1 = \{(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\}$.
     Number of ways: $\binom{4}{1} = 4$.
     Are any of these 4 ways already counted in Case 1 or Case 2?
     Case 1: Removed {(1,0), (0,1)} and 2 from R \ {(1,0), (0,1)}.
     Case 2: Removed {(1,2), (2,1)} and 2 from R \ {(1,2), (2,1)}.
     The set $D_1$ itself does not contain {(1,0), (0,1)} or {(1,2), (2,1)}.
     If we remove $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$ and one of $\{(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\}$.
     - Example: $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1)\}$. This set includes $(0,1)$, but not $(1,0)$. So (0,0) is not isolated.
       Similarly for other choices from $D_1$.
       So these 4 ways are not included in the 19 ways from Case 1 or 2.

   - $D_2 = \{(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)\}$ (This is not a clean cut set, it leaves paths open. E.g., (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2)). This is not a minimal cut set.
   - $D_3 = \{(1,0), (0,2), (2,1)\}$ (Similarly, leaves paths open. E.g., (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2)). Not a minimal cut set.

   The only minimal node cut set of size 3 is $D_1 = \{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$.

Let's verify this. If $D_1$ is removed, the remaining removable nodes are $R' = \{(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\}$.
The graph is now:
(0,0) -- (1,0)
|        |
(0,1) -- (1,2) -- (2,2)
         |
         (2,1) -- (2,2)

No, this is wrong. If (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) are removed:
(0,0) neighbors: (1,0), (0,1)
(2,2) neighbors: (1,2), (2,1)
Remaining available (non-removed, non-S, non-T):
(0,1) connects to (0,0) and (1,1) (but (1,1) is removed). So (0,1) only connects to (0,0).
(1,0) connects to (0,0) and (1,1) (but (1,1) is removed) and (2,0) (but (2,0) is removed). So (1,0) only connects to (0,0).
(1,2) connects to (1,1) (removed), (0,2) (removed), (2,2). So (1,2) only connects to (2,2).
(2,1) connects to (1,1) (removed), (2,0) (removed), (2,2). So (2,1) only connects to (2,2).

So if $D_1$ is removed, (0,0) can reach (0,1) and (1,0).
And (2,2) can reach (1,2) and (2,1).
But there is *no path* between {(0,1), (1,0)} and {(1,2), (2,1)} as (1,1), (0,2), (2,0) are removed.
Thus, $D_1 = \{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\}$ is indeed a minimal vertex cut.
Any set of 4 pads that contains $D_1$ as a subset will disconnect the graph.
There are 4 such sets. These are:
1. $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1)\}$
2. $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (1,0)\}$
3. $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2)\}$
4. $\{(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\}$

Now, check for overlaps with Case 1 (isolating (0,0)) and Case 2 (isolating (2,2)).
Case 1: Removing {(1,0), (0,1)} and 2 others.
None of the 4 sets above contain both (1,0) and (0,1). So no overlap with Case 1.
Case 2: Removing {(1,2), (2,1)} and 2 others.
None of the 4 sets above contain both (1,2) and (2,1). So no overlap with Case 2.
This means these 4 combinations are new and distinct from the 19 combinations previously identified.

So far: $19 + 4 = 23$ ways.

What if there are other cut sets of 4 nodes which are not captured by the above?
This is a small grid. We have enumerated the total number of ways (35).
It might be easier to count the number of ways they *remain connected* and subtract from 35.

Let's list the 7 removable pads:
P1: (0,1)
P2: (0,2)
P3: (1,0)
P4: (1,1)
P5: (1,2)
P6: (2,0)
P7: (2,1)

Let's think about nodes that, if removed, are likely to disconnect.
The "central" node (1,1) is very important.
If (1,1) is removed, we have removed 1 pad, need to remove 3 more.
Remaining 6 pads: {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}
If (1,1) is removed, paths must use (0,1), (1,0) (from start) and (1,2), (2,1) (to end).
Essentially, any path must use a node from {(0,1), (1,0)} AND a node from {(1,2), (2,1)}.
If (1,1) is removed, the remaining graph has 4 "corners" around (1,1).
(0,0) -- (1,0)    (1,2) -- (2,2)
|                   |
(0,1)               (2,1)
|
(0,2)               (2,0)

If (1,1) is removed, path from (0,0) to (2,2) must use:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) OR
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) (no, (1,0)-(1,2) need (1,1))
This means if (1,1) is removed, the path segments are:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)  (Path A)
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)  (Path B)
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> ... (1,1) is removed
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> ... (1,1) is removed

So if (1,1) is removed, the only paths are through the "edges" of the grid:
Path A: (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)
Path B: (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)

To disconnect the graph when (1,1) is removed, we must remove 3 more nodes such that both Path A and Path B are broken.
Path A uses (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).
Path B uses (0,1), (0,2), (1,2).
The 6 removable pads (excluding (1,1)) are: {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}.
To break Path A, we need to remove at least one of {(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)}.
To break Path B, we need to remove at least one of {(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)}.

Let $X_A = \{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ and $X_B = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$.
We need to choose 3 pads $P_1, P_2, P_3$ from $R \setminus \{(1,1)\}$ such that $\{P_1, P_2, P_3\} \cap X_A \neq \emptyset$ AND $\{P_1, P_2, P_3\} \cap X_B \neq \emptyset$.
Total ways to pick 3 from 6 is $\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20$.

How many of these 20 combinations *do not* disconnect the graph? (i.e. one of Path A or Path B remains).
- Path A remains: Need to pick 3 pads such that none are from $X_A$. This means picking 3 pads from $R \setminus (\{(1,1)\} \cup X_A) = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$. This is $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ way: $\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$.
  If $\{(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$ are removed, Path A (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2) still exists. This means this combination is *connected*.
- Path B remains: Need to pick 3 pads such that none are from $X_B$. This means picking 3 pads from $R \setminus (\{(1,1)\} \cup X_B) = \{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. This is $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ way: $\{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.
  If $\{(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ are removed, Path B (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2) still exists. This means this combination is *connected*.

These two sets are disjoint:
Set 1: $\{(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$ (connected)
Set 2: $\{(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ (connected)
So, out of the 20 combinations where (1,1) is removed, $20 - 2 = 18$ combinations result in disconnection.

Now, let's look at the cases where (1,1) is *not* removed.
We need to remove 4 pads from the 6 pads in $R \setminus \{(1,1)\}$: {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}.
Total ways: $\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15$.
In these cases, (1,1) remains.
The paths are more numerous. Any path must go through (1,1) OR around it.
If (1,1) remains, it acts as a central hub.
Paths from (0,0) to (1,1): (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1) or (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1).
Paths from (1,1) to (2,2): (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2) or (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2).

So, for a path to exist, at least one path from (0,0) to (1,1) must exist, AND at least one path from (1,1) to (2,2) must exist.
Let $N_S = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$. To disconnect (0,0) from (1,1), both nodes in $N_S$ must be removed.
Let $N_T = \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$. To disconnect (1,1) from (2,2), both nodes in $N_T$ must be removed.

If (1,1) is *not* removed:
Case 3: Both nodes in $N_S$ are removed: {(1,0), (0,1)}. (2 pads removed). Need to remove 2 more.
   These 2 pads must be chosen from the remaining $R' = \{(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.
   Number of ways: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
   These 6 combinations disconnect (0,0) from (1,1), and thus from (2,2).
   Are any of these 6 combinations already counted?
   - Case 1: (0,0) isolated. Yes, these are exactly the cases where (0,0) is isolated, but (1,1) remains.
     Example: {(1,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)}. (0,0) is isolated. (1,1) is not isolated.
     These 6 combinations are part of the initial 10 combinations where (0,0) is isolated (Case 1).
     Recall: Case 1 was: remove {(1,0), (0,1)} and 2 from R \ {(1,0), (0,1)}. The full list for R \ {(1,0), (0,1)} is {(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}.
     If (1,1) is *not* removed, then we choose 2 from {(0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)}. This is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways. These 6 ways are already counted in the 19.

Case 4: Both nodes in $N_T$ are removed: {(1,2), (2,1)}. (2 pads removed). Need to remove 2 more.
   These 2 pads must be chosen from the remaining $R'' = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0)\}$.
   Number of ways: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
   These 6 combinations disconnect (1,1) from (2,2), and thus from (0,0).
   These 6 combinations are part of the initial 10 combinations where (2,2) is isolated (Case 2).

The 15 combinations where (1,1) is *not* removed:
- 6 ways where (0,0) is isolated from (1,1) (and thus (2,2)). These are the 6 ways from Case 3.
- 6 ways where (1,1) is isolated from (2,2) (and thus (0,0)). These are the 6 ways from Case 4.
- Overlap: If both $N_S$ and $N_T$ are removed. This is {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)}. This is 1 way.
  This means (0,0) is isolated and (2,2) is isolated. This specific combination was already identified as the overlap (1 way) in the $10+10-1=19$ calculation.

So far, the 19 disconnected combinations are:
- (0,0) isolated (10 combinations): {(1,0), (0,1)} plus any 2 from $R \setminus \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$.
- (2,2) isolated (10 combinations): {(1,2), (2,1)} plus any 2 from $R \setminus \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$.
- Overlap: {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)} (1 combination).

And the 18 disconnected combinations where (1,1) is removed are:
- (1,1) removed, and 3 others. 2 of these are connected. So $20-2=18$ are disconnected.

Total: $19 + 18$? No, this is double counting.
Let $D$ be the set of disconnected combinations.
Let $D_I$ be the set of combinations where (0,0) or (2,2) are isolated (19 ways).
Let $D_{M}$ be the set of combinations where (1,1) is removed and the graph is disconnected (18 ways).

The question is, are there any combinations in $D_I$ where (1,1) is also removed?
Yes.
Consider $C_A = \{(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,2)\}$. This is one of the 10 ways from Case 1. (0,0) is isolated. (1,1) is also removed.
Consider $C_B = \{(1,2), (2,1), (1,1), (2,0)\}$. This is one of the 10 ways from Case 2. (2,2) is isolated. (1,1) is also removed.
Consider $C_C = \{(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. This is the overlap. (1,1) is NOT removed.

Let's use a simpler approach for the revised Subgoal 4.
Total combinations = 35.
Let's list the combinations of 4 removed pads that keep the graph connected.
A path from (0,0) to (2,2) must always exist.
The minimum number of nodes for a path is 5 (including (0,0) and (2,2)). So if 4 pads are removed, 5 pads remain.
The 5 remaining pads must form a connected path.

Connected cases:
1. Path A: (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)
   Pads used: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).
   Removable pads not used in this path: {(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)}. These are 4 pads.
   If these 4 pads are removed, Path A remains. This is 1 connected combination:
   $\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)\}$

2. Path B: (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)
   Pads used: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2).
   Removable pads not used in this path: {(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)}. These are 4 pads.
   If these 4 pads are removed, Path B remains. This is 1 connected combination:
   $\{(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\}$

These two combinations are disjoint (no common removed pads). So they are 2 distinct connected combinations.

Are there other sets of 4 pads whose removal leaves a connected path?
What if (1,1) remains? This is a strong central hub.
If (1,1) remains, we choose 4 pads from the 6 pads that are not (1,1) and not (0,0) or (2,2).
$R' = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.
Total $\binom{6}{4} = 15$ combinations where (1,1) remains.
We need to check which of these 15 combinations keep the graph connected.
For (1,1) to be a part of a path from (0,0) to (2,2), we need:
- Path from (0,0) to (1,1) exists: At least one of (1,0) or (0,1) must remain.
- Path from (1,1) to (2,2) exists: At least one of (1,2) or (2,1) must remain.

So, for connected cases where (1,1) *remains*:
We remove 4 pads from $R'$.
Let $N_S = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$ (neighbors of (0,0) in $R'$).
Let $N_T = \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$ (neighbors of (2,2) in $R'$).
Let $N_O = \{(0,2), (2,0)\}$ (other pads in $R'$).
$R' = N_S \cup N_T \cup N_O$. $|N_S|=2, |N_T|=2, |N_O|=2$. Total 6.

To be connected:
(At least one of $N_S$ remains) AND (At least one of $N_T$ remains).
Total combinations of 4 from $R'$ is 15.
Disconnected cases (where (1,1) remains):
1. Both from $N_S$ are removed: {(1,0), (0,1)} are removed (2 pads). Need to remove 2 more from $N_T \cup N_O$ (4 pads). $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
   These 6 combinations disconnect (0,0) from (1,1).
2. Both from $N_T$ are removed: {(1,2), (2,1)} are removed (2 pads). Need to remove 2 more from $N_S \cup N_O$ (4 pads). $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
   These 6 combinations disconnect (1,1) from (2,2).
3. Overlap of 1 and 2: Both $N_S$ and $N_T$ are removed. This is exactly 4 pads: {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)}. This is 1 way.
   This combination is {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)}. This is one of the 15 combinations.
   It disconnects the graph.

So, number of disconnected combinations where (1,1) *remains* is $6 + 6 - 1 = 11$.
Total combinations where (1,1) remains is 15.
So, number of connected combinations where (1,1) *remains* is $15 - 11 = 4$.

These 4 combinations are:
- $\{(0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ (removed from $R'$)
- $\{(1,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0)\}$ (removed from $R'$)
- $\{(0,1), (1,0), (0,2), (1,2)\}$ (removed from $R'$)
- $\{(0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ (removed from $R'$)

Let's check the two "Path A" and "Path B" specific connected cases:
1. $\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)\}$ - (1,1) is removed. So this is not in the 4 connected cases where (1,1) remains.
2. $\{(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\}$ - (1,1) is removed. So this is not in the 4 connected cases where (1,1) remains.

So, total connected cases:
- 2 cases where (1,1) is removed (Path A and Path B above).
- 4 cases where (1,1) remains.
Total connected cases = $2 + 4 = 6$.

Total disconnected cases = Total combinations - Total connected cases
Total disconnected cases = $35 - 6 = 29$.

Let's double check this logic.
The 6 connected combinations of 4 removed pads are:
1. Remove $\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)\}$. Remaining: $(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)$. Path: $(0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)$. (Connected)
2. Remove $\{(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. Remaining: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)$. Path: $(0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)$. (Connected)

Now, the 4 cases where (1,1) remains (so we remove 4 from the 6 pads in $R' = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$, and (1,1) is *not* one of them).
These are the cases where (1,1) remains, and at least one of $N_S$ remains, and at least one of $N_T$ remains.
Total $\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to remove 4 from $R'$.
Disconnected if:
- Both $N_S$ are removed: $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$, plus 2 from $N_O \cup N_T = \{(0,2), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways.
  Example: $\{(1,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. (1,1) remains. (0,0) isolated. Disconnected.
- Both $N_T$ are removed: $\{(1,2), (2,1)\}$, plus 2 from $N_O \cup N_S = \{(0,2), (2,0), (1,0), (0,1)\}$. $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways.
  Example: $\{(1,2), (2,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. (1,1) remains. (2,2) isolated. Disconnected.
- Overlap: $\{(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. This is 1 way.
Total disconnected where (1,1) remains = $6+6-1=11$.
Total connected where (1,1) remains = $15-11=4$.

The 4 connected combinations where (1,1) remains must be:
- $\{(0,2), (2,0), (1,0), (1,2)\}$ - Path: (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2) (No, (0,1) and (2,1) must be remaining)
Let's list the 4 connected combinations (where (1,1) remains):
1. Remove 4 from $R'$ such that (1,0) and (1,2) remain:
   Remove 4 from $\{(0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. No, this is too complex.
   Let's check the combinations that *remain connected* with (1,1) present.
   - To stay connected, we must avoid removing both (1,0) and (0,1).
   - To stay connected, we must avoid removing both (1,2) and (2,1).
   Total ways to remove 4 from $R'$ is 15.
   Ways to disconnect with (1,1) present:
   - Remove (1,0) AND (0,1) AND 2 others from $\{(0,2), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. (6 ways)
   - Remove (1,2) AND (2,1) AND 2 others from $\{(0,2), (2,0), (1,0), (0,1)\}$. (6 ways)
   - Overlap: Remove {(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)}. (1 way)
   Disconnected = 11. Connected = 15 - 11 = 4.

   Let's list these 4 connected sets (where (1,1) is NOT removed):
   The removed 4 must NOT contain $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$ and NOT contain $\{(1,2), (2,1)\}$.
   The 6 pads are $N_S = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$, $N_T = \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$, $N_O = \{(0,2), (2,0)\}$.
   The combinations that remain connected are those where we pick:
   - 1 from $N_S$, 1 from $N_T$, 2 from $N_O$. $\binom{2}{1} \binom{2}{1} \binom{2}{2} = 2 \times 2 \times 1 = 4$ ways.
     Example: $\{(1,0), (1,2), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. Path: $(0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2)$. Yes.
     Let's list these 4:
     1. $\{(1,0), (1,2), (0,2), (2,0)\}$
     2. $\{(1,0), (2,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$
     3. $\{(0,1), (1,2), (0,2), (2,0)\}$
     4. $\{(0,1), (2,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$

These 4 are distinct from the initial 2 because the initial 2 had (1,1) removed.
So, total connected combinations = $2 + 4 = 6$.
Total ways to remove 4 pads is 35.
Number of ways to remove 4 pads such that Kevin cannot get home = $35 - 6 = 29$.

This seems correct and consistent. The characterization of paths and cut sets (Subgoal 3) led to a systematic enumeration of connected cases, which is typically less error-prone than enumerating disconnected cases directly for this type of problem.

Final check:
The 6 connected combinations:
1. $R_1 = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)
2. $R_2 = \{(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)
3. $R_3 = \{(1,0), (1,2), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2) (Here (0,1) and (2,1) must remain)
   Remaining pads: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Yes, connected.
4. $R_4 = \{(1,0), (2,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2) (Here (0,1) and (1,2) must remain)
   Remaining pads: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). Yes, connected.
5. $R_5 = \{(0,1), (1,2), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2) (Here (1,0) and (2,1) must remain)
   Remaining pads: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Yes, connected.
6. $R_6 = \{(0,1), (2,1), (0,2), (2,0)\}$. Path: (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2) (Here (1,0) and (1,2) must remain)
   Remaining pads: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). Yes, connected.

These 6 combinations are distinct and indeed result in a connected graph.
Thus, $35 - 6 = 29$ is the correct answer.
This completes the planning and calculation for the problem.

The next step is to conclude the planning process according to the revised subgoals.
Subgoal 3 (Revised) is completed.
Subgoal 4 (Revised) is completed (identified connected cases and calculated disconnected ones).
Subgoal 5 (Revised) is completed (calculated the final count).
So, the next action should be to mark the problem as solved or to provide the final answer.
The prompt asks to continue until all plans are completed. The plan is now completed.
The final action would be "Track Goals" to confirm completion, then "Final Answer".
I should output the last step as an Implementation step to reach the goal of calculating the final number.

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Here is the current hierarchy of goals:
- Overall Goal: Compute the number of ways to remove 4 lily pads such that (0,0) and (2,2) remain, but Kevin cannot get home.
  - Subgoal 1: Identify all lily pads that can be removed. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 lily pads from the removable set. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 3 (Revised): Characterize the types of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) and identify critical nodes/sets of nodes whose removal would disconnect the path. (Completed)
  - Subgoal 4 (Revised): Systematically enumerate combinations of 4 removed lily pads that result in disconnection. This might involve considering small cut sets and building upon them, or directly counting the "connected" cases and subtracting from the total.
  - Subgoal 5 (Revised): Count the combinations where no path exists.

The current goal is **Subgoal 4 (Revised): Systematically enumerate combinations of 4 removed lily pads that result in disconnection. (and Subgoal 5: Count the combinations where no path exists).** These two subgoals are closely related and will be addressed together by finding the complement.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Systematically enumerate combinations of 4 removed lily pads that result in disconnection, and count them.
How to achieve it: I will calculate the number of ways the graph *remains connected* after removing 4 lily pads, and subtract this from the total number of ways to remove 4 lily pads (which is 35).
I will identify two main scenarios for connectivity:
1.  Paths that do not rely on the central pad (1,1).
2.  Paths that rely on the central pad (1,1).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The total number of ways to remove 4 lily pads from the 7 removable ones is $\binom{7}{4} = 35$.

We need to find the number of ways to remove 4 pads such that the graph *remains connected* from (0,0) to (2,2).
Let $S = (0,0)$ and $T = (2,2)$.
The 7 removable pads are $R = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.

**Case 1: (1,1) is removed.**
If (1,1) is removed, we need to remove 3 more pads from the remaining 6 removable pads (excluding (1,1)): $R_1 = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.
Total ways to remove 3 from these 6 is $\binom{6}{3} = 20$.
If (1,1) is removed, the graph essentially splits into two disjoint "side paths" that must be maintained:
- Path A: $(0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,1)-(2,2)$ (uses pads $(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)$ from $R_1$)
- Path B: $(0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(1,2)-(2,2)$ (uses pads $(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)$ from $R_1$)
For the graph to remain connected, at least one of Path A or Path B must exist.
A path exists if *none* of its constituent removable pads are removed.
- If Path A remains: This means we removed 3 pads from $R_1 \setminus \{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\} = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$. There is $\binom{3}{3}=1$ way: remove $\{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$. So, the set of 4 removed pads is $\{(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\}$. This leaves Path A.
- If Path B remains: This means we removed 3 pads from $R_1 \setminus \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)\} = \{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. There is $\binom{3}{3}=1$ way: remove $\{(1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. So, the set of 4 removed pads is $\{(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\}$. This leaves Path B.
These two combinations are disjoint. So, there are 2 connected combinations when (1,1) is removed.

**Case 2: (1,1) remains.**
If (1,1) remains, we need to remove 4 pads from the remaining 6 removable pads (excluding (1,1)): $R_1 = \{(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\}$.
Total ways to remove 4 from these 6 is $\binom{6}{4} = 15$.
For the graph to remain connected with (1,1) present, two conditions must be met:
1.  There must be at least one path from (0,0) to (1,1). This means not both (1,0) and (0,1) are removed.
2.  There must be at least one path from (1,1) to (2,2). This means not both (1,2) and (2,1) are removed.

Let $N_S = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$ (neighbors of (0,0) among $R_1$).
Let $N_T = \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$ (neighbors of (2,2) among $R_1$).
Let $N_O = \{(0,2), (2,0)\}$ (other pads in $R_1$).
We need to count combinations of 4 pads removed from $R_1$ that *do not* remove both $N_S$ and *do not* remove both $N_T$.
Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for disconnected cases (where (1,1) remains):
- Disconnected due to $N_S$ removal: Remove $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$ (2 pads), plus 2 more from $R_1 \setminus N_S = N_T \cup N_O$ (4 pads). $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.
- Disconnected due to $N_T$ removal: Remove $\{(1,2), (2,1)\}$ (2 pads), plus 2 more from $R_1 \setminus N_T = N_S \cup N_O$ (4 pads). $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.
- Overlap (both $N_S$ and $N_T$ removed): Remove $\{(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\}$. This is exactly 4 pads. $\binom{0}{0} = 1$ way.
Total disconnected combinations when (1,1) remains = $6 + 6 - 1 = 11$.
Total connected combinations when (1,1) remains = (Total ways to remove 4 from $R_1$) - (Disconnected ways from $R_1$) = $15 - 11 = 4$.

**Total Connected Combinations:**
Summing the connected combinations from Case 1 and Case 2:
Total connected = 2 (from Case 1: (1,1) removed) + 4 (from Case 2: (1,1) remains) = 6 ways.

**Total Disconnected Combinations:**
The problem asks for the number of ways Kevin cannot get home, which means the graph is disconnected.
Total disconnected ways = (Total ways to remove 4 pads) - (Total connected ways)
Total disconnected ways = $35 - 6 = 29$.

The number of ways to remove 4 lily pads so that Kevin cannot get home is 29.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
29
