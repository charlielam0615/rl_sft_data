### Problem Statement
Equilateral triangles $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle D E F$ are drawn such that points $B, E, F$, and $C$ lie on a line in this order, and point $D$ lies inside triangle $\triangle A B C$. If $B E=14, E F=15$, and $F C=16$, compute $A D$.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning): To find the coordinates of $A$ and $D$, we need to determine the side lengths of $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle D E F$. The side length of $\triangle D E F$ is given as $E F = 15$. The points $B, E, F, C$ are collinear, and $B E=14, E F=15, F C=16$. The side length of $\triangle A B C$ is $B C = B E + E F + F C$.

[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation): Calculate the side length of $\triangle A B C$ using the given segment lengths on the line.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Current Goal: Determine the side lengths of $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle D E F$.
The side length of $\triangle D E F$ is $E F = 15$.
The points $B, E, F, C$ lie on a line in this order. The side length of $\triangle A B C$ is $B C = B E + E F + F C = 14 + 15 + 16 = 45$.
So, the side length of $\triangle A B C$ is 45 and the side length of $\triangle D E F$ is 15.

Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of points $A$ and $D$.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning): To determine the coordinates of $A$ and $D$, we need to set up a coordinate system. A convenient choice is to place the line containing $B, E, F, C$ on the x-axis. We can place point $B$ at the origin (0, 0).

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation): Set up the coordinate system with $B$ at the origin and the line $BCEF$ on the x-axis. Determine the coordinates of $B, E, F, C$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Current Goal: Set up a coordinate system and determine the coordinates of $B, E, F, C$.
Let $B = (0, 0)$. Since $B, E, F, C$ are on the x-axis in that order:
$E = (B E, 0) = (14, 0)$
$F = (B E + E F, 0) = (14 + 15, 0) = (29, 0)$
$C = (B E + E F + F C, 0) = (14 + 15 + 16, 0) = (45, 0)$
So, $B=(0, 0)$, $E=(14, 0)$, $F=(29, 0)$, $C=(45, 0)$.

        5. Determine the coordinates of $A$ and $D$ using the side lengths and base coordinates.
Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of $A$ and $D$ using the side lengths and base coordinates.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation): Determine the coordinates of point $A$. $\triangle A B C$ is equilateral with side length 45. The base $B C$ is on the x-axis from (0, 0) to (45, 0). The x-coordinate of $A$ is the midpoint of $B C$, and the y-coordinate is the height of the equilateral triangle.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of $A$ and $D$ using the side lengths and base coordinates.
Coordinates of $A$:
The midpoint of $B C$ is $((0+45)/2, (0+0)/2) = (22.5, 0)$.
The height of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $h = s \sqrt{3} / 2$.
For $\triangle A B C$, $s=45$. The height is $45 \sqrt{3} / 2$.
Since $D$ lies inside $\triangle A B C$, $A$ must be above the x-axis (positive y-coordinate).
So, $A = (22.5, 45 \sqrt{3} / 2)$.
[/IMP]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation): Determine the coordinates of point $D$. $\triangle D E F$ is equilateral with side length 15. The base $E F$ is on the x-axis from (14, 0) to (29, 0). The x-coordinate of $D$ is the midpoint of $E F$, and the y-coordinate is the height of the equilateral triangle. Since $D$ is inside $\triangle A B C$, and $A$ is above the x-axis, $D$ must also be above the x-axis.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Current Goal: Determine the coordinates of $A$ and $D$ using the side lengths and base coordinates.
Coordinates of $D$:
The midpoint of $E F$ is $((14+29)/2, (0+0)/2) = (43/2, 0) = (21.5, 0)$.
The height of an equilateral triangle with side length $s=15$ is $15 \sqrt{3} / 2$.
So, $D = (21.5, 15 \sqrt{3} / 2)$.

### Step 17
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation): Compute the distance between points $A$ and $D$ using their coordinates.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Current Goal: Compute $A D$.
$A = (22.5, 45 \sqrt{3} / 2)$
$D = (21.5, 15 \sqrt{3} / 2)$
The distance $A D$ is given by the distance formula:
$A D = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
$A D = \sqrt{(21.5 - 22.5)^2 + (15 \sqrt{3} / 2 - 45 \sqrt{3} / 2)^2}$
$A D = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + ((15 - 45) \sqrt{3} / 2)^2}$
$A D = \sqrt{1 + (-30 \sqrt{3} / 2)^2}$
$A D = \sqrt{1 + (-15 \sqrt{3})^2}$
$A D = \sqrt{1 + (15^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2)}$
$A D = \sqrt{1 + (225 \times 3)}$
$A D = \sqrt{1 + 675}$
$A D = \sqrt{676}$
$A D = 26$
