### Problem Restatement
Joshua has 9 cards, each displaying the number 9, arranged in a row. He places a multiplication sign between two of the 9s, splitting the row into two strings of 9s (e.g., 999 × 999999). The product of these two strings is calculated, and all possible distinct products are considered (noting that a × b = b × a). Let S be the sum of all distinct products. The task is to find the sum of the digits of S.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Determine the possible ways to split 9 cards into two strings.  
**How to Achieve**: The multiplication sign can be placed between any two consecutive cards, splitting the 9 cards into two non-empty strings of lengths k and 9-k, where k ranges from 1 to 8. Since the product is commutative (e.g., 999 × 999999 = 999999 × 999), we consider splits where the first string has length k ≤ 4 to avoid duplicates (as k and 9-k yield the same product).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
There are 8 possible positions for the multiplication sign (between the 1st and 2nd card, 2nd and 3rd, ..., 8th and 9th). This creates pairs of string lengths: (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1). Since multiplication is commutative, the distinct pairs are:
- k = 1: (1, 8) → 9 × 99999999
- k = 2: (2, 7) → 99 × 9999999
- k = 3: (3, 6) → 999 × 999999
- k = 4: (4, 5) → 9999 × 99999

Thus, there are 4 distinct products based on string lengths (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5).

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of the digits of S, where S is the sum of all distinct products.
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the possible ways to split 9 cards into two strings (Completed: Identified 4 distinct pairs: (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5)).
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the product for each unique split.
  - Subgoal 3: Identify and collect all distinct products.
  - Subgoal 4: Compute the sum S of these distinct products.
  - Subgoal 5: Calculate the sum of the digits of S.

**Current Goal**: Calculate the product for each unique split.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the product for each unique split.  
**How to Achieve**: For each distinct pair (k, 9-k), compute the product of 10^k - 1 and 10^(9-k) - 1, where 10^n - 1 represents a string of n nines (e.g., 10^3 - 1 = 999).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Calculate the products for k = 1, 2, 3, 4:
- k = 1: (10^1 - 1) × (10^8 - 1) = 9 × 99999999 = 899999991.
- k = 2: (10^2 - 1) × (10^7 - 1) = 99 × 9999999 = 989999901.
- k = 3: (10^3 - 1) × (10^6 - 1) = 999 × 999999 = 998999001.
- k = 4: (10^4 - 1) × (10^5 - 1) = 9999 × 99999 = 999899991.

Products:
- (1, 8): 899999991
- (2, 7): 989999901
- (3, 6): 998999001
- (4, 5): 999899991
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that all distinct products have been calculated correctly.  
**How to Achieve**: Check the calculations for each product and confirm that no splits were missed and that products are distinct.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify calculations:
- k = 1: 9 × 99999999 = 899999991 (9 × (10^8 - 1) = 9 × 10^8 - 9 = 899999991).
- k = 2: 99 × 9999999 = 989999901 (99 × (10^7 - 1) = 99 × 10^7 - 99 = 989999901).
- k = 3: 999 × 999999 = 998999001 (999 × (10^6 - 1) = 999 × 10^6 - 999 = 998999001).
- k = 4: 9999 × 99999 = 999899991 (9999 × (10^5 - 1) = 9999 × 10^5 - 9999 = 999899991).

Confirm splits: The pairs (k, 9-k) for k = 1 to 4 cover all distinct products since (5, 4), (6, 3), etc., are duplicates due to commutativity. All products are distinct (different digit patterns and values).
