The problem asks to compute the sum of the infinite series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{sgn}\left(\sin \left(2^{n}\right)\right)}{2^{n}}$, where $\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is defined as $1$ for $x > 0$, $-1$ for $x < 0$, and $0$ for $x = 0$. The arguments to sin are in radians.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
**Current Goal:** Understand the problem and identify main components and challenges.
**Subgoals:**
1.  Analyze the term $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$. This is the most crucial part.
    *   Determine when $\sin(2^n)$ is positive, negative, or zero. This depends on the value of $2^n$ modulo $2\pi$.
    *   Specifically, we need to know if $2^n \pmod{2\pi}$ falls into $(0, \pi)$, $(\pi, 2\pi)$, or exactly $0$ or $\pi$.
2.  Once the values of $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$ are determined for each $n$, the series will transform into a sum of terms of the form $\pm \frac{1}{2^n}$.
3.  Identify any patterns or properties of the sequence $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$ that might simplify the summation.
4.  Compute the sum of the resulting series.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
**Current Goal:** Determine the value of the series.
**Subgoals:**
1.  Simplify the term $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$ into a more manageable form, specifically proving $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(x)) = (-1)^{\lfloor x/\pi \rfloor}$ and applying it to $x=2^n$.
2.  Research or recall known identities for series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n x \rfloor}}{2^n}$.
3.  Verify the conditions for applying the identified identity (e.g., $x \in (0,1)$ and $x$ is not a dyadic rational).
4.  Apply the identity with $x=1/\pi$ to compute the sum.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Simplify the term $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$ into $(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n/\pi \rfloor}$.
**How to achieve:** Analyze the definition of $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(x))$ by considering the sign of $\sin(x)$ in intervals of $x$ and relating these intervals to the floor of $x/\pi$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The function $\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is defined as $1$ if $x > 0$, $-1$ if $x < 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$.
First, we observe that $2^n$ is never an integer multiple of $\pi$ for any integer $n \ge 1$, because $\pi$ is a transcendental number. This implies that $\sin(2^n)$ is never zero. Therefore, $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n))$ will always be either $1$ or $-1$.

The sign of $\sin(x)$ depends on the interval $x$ falls into modulo $2\pi$:
*   If $x \in (2k\pi, (2k+1)\pi)$ for some integer $k$, then $\sin(x) > 0$. In this case, dividing by $\pi$, we get $\frac{x}{\pi} \in (2k, 2k+1)$, which means $\lfloor \frac{x}{\pi} \rfloor = 2k$ (an even integer).
*   If $x \in ((2k+1)\pi, (2k+2)\pi)$ for some integer $k$, then $\sin(x) < 0$. In this case, $\frac{x}{\pi} \in (2k+1, 2k+2)$, which means $\lfloor \frac{x}{\pi} \rfloor = 2k+1$ (an odd integer).

From these observations, we can conclude that $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(x)) = (-1)^{\lfloor x/\pi \rfloor}$.
Substituting $x=2^n$, the term in the sum becomes $\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(2^n)) = (-1)^{\lfloor 2^n/\pi \rfloor}$.
Thus, the given sum can be rewritten as:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n/\pi \rfloor}}{2^n}
$$

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Identify a known identity for series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n x \rfloor}}{2^n}$.
**How to achieve:** Recall or research standard mathematical identities related to binary representations and sums involving floor functions.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A known identity in number theory states that for any real number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$ and $x$ is not a dyadic rational (i.e., $x \neq k/2^m$ for integers $k, m$), the following holds:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n x \rfloor}}{2^n} = 1 - 2x
$$
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Validation (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Verify the conditions for applying the identified identity with $x=1/\pi$.
**How to achieve:** Check if $1/\pi$ is within the range $(0,1)$ and if it is a dyadic rational.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We need to check two conditions for $x = 1/\pi$ to apply the identity:
1.  Is $0 < 1/\pi < 1$?
    We know that $\pi \approx 3.14159$. Therefore, $1/\pi \approx 1/3.14159 \approx 0.3183$. Since $0 < 0.3183 < 1$, the first condition is satisfied.
2.  Is $1/\pi$ not a dyadic rational?
    A dyadic rational is a number of the form $k/2^m$ for integers $k, m$. If $1/\pi$ were a dyadic rational, then $1/\pi = k/2^m$, which would imply $\pi = 2^m/k$. This would mean $\pi$ is a rational number. However, $\pi$ is a well-known irrational (and transcendental) number. Therefore, $1/\pi$ is not a dyadic rational.
Both conditions for applying the identity are satisfied.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Compute the sum using the identified identity and verified conditions.
**How to achieve:** Substitute $x=1/\pi$ into the identity $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n x \rfloor}}{2^n} = 1 - 2x$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Using the identity $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n x \rfloor}}{2^n} = 1 - 2x$ with $x = 1/\pi$, we can directly compute the sum:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\operatorname{sgn}\left(\sin \left(2^{n}\right)\right)}{2^{n}} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor 2^n/\pi \rfloor}}{2^{n}} = 1 - 2\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right) = 1 - \frac{2}{\pi}
$$
