### Problem Statement
Compute the number of ways to pick two rectangles in a $5 \times 5$ grid of squares such that the edges of the rectangles lie on the lines of the grid and the rectangles do not overlap at their interiors, edges, or vertices. The order in which the rectangles are chosen does not matter.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
The overall goal is to count non-overlapping pairs of rectangles in a 5x5 grid. A sub-goal is to first determine the total number of possible rectangles in a 5x5 grid.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the total number of possible rectangles in a 5x5 grid.
How to achieve the goal: A rectangle is defined by choosing two distinct horizontal lines and two distinct vertical lines. In a 5x5 grid, there are 6 horizontal lines and 6 vertical lines.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
In a $5 \times 5$ grid, there are $5+1=6$ horizontal lines and $5+1=6$ vertical lines. To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 distinct horizontal lines and 2 distinct vertical lines. The number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines from 6 is $\binom{6}{2}$. The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 6 is $\binom{6}{2}$.
The total number of rectangles is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} \times \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15 \times 15 = 225$.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
We have found the total number of rectangles. The next sub-goal is to find the number of pairs of overlapping rectangles and subtract this from the total number of pairs of rectangles. Alternatively, we can directly count the number of non-overlapping pairs. Let's try to count non-overlapping pairs directly. A pair of non-overlapping rectangles can be categorized based on their relative positions. They can be side-by-side (horizontally or vertically) or one can be completely above/below or left/right of the other. This seems complex. Let's refine the approach. We can consider fixing one rectangle and then counting the number of rectangles that do not overlap with it.
Let's refine the sub-goal: Iterate through all possible first rectangles, and for each first rectangle, count the number of non-overlapping second rectangles.

The current goal is to iterate through all possible first rectangles and for each, count non-overlapping second rectangles.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
The current goal is to iterate through all possible first rectangles and count non-overlapping second rectangles. To do this systematically, we need a way to represent a rectangle and iterate through all possibilities. A rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners, or by the indices of the horizontal and vertical lines that form its boundaries.
Let a rectangle be defined by $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the top-left corner and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the bottom-right corner, with $1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le 5$ and $1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le 5$.
Alternatively, let a rectangle be defined by the indices of the chosen horizontal lines $h_1, h_2$ and vertical lines $v_1, v_2$, where $1 \le h_1 < h_2 \le 6$ and $1 \le v_1 < v_2 \le 6$.
Let's use the line index representation. A rectangle is defined by $(h_1, h_2, v_1, v_2)$.

Sub-goal: For a fixed rectangle $R_1$ defined by $(h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$, determine the number of rectangles $R_2$ defined by $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2}, v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ such that $R_1$ and $R_2$ do not overlap.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Recall Info (Review)
Current Goal: For a fixed rectangle $R_1$ defined by $(h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$, determine the number of rectangles $R_2$ defined by $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2}, v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ such that $R_1$ and $R_2$ do not overlap.
Meta-data for recall: Previous steps discuss the representation of a rectangle and the overall problem.
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
From Step 2, we know the total number of rectangles is 225.
From Step 5, a rectangle can be represented by $(h_1, h_2, v_1, v_2)$ where $1 \le h_1 < h_2 \le 6$ and $1 \le v_1 < v_2 \le 6$.
The current goal is to count non-overlapping rectangles with a fixed first rectangle. Two rectangles do not overlap if they are separated either horizontally or vertically.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
We need to count rectangles $R_2$ that do not overlap with a fixed $R_1$. $R_2$ does not overlap with $R_1$ if either $R_2$ is entirely to the left of $R_1$, entirely to the right of $R_1$, entirely above $R_1$, or entirely below $R_1$.
Let $R_1$ be defined by horizontal lines $h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}$ and vertical lines $v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}$.
$R_2$ is entirely to the left of $R_1$ if $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$.
$R_2$ is entirely to the right of $R_1$ if $v_{2,1} \ge v_{1,2}$.
$R_2$ is entirely above $R_1$ if $h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}$.
$R_2$ is entirely below $R_1$ if $h_{2,1} \ge h_{1,2}$.

Note that these conditions are not mutually exclusive (e.g., a rectangle can be entirely to the left and entirely above). We need to be careful with double counting.

Sub-goal: For a fixed $R_1$, calculate the number of rectangles $R_2$ that are entirely to the left of $R_1$.
Sub-goal: For a fixed $R_1$, calculate the number of rectangles $R_2$ that are entirely to the right of $R_1$.
Sub-goal: For a fixed $R_1$, calculate the number of rectangles $R_2$ that are entirely above $R_1$.
Sub-goal: For a fixed $R_1$, calculate the number of rectangles $R_2$ that are entirely below $R_1$.
Then, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of non-overlapping rectangles for a fixed $R_1$. This seems complicated.

Let's consider a simpler approach.
Two rectangles $R_1$ and $R_2$ overlap if and only if their projections onto both the x-axis and the y-axis overlap.
Let $R_1$ span from column $c_{1,1}$ to $c_{1,2}$ and row $r_{1,1}$ to $r_{1,2}$.
Let $R_2$ span from column $c_{2,1}$ to $c_{2,2}$ and row $r_{2,1}$ to $r_{2,2}$.
Overlap occurs if $[c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}] \cap [c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}]$ is not empty AND $[r_{1,1}, r_{1,2}] \cap [r_{2,1}, r_{2,2}]$ is not empty.
Non-overlap occurs if $[c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}] \cap [c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}]$ is empty OR $[r_{1,1}, r_{1,2}] \cap [r_{2,1}, r_{2,2}]$ is empty.
This means either $c_{1,2} \le c_{2,1}$ or $c_{2,2} \le c_{1,1}$ (no horizontal overlap) OR $r_{1,2} \le r_{2,1}$ or $r_{2,2} \le r_{1,1}$ (no vertical overlap).

Let's go back to the line index representation. $R_1$ is $(h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$ and $R_2$ is $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2}, v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$.
No horizontal overlap means $v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}$ or $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$.
No vertical overlap means $h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1}$ or $h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}$.
Non-overlap of rectangles means (No horizontal overlap) OR (No vertical overlap).

Let $N(R_1)$ be the number of rectangles that do not overlap with $R_1$.
$N(R_1) = |\{R_2 | (v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1} \text{ or } v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}) \text{ or } (h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1} \text{ or } h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1})\}|$
Using inclusion-exclusion:
$N(R_1) = |\{R_2 | v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1} \text{ or } v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}\}| + |\{R_2 | h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1} \text{ or } h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}\}| - |\{R_2 | (v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1} \text{ or } v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}) \text{ and } (h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1} \text{ or } h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1})\}|$

Let $N_H(R_1)$ be the number of rectangles with no horizontal overlap with $R_1$.
$N_V(R_1)$ be the number of rectangles with no vertical overlap with $R_1$.
$N_{HV}(R_1)$ be the number of rectangles with no horizontal and no vertical overlap with $R_1$.
$N(R_1) = N_H(R_1) + N_V(R_1) - N_{HV}(R_1)$.

$N_H(R_1) = |\{R_2 | v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}\}| + |\{R_2 | v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}\}|$. Note that $v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}$ and $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$ cannot both be true since $v_{2,1} < v_{2,2}$ and $v_{1,1} < v_{1,2}$. So no inclusion-exclusion needed here.
$N_H(R_1) = (\text{number of rectangles to the right of } R_1) + (\text{number of rectangles to the left of } R_1)$.
Number of rectangles to the right of $R_1$: $v_{2,1}$ can be $v_{1,2}, v_{1,2}+1, \dots, 5$. So $v_{2,1}$ can be chosen in $6 - v_{1,2}$ ways. $v_{2,2}$ must be greater than $v_{2,1}$, so $v_{2,2}$ can be chosen in $6 - v_{2,1}$ ways. The number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ with $v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1} < v_{2,2} \le 6$ is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}$. The number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6}{2} = 15$. So, number to the right is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} \times 15$.
Number of rectangles to the left of $R_1$: $v_{2,2}$ can be $v_{1,1}, v_{1,1}-1, \dots, 2$. So $v_{2,2}$ can be chosen in $v_{1,1}-1$ ways. $v_{2,1}$ must be less than $v_{2,2}$, so $v_{2,1}$ can be chosen in $v_{2,2}-1$ ways. The number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ with $1 \le v_{2,1} < v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$ is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}$. The number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6}{2} = 15$. So, number to the left is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} \times 15$.
$N_H(R_1) = 15 \times (\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2})$.

Similarly, $N_V(R_1) = 15 \times (\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2})$.

$N_{HV}(R_1)$: No horizontal and no vertical overlap.
This means ($v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}$ or $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$) AND ($h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1}$ or $h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}$).
This expands to four cases:
1. $v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}$ and $h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1}$ (to the right and below)
   Number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}$. Number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$. Product is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$.
2. $v_{1,2} \le v_{2,1}$ and $h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}$ (to the right and above)
   Number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}$. Number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}$. Product is $\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}$.
3. $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$ and $h_{1,2} \le h_{2,1}$ (to the left and below)
   Number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}$. Number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$. Product is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$.
4. $v_{2,2} \le v_{1,1}$ and $h_{2,2} \le h_{1,1}$ (to the left and above)
   Number of choices for $(v_{2,1}, v_{2,2})$ is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}$. Number of choices for $(h_{2,1}, h_{2,2})$ is $\binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}$. Product is $\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}$.

$N_{HV}(R_1) = \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}$
$N_{HV}(R_1) = (\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}) \times (\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2})$.

So, for a fixed rectangle $R_1$ defined by $(h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$, the number of non-overlapping rectangles $N(R_1)$ is:
$N(R_1) = 15 (\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}) + 15 (\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2}) - (\binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2}) (\binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2} + \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2})$.

Let $A = \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}$ and $B = \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$.
$N(R_1) = 15A + 15B - AB$.

The total number of ordered pairs of non-overlapping rectangles is $\sum_{R_1} N(R_1)$.
Since the order does not matter, the final answer is $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{R_1} N(R_1)$.

Sub-goal: Iterate through all possible rectangles $R_1$ and calculate $N(R_1)$ for each.
Sub-goal: Sum up all $N(R_1)$ values.
Sub-goal: Divide the sum by 2.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To iterate through all possible rectangles $R_1$, we need to iterate through all possible values of $h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}$ such that $1 \le h_{1,1} < h_{1,2} \le 6$ and $1 \le v_{1,1} < v_{1,2} \le 6$.

Sub-goal: Create a loop structure to iterate through all valid $(h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$ combinations.
Sub-goal: Inside the loop, calculate $A = \binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}$ and $B = \binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}$.
Sub-goal: Calculate $N(R_1) = 15A + 15B - AB$.
Sub-goal: Maintain a running sum of $N(R_1)$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Implement the iteration and summation process.
How to achieve the goal: Use nested loops for $h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}, v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}$ with the given constraints and calculate the sum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We need to compute $\sum_{h_{1,1}=1}^5 \sum_{h_{1,2}=h_{1,1}+1}^6 \sum_{v_{1,1}=1}^5 \sum_{v_{1,2}=v_{1,1}+1}^6 (15 (\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}) + 15 (\binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}) - (\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2}) (\binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2}))$.

Let's define a helper function for binomial coefficient: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ if $0 \le k \le n$, otherwise 0.

We can separate the summations over $h$ and $v$.
Let $S_v = \sum_{v_{1,1}=1}^5 \sum_{v_{1,2}=v_{1,1}+1}^6 (\binom{v_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-v_{1,2}}{2})$.
Let $S_h = \sum_{h_{1,1}=1}^5 \sum_{h_{1,2}=h_{1,1}+1}^6 (\binom{h_{1,1}-1}{2} + \binom{6-h_{1,2}}{2})$.
By symmetry, $S_v = S_h$.

The total sum is $\sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} (15A + 15B - AB)$.
This is $\sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} 15A + \sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} 15B - \sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} AB$.

$\sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} 15A = \sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} 15 \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} A = \binom{6}{2} \times 15 \times S_v = 15 \times 15 \times S_v = 225 S_v$.
$\sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} 15B = \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} 15 \sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} B = \binom{6}{2} \times 15 \times S_h = 15 \times 15 \times S_h = 225 S_h$.
$\sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} AB = \sum_{h_{1,1}, h_{1,2}} B \sum_{v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}} A = S_h \times S_v$.

Total sum = $225 S_v + 225 S_h - S_h S_v$. Since $S_v = S_h$, let $S = S_v = S_h$.
Total sum = $225S + 225S - S^2 = 450S - S^2$.

Now we need to calculate $S = \sum_{i=1}^5 \sum_{j=i+1}^6 (\binom{i-1}{2} + \binom{6-j}{2})$.

Let's calculate the inner sum: $\sum_{j=i+1}^6 (\binom{i-1}{2} + \binom{6-j}{2})$.
$\sum_{j=i+1}^6 \binom{i-1}{2} = (6 - (i+1) + 1) \binom{i-1}{2} = (6 - i) \binom{i-1}{2}$.
$\sum_{j=i+1}^6 \binom{6-j}{2}$. Let $k = 6-j$. When $j=i+1, k=5-i$. When $j=6, k=0$.
The sum is $\sum_{k=0}^{5-i} \binom{k}{2} = \binom{5-i+1}{2+1} = \binom{6-i}{3}$ using the identity $\sum_{k=r}^n \binom{k}{r} = \binom{n+1}{r+1}$.

So the inner sum is $(6 - i) \binom{i-1}{2} + \binom{6-i}{3}$.

Now we need to sum this over $i$ from 1 to 5:
$S = \sum_{i=1}^5 ((6 - i) \binom{i-1}{2} + \binom{6-i}{3})$.

Let's calculate the terms:
i=1: $(6-1)\binom{0}{2} + \binom{5}{3} = 5 \times 0 + 10 = 10$.
i=2: $(6-2)\binom{1}{2} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 0 + 4 = 4$.
i=3: $(6-3)\binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{3} = 3 \times 1 + 1 = 4$.
i=4: $(6-4)\binom{3}{2} + \binom{2}{3} = 2 \times 3 + 0 = 6$.
i=5: $(6-5)\binom{4}{2} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 \times 6 + 0 = 6$.

$S = 10 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 30$.

The total sum of $N(R_1)$ is $450S - S^2 = 450 \times 30 - 30^2 = 13500 - 900 = 12600$.

Since the order of picking rectangles does not matter, we divide by 2.
Number of ways = $\frac{12600}{2} = 6300$.
