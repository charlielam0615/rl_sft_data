### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand what it means for \( n \) to have exactly 25 divisors.  
**How to Achieve**: Define the number of divisors of a positive integer \( n \) based on its prime factorization and clarify the requirement that this number equals 25.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The number of divisors of a positive integer \( n \) with prime factorization \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \) is given by the formula \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \), where \( p_i \) are distinct primes and \( e_i \) are their exponents. For \( n \) to have exactly 25 divisors, we need:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) = 25. \]
This means the product of the exponents plus one for each prime factor must equal 25.

### Step 3: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express the number of divisors of \( n \) in terms of its prime factorization and find possible factorizations of 25.  
**How to Achieve**: Factorize 25 into integer factors (since each \( e_i + 1 \) is a positive integer) and interpret these as the number of terms \( (e_i + 1) \) in the divisor formula.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Since the number of divisors must be 25, we need:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) = 25. \]
Factorize 25:
- \( 25 = 25 \), corresponding to one prime with \( e_1 + 1 = 25 \), so \( e_1 = 24 \).
- \( 25 = 5 \times 5 \), corresponding to two primes with \( e_1 + 1 = 5 \), \( e_2 + 1 = 5 \), so \( e_1 = 4 \), \( e_2 = 4 \).
- \( 25 = 5 \times 5 \times 1 \), corresponding to three primes with \( e_1 + 1 = 5 \), \( e_2 + 1 = 5 \), \( e_3 + 1 = 1 \), so \( e_1 = 4 \), \( e_2 = 4 \), \( e_3 = 0 \). Since \( e_3 = 0 \) implies the third prime is not used, this reduces to the two-prime case.
Thus, the possible forms for \( n \) are:
- One prime: \( n = p^{24} \).
- Two primes: \( n = p^4 q^4 \).

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Main Goal: Find the smallest positive integer \( n \) with exactly 25 divisors.
  - Subgoal 1: Understand the divisor formula (completed).
  - Subgoal 2: Express the number of divisors as a product equaling 25 (completed).
  - Subgoal 3: Determine the prime factorization of \( n \) (partially completed: identified forms \( p^{24} \) and \( p^4 q^4 \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Find the smallest \( n \) by evaluating the possible factorizations.
  - Subgoal 5: Verify the solution.
**Current Goal**: Find the smallest \( n \) by evaluating the possible factorizations.
[/REVIEW]

---

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Find the smallest \( n \) by evaluating the possible factorizations \( p^{24} \) and \( p^4 q^4 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the smallest possible primes (\( p = 2 \), \( q = 3 \), etc.) to compute \( n \) for each factorization and select the smallest value.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
To minimize \( n \), use the smallest primes:
- **Case 1: \( n = p^{24} \)**  
  Smallest prime is \( p = 2 \). Compute:
  \[ n = 2^{24} = 16,777,216. \]
  Number of divisors: \( 24 + 1 = 25 \).

- **Case 2: \( n = p^4 q^4 \)**  
  Smallest primes are \( p = 2 \), \( q = 3 \). Compute:
  \[ n = 2^4 \cdot 3^4 = 16 \cdot 81 = 1,296. \]
  Number of divisors: \( (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \).

Compare:
- \( 2^{24} = 16,777,216 \).
- \( 2^4 \cdot 3^4 = 1,296 \).
Since \( 1,296 < 16,777,216 \), test if a different prime combination yields a smaller \( n \):
- Try \( p = 2 \), \( q = 5 \):
  \[ n = 2^4 \cdot 5^4 = 16 \cdot 625 = 10,000. \]
  Divisors: \( (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 25 \).
- Try \( p = 3 \), \( q = 5 \):
  \[ n = 3^4 \cdot 5^4 = 81 \cdot 625 = 50,625. \]
  Divisors: \( (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 25 \).

Smallest \( n \): \( 2^4 \cdot 3^4 = 1,296 \).
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that \( n = 1,296 \) is the smallest positive integer with exactly 25 divisors.  
**How to Achieve**: Confirm the number of divisors for \( n = 1,296 \) and check if any smaller \( n \) has 25 divisors.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
For \( n = 1,296 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4 \):
- Number of divisors: \( (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \).
- Check smaller \( n \), e.g., \( n = 2^3 \cdot 3^5 = 8 \cdot 243 = 1,944 \):
  - Divisors: \( (3 + 1)(5 + 1) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \). Too few.
- Try \( n = 2^5 \cdot 3^3 = 32 \cdot 27 = 864 \):
  - Divisors: \( (5 + 1)(3 + 1) = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \). Too few.
- Single prime, e.g., \( n = 2^{24} = 16,777,216 \), is much larger.
No smaller \( n \) with exactly 25 divisors is found, as other factorizations (e.g., three primes) yield larger numbers or fewer divisors.
