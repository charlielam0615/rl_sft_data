### Problem Statement
Albert writes $2025$ numbers $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{2025}$ in a circle on a blackboard. Initially, each of the numbers is uniformly and independently sampled at random from the interval $[0,1]$. Then, each second, he \emph{simultaneously} replaces $a_{i}$ with $\max \left(a_{i-1}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, 2025$ (where $a_{0}=a_{2025}$ and $a_{2026}=a_{1}$ ). Compute the expected value of the number of distinct values remaining after $100$ seconds.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
The problem asks for the expected number of distinct values after 100 seconds. This involves understanding the process of how the numbers change over time and how the number of distinct values evolves. A key observation might be how the maximum operation affects the values and their distribution.
Subgoal 1: Understand the dynamics of the numbers over time.
Subgoal 2: Determine the state of the system after 100 seconds.
Subgoal 3: Determine the number of distinct values in the state after 100 seconds.
Subgoal 4: Compute the expected value of the number of distinct values.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Current Goal: Understand the dynamics of the numbers over time.
To understand the dynamics, we need to analyze the operation $a_{i} \leftarrow \max(a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1})$.
Subgoal 1.1: Analyze the effect of the max operation on individual elements.
Subgoal 1.2: Analyze the effect of the max operation on the set of values as a whole.
Subgoal 1.3: Identify any properties of the sequence that are preserved or emerge over time.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Analyze the effect of the max operation on individual elements.
The operation $a_i \leftarrow \max(a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1})$ means that each number is replaced by the maximum of itself and its two neighbors. This implies that the values are non-decreasing over time.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The value of $a_i$ at time $t+1$ is $a_i(t+1) = \max(a_{i-1}(t), a_i(t), a_{i+1}(t))$. Since $a_i(t) \le \max(a_{i-1}(t), a_i(t), a_{i+1}(t))$, we have $a_i(t+1) \ge a_i(t)$. Thus, each individual number is non-decreasing over time.
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Analyze the effect of the max operation on the set of values as a whole.
As individual values are non-decreasing, the set of values will also change. The maximum value in the circle can only increase or stay the same. Once a value reaches the maximum value in the circle, it will remain that value.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The set of values $\{a_1(t), \ldots, a_{2025}(t)\}$ at time $t+1$ is related to the set at time $t$. The maximum value in the set at time $t+1$ is $\max_{i} a_i(t+1) = \max_i \max(a_{i-1}(t), a_i(t), a_{i+1}(t)) = \max_i a_i(t)$. So the maximum value in the circle remains constant over time.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Identify any properties of the sequence that are preserved or emerge over time.
Consider the values that are local maxima. If $a_i > a_{i-1}$ and $a_i > a_{i+1}$, then $a_i(t+1) = a_i(t)$. If $a_i$ is part of a non-decreasing sequence of length at least 3, its value will propagate.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A key property is the propagation of maximum values. If $a_i$ is the maximum value among $a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1}$, then $a_i$ retains its value. If $a_i$ is a local maximum, it will remain a local maximum (or expand its region). Over time, the maximum value in the initial configuration will spread. A block of consecutive identical values, once formed, will maintain its values and can potentially expand.

Current Goal: Determine the state of the system after 100 seconds.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Current Goal: Determine the state of the system after 100 seconds.
Consider the effect of the operation over multiple steps. A value $a_i$ at time $t+1$ depends on values in a window of size 3 at time $t$. At time $t+k$, $a_i$ will depend on values in a window of size $2k+1$ centered at $i$ at time $t$.
Subgoal 2.1: Analyze the spread of maximum values.
Subgoal 2.2: Understand the structure of the sequence after a large number of steps.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Analyze the spread of maximum values.
If a value $M$ is the maximum in a neighborhood, it will propagate to its neighbors in the next step. If $a_i = M$, then $a_{i-1}(t+1) = \max(a_{i-2}, a_{i-1}, a_i) \ge a_i = M$ and $a_{i+1}(t+1) = \max(a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) \ge a_i = M$. Since values are non-decreasing and the maximum value is $M$, $a_{i-1}(t+1)$ and $a_{i+1}(t+1)$ will become $M$ if their neighbors include $M$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
If $a_i(t)$ is the maximum value in the circle, then $a_{i-1}(t+1) \ge a_i(t)$ and $a_{i+1}(t+1) \ge a_i(t)$. Since the maximum value in the circle is constant, $a_{i-1}(t+1)$ and $a_{i+1}(t+1)$ will become the maximum value if they were not already. This means the maximum value spreads outwards from its initial locations.
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Understand the structure of the sequence after a large number of steps.
After a sufficient number of steps, the maximum value in the initial configuration will have spread throughout the circle. The question is what other values remain.
Consider the values less than the maximum. They are non-decreasing and are influenced by their neighbors.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
After a large number of steps, the sequence will consist of blocks of identical values. The maximum value will occupy at least one block. The boundaries between different values will be where the maximum operation selected a neighbor's value. Specifically, a value $v$ can only exist if it was one of the initial values and it hasn't been "overwritten" by a larger value from its neighborhood within a certain number of steps.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Current Goal: Determine the number of distinct values in the state after 100 seconds.
After 100 seconds, a value $a_i(100)$ is the maximum of the initial values in the window $[i-100, i+100]$ (indices are taken modulo 2025).
The distinct values remaining will be a subset of the initial values.
Subgoal 3.1: Characterize which initial values can persist for 100 seconds.
Subgoal 3.2: Relate the number of distinct values to the initial configuration.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 12
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Characterize which initial values can persist for 100 seconds.
An initial value $a_j(0)$ can persist as a distinct value at position $i$ at time $t$ if $a_i(t) = a_j(0)$ and $a_j(0)$ is not equal to other values in the sequence $a(t)$. More specifically, a value $a_j(0)$ can be a distinct value at time 100 if there exists some $i$ such that $a_i(100) = a_j(0)$ and $a_j(0)$ is not equal to any other value $a_k(100)$ for $k \ne i$.

Consider an initial value $a_j(0)$. For this value to be present at position $i$ at time 100, it must be the maximum in the window $[i-100, i+100]$ in the initial configuration. A value $a_j(0)$ will be a distinct value at time 100 if it is the maximum in some window of size 201, and it's the *unique* maximum in that window, and there isn't a larger value elsewhere that has spread to cover the position where $a_j(0)$ is the maximum.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
A value $a_j(0)$ can be a distinct value at time 100 if it is a local maximum in the initial configuration that is not "overwhelmed" by larger values. Specifically, if $a_j(0)$ is greater than its neighbors $a_{j-1}(0)$ and $a_{j+1}(0)$, it will persist at position $j$ for at least one second. For it to be a distinct value after 100 seconds, it needs to be the maximum in a window of size $2 \times 100 + 1 = 201$ in the initial configuration centered around some position, and this value must not be equal to any other value that is also a maximum in some other window.

More precisely, a value $v$ is present at time 100 if there is some $i$ such that $a_i(100) = v$. This means $v = \max(\{a_k(0) : k \in [i-100, i+100]\})$. The set of distinct values at time 100 is the set of values $v$ such that $v = \max(\{a_k(0) : k \in [i-100, i+100]\})$ for some $i$.
[/IMP]

### Step 13
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Relate the number of distinct values to the initial configuration.
The distinct values at time 100 are the values $v$ such that $v$ is the maximum in some window of size 201 in the initial configuration. Since the initial values are drawn from a continuous distribution, the probability that any two initial values are equal is zero. Therefore, the distinct values at time 100 are precisely the values $a_j(0)$ such that $a_j(0) > a_k(0)$ for all $k \in [j-100, j+100]$ with $k \ne j$. These are the "100-local maxima" of the initial sequence.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $S_{100}$ be the set of distinct values after 100 seconds. A value $v$ is in $S_{100}$ if and only if $v = a_i(100)$ for some $i$. We know $a_i(100) = \max(\{a_k(0) : k \in [i-100, i+100]\})$.
Since the initial values are distinct with probability 1, the set of distinct values after 100 seconds is the set of values $a_j(0)$ such that $a_j(0) = \max(\{a_k(0) : k \in [i-100, i+100]\})$ for some $i$.
This is equivalent to the set of values $a_j(0)$ such that $a_j(0) > a_k(0)$ for all $k \in [j-100, j+100]$ with $k \ne j$.
These are the initial values that are strictly greater than all other initial values within a window of size 201 centered at their position. Let's call such a value a "100-prominent" value. The number of distinct values after 100 seconds is the number of 100-prominent values in the initial sequence.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
Current Goal: Compute the expected value of the number of distinct values.
The number of distinct values is the number of 100-prominent values in the initial sequence. We need to find the expected number of such values.
Subgoal 4.1: Define an indicator variable for each initial value being 100-prominent.
Subgoal 4.2: Compute the probability that a single initial value is 100-prominent.
Subgoal 4.3: Use linearity of expectation to compute the expected number of 100-prominent values.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 16
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Define an indicator variable for each initial value being 100-prominent.
Let $X_j$ be an indicator variable such that $X_j = 1$ if $a_j(0)$ is 100-prominent, and $X_j = 0$ otherwise.
$a_j(0)$ is 100-prominent if $a_j(0) > a_k(0)$ for all $k \in [j-100, j+100]$ with $k \ne j$. The indices are taken modulo 2025. The window $[j-100, j+100]$ contains $100 + 1 + 100 = 201$ initial values.
Let $N=2025$. The indices are $j-100, j-99, \ldots, j-1, j, j+1, \ldots, j+99, j+100$ (modulo $N$).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $X_j$ be an indicator variable for the event that $a_j(0)$ is 100-prominent.
$X_j = 1$ if $a_j(0) > a_k(0)$ for all $k \in \{j-100, \ldots, j-1, j+1, \ldots, j+100\}$ (modulo 2025).
$X_j = 0$ otherwise.
The number of distinct values after 100 seconds is $X = \sum_{j=1}^{2025} X_j$.
The expected number of distinct values is $E[X] = E[\sum_{j=1}^{2025} X_j] = \sum_{j=1}^{2025} E[X_j]$.
$E[X_j] = P(X_j = 1) = P(a_j(0) > a_k(0) \text{ for all } k \in \{j-100, \ldots, j-1, j+1, \ldots, j+100\} \pmod{2025})$.
[/IMP]

### Step 17
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the probability that a single initial value is 100-prominent.
The initial values $a_1(0), \ldots, a_{2025}(0)$ are independent and uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$.
Consider $a_j(0)$. For it to be 100-prominent, it must be the maximum among the $201$ values in the window $[j-100, j+100]$ (including $a_j(0)$ itself).
Let $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_{201}$ be 201 independent random variables from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. The probability that a specific one of these variables is the maximum is $1/201$.
In our case, the set of values is $\{a_k(0) : k \in [j-100, j+100] \pmod{2025}\}$. These are 201 distinct initial values.
The probability that $a_j(0)$ is the maximum among these 201 values is $1/201$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $W_j = \{a_k(0) : k \in [j-100, j+100] \pmod{2025}\}$. This set contains 201 independent random variables from $U[0,1]$.
The event that $a_j(0)$ is 100-prominent is the event that $a_j(0) = \max(W_j)$.
Since the values in $W_j$ are independent and identically distributed from a continuous distribution, the probability that any specific one is the maximum is equal. There are 201 values in $W_j$.
$P(a_j(0) = \max(W_j)) = P(a_j(0) > a_k(0) \text{ for all } k \in W_j \setminus \{j\})$.
Consider the ordered set of values in $W_j$. Any permutation is equally likely. The probability that $a_j(0)$ is the largest is $1/201$.
Therefore, $P(X_j = 1) = \frac{1}{201}$.
[/IMP]

### Step 18
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Use linearity of expectation to compute the expected number of 100-prominent values.
We have $E[X] = \sum_{j=1}^{2025} E[X_j]$ and we found $E[X_j] = P(X_j = 1) = 1/201$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
The expected number of distinct values is $E[X] = \sum_{j=1}^{2025} E[X_j] = \sum_{j=1}^{2025} \frac{1}{201} = 2025 \times \frac{1}{201}$.
$2025 / 201 = (3^4 \times 5^2) / (3 \times 67) = (3^3 \times 5^2) / 67 = (27 \times 25) / 67 = 675 / 67$.
