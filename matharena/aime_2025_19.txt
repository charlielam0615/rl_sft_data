### Problem Statement
We need to evaluate the product

$$\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k \left(5^{k^2 - 1}\right)}{\log_{k+1} \left(5^{k^2 - 4}\right)} = \frac{\log_4 (5^{15})}{\log_5 (5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5 (5^{24})}{\log_6 (5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6 (5^{35})}{\log_7 (5^{32})} \dots \frac{\log_{63} (5^{3968})}{\log_{64} (5^{3965})}$$

and express it as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Then, compute \(m + n\).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to simplify the product and evaluate it as a fraction.  
1. Understand the structure of each term in the product.  
2. Simplify each logarithmic fraction using properties of logarithms.  
3. Analyze the pattern in the exponents to simplify the product.  
4. Compute the product as a single fraction.  
5. Ensure the fraction is in simplest form and find \(m + n\).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to simplify each term \(\frac{\log_k (5^{k^2 - 1})}{\log_{k+1} (5^{k^2 - 4})}\) using logarithmic properties. Apply the change of base formula and properties of logarithms to express each term in a form that may reveal a pattern or allow cancellation when multiplied.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Using the change of base formula, \(\log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}\), rewrite the numerator and denominator:

\[
\log_k (5^{k^2 - 1}) = \frac{\ln (5^{k^2 - 1})}{\ln k} = \frac{(k^2 - 1) \ln 5}{\ln k}
\]

\[
\log_{k+1} (5^{k^2 - 4}) = \frac{\ln (5^{k^2 - 4})}{\ln (k+1)} = \frac{(k^2 - 4) \ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}
\]

Thus, each term is:

\[
\frac{\log_k (5^{k^2 - 1})}{\log_{k+1} (5^{k^2 - 4})} = \frac{\frac{(k^2 - 1) \ln 5}{\ln k}}{\frac{(k^2 - 4) \ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}
\]

The \(\ln 5\) terms cancel out, simplifying the product term.

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate the product and find \(m + n\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify each term (completed in Step 2: each term is \(\frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}\)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the product \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right)\).  
  - Subgoal 3: Express the result as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) in simplest form.  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(m + n\).  
**Current Goal**: Compute the product by analyzing the two parts: \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4}\) and \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4}\). Factor the expressions to identify possible cancellations in the telescoping product.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Factor the numerator and denominator:

\[
k^2 - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1)
\]

\[
k^2 - 4 = (k - 2)(k + 2)
\]

So,

\[
\frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4} = \frac{(k - 1)(k + 1)}{(k - 2)(k + 2)}
\]

Write the product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k - 1)(k + 1)}{(k - 2)(k + 2)}
\]

Expand the product:

\[
= \frac{(3 \cdot 5) \cdot (4 \cdot 6) \cdot (5 \cdot 7) \cdots (62 \cdot 64)}{(2 \cdot 6) \cdot (3 \cdot 7) \cdot (4 \cdot 8) \cdots (61 \cdot 65)}
\]

Numerator: \(3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdots 62 \cdot (5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdots 64)\)

Denominator: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdots 61 \cdot (6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdots 65)\)

Cancel terms:

- From 3 to 61, all terms cancel.
- Numerator remaining: \(62 \cdot (5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdots 64)\)
- Denominator remaining: \(2 \cdot (6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdots 65)\)

Adjust indices for clarity. Let’s compute:

\[
\frac{62 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdots 64}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdots 65} = \frac{62 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 65} = \frac{62 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 65} = \frac{310}{130} = \frac{31}{13}
\]

Since \(\gcd(31, 13) = 1\), this is in simplest form.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}\). Analyze this product to determine if it telescopes or simplifies.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Write the product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63}
\]

This is a telescoping product. Most terms cancel:

\[
= \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}
\]

Since \(64 = 2^6\) and \(4 = 2^2\),

\[
\ln 64 = \ln (2^6) = 6 \ln 2, \quad \ln 4 = \ln (2^2) = 2 \ln 2
\]

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = \frac{6 \ln 2}{2 \ln 2} = 3
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]

[REVIEW]
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main goal: Evaluate the product and find \(m + n\).  
  - Subgoal 1: Simplify each term (completed).  
  - Subgoal 2: Compute the product (split into two parts).  
    - Compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2 - 4} = \frac{31}{13}\) (completed in Step 4).  
    - Compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = 3\) (completed in Step 5).  
  - Subgoal 3: Combine results to express the product as \(\frac{m}{n}\).  
  - Subgoal 4: Compute \(m + n\).  
**Current Goal**: Combine the results to find the final fraction and compute \(m + n\).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to combine the two parts of the product, \(\frac{31}{13} \cdot 3\), to obtain \(\frac{m}{n}\) in simplest form, then compute \(m + n\).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Multiply the results:

\[
\frac{31}{13} \cdot 3 = \frac{31 \cdot 3}{13} = \frac{93}{13}
\]

Check if \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\):

- \(93 = 3 \cdot 31\), \(13\) is prime, and neither 3 nor 31 divides 13, so \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\).

Thus, \(m = 93\), \(n = 13\). Compute:

\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106
\]

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by ensuring the product’s exponents match the given pattern and the fraction is correct.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Verify the exponents in the product match the pattern. For each \(k\), the term is \(\frac{\log_k (5^{k^2 - 1})}{\log_{k+1} (5^{k^2 - 4})}\). Check a few terms:

- For \(k=4\): \(\frac{\log_4 (5^{16 - 1})}{\log_5 (5^{16 - 4})} = \frac{\log_4 (5^{15})}{\og_5 (5^{12})}\), which matches.
- For \(k=5\): \(\frac{\log_5 (5^{25 - 1})}{\log_6 (5^{25 - 4})} = \frac{\log_5 (5^{24})}{\log_6 (5^{21})}\), which matches.
- For \(k=63\): \(\frac{\log_{63} (5^{3969 - 1})}{\log_{64} (5^{3969 - 4})} = \frac{\log_{63} (5^{3968})}{\log_{64} (5^{3965})}\), which matches.

The pattern holds. The simplification and cancellation in Steps 4 and 5 are consistent, and the final fraction \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in simplest form. The computation of \(m + n = 106\) is correct.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The product equals \(\frac{93}{13}\), where \(m = 93\), \(n = 13\), and \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\). Thus,

\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106
\]

**Final Answer**: \(106\)
