### Problem Statement
We need to find the real number \( k \) such that the system of equations
\[
\begin{align*}
|25 + 20i - z| &= 5 \\
|z - 4 - k| &= |z - 3i - k|
\end{align*}
\]
has exactly one complex solution \( z \). Then, compute the sum of all possible values of \( k \), expressed as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers, and find \( m + n \). Here, \( i = \sqrt{-1} \).

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable subgoals. The system has two equations involving the complex number \( z \), and we need exactly one solution for \( z \). The subgoals are:
1. Interpret the first equation to define the possible values of \( z \).
2. Use the second equation to impose constraints on \( z \) and \( k \).
3. Determine the value(s) of \( k \) that result in exactly one solution for \( z \).
4. Sum all possible \( k \) values and express the result as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \).
5. Compute \( m + n \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Interpret the first equation \( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \).
Description: The first equation describes a geometric constraint in the complex plane. The expression \( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \) means that \( z \) lies on a circle centered at \( 25 + 20i \) with radius 5. We will rewrite this equation to express \( z \) and understand its geometric implications.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Let \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers. The first equation is:
\[
|25 + 20i - (x + yi)| = 5
\]
Simplify the expression inside the modulus:
\[
25 + 20i - x - yi = (25 - x) + (20 - y)i
\]
Thus:
\[
|(25 - x) + (20 - y)i| = 5
\]
The modulus of a complex number \( a + bi \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), so:
\[
\sqrt{(25 - x)^2 + (20 - y)^2} = 5
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[
(25 - x)^2 + (20 - y)^2 = 25
\]
This is the equation of a circle in the complex plane centered at \( (25, 20) \) with radius 5. Thus, \( z \) lies on this circle.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Interpret the second equation \( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \).
Description: The second equation suggests that \( z \) is equidistant from the points \( 4 + k \) and \( 3i + k \) in the complex plane. This represents the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting these two points. We will express this geometrically and algebraically to find constraints on \( z \) and \( k \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The second equation is:
\[
|z - (4 + k)| = |z - (3i + k)|
\]
Let \( z = x + yi \). Compute the distances:
- Left side: \( |z - (4 + k)| = |(x + yi) - (4 + k)| = |(x - 4 - k) + yi| = \sqrt{(x - 4 - k)^2 + y^2} \).
- Right side: \( |z - (3i + k)| = |(x + yi) - (k + 3i)| = |(x - k) + (y - 3)i| = \sqrt{(x - k)^2 + (y - 3)^2} \).

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{(x - 4 - k)^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(x - k)^2 + (y - 3)^2}
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x - 4 - k)^2 + y^2 = (x - k)^2 + (y - 3)^2
\]
Expand both sides:
- Left: \( (x - 4 - k)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 2x(4 + k) + (4 + k)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 8x - 2kx + 16 + 8k + k^2 + y^2 \).
- Right: \( (x - k)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2kx + k^2 + y^2 - 6y + 9 \).

Equate and simplify:
\[
x^2 - 8x - 2kx + 16 + 8k + k^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 2kx + k^2 + y^2 - 6y + 9
\]
Subtract \( x^2 \), \( y^2 \), and \( k^2 \) from both sides:
\[
-8x - 2kx + 16 + 8k = -2kx - 6y + 9
\]
Simplify:
\[
-8x + 16 + 8k = -6y + 9
\]
Rearrange:
\[
8x - 6y = 8k - 7
\]
\[
4x - 3y = 4k - \frac{7}{2}
\]
This is the equation of a line in the complex plane, representing the perpendicular bisector of the segment from \( 4 + k \) to \( 3i + k \).
[/IMP]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Find the values of \( k \) such that the circle and line intersect at exactly one point.
Description: The system has exactly one solution when the circle \( (x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25 \) and the line \( 4x - 3y = 4k - \frac{7}{2} \) intersect at exactly one point (i.e., the line is tangent to the circle). We will substitute the line equation into the circle equation and ensure the resulting quadratic has exactly one solution.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
From the line equation:
\[
4x - 3y = 4k - \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solve for \( y \):
\[
3y = 4x - 4k + \frac{7}{2} \implies y = \frac{4x - 4k + \frac{7}{2}}{3} = \frac{4x - 4k + \frac{7}{2}}{3}
\]
Simplify:
\[
y = \frac{4x - 4k + \frac{7}{2}}{3} = \frac{8x - 8k + 7}{6}
\]
Substitute \( y \) into the circle equation \( (x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25 \):
\[
(x - 25)^2 + \left( \frac{8x - 8k + 7}{6} - 20 \right)^2 = 25
\]
Simplify the expression for \( y - 20 \):
\[
y - 20 = \frac{8x - 8k + 7}{6} - \frac{120}{6} = \frac{8x - 8k + 7 - 120}{6} = \frac{8x - 8k - 113}{6}
\]
So:
\[
(y - 20)^2 = \left( \frac{8x - 8k - 113}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{(8x - 8k - 113)^2}{36}
\]
The circle equation becomes:
\[
(x - 25)^2 + \frac{(8x - 8k - 113)^2}{36} = 25
\]
Multiply through by 36 to clear the denominator:
\[
36(x - 25)^2 + (8x - 8k - 113)^2 = 900
\]
Expand:
- \( (x - 25)^2 = x^2 - 50x + 625 \), so \( 36(x - 25)^2 = 36x^2 - 1800x + 22500 \).
- \( (8x - 8k - 113)^2 = 64x^2 - 16x(8k + 113) + (8k + 113)^2 \).

Let \( a = 8k + 113 \), so:
\[
(8x - 8k - 113)^2 = (8x - a)^2 = 64x^2 - 16ax + a^2
\]
The equation is:
\[
36x^2 - 1800x + 22500 + 64x^2 - 16ax + a^2 = 900
\]
Combine:
\[
100x^2 - (16a + 1800)x + (a^2 + 22500) = 900
\]
\[
100x^2 - (16a + 1800)x + (a^2 + 22500 - 900) = 0
\]
\[
100x^2 - (16a + 1800)x + (a^2 + 21600) = 0
\]
For exactly one solution, the discriminant of this quadratic in \( x \) must be zero:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0
\]
where:
- \( a = 100 \)
- \( b = -(16a + 1800) \)
- \( c = a^2 + 21600 \)

Compute the discriminant:
\[
b^2 = (16a + 1800)^2 = 256a^2 + 57600a + 3240000
\]
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 100 \cdot (a^2 + 21600) = 400a^2 + 8640000
\]
\[
\Delta = 256a^2 + 57600a + 3240000 - (400a^2 + 8640000) = -144a^2 + 57600a - 5400000
\]
Set \( \Delta = 0 \):
\[
-144a^2 + 57600a - 5400000 = 0
\]
Divide by \(-144\):
\[
a^2 - 400a + 37500 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic:
\[
a = \frac{400 \pm \sqrt{400^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 37500}}{2} = \frac{400 \pm \sqrt{160000 - 150000}}{2} = \frac{400 \pm \sqrt{10000}}{2} = \frac{400 \pm 100}{2}
\]
\[
a = 250 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 150
\]
Since \( a = 8k + 113 \):
- \( a = 250 \): \( 8k + 113 = 250 \implies 8k = 137 \implies k = \frac{137}{8} \).
- \( a = 150 \): \( 8k + 113 = 150 \implies 8k = 37 \implies k = \frac{37}{8} \).

Thus, the possible values of \( k \) are \( \frac{37}{8} \) and \( \frac{137}{8} \).
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify that \( k = \frac{37}{8} \) and \( k = \frac{137}{8} \) yield exactly one solution.
Description: Substitute \( k = \frac{37}{8} \) and \( k = \frac{137}{8} \) back into the line equation, compute the intersection with the circle, and confirm that each results in a single point of intersection (tangency).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
**For \( k = \frac{37}{8} \)**:
Line equation:
\[
4x - 3y = 4 \cdot \frac{37}{8} - \frac{7}{2} = \frac{148}{8} - \frac{28}{8} = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]
\[
4x - 3y = 15 \implies y = \frac{4x - 15}{3}
\]
Substitute into the circle equation \( (x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25 \):
\[
y - 20 = \frac{4x - 15}{3} - \frac{60}{3} = \frac{4x - 75}{3}
\]
\[
(y - 20)^2 = \left( \frac{4x - 75}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{(4x - 75)^2}{9}
\]
\[
(x - 25)^2 + \frac{(4x - 75)^2}{9} = 25
\]
\[
9(x - 25)^2 + (4x - 75)^2 = 225
\]
\[
9(x^2 - 50x + 625) + (16x^2 - 600x + 5625) = 225
\]
\[
9x^2 - 450x + 5625 + 16x^2 - 600x + 5625 = 225
\]
\[
25x^2 - 1050x + 11250 = 225
\]
\[
25x^2 - 1050x + 11025 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 42x + 441 = 0
\]
\[
(x - 21)^2 = 0 \implies x = 21
\]
\[
y = \frac{4 \cdot 21 - 15}{3} = \frac{84 - 15}{3} = 23
\]
Point: \( (21, 23) \). Check if it lies on the circle:
\[
(21 - 25)^2 + (23 - 20)^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
\]
The point satisfies the circle equation. Since the discriminant was zero, there is exactly one solution.

**For \( k = \frac{137}{8} \)**:
Line equation:
\[
4x - 3y = 4 \cdot \frac{137}{8} - \frac{7}{2} = \frac{548}{8} - \frac{28}{8} = \frac{520}{8} = 65
\]
\[
4x - 3y = 65 \implies y = \frac{4x - 65}{3}
\]
\[
y - 20 = \frac{4x - 65 - 60}{3} = \frac{4x - 125}{3}
\]
\[
(y - 20)^2 = \frac{(4x - 125)^2}{9}
\]
\[
9(x - 25)^2 + (4x - 125)^2 = 225
\]
\[
9(x^2 - 50x + 625) + (16x^2 - 1000x + 15625) = 225
\]
\[
9x^2 - 450x + 5625 + 16x^2 - 1000x + 15625 = 225
\]
\[
25x^2 - 1450x + 21250 = 225
\]
\[
25x^2 - 1450x + 21025 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 58x + 841 = 0
\]
\[
(x - 29)^2 = 0 \implies x = 29
\]
\[
y = \frac{4 \cdot 29 - 65}{3} = \frac{116 - 65}{3} = \frac{51}{3} = 17
\]
Point: \( (29, 17) \).
\[
(29 - 25)^2 + (17 - 20)^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
\]
The point satisfies the circle equation, and the discriminant being zero confirms a single solution.

### Step 6

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all possible \( k \) such that the system has exactly one complex solution \( z \), and compute \( m + n \) where the sum is \( \frac{m}{n} \).
  - Subgoal 1: Interpret the first equation (completed: circle centered at \( (25, 20) \), radius 5).
  - Subgoal 2: Interpret the second equation (completed: line as perpendicular bisector).
  - Subgoal 3: Find \( k \) for exactly one solution (completed: \( k = \frac{37}{8}, \frac{137}{8} \)).
  - Subgoal 4: Sum all possible \( k \) values and express as \( \frac{m}{n} \).
  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( m + n \).

Current Goal: Sum all possible \( k \) values and compute \( m + n \).
[/REVIEW]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Sum all possible \( k \) values and express as \( \frac{m}{n} \), then compute \( m + n \).
Description: Add the values \( k = \frac{37}{8} \) and \( k = \frac{137}{8} \), simplify the result to a fraction in lowest terms, and find \( m + n \).
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
\[
k_1 + k_2 = \frac{37}{8} + \frac{137}{8} = \frac{37 + 137}{8} = \frac{174}{8} = \frac{87}{4}
\]
The fraction \( \frac{87}{4} \) is in lowest terms (since 87 and 4 are coprime; 87 is odd, 4 is even).
Thus, \( m = 87 \), \( n = 4 \), and:
\[
m + n = 87 + 4 = 91
\]
[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Verify the sum and ensure no other \( k \) values satisfy the condition.
Description: Confirm the sum \( \frac{87}{4} \) and check if other \( k \) values could produce exactly one solution by re-evaluating the discriminant condition and geometric constraints.
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The sum \( \frac{87}{4} \) was computed from \( k = \frac{37}{8} \) and \( \frac{137}{8} \). The discriminant equation \( a^2 - 400a + 37500 = 0 \) (where \( a = 8k + 113 \)) is quadratic, yielding exactly two solutions for \( a \), hence two \( k \) values. Geometrically, the line being tangent to the circle requires the distance from the circle’s center to the line to equal the radius, which we satisfied. No other \( k \) values should arise责任

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)

Goal Hierarchy:
- Main Goal: Find the sum of all possible \( k \) such that the system has exactly one complex solution \( z \), and compute \( m + n \).

  - Subgoal 5: Compute \( m + n \) (completed: \( m + n = 91 \)).

Current Goal: Finalize the solution by confirming all steps are complete and presenting the final answer.
[/REVIEW]

### Final Answer
The sum of all possible values of \( k \) is \( \frac{87}{4} \), where \( m = 87 \) and \( n = 4 \). Thus:
\[
m + n = 87 + 4 = 91
\]
\[
\boxed{91}
\]
