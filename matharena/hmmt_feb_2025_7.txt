Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG1.1: Introduce $k = 2(a^2+1)=\dots$, express $a^2,b^2,c^2$ via $k$, and find constraints on $k$.
How: Define $k$ as the common value from the first set of equations. Solve for $a^2, b^2, c^2$. Use $a,b,c > 0$ to establish $a^2,b^2,c^2 > 0$ and thereby constrain $k$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $k = 2(a^2+1) = 3(b^2+1) = 4(c^2+1)$.
From this, we can express $a^2, b^2, c^2$ in terms of $k$:
$a^2+1 = k/2 \implies a^2 = k/2 - 1$.
$b^2+1 = k/3 \implies b^2 = k/3 - 1$.
$c^2+1 = k/4 \implies c^2 = k/4 - 1$.
Since $a,b,c$ are positive real numbers, $a^2, b^2, c^2$ must be positive.
$k/2 - 1 > 0 \implies k > 2$.
$k/3 - 1 > 0 \implies k > 3$.
$k/4 - 1 > 0 \implies k > 4$.
For all conditions to hold, $k$ must be greater than 4.

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG1.2: Introduce trigonometric substitutions for $a,b,c$ and relate $ab+bc+ca=1$ to a condition on the angles $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.
How: The terms $a^2+1$, etc., suggest substitutions involving $\tan$ or $\cot$. Let $a=\tan\alpha, b=\tan\beta, c=\tan\gamma$. Since $a,b,c>0$, angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ can be taken in $(0, \pi/2)$. The condition $ab+bc+ca=1$ is a known identity related to sum of angles.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $a = \tan\alpha$, $b = \tan\beta$, $c = \tan\gamma$. Since $a,b,c > 0$, we choose $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in (0, \pi/2)$.
The second equation is $ab+bc+ca=1$, which translates to:
$\tan\alpha\tan\beta + \tan\beta\tan\gamma + \tan\gamma\tan\alpha = 1$.
This identity holds if $\alpha+\beta+\gamma = (n+1/2)\pi$ for an integer $n$.
Since $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in (0, \pi/2)$, we have $0 < \alpha+\beta+\gamma < 3\pi/2$.
The only possibility in this range is $\alpha+\beta+\gamma = \pi/2$.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG1.3: Connect $k$ with trigonometric substitutions, introduce $R$, express $\cos$ and $\sin$ of angles in terms of $R$, and find constraints on $R$.
How: Substitute $a=\tan\alpha$ into $a^2+1=k/2$, etc. This gives $\sec^2\alpha=k/2$. Define $R^2=k$ for convenience. Then express $\cos\alpha$ and $\sin\alpha$ (and similarly for $\beta, \gamma$) in terms of $R$. Use $k>4$ to constrain $R$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From SG1.1, $a^2+1=k/2, b^2+1=k/3, c^2+1=k/4$.
Using $a=\tan\alpha$ (from SG1.2), $a^2+1 = \tan^2\alpha+1 = \sec^2\alpha$.
So, $\sec^2\alpha = k/2$, $\sec^2\beta = k/3$, $\sec^2\gamma = k/4$.
Let $k=R^2$. Since $k>4$, $R^2>4$, so $R>2$ (assuming $R$ positive, which is convenient).
Then $\sec^2\alpha = R^2/2$, $\sec^2\beta = R^2/3$, $\sec^2\gamma = R^2/4$.
Since $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in (0, \pi/2)$, $\cos\alpha, \cos\beta, \cos\gamma$ are positive.
$\cos^2\alpha = 2/R^2 \implies \cos\alpha = \sqrt{2}/R$.
$\cos^2\beta = 3/R^2 \implies \cos\beta = \sqrt{3}/R$.
$\cos^2\gamma = 4/R^2 \implies \cos\gamma = 2/R$.
For these to be valid, $R^2 \ge 2, R^2 \ge 3, R^2 \ge 4$. Thus $R^2 \ge 4$, or $R \ge 2$. This is consistent with $k>4$.

Now, find expressions for $\sin\alpha, \sin\beta, \sin\gamma$. Since $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in (0, \pi/2)$, their sines are positive.
$\sin\alpha = \sqrt{1-\cos^2\alpha} = \sqrt{1-2/R^2} = \sqrt{R^2-2}/R$. (Requires $R^2 \ge 2$)
$\sin\beta = \sqrt{1-\cos^2\beta} = \sqrt{1-3/R^2} = \sqrt{R^2-3}/R$. (Requires $R^2 \ge 3$)
$\sin\gamma = \sqrt{1-\cos^2\gamma} = \sqrt{1-4/R^2} = \sqrt{R^2-4}/R$. (Requires $R^2 \ge 4$)
All these conditions are satisfied if $R \ge 2$.

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG1.4: Use angle condition $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi/2$ to form an equation in $R$.
How: From $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi/2$, we get $\alpha+\beta = \pi/2-\gamma$. Apply cosine to both sides: $\cos(\alpha+\beta) = \cos(\pi/2-\gamma) = \sin\gamma$. Expand $\cos(\alpha+\beta)$ and substitute the expressions for $\cos\alpha, \cos\beta, \sin\alpha, \sin\beta, \sin\gamma$ in terms of $R$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
We have $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi/2$, so $\alpha+\beta = \pi/2-\gamma$.
Therefore, $\cos(\alpha+\beta) = \cos(\pi/2-\gamma) = \sin\gamma$.
Expanding $\cos(\alpha+\beta)$ gives $\cos\alpha\cos\beta - \sin\alpha\sin\beta$.
So, the equation is $\cos\alpha\cos\beta - \sin\alpha\sin\beta = \sin\gamma$.
Substitute the expressions in terms of $R$ (from SG1.3):
$(\sqrt{2}/R)(\sqrt{3}/R) - (\sqrt{R^2-2}/R)(\sqrt{R^2-3}/R) = \sqrt{R^2-4}/R$.
Multiply by $R^2$ (note $R \ge 2$, so $R \ne 0$):
$\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(R^2-2)(R^2-3)} = R\sqrt{R^2-4}$.
This is the equation for $R$. This completes SG1.

### Step 15
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG2.1: Solve the equation $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(R^2-2)(R^2-3)} = R\sqrt{R^2-4}$ for $R^2$.
How: Let $X=R^2$. Rearrange the equation and square it. Check conditions for squaring.
The equation is $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)} = \sqrt{X(X-4)}$.
For all terms to be real, we need $X \ge 2, X \ge 3, X \ge 4$. So $X \ge 4$.
The RHS $\sqrt{X(X-4)}$ is non-negative.
The LHS $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)}$ must also be non-negative.
So $\sqrt{6} \ge \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)} \implies 6 \ge (X-2)(X-3) = X^2-5X+6$.
$0 \ge X^2-5X \implies X(X-5) \le 0$. Since $X \ge 4$, we must have $X-5 \le 0$, so $X \le 5$.
Thus, any solution must satisfy $4 \le X \le 5$.
Square both sides: $(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{X^2-5X+6})^2 = X(X-4)$.
$6 - 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)} + (X^2-5X+6) = X^2-4X$.
$X^2-5X+12 - 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)} = X^2-4X$.
$-X+12 = 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)}$.
For the LHS $(-X+12)$ to be non-negative (as RHS is non-negative): $-X+12 \ge 0 \implies X \le 12$. This condition $X \le 12$ is satisfied as we already have $X \le 5$.
Square both sides again: $(-X+12)^2 = 4 \cdot 6(X^2-5X+6)$.
$X^2 - 24X + 144 = 24(X^2-5X+6)$.
$X^2 - 24X + 144 = 24X^2 - 120X + 144$.
$X^2 - 24X = 24X^2 - 120X$.
$0 = 23X^2 - 96X$.
$X(23X - 96) = 0$.
Since $X \ge 4$, $X \ne 0$. So $23X - 96 = 0 \implies X = 96/23$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $X=R^2$. The equation is $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)} = \sqrt{X(X-4)}$.
Conditions for validity:
1. All expressions under square roots must be non-negative: $X-2 \ge 0, X-3 \ge 0, X(X-4) \ge 0$. Since $a,b,c$ are real, $X=R^2=k$ must be $k>4$. So $X>4$. This ensures arguments of square roots are positive.
2. The LHS $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)}$ must be non-negative to match the non-negative RHS $\sqrt{X(X-4)}$.
   So $\sqrt{6} \ge \sqrt{(X-2)(X-3)}$. Squaring this (both sides positive): $6 \ge (X-2)(X-3) = X^2-5X+6$.
   This implies $0 \ge X^2-5X = X(X-5)$. Since $X>4$, $X$ is positive, so we must have $X-5 \le 0$, which means $X \le 5$.
   So, any solution $X$ must satisfy $4 < X \le 5$.

Now, solve $\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{X^2-5X+6} = \sqrt{X^2-4X}$.
Square both sides:
$6 - 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)} + (X^2-5X+6) = X^2-4X$.
$X^2-5X+12 - 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)} = X^2-4X$.
Rearrange to isolate the square root term:
$-X+12 = 2\sqrt{6(X^2-5X+6)}$.
The RHS is non-negative. So $-X+12 \ge 0 \implies X \le 12$. This condition $4 < X \le 5$ fulfills $X \le 12$.
Square both sides again:
$(-X+12)^2 = 4 \cdot 6(X^2-5X+6)$.
$X^2 - 24X + 144 = 24(X^2-5X+6)$.
$X^2 - 24X + 144 = 24X^2 - 120X + 144$.
$X^2 - 24X = 24X^2 - 120X$.
$0 = 23X^2 - 96X$.
Factor out $X$: $X(23X - 96) = 0$.
Since $X>4$, $X \ne 0$.
Thus, $23X - 96 = 0 \implies X = 96/23$.
So, $R^2 = 96/23$.

The solution found is $R^2 = 96/23$.
1. Check $R^2 > 4$:

2. Check $4 < R^2 \le 5$:
   $96/23 \approx 4.1739$.
   So $4 < 96/23$ is true.
   $96/23 \le 5 \iff 96 \le 23 \times 5 \iff 96 \le 115$. This is true.

Using $R^2 = 96/23$:
$a = \sqrt{(96/23)/2 - 1} = \sqrt{48/23 - 1} = \sqrt{(48-23)/23} = \sqrt{25/23} = 5/\sqrt{23}$.
$b = \sqrt{(96/23)/3 - 1} = \sqrt{32/23 - 1} = \sqrt{(32-23)/23} = \sqrt{9/23} = 3/\sqrt{23}$.
$c = \sqrt{(96/23)/4 - 1} = \sqrt{24/23 - 1} = \sqrt{(24-23)/23} = \sqrt{1/23} = 1/\sqrt{23}$.
So, $(a,b,c) = (5/\sqrt{23}, 3/\sqrt{23}, 1/\sqrt{23})$. Since $a,b,c$ must be positive, we take positive square roots.

Values: $a=5/\sqrt{23}, b=3/\sqrt{23}, c=1/\sqrt{23}$.
$a^2=25/23, b^2=9/23, c^2=1/23$.

Check first set of equations: $2(a^2+1)=3(b^2+1)=4(c^2+1)$.
$2(a^2+1) = 2(25/23+1) = 2(25/23+23/23) = 2(48/23) = 96/23$.
$3(b^2+1) = 3(9/23+1) = 3(9/23+23/23) = 3(32/23) = 96/23$.
$4(c^2+1) = 4(1/23+1) = 4(1/23+23/23) = 4(24/23) = 96/23$.
All three are equal to $96/23$. This part is satisfied. (This is $R^2=k$, which was used in derivation).

Check second equation: $ab+bc+ca=1$.
$ab = (5/\sqrt{23})(3/\sqrt{23}) = 15/23$.
$bc = (3/\sqrt{23})(1/\sqrt{23}) = 3/23$.
$ca = (1/\sqrt{23})(5/\sqrt{23}) = 5/23$.
$ab+bc+ca = 15/23 + 3/23 + 5/23 = (15+3+5)/23 = 23/23 = 1$.
This part is also satisfied.

G0: Compute $a+b+c$.
  SG1: (Completed)
  SG2: (Completed)
  SG3: (Completed) Calculated $a,b,c$ and validated them.
  SG4: Compute $a+b+c$. (CURRENT)
Current Goal: SG4.

### Step 26
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: SG4: Compute $a+b+c$.
How: Sum the calculated values of $a,b,c$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
$a = 5/\sqrt{23}$, $b = 3/\sqrt{23}$, $c = 1/\sqrt{23}$.
$a+b+c = 5/\sqrt{23} + 3/\sqrt{23} + 1/\sqrt{23} = (5+3+1)/\sqrt{23} = 9/\sqrt{23}$.
To rationalize the denominator: $9/\sqrt{23} = (9\sqrt{23}) / (\sqrt{23}\sqrt{23}) = 9\sqrt{23}/23$.
