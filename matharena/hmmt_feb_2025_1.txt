### Problem Statement
Compute the sum of the positive divisors (including 1) of \(9!\) that have a units digit of \(1\). 

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
- Factorize \(9!\) into prime factors.  
- Identify that divisors with units digit \(1\) must be odd, so they cannot include the prime factor \(2\). Also, they cannot include the prime factor \(5\) (since \(5\) would force the units digit to be \(0\) or \(5\)).  
- Thus, consider only divisors of the form \(3^b \times 7^d\), where \(0 \leq b \leq 4\) and \(0 \leq d \leq 1\).  
- List all combinations of \((b, d)\) and compute the units digit of each divisor.  
- Sum the divisors satisfying the units digit condition.  
- **Current goal**: Find all divisors of \(9!\) of the form \(3^b \times 7^d\) with units digit \(1\).  
- **How to achieve**: Enumerate \(b\) from \(0\) to \(4\), \(d\) from \(0\) to \(1\), compute units digits, and sum valid divisors.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
- **Goal**: Enumerate all pairs \((b, d)\) for the divisor form \(3^b \times 7^d\) and check units digit.  
- **How**:  
  - \(b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), \(d \in \{0, 1\}\).  
  - For each pair, compute the divisor and its units digit.  
  - Include divisor if units digit is \(1\).  
  - Sum included divisors.

Prime factorization: \(9! = 2^7 \times 3^4 \times 5^1 \times 7^1\).  
Divisors of the form \(3^b \times 7^d\) (with \(c=0\) for \(5\), and \(a=0\) for \(2\)):  
- \((b,d) = (0,0)\): \(3^0 \times 7^0 = 1\), units digit = \(1\) → include.  
- \((b,d) = (0,1)\): \(3^0 \times 7^1 = 7\), units digit = \(7\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (1,0)\): \(3^1 \times 7^0 = 3\), units digit = \(3\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (1,1)\): \(3^1 \times 7^1 = 21\), units digit = \(1\) → include.  
- \((b,d) = (2,0)\): \(3^2 \times 7^0 = 9\), units digit = \(9\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (2,1)\): \(3^2 \times 7^1 = 63\), units digit = \(3\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (3,0)\): \(3^3 \times 7^0 = 27\), units digit = \(7\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (3,1)\): \(3^3 \times 7^1 = 189\), units digit = \(9\) → exclude.  
- \((b,d) = (4,0)\): \(3^4 \times 7^0 = 81\), units digit = \(1\) → include.  
- \((b,d) = (4,1)\): \(3^4 \times 7^1 = 567\), units digit = \(7\) → exclude.  

Valid divisors: \(1, 21, 81\).  
Sum: \(1 + 21 + 81 = 103\).

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Overall: Sum divisors of \(9!\) with units digit \(1\).  
  - Subgoal: Factorize \(9!\) → **Done** (\(2^7 \times 3^4 \times 5 \times 7\)).  
  - Subgoal: Identify divisor form → Only \(3^b \times 7^d\) (no \(2\) or \(5\)).  
  - Subgoal: Enumerate \((b,d)\) pairs and filter by units digit → **Done**.  
    - Current goal: Sum valid divisors → **Done** (sum=\(103\)).  
**Current Goal**: Completed verification.  
[/REVIEW]  

### Final Answer  
The sum of the positive divisors of \(9!\) with units digit \(1\) is \(103\).
