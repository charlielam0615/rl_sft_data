### Problem Statement
We are tasked with finding the area of heptagon AFNBCEM in triangle ABC. Points A, D, E, and B lie on side AB with AD = 4, DE = 16, and EB = 8. Points A, F, G, and C lie on side AC with AF = 13, FG = 52, and GC = 26. Point M is the reflection of D through F, and point N is the reflection of G through E. The area of quadrilateral DEGF is given as 288. We need to determine the area of the heptagon AFNBCEM.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to solve for the area of heptagon AFNBCEM. The initial subgoals are:
1. Determine the coordinates or relative positions of all points (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, M, N) based on the given distances and reflections.
2. Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the information about points and distances.
3. Identify the structure of heptagon AFNBCEM and break it into smaller polygons or use coordinate geometry to find its area.
4. Use the given area of quadrilateral DEGF (288) to validate calculations or find necessary ratios.
5. Compute the final area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Upon reviewing the initial subgoals, I will refine them to ensure a clearer path to the solution. The adjusted subgoals are:
1. Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C for easier computation.
2. Place points D, E, F, and G based on the given distances along AB and AC.
3. Determine the positions of M and N using the reflection properties over F and E, respectively.
4. Verify the area of quadrilateral DEGF as 288 to ensure correct coordinate placement.
5. Compute the area of heptagon AFNBCEM using the shoelace formula or by breaking it into smaller shapes.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 3

Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]

Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Find the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
  - Subgoal 1: Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C.
  - Subgoal 2: Place points D, E, F, and G based on given distances.
  - Subgoal 3: Determine positions of M and N using reflection properties.
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the area of quadrilateral DEGF as 288.
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
Current Goal: Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C to establish a coordinate system for calculations.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C.
Description: I will place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity, point B along the x-axis based on the total length of AB (AD + DE + EB = 4 + 16 + 8 = 28), and point C based on the total length of AC (AF + FG + GC = 13 + 52 + 26 = 91) along another axis or direction to form triangle ABC.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
I will assign coordinates as follows:
- Point A: (0, 0)
- Point B: (28, 0) since AB = 28 units (calculated as AD + DE + EB = 4 + 16 + 8).
- For point C, I need to determine a suitable position. Since AC has a length breakdown, I will temporarily place C at (0, h) and solve for h later using additional information. However, for simplicity and to match the diagram's orientation, I will assume C is at (c_x, c_y) and use the distances along AC to find its coordinates later if necessary. To proceed, I will test C at (0, 91) as a placeholder, but this might not form a proper triangle. Instead, I will use the given TikZ coordinates as a guide but scale them appropriately later.
For now, let's set:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (28, 0)
- C: To be determined more accurately after placing intermediate points.
I will proceed to the next step to place points D, E, F, and G.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Place points D, E, F, and G based on given distances along AB and AC.
Description: Using the coordinates of A and B, place D and E on AB according to the distances AD = 4, DE = 16, EB = 8. Similarly, place F and G on AC using AF = 13, FG = 52, GC = 26, after estimating C's position.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
First, along AB:
- A is at (0, 0), B is at (28, 0).
- AD = 4, so D is at (4, 0).
- DE = 16, so E is at (4 + 16, 0) = (20, 0).
- EB = 8, from E at 20 to B at 28, which checks out (28 - 20 = 8).

Now, along AC:
- A is at (0, 0), C is temporarily unknown. Total AC distance is 91 (13 + 52 + 26).
- Since the diagram suggests C is not on the y-axis, I will assume a direction for AC. Let's try placing C to form a triangle. Based on TikZ coordinates (scaled down), C might be positioned relative to A and B. For simplicity, let's assume AC is not aligned with axes and solve using ratios later if needed. I will use the TikZ hint that C is at a position like (F)!2!(G) suggests midpoint or proportional placement.

To simplify, let's assign C at (0, c_y) and adjust later. However, looking at TikZ, C is at a higher x and y. Let's try C at (14, 28) as a rough estimate (half of AB's x for symmetry in triangle) and adjust using quadrilateral area.

Since exact placement is complex without solving equations, I will use the given quadrilateral area later to solve for heights or positions. For now:
- F is at distance 13 from A towards C.
- Let's assume C's position will be solved using quadrilateral DEGF area = 288.

Proceeding with D at (4,0), E at (20,0), I will define F and G after C's height is estimated.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)
I will work backward from the need to find the area of heptagon AFNBCEM to define necessary steps or information required. Since exact coordinates are challenging without solving for C's position, I will focus on:
1. Using the area of quadrilateral DEGF = 288 to find the height or relative positions in triangle ABC.
2. Define reflections M and N based on current points.
3. Compute areas using coordinate geometry or polygon decomposition.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
[REVIEW]
Goal Management System:
- Main Goal: Find the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
  - Subgoal 1: Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C. (Partially done: A at (0,0), B at (28,0), C to be finalized)
  - Subgoal 2: Place points D, E, F, and G based on given distances. (D at (4,0), E at (20,0), F and G pending C's position)
  - Subgoal 3: Determine positions of M and N using reflection properties.
  - Subgoal 4: Verify the area of quadrilateral DEGF as 288.
  - Subgoal 5: Compute the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
Current Goal: Use the area of quadrilateral DEGF to finalize positions of points, especially along AC.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Use the area of quadrilateral DEGF = 288 to determine positions or heights in triangle ABC.
Description: With D and E on AB at known x-coordinates, assume F and G lie on AC, estimate C's position, and use the quadrilateral area to solve for unknown coordinates or heights.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let's denote:
- A at (0,0), B at (28,0), C at (c_x, c_y).
- D at (4,0), E at (20,0).
- F is at distance 13 from A towards C, so parametrically, F's coordinates are proportional to C's coordinates scaled by (13 / 91).
- Total AC = 91, so F is at (13/91)*c_x, (13/91)*c_y.
- Similarly, G is at (13 + 52)/91 = 65/91 of the way from A to C, so G at (65/91)*c_x, (65/91)*c_y.

Quadrilateral DEGF has vertices at D(4,0), E(20,0), G((65/91)*c_x, (65/91)*c_y), F((13/91)*c_x, (13/91)*c_y).

Using the shoelace formula for quadrilateral DEGF:
Area = 1/2 |(x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y4 + x4y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x1)|
Points in order D, E, G, F:
x1=4, y1=0
x2=20, y2=0
x3=(65/91)*c_x, y3=(65/91)*c_y
x4=(13/91)*c_x, y4=(13/91)*c_y

Area = 1/2 |(4*0 + 20*(65/91)*c_y + (65/91)*c_x*(13/91)*c_y + (13/91)*c_x*0) - (0*20 + 0*(65/91)*c_x + (65/91)*c_y*(13/91)*c_x + (13/91)*c_y*4)|
= 1/2 |0 + (20*65/91)*c_y + (65*13)/(91*91)*c_x*c_y + 0 - (0 + 0 + (65*13)/(91*91)*c_y*c_x + (13/91)*c_y*4)|
= 1/2 |(1300/91)*c_y - (52/91)*c_y|
= 1/2 * c_y * (1300/91 - 52/91)
= 1/2 * c_y * (1248/91)
= (624/91)*c_y

Given area = 288, so:
(624/91)*c_y = 288
c_y = 288 * 91 / 624
= (288 / 624) * 91
= (12 / 26) * 91
= (6 / 13) * 91
= 42

So, c_y = 42. I will assume c_x for C's position and test if it affects further calculations. For simplicity, let's try c_x = 28 or adjust based on symmetry or triangle formation. In TikZ, C is to the right, so let's set C at (28, 42) temporarily and check consistency later.

Thus, C at (28, 42)
F at (13/91)*28, (13/91)*42 = (4, 6)
G at (65/91)*28, (65/91)*42 = (20, 30)

Recalculating area DEGF with D(4,0), E(20,0), G(20,30), F(4,6):
Area = 1/2 |(4*0 + 20*30 + 20*6 + 4*0) - (0*20 + 0*20 + 30*4 + 6*4)|
= 1/2 |0 + 600 + 120 + 0 - (0 + 0 + 120 + 24)|
= 1/2 |720 - 144| = 1/2 * 576 = 288
This matches the given area, so positions are correct:
A(0,0), B(28,0), C(28,42), D(4,0), E(20,0), F(4,6), G(20,30)
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine positions of M and N using reflection properties.
Description: Calculate M as the reflection of D over F, and N as the reflection of G over E, using the midpoint formula for reflections.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Reflection over a point means the point is the midpoint between the original and reflected point.
- M is reflection of D over F:
  F is midpoint of D and M.
  D at (4,0), F at (4,6), so M's coordinates:
  (x_m + 4)/2 = 4 → x_m + 4 = 8 → x_m = 4
  (y_m + 0)/2 = 6 → y_m = 12
  So, M at (4,12)

- N is reflection of G over E:
  E is midpoint of G and N.
  G at (20,30), E at (20,0), so N's coordinates:
  (x_n + 20)/2 = 20 → x_n + 20 = 40 → x_n = 20
  (y_n + 30)/2 = 0 → y_n + 30 = 0 → y_n = -30
  So, N at (20,-30)

Points are now:
A(0,0), B(28,0), C(28,42), D(4,0), E(20,0), F(4,6), G(20,30), M(4,12), N(20,-30)
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Compute the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
Description: Use the shoelace formula with the coordinates of points A, F, N, B, C, E, M in order to find the area of the heptagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Heptagon vertices in order: A(0,0), F(4,6), N(20,-30), B(28,0), C(28,42), E(20,0), M(4,12)

Using shoelace formula:
Area = 1/2 * |(sum of x_i * y_{i+1}) - (sum of y_i * x_{i+1})|

Listing points with last connecting to first:
1. A(0,0)
2. F(4,6)
3. N(20,-30)
4. B(28,0)
5. C(28,42)
6. E(20,0)
7. M(4,12)
8. Back to A(0,0)

Sum1 = x1*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y4 + x4*y5 + x5*y6 + x6*y7 + x7*y8
= 0*6 + 4*(-30) + 20*0 + 28*42 + 28*0 + 20*12 + 4*0
= 0 - 120 + 0 + 1176 + 0 + 240 + 0 = 1296

Sum2 = y1*x2 + y2*x3 + y3*x4 + y4*x5 + y5*x6 + y6*x7 + y7*x8
= 0*4 + 6*20 + (-30)*28 + 0*28 + 42*20 + 0*4 + 12*0
= 0 + 120 - 840 + 0 + 840 + 0 + 0 = 120

Area = 1/2 * |1296 - 120| = 1/2 * 1176 = 588
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate the computed area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
Description: Double-check the shoelace calculation and ensure all coordinates and order of points are correct for the heptagon.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Recomputing shoelace to confirm:
Points in order: A(0,0), F(4,6), N(20,-30), B(28,0), C(28,42), E(20,0), M(4,12)

Sum1:
0*6 = 0
4*(-30) = -120
20*0 = 0
28*42 = 1176
28*0 = 0
20*12 = 240
4*0 = 0
Total Sum1 = 0 - 120 + 0 + 1176 + 0 + 240 + 0 = 1296

Sum2:
0*4 = 0
6*20 = 120
-30*28 = -840
0*28 = 0
42*20 = 840
0*4 = 0
12*0 = 0
Total Sum2 = 0 + 120 - 840 + 0 + 840 + 0 + 0 = 120

Area = 1/2 * |1296 - 120| = 1/2 * 1176 = 588

Coordinates and order seem consistent with the problem description and diagram. Calculation appears correct.
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The area of heptagon AFNBCEM is 588.
