### Problem Statement
I need to find the sum of all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n + 2 \) divides the product \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \). This is a problem in Number Theory, and I will solve it by applying the meta-cognitive action set framework, selecting actions from Planning (P), Implementation (I), and Review (R) categories to systematically address the problem.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
I will break down the problem into manageable subgoals to guide the solution process. First, I need to understand the condition that \( n + 2 \) divides \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \), which means \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \) must be a multiple of \( n + 2 \). My initial subgoals are:
1. Simplify or rewrite the expression \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \) to see if it can be expressed in terms of \( n + 2 \).
2. Set up the divisibility condition mathematically, possibly as an equation or congruence.
3. Solve for positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the condition.
4. Sum up all such values of \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the expression \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \) to explore its relationship with \( n + 2 \).
Description: I will expand the expression and check if \( n + 2 \) appears as a factor or if it can be manipulated to show divisibility by \( n + 2 \). I might also try polynomial division or substitution to test the divisibility condition.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
I start by expanding the product \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \):
- First, compute \( n^2 + 9 \), which is already in a simple form.
- Then, multiply by \( n + 3 \): \( (n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = n^3 + 9n + 3n^2 + 27 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 9n + 27 \).
- Multiply by 3: \( 3(n^3 + 3n^2 + 9n + 27) = 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \).

Now, I need to check if \( n + 2 \) divides this polynomial. I can use polynomial division to divide \( 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \) by \( n + 2 \). If the remainder is zero, then \( n + 2 \) is a factor. Alternatively, by the Remainder Theorem, I can substitute \( n = -2 \) into the polynomial; if the result is zero, then \( n + 2 \) is a factor.
- Substituting \( n = -2 \): \( 3(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 + 27(-2) + 81 = 3(-8) + 9(4) + 27(-2) + 81 = -24 + 36 - 54 + 81 = 39 \), which is not zero. This indicates \( n + 2 \) is not a factor of the polynomial directly, so I need to reconsider the approach to divisibility.
[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]
Action: Adjust Subgoals (Planning)
Upon realizing that \( n + 2 \) does not directly divide the expanded polynomial, I will adjust my subgoals to focus on the divisibility condition more directly. New subgoals are:
1. Express the condition \( (n + 2) \) divides \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \) as \( \frac{3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)}{n + 2} \) being an integer.
2. Simplify this fraction or find an equivalent expression to make the divisibility clearer.
3. Test possible values of \( n \) or solve algebraically for integer solutions.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Simplify the expression \( \frac{3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)}{n + 2} \) to determine when it is an integer.
Description: I will attempt to factorize or rewrite the numerator to see if \( n + 2 \) can be canceled out or if the expression can be reduced to a polynomial whose integer values of \( n \) can be easily determined.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
I start with the expression \( \frac{3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)}{n + 2} \). Notice that \( n^2 + 9 = (n^2 + 6n + 9) - 6n = (n + 3)^2 - 6n \), but this might not help directly. Instead, I hypothesize that \( n^2 + 9 \) can be expressed in a form involving \( n + 2 \). Let me try to write \( n^2 + 9 \) in terms of \( n + 2 \):
- Let \( n + 2 = t \), so \( n = t - 2 \).
- Then \( n^2 + 9 = (t - 2)^2 + 9 = t^2 - 4t + 4 + 9 = t^2 - 4t + 13 \).
- Also, \( n + 3 = (t - 2) + 3 = t + 1 \).
- So the expression becomes \( \frac{3(t + 1)(t^2 - 4t + 13)}{t} \).

This looks promising. Now, split the fraction:
- \( 3(t + 1) \cdot \frac{t^2 - 4t + 13}{t} = 3(t + 1) \cdot \left( t - 4 + \frac{13}{t} \right) = 3(t + 1)(t - 4) + 3(t + 1) \cdot \frac{13}{t} \).
- For the entire expression to be an integer, \( \frac{13}{t} \) must be an integer because \( 3(t + 1)(t - 4) \) is already an integer. Thus, \( t \) must be a divisor of 13, i.e., \( t = \pm 1, \pm 13 \).
- Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( t = n + 2 > 0 \), so \( t = 1 \) or \( 13 \).
- Therefore, \( n + 2 = 1 \Rightarrow n = -1 \) (not positive), or \( n + 2 = 13 \Rightarrow n = 11 \).

I have one candidate, \( n = 11 \), but I should check other possible values or if I missed something in the substitution.
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Action: Validation (Implementation)
Current Goal: Validate if \( n = 11 \) satisfies the original condition and check for other possible solutions.
Description: I will substitute \( n = 11 \) back into the original expression to confirm divisibility and test a few other values of \( n \) to ensure I haven't missed any solutions, especially since my substitution method might not capture all cases.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
First, check \( n = 11 \):
- Compute \( n + 2 = 13 \).
- Compute \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3(14)(121 + 9) = 3(14)(130) = 3 \cdot 14 \cdot 130 = 5460 \).
- Check if 13 divides 5460: \( 5460 \div 13 = 420 \), which is an integer. So, yes, \( n = 11 \) works.

Now, test other values of \( n \) to see if there are additional solutions. Try \( n = 1 \):
- \( n + 2 = 3 \).
- \( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3(4)(10) = 120 \).
- \( 120 \div 3 = 40 \), which is an integer. So, \( n = 1 \) also works.

I missed \( n = 1 \) in my earlier substitution. Let me try \( n = 7 \):
- \( n + 2 = 9 \).
- \( 3(7 + 3)(7^2 + 9) = 3(10)(49 + 9) = 3(10)(58) = 1740 \).
- \( 1740 \div 9 = 193.\overline{3} \), not an integer. Correcting calculation: \( 9 \times 193 = 1737 \), remainder 3, so not divisible.

After testing a few values, I realize my substitution might have missed divisors because I assumed \( \frac{13}{t} \) must be integer, but there could be other factors. I should consider the full expression again or test more systematically. Let's list divisors of 13 and check both positive and negative \( t \), but focus on positive \( n \), and test small values of \( n \).

After testing \( n = 1 \) (works), \( n = 11 \) (works), try \( n = 2 \):
- \( n + 2 = 4 \).
- \( 3(2 + 3)(4 + 9) = 3(5)(13) = 195 \).
- \( 195 \div 4 = 48.75 \), not integer.

\( n = 3 \): \( n + 2 = 5 \), \( 3(6)(18 + 9) = 3(6)(27) = 486 \), \( 486 \div 5 = 97.2 \), not integer.

\( n = 5 \): \( n + 2 = 7 \), \( 3(8)(25 + 9) = 3(8)(34) = 816 \), \( 816 \div 7 \approx 116.57 \), not integer.

\( n = 15 \): \( n + 2 = 17 \), \( 3(18)(225 + 9) = 3(18)(234) = 12636 \), \( 12636 \div 17 = 743.294 \), not integer.

So far, \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 11 \) work. I will stop testing and assume these might be the only solutions for now, but I need a better algebraic method.
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]
Action: Backward Subgoaling (Planning)
Since testing values is inefficient, I will work backward from the condition that \( \frac{3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)}{n + 2} \) is an integer. My subgoals are:
1. Rewrite the expression to isolate terms and find an equation.
2. Solve the resulting equation for integer values of \( n \).
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Rewrite the divisibility condition as an equation to solve for \( n \).
Description: I will perform polynomial division on \( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \) by \( n + 2 \) to find the quotient and remainder, setting the remainder to zero or finding when the expression is divisible.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Perform polynomial division of \( 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \) by \( n + 2 \):
- Divide leading term: \( 3n^3 \div n = 3n^2 \).
- Multiply: \( 3n^2 (n + 2) = 3n^3 + 6n^2 \).
- Subtract: \( (3n^3 + 9n^2) - (3n^3 + 6n^2) = 3n^2 \).
- Bring down next term: \( 3n^2 + 27n \).
- Divide: \( 3n^2 \div n = 3n \).
- Multiply: \( 3n (n + 2) = 3n^2 + 6n \).
- Subtract: \( (3n^2 + 27n) - (3n^2 + 6n) = 21n \).
- Bring down next term: \( 21n + 81 \).
- Divide: \( 21n \div n = 21 \).
- Multiply: \( 21 (n + 2) = 21n + 42 \).
- Subtract: \( (21n + 81) - (21n + 42) = 39 \).

So, \( 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 = (n + 2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) + 39 \).

For \( n + 2 \) to divide the polynomial, the remainder must be zero, but it's 39, a constant. However, in the context of divisibility for specific \( n \), the correct interpretation is that \( n + 2 \) must divide the entire expression, so:

\( (n + 2) \) must divide 39 (since the remainder is 39, for the total to be divisible by \( n + 2 \), \( n + 2 \) must divide the remainder).

Divisors of 39 are \( \pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 13, \pm 39 \).
- \( n + 2 = 1 \Rightarrow n = -1 \) (not positive).
- \( n + 2 = 3 \Rightarrow n = 1 \).
- \( n + 2 = 13 \Rightarrow n = 11 \).
- \( n + 2 = 39 \Rightarrow n = 37 \).
- Negative divisors give negative \( n \), so discard.

Check \( n = 37 \):
- \( n + 2 = 39 \).
- \( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3(40)(1369 + 9) = 3(40)(1378) = 165360 \).
- \( 165360 \div 39 = 4240 \), which is an integer.

So, \( n = 1, 11, 37 \) are solutions.

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Action: Track Goals (Review)
[/PLANNING]
