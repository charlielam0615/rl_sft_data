### Problem Statement
We need to find the side length \( x \) of two squares, \( ABCD \) and \( AEFG \), which have equal side lengths and intersect at points \( A \) and \( O \). Given the distances \( CO = 2 \) and \( OA = 2\sqrt{2} \), determine the value of \( x \).

I will solve this problem by selecting one meta-cognitive action per step from the provided action set, adhering to the specified format with [PLANNING], [IMP], and [REVIEW] blocks as required.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
To solve for the side length \( x \), break down the problem into intermediate subgoals:  
1. Model the squares geometrically by assigning coordinates to their vertices.  
2. Use the given distances \( CO = 2 \) and \( OA = 2\sqrt{2} \) to set up equations.  
3. Solve the equations to find \( x \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to model the squares geometrically by assigning coordinates to their vertices. To achieve this, place square \( ABCD \) on the coordinate plane with \( A \) at the origin and assign coordinates to \( AEFG \), considering their intersection at \( A \) and \( O \).  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Place square \( ABCD \) with vertex \( A \) at \( (0, 0) \). Since the side length is \( x \), assume:  
- \( B = (x, 0) \),  
- \( C = (x, x) \),  
- \( D = (0, x) \).  

For square \( AEFG \), assume it is rotated relative to \( ABCD \) since they intersect at \( A \) and \( O \). Place \( A \) at \( (0, 0) \). Let \( E \) be at \( (x \cos \theta, x \sin \theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of rotation. The coordinates of \( F \) and \( G \) depend on the rotation and side length \( x \). Since \( O \) is the second intersection point, we need to find its coordinates using the given distances.

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the distances \( CO = 2 \) and \( OA = 2\sqrt{2} \) to set up equations. Achieve this by determining the coordinates of point \( O \), the intersection of the squares, and applying the distance conditions.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Assume point \( O \) has coordinates \( (p, q) \). Since \( O \) lies on a side of square \( AEFG \), consider it on side \( AE \). The line \( AE \) from \( (0, 0) \) to \( (x \cos \theta, x \sin \theta) \) can be parameterized as \( (t x \cos \theta, t x \sin \theta) \), where \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \). Suppose \( O = (t x \cos \theta, t x \sin \theta) \).

- **Distance \( OA \)**:  
  \( OA = \sqrt{(t x \cos \theta - 0)^2 + (t x \sin \theta - 0)^2} = t x \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = t x \).  
  Given \( OA = 2\sqrt{2} \), we have:  
  \( t x = 2\sqrt{2} \quad (1) \).

- **Distance \( CO \)**:  
  Point \( C = (x, x) \). The distance \( CO \) is:  
  \( CO = \sqrt{(t x \cos \theta - x)^2 + (t x \sin \theta - x)^2} = 2 \).  
  Simplify:  
  \( (t x \cos \theta - x)^2 + (t x \sin \theta - x)^2 = 4 \).  
  Factor out \( x^2 \):  
  \( x^2 [(t \cos \theta - 1)^2 + (t \sin \theta - 1)^2] = 4 \quad (2) \).

We need to find the coordinates of \( O \) as an intersection point, so assume \( O \) also lies on a side of square \( ABCD \), say side \( BC \) from \( (x, 0) \) to \( (x, x) \), parameterized as \( (x, s x) \), where \( 0 \leq s \leq 1 \). Thus, \( O = (x, s x) \).

- **Distance \( OA \)**:  
  \( OA = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (s x - 0)^2} = x \sqrt{1 + s^2} = 2\sqrt{2} \).  
  Thus:  
  \( x \sqrt{1 + s^2} = 2\sqrt{2} \quad (3) \).

- **Distance \( CO \)**:  
  \( CO = \sqrt{(x - x)^2 + (s x - x)^2} = |s x - x| = x |s - 1| = 2 \).  
  Thus:  
  \( x |s - 1| = 2 \quad (4) \).

Since \( O \) is the intersection, equate the coordinates of \( O \):  
\( (t x \cos \theta, t x \sin \theta) = (x, s x) \).  
This gives:  
- \( t x \cos \theta = x \implies t \cos \theta = 1 \implies \cos \theta = \frac{1}{t} \) (since \( x \neq 0 \)).  
- \( t x \sin \theta = s x \implies t \sin \theta = s \).  

From equation (3):  
\( x = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + s^2}} \).  

From equation (4):  
\( x |s - 1| = 2 \implies x = \frac{2}{|s - 1|} \).  

Equate the two expressions for \( x \):  
\( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + s^2}} = \frac{2}{|s - 1|} \).  
Simplify:  
\( \sqrt{2} |s - 1| = \sqrt{1 + s^2} \).  
Square both sides:  
\( 2 (s - 1)^2 = 1 + s^2 \).  
Expand:  
\( 2s^2 - 4s + 2 = 1 + s^2 \).  
Simplify:  
\( s^2 - 4s + 1 = 0 \).  
Solve the quadratic equation:  
\( s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{12}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{3} \).  

Since \( 0 \leq s \leq 1 \), test \( s = 2 - \sqrt{3} \approx 0.268 \), which is in \( [0, 1] \). Discard \( s = 2 + \sqrt{3} \approx 3.732 \).

Using \( s = 2 - \sqrt{3} \):  
From equation (4):  
\( x | (2 - \sqrt{3}) - 1 | = 2 \implies x | 1 - \sqrt{3} | = 2 \implies x (\sqrt{3} - 1) = 2 \).  
Thus:  
\( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \).  
Rationalize:  
\( x = \frac{2 (\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{2 (\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \sqrt{3} + 1 \).

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution \( x = \sqrt{3} + 1 \). Achieve this by substituting \( x \) back into the distance equations and checking consistency.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]  
Using \( x = \sqrt{3} + 1 \), \( s = 2 - \sqrt{3} \):  
- **Check \( OA \)**:  
  \( O = (x, s x) \), so compute \( x \):  
  \( x = \sqrt{3} + 1 \), \( s x = (2 - \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2\sqrt{3} + 2 - 3 - \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3} - 1 \).  
  Thus, \( O = (\sqrt{3} + 1, \sqrt{3} - 1) \).  
  \( OA = \sqrt{(\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 + (\sqrt{3} - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(3 + 2\sqrt{3} + 1) + (3 - 2\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \).  
  This matches \( OA = 2\sqrt{2} \).  

- **Check \( CO \)**:  
  \( C = (x, x) = (\sqrt{3} + 1, \sqrt{3} + 1) \).  
  \( CO = \sqrt{((\sqrt{3} + 1) - (\sqrt{3} + 1))^2 + ((\sqrt{3} - 1) - (\sqrt{3} + 1))^2} = \sqrt{0 + (-2)^2} = 2 \).  
  This matches \( CO = 2 \).  

The solution satisfies both conditions.
