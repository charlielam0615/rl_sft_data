$$
Compute the two possible values of $a+b+c$. In your answer, list the two values in a comma-separated list of two valid \LaTeX expressions.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
**Current Goal:** Understand the problem and define the overarching strategy.
**Subgoals:**
1.  Express the given system of equations in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials $S_1 = a+b+c$, $S_2 = ab+bc+ca$, and $S_3 = abc$.
2.  Derive multiple independent relations between $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
3.  Solve the system of equations for $S_1$.
4.  Identify and discard any extraneous solutions for $S_1$ that might violate the condition that $a,b,c$ are pairwise distinct.
5.  List the remaining valid values of $a+b+c$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 2
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Establish the first relation between $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
**How to achieve it:** Sum the three given equations: $a^2=b+6$, $b^2=c+6$, and $c^2=a+6$. Use the identity $a^2+b^2+c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca)$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Summing the given equations:
$a^2+b^2+c^2 = (b+6)+(c+6)+(a+6)$
$a^2+b^2+c^2 = a+b+c+18$

Using the identity $S_1^2 - 2S_2 = a^2+b^2+c^2$, we substitute this into the summed equation:
$S_1^2 - 2S_2 = S_1 + 18$
This gives us our first relation: $2S_2 = S_1^2 - S_1 - 18$.

The current goal is to derive additional relations between $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
**Current Goal:** Derive a second independent relation involving $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
**Subgoals:** Consider subtracting the equations pairwise to find a useful identity, then manipulate it to relate $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Derive the second relation $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)=1$ and express it in terms of $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
**How to achieve it:** Subtract the original equations pairwise, for example, $a^2-b^2 = b-c$. Factor the difference of squares and observe the pattern. Then multiply these identities.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Subtracting the equations pairwise:
1.  $a^2-b^2 = (b+6)-(c+6) \implies (a-b)(a+b) = b-c$
2.  $b^2-c^2 = (c+6)-(a+6) \implies (b-c)(b+c) = c-a$
3.  $c^2-a^2 = (a+6)-(b+6) \implies (c-a)(c+a) = a-b$

Since $a,b,c$ are pairwise distinct, $a-b \neq 0$, $b-c \neq 0$, $c-a \neq 0$.
Multiply these three equations:
$(a-b)(a+b) \cdot (b-c)(b+c) \cdot (c-a)(c+a) = (b-c)(c-a)(a-b)$

Since $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a) \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by this product:
$(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 1$

Now, express this in terms of $S_1, S_2, S_3$. Recall that $a+b=S_1-c$, $b+c=S_1-a$, $c+a=S_1-b$.
$(S_1-c)(S_1-a)(S_1-b) = 1$
Expanding the left side:
$S_1^3 - (a+b+c)S_1^2 + (ab+bc+ca)S_1 - abc = 1$
$S_1^3 - S_1 \cdot S_1^2 + S_2 S_1 - S_3 = 1$
$S_1^3 - S_1^3 + S_1 S_2 - S_3 = 1$
So, our second relation is: $S_1 S_2 - S_3 = 1$.

**Current Goal:** To find the values of $a+b+c$.

    *   Subgoal 2: Derive multiple independent relations between $S_1, S_2, S_3$. (In progress, we have $S_1^2 - 2S_2 = S_1 + 18$ and $S_1 S_2 - S_3 = 1$)

The current goal is to derive a third independent relation between $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]
Forward Subgoaling (Planning)
**Current Goal:** Derive a third independent relation involving $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
**Subgoals:** Consider relations involving higher powers, specifically the sum of cubes $a^3+b^3+c^3$.
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Derive the third relation using the sum of cubes and express it in terms of $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
**How to achieve it:** Multiply each original equation by $a, b, c$ respectively ($a^2=b+6 \implies a^3=ab+6a$, etc.) and sum them. Use the identity for sum of cubes $a^3+b^3+c^3 = S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 3S_3$.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Multiply the original equations by $a, b, c$ respectively:
$a(a^2) = a(b+6) \implies a^3 = ab+6a$
$b(b^2) = b(c+6) \implies b^3 = bc+6b$
$c(c^2) = c(a+6) \implies c^3 = ca+6c$

Summing these new equations:
$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (ab+bc+ca) + 6(a+b+c)$
$a^3+b^3+c^3 = S_2 + 6S_1$

Now, use the identity for the sum of cubes: $a^3+b^3+c^3 = S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 3S_3$.
So, our third relation is: $S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 3S_3 = S_2 + 6S_1$.

The current goal is to combine these relations to find a polynomial equation for $S_1$.
[/REVIEW]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Combine the derived relations to form a single polynomial equation in $S_1$.
**How to achieve it:** Use relation (1) to express $S_2$ in terms of $S_1$. Use relation (2) to express $S_3$ in terms of $S_1$ and $S_2$. Substitute these into relation (3).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
From relation (1): $S_2 = \frac{S_1^2 - S_1 - 18}{2}$.
From relation (2): $S_3 = S_1 S_2 - 1$.
Substitute $S_2$ into the expression for $S_3$:
$S_3 = S_1 \left(\frac{S_1^2 - S_1 - 18}{2}\right) - 1 = \frac{S_1^3 - S_1^2 - 18S_1 - 2}{2}$.

Now substitute $S_2$ and $S_3$ into relation (3): $S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 3S_3 = S_2 + 6S_1$.
$S_1^3 - 3S_1 \left(\frac{S_1^2 - S_1 - 18}{2}\right) + 3\left(\frac{S_1^3 - S_1^2 - 18S_1 - 2}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{S_1^2 - S_1 - 18}{2}\right) + 6S_1$
Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear denominators:
$2S_1^3 - 3S_1(S_1^2 - S_1 - 18) + 3(S_1^3 - S_1^2 - 18S_1 - 2) = (S_1^2 - S_1 - 18) + 12S_1$
$2S_1^3 - 3S_1^3 + 3S_1^2 + 54S_1 + 3S_1^3 - 3S_1^2 - 54S_1 - 6 = S_1^2 + 11S_1 - 18$
Combining terms on the left side:
$(2-3+3)S_1^3 + (3-3)S_1^2 + (54-54)S_1 - 6 = S_1^2 + 11S_1 - 18$
$2S_1^3 - 6 = S_1^2 + 11S_1 - 18$
Rearranging into a standard polynomial form:
$2S_1^3 - S_1^2 - 11S_1 + 12 = 0$.
[/IMP]

### Step 11
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Solve the cubic equation for $S_1$.
**How to achieve it:** Use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots, then perform polynomial division to factor the cubic.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let $P(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 - 11x + 12$.
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are $\pm p/q$, where $p$ divides 12 and $q$ divides 2.
Possible values for $p$: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$.
Possible values for $q$: $1, 2$.
Possible rational roots: $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12, \pm 1/2, \pm 3/2$.

Test $x=3/2$:
$P(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - (3/2)^2 - 11(3/2) + 12$
$= 2(27/8) - 9/4 - 33/2 + 12$
$= 27/4 - 9/4 - 66/4 + 48/4$
$= (27-9-66+48)/4 = (75-75)/4 = 0$.
So $x=3/2$ is a root. This means $(2x-3)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.

Perform polynomial division:
$(2x^3 - x^2 - 11x + 12) \div (2x-3) = x^2+x-4$.
So $P(x) = (2x-3)(x^2+x-4) = 0$.

Now, solve the quadratic factor $x^2+x-4=0$ using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+16}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{17}}{2}$.

Thus, the three possible values for $S_1 = a+b+c$ are $3/2$, $\frac{-1+\sqrt{17}}{2}$, and $\frac{-1-\sqrt{17}}{2}$.

[/PLANNING]

### Step 14
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
**Current Goal:** Derive a fourth relation by multiplying the original equations and check if all roots of the cubic equation satisfy this relation.
**How to achieve it:** Multiply $a^2=b+6$, $b^2=c+6$, $c^2=a+6$. Express the resulting equation in terms of $S_1, S_2, S_3$. Substitute the expressions for $S_2$ and $S_3$ in terms of $S_1$ (derived from earlier relations) into this new equation. Check if $S_1=3/2$ satisfies this final relation.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Multiply the original equations:
$a^2 \cdot b^2 \cdot c^2 = (b+6)(c+6)(a+6)$
$(abc)^2 = (b+6)(c+6)(a+6)$
$S_3^2 = abc + 6(ab+bc+ca) + 36(a+b+c) + 216$
$S_3^2 = S_3 + 6S_2 + 36S_1 + 216$. (This is our fourth relation)

We have expressions for $S_2$ and $S_3$ in terms of $S_1$ from previous steps:
$S_2 = \frac{S_1^2 - S_1 - 18}{2}$
$S_3 = \frac{S_1^3 - S_1^2 - 18S_1 - 2}{2}$

Let's test $S_1 = 3/2$.
First, calculate $S_2$ and $S_3$ for $S_1=3/2$:
$S_2 = \frac{(3/2)^2 - (3/2) - 18}{2} = \frac{9/4 - 6/4 - 72/4}{2} = \frac{-69/4}{2} = -69/8$.
$S_3 = \frac{(3/2)^3 - (3/2)^2 - 18(3/2) - 2}{2} = \frac{27/8 - 9/4 - 27 - 2}{2} = \frac{27/8 - 18/8 - 216/8 - 16/8}{2} = \frac{-223/8}{2} = -223/16$.

Now substitute these values into the fourth relation $S_3^2 = S_3 + 6S_2 + 36S_1 + 216$:
LHS: $S_3^2 = (-223/16)^2 = 49729/256$.
RHS: $S_3 + 6S_2 + 36S_1 + 216 = (-223/16) + 6(-69/8) + 36(3/2) + 216$
$= -223/16 - 414/8 + 54 + 216$
$= -223/16 - 828/16 + 270$
$= (-223 - 828)/16 + 270 = -1051/16 + 270$
$= -1051/16 + (270 \times 16)/16 = -1051/16 + 4320/16 = 3269/16$.
To compare, convert to common denominator: $3269/16 = (3269 \times 16) / (16 \times 16) = 52304/256$.
Since $49729/256 \neq 52304/256$, the value $S_1=3/2$ does not satisfy this necessary condition derived from the product of the original equations.
Therefore, $S_1=3/2$ is an extraneous root and must be discarded.

The other two roots, $\frac{-1+\sqrt{17}}{2}$ and $\frac{-1-\sqrt{17}}{2}$, must satisfy this relation, as they represent the true solutions to the system. These two values correspond to cases where $a,b,c$ are pairwise distinct. If $a=b=c$, then $a=3$ or $a=-2$, leading to $a+b+c=9$ or $a+b+c=-6$. Neither of these are among the three roots found for $S_1$.
