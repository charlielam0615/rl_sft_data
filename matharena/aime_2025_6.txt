### Problem Statement
We need to find \( r^2 + s^2 \), where \( r \) and \( s \) are the lengths of the parallel sides of an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle of radius 3 and an area of 72.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process.  
To find \( r^2 + s^2 \), we need to:  
1. Use the property that the trapezoid has an inscribed circle (is tangential), implying the sum of the parallel sides equals the sum of the non-parallel sides.  
2. Use the given area (72) and radius (3) to establish relationships between \( r \), \( s \), and other geometric properties.  
3. Derive expressions for \( r \) and \( s \) or directly for \( r^2 + s^2 \).

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the tangential property of the trapezoid (sum of parallel sides equals sum of non-parallel sides) and the given radius to set up initial equations. We will apply the property that for a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of opposite sides is equal, and use the inradius formula to relate the area and radius.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
For a tangential quadrilateral (like our isosceles trapezoid), the sum of the parallel sides equals the sum of the non-parallel sides. Let the parallel sides be \( r \) and \( s \), and the non-parallel sides (legs) of the isosceles trapezoid be equal, each of length \( l \). Thus:  
\[ r + s = 2l \]  
The area of a tangential quadrilateral is given by:  
\[ \text{Area} = \text{radius} \times \text{semiperimeter} \]  
Given the area is 72 and radius is 3, the semiperimeter \( t \) is:  
\[ 72 = 3 \times t \implies t = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \]  
The perimeter is:  
\[ 2t = r + s + l + l = r + s + 2l = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]  
Since \( r + s = 2l \), substitute:  
\[ 2l + 2l = 4l = 48 \implies l = 12 \]  
Thus:  
\[ r + s = 2l = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Use the results from Step 2 (\( r + s = 24 \), leg length \( l = 12 \)) to set up further subgoals:  
1. Use the area formula for a trapezoid to relate \( r \), \( s \), and the height.  
2. Incorporate the inradius to find the height or other geometric relationships.  
3. Solve for \( r \) and \( s \), then compute \( r^2 + s^2 \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to use the trapezoid’s area formula and the inradius to find the height and establish relationships to solve for \( r \) and \( s \). We will use the area formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}(r + s)h \) and the inradius formula to proceed.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The area of a trapezoid is:  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}(r + s)h \]  
Given the area is 72 and \( r + s = 24 \):  
\[ 72 = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times h \implies 72 = 12h \implies h = 6 \]  
For a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius \( r_{\text{in}} \) is:  
\[ r_{\text{in}} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{semiperimeter}} \]  
This was already used to confirm \( t = 24 \). Now, consider the geometry of the isosceles trapezoid. The height \( h = 6 \) is related to the inradius. For a trapezoid with an inscribed circle, the inradius is equal to the height divided by 2 (since the circle’s diameter equals the height):  
\[ r_{\text{in}} = \frac{h}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]  
This confirms the radius of 3, validating our height. Now, we need the difference between the parallel sides. Drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the top base to the bottom base, forming two right triangles on the sides and a rectangle in the middle. The horizontal distance between the top and bottom bases (difference in lengths) is split equally:  
\[ \frac{|r - s|}{2} = \text{horizontal leg of right triangle} \]  
In each right triangle, the vertical leg is the height \( h = 6 \), and the hypotenuse is the leg of the trapezoid \( l = 12 \). The horizontal leg \( d \) is:  
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 - h^2} = \sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{144 - 36} = \sqrt{108} = 6\sqrt{3} \]  
Thus:  
\[ |r - s| = 2d = 2 \times 6\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{3} \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to solve for \( r \) and \( s \) using the equations \( r + s = 24 \) and \( |r - s| = 12\sqrt{3} \), then compute \( r^2 + s^2 \). We will solve these equations and calculate the final expression.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
We have:  
\[ r + s = 24 \]  
\[ |r - s| = 12\sqrt{3} \]  
Consider \( r - s = 12\sqrt{3} \) (the negative case is symmetric). Solve the system:  
\[ r + s = 24 \]  
\[ r - s = 12\sqrt{3} \]  
Add the equations:  
\[ 2r = 24 + 12\sqrt{3} \implies r = 12 + 6\sqrt{3} \]  
Subtract the equations:  
\[ 2s = 24 - 12\sqrt{3} \implies s = 12 - 6\sqrt{3} \]  
Compute \( r^2 + s^2 \):  
\[ r^2 + s^2 = (r + s)^2 - 2rs = 24^2 - 2rs = 576 - 2rs \]  
Find \( rs \):  
\[ rs = (12 + 6\sqrt{3})(12 - 6\sqrt{3}) = 12^2 - (6\sqrt{3})^2 = 144 - 36 \cdot 3 = 144 - 108 = 36 \]  
Thus:  
\[ r^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2 \cdot 36 = 576 - 72 = 504 \]  
Check the negative case (\( r - s = -12\sqrt{3} \)):  
\[ r = 12 - 6\sqrt{3}, \quad s = 12 + 6\sqrt{3} \]  
\[ rs = (12 - 6\sqrt{3})(12 + 6\sqrt{3}) = 36 \]  
\[ r^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2 \cdot 36 = 504 \]  
Both cases yield the same \( r^2 + s^2 \).

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the solution by checking if the derived values of \( r \), \( s \), height, and leg length satisfy all given conditions (area, inradius, tangential property).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Take \( r = 12 + 6\sqrt{3} \), \( s = 12 - 6\sqrt{3} \):  
- **Tangential property**: \( r + s = (12 + 6\sqrt{3}) + (12 - 6\sqrt{3}) = 24 \), and leg length \( l = 12 \), so \( 2l = 24 \), satisfying \( r + s = 2l \).  
- **Area**: Height \( h = 6 \), so:  
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}(r + s)h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 24 \cdot 6 = 72 \]  
- **Inradius**: Semiperimeter \( t = \frac{r + s + 2l}{2} = \frac{24 + 24}{2} = 24 \), so:  
\[ r_{\text{in}} = \frac{\text{Area}}{t} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]  
- **Leg length**: Horizontal leg \( d = 6\sqrt{3} \), so \( |r - s| = |(12 + 6\sqrt{3}) - (12 - 6\sqrt{3})| = 12\sqrt{3} \). Check triangle:  
\[ \sqrt{(6\sqrt{3})^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{108 + 36} = \sqrt{144} = 12 = l \]  
All conditions are satisfied.
