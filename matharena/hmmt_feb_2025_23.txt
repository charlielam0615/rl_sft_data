### Step 3

Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Determine the relationship between the areas of the triangles and the distances from P to the sides of the square.
To achieve this, we can consider the base and height of each triangle. The base of each triangle is a side of the square. The height of each triangle with respect to that base is the perpendicular distance from point P to that side of the square. Let the side length of the square be 's'. Let the distances from P to sides AB, BC, CD, DA be $h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4$ respectively.
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
Let the square be ABCD with vertices A=(0,s), B=(s,s), C=(s,0), D=(0,0). Let P=(x,y).
The side length of the square is s.
The distance from P to AB is $|y-s| = s-y$ (since P is inside the square, $0 < y < s$). Let this be $h_1 = s-y$.
The distance from P to BC is $|x-s| = s-x$ (since P is inside the square, $0 < x < s$). Let this be $h_2 = s-x$.
The distance from P to CD is $|y-0| = y$. Let this be $h_3 = y$.
The distance from P to DA is $|x-0| = x$. Let this be $h_4 = x$.

The area of $\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot h_1 = \frac{1}{2} s (s-y)$.
The area of $\triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h_2 = \frac{1}{2} s (s-x)$.
The area of $\triangle PCD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot CD \cdot h_3 = \frac{1}{2} s y$.
The area of $\triangle PDA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot DA \cdot h_4 = \frac{1}{2} s x$.

We are given that these areas are 1, 2, 3, 4 in some order.
Let Area(PAB) = $A_1$, Area(PBC) = $A_2$, Area(PCD) = $A_3$, Area(PDA) = $A_4$.
We have the following relationships:
$A_1 = \frac{1}{2} s (s-y)$
$A_2 = \frac{1}{2} s (s-x)$
$A_3 = \frac{1}{2} s y$
$A_4 = \frac{1}{2} s x$

From $A_3$ and $A_1$:
$A_3 + A_1 = \frac{1}{2} s y + \frac{1}{2} s (s-y) = \frac{1}{2} s y + \frac{1}{2} s^2 - \frac{1}{2} s y = \frac{1}{2} s^2$.
This means the sum of the areas of triangles with opposite bases (PCD and PAB) is $\frac{1}{2} s^2$.
Similarly, from $A_4$ and $A_2$:
$A_4 + A_2 = \frac{1}{2} s x + \frac{1}{2} s (s-x) = \frac{1}{2} s x + \frac{1}{2} s^2 - \frac{1}{2} s x = \frac{1}{2} s^2$.
The sum of the areas of triangles with opposite bases (PDA and PBC) is also $\frac{1}{2} s^2$.

The total area of the square is $s^2$. The sum of the areas of the four triangles is also the area of the square: $A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = s^2$.
Given the areas are 1, 2, 3, 4, the sum is $1+2+3+4 = 10$.
So, $s^2 = 10$.

From the sums of opposite areas:
Area(PCD) + Area(PAB) = $\frac{1}{2} s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 = 5$.
Area(PDA) + Area(PBC) = $\frac{1}{2} s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 = 5$.

This tells us that the areas are paired such that opposite triangles sum to 5. The pairs from the given areas (1, 2, 3, 4) that sum to 5 are (1, 4) and (2, 3).
This means either {Area(PAB), Area(PCD)} = {1, 4} and {Area(PBC), Area(PDA)} = {2, 3}, or {Area(PAB), Area(PCD)} = {2, 3} and {Area(PBC), Area(PDA)} = {1, 4}.

Let's assume Area(PCD) = 3 and Area(PAB) = 2. Then Area(PDA) = 4 and Area(PBC) = 1.
Using our formulas:
$\frac{1}{2} s y = 3 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} y = 3 \implies y = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$\frac{1}{2} s (s-y) = 2 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10}-y) = 2 \implies 5 - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} y = 2 \implies 5 - 3 = 2$. This is consistent.

$\frac{1}{2} s x = 4 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} x = 4 \implies x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$\frac{1}{2} s (s-x) = 1 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10}-x) = 1 \implies 5 - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} x = 1 \implies 5 - 4 = 1$. This is also consistent.

So, one possible assignment of areas is Area(PAB)=2, Area(PBC)=1, Area(PCD)=3, Area(PDA)=4.
In this case, $s=\sqrt{10}$, $x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$, $y = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$.

Let's consider another possible assignment: Area(PCD) = 4 and Area(PAB) = 1. Then Area(PDA) = 3 and Area(PBC) = 2.
$\frac{1}{2} s y = 4 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} y = 4 \implies y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$\frac{1}{2} s (s-y) = 1 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10}-y) = 1 \implies 5 - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} y = 1 \implies 5 - 4 = 1$. Consistent.

$\frac{1}{2} s x = 3 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} x = 3 \implies x = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$\frac{1}{2} s (s-x) = 2 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10}-x) = 2 \implies 5 - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} x = 2 \implies 5 - 3 = 2$. Consistent.

So, another possible assignment is Area(PAB)=1, Area(PBC)=2, Area(PCD)=4, Area(PDA)=3.
In this case, $s=\sqrt{10}$, $x = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$, $y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.

The relationship between the areas and the distances from P to the sides is established. We also found the side length of the square and potential coordinates of P based on the area assignments.

[/REVIEW]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]
Reach Goal (Implementation)
Current Goal: Use the given areas to find information about the position of P within the square.
We have already used the areas to determine the side length of the square ($s=\sqrt{10}$) and the coordinates of P based on the assignment of areas to the triangles.
Let's use the case where Area(PAB)=1, Area(PBC)=2, Area(PCD)=4, Area(PDA)=3.
From Step 3, we found $s=\sqrt{10}$, $x = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$, $y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.
So, P has coordinates $(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}})$ relative to D=(0,0).
The vertices of the square are A=(0, $\sqrt{10}$), B=($\sqrt{10}$, $\sqrt{10}$), C=($\sqrt{10}$, 0), D=(0,0).
[/PLANNING]
[IMP]
With $s=\sqrt{10}$, and assuming Area(PAB)=1, Area(PBC)=2, Area(PCD)=4, Area(PDA)=3:
Area(PCD) = $\frac{1}{2} s y = 4 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} y = 4 \implies y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.
Area(PDA) = $\frac{1}{2} s x = 3 \implies \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} x = 3 \implies x = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$.
So P has coordinates $(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}})$.

Let's verify with the other areas:
Area(PAB) = $\frac{1}{2} s (s-y) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10} - \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\frac{10-8}{\sqrt{10}}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1$. Correct.
Area(PBC) = $\frac{1}{2} s (s-x) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\sqrt{10} - \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{10} (\frac{10-6}{\sqrt{10}}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 = 2$. Correct.

The position of P is $(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}})$ when the areas are assigned as 1, 2, 4, 3 to PAB, PBC, PCD, PDA respectively.
If we used the other assignment (Area(PAB)=2, Area(PBC)=1, Area(PCD)=3, Area(PDA)=4), we would get $x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$ and $y = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$. P would be at $(\frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}})$.
This shows that the specific coordinates of P depend on the assignment of the areas. However, the problem asks for $PA \cdot PB \cdot PC \cdot PD$, and we need to see if this product is independent of the area assignment.

### Step 7

Current Goal: Express the distances PA, PB, PC, PD in terms of the coordinates of P or other geometric properties.
We have the coordinates of the vertices of the square and the coordinates of P. We can use the distance formula. Let the side length of the square be $s$, and the coordinates of P be (x,y) with respect to D=(0,0).
A=(0,s), B=(s,s), C=(s,0), D=(0,0).
P=(x,y).

[IMP]
$PA^2 = (x-0)^2 + (y-s)^2 = x^2 + (y-s)^2$
$PB^2 = (x-s)^2 + (y-s)^2$
$PC^2 = (x-s)^2 + (y-0)^2 = (x-s)^2 + y^2$
$PD^2 = (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = x^2 + y^2$

We need to compute $PA \cdot PB \cdot PC \cdot PD$, which is $\sqrt{PA^2 \cdot PB^2 \cdot PC^2 \cdot PD^2}$.
So we need to compute $PA^2 \cdot PB^2 \cdot PC^2 \cdot PD^2$.

Let's use the values from the case where $s=\sqrt{10}$, $x = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$, $y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$s^2 = 10$.
$x^2 = (\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = \frac{36}{10} = 3.6$.
$y^2 = (\frac{8}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = \frac{64}{10} = 6.4$.
$x^2 + y^2 = 3.6 + 6.4 = 10$. This is $PD^2$.

$PA^2 = x^2 + (y-s)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2sy + s^2 = 10 - 2\sqrt{10}(\frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}) + 10 = 10 - 16 + 10 = 4$.
$PB^2 = (x-s)^2 + (y-s)^2 = x^2 - 2sx + s^2 + y^2 - 2sy + s^2 = (x^2+y^2) - 2s(x+y) + 2s^2 = 10 - 2\sqrt{10}(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}} + \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}) + 2(10) = 10 - 2(6+8) + 20 = 10 - 2(14) + 20 = 10 - 28 + 20 = 2$.
$PC^2 = (x-s)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 2sx + s^2 + y^2 = (x^2+y^2) - 2sx + s^2 = 10 - 2\sqrt{10}(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}) + 10 = 10 - 12 + 10 = 8$.
$PD^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 10$.

So, $PA^2 \cdot PB^2 \cdot PC^2 \cdot PD^2 = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 10 = 640$.
$PA \cdot PB \cdot PC \cdot PD = \sqrt{640} = \sqrt{64 \cdot 10} = 8\sqrt{10}$.

Let's check the other case where $x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}}$ and $y = \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}$.
$x^2 = 6.4$, $y^2 = 3.6$. $x^2+y^2 = 10$.
$PA^2 = x^2 + (y-s)^2 = 6.4 + (\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}} - \sqrt{10})^2 = 6.4 + (\frac{6-10}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = 6.4 + (\frac{-4}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = 6.4 + \frac{16}{10} = 6.4 + 1.6 = 8$.
$PB^2 = (x-s)^2 + (y-s)^2 = (\frac{8}{\sqrt{10}} - \sqrt{10})^2 + (\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}} - \sqrt{10})^2 = (\frac{8-10}{\sqrt{10}})^2 + (\frac{6-10}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = (\frac{-2}{\sqrt{10}})^2 + (\frac{-4}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = \frac{4}{10} + \frac{16}{10} = \frac{20}{10} = 2$.
$PC^2 = (x-s)^2 + y^2 = (\frac{8}{\sqrt{10}} - \sqrt{10})^2 + (\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}})^2 = (\frac{8-10}{\sqrt{10}})^2 + \frac{36}{10} = \frac{4}{10} + 3.6 = 0.4 + 3.6 = 4$.
$PD^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 6.4 + 3.6 = 10$.

$PA^2 \cdot PB^2 \cdot PC^2 \cdot PD^2 = 8 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 = 640$.
$PA \cdot PB \cdot PC \cdot PD = \sqrt{640} = 8\sqrt{10}$.

The result is independent of the assignment of the areas.
We have expressed the distances squared in terms of the coordinates and the side length.
