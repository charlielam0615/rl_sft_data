### Problem Statement
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that the polynomials \( z^n - 1 \) and \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n - 1 \) share a common complex root. This is an algebra problem requiring us to identify a complex number \( z \) that satisfies both \( z^n = 1 \) and \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) for the same \( n \), and to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which this occurs.

### Step 1: Forward Subgoaling
[PLANNING]
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into intermediate subgoals to guide the solution process:  
1. Understand the equations \( z^n = 1 \) and \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \).  
2. Identify the roots of \( z^n = 1 \) (the \( n \)-th roots of unity).  
3. Express the condition \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) in terms of the roots of unity.  
4. Find a common root \( z \) that satisfies both equations.  
5. Determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which a common root exists.

### Step 2: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Understand the equations \( z^n = 1 \) and \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the mathematical meaning of both equations. The equation \( z^n = 1 \) implies \( z \) is an \( n \)-th root of unity. The equation \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) implies \( z - \sqrt{3} \) is also an \( n \)-th root of unity. We need to find a \( z \) that satisfies both simultaneously.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation \( z^n = 1 \) has solutions \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} \), where \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \), which are the \( n \)-th roots of unity. Similarly, \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) implies \( z - \sqrt{3} = e^{2\pi i m / n} \) for some integer \( m \), so \( z = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \). We need \( z \) to be a common root, so \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} \) must equal \( z = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \) for some \( k \) and \( m \).

[/REVIEW]

### Step 4: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Identify the roots of \( z^n = 1 \).  
**How to Achieve**: Use the known formula for the \( n \)-th roots of unity to list the roots explicitly.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The roots of \( z^n = 1 \) are the \( n \)-th roots of unity, given by:  
\[ z = e^{2\pi i k / n}, \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1. \]  
These roots lie on the unit circle in the complex plane at angles \( \frac{2\pi k}{n} \). For example, when \( k = 0 \), \( z = e^{0} = 1 \); when \( k = 1 \), \( z = e^{2\pi i / n} \), and so on.  
[/IMP]

### Step 5: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Express the condition \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) in terms of the roots of unity.  
**How to Achieve**: Analyze the equation \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) and relate \( z - \sqrt{3} \) to the roots of unity.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \) means \( z - \sqrt{3} \) is an \( n \)-th root of unity. Thus:  
\[ z - \sqrt{3} = e^{2\pi i m / n}, \quad m = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1. \]  
Solving for \( z \), we get:  
\[ z = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n}. \]  
For \( z \) to be a common root, it must also satisfy \( z^n = 1 \), so \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} \) for some \( k \). This leads to the equation:  
\[ e^{2\pi i k / n} = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n}. \]  
[/IMP]

### Step 6: Validation
[PLANNING]
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Verify that the equation \( e^{2\pi i k / n} = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \) is a valid condition for finding a common root.  
**How to Achieve**: Check if the equation is mathematically consistent and aligns with the problem’s requirements.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
The equation \( e^{2\pi i k / n} = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \) equates a root of unity (left-hand side) to a complex expression involving a real shift by \( \sqrt{3} \) and another root of unity (right-hand side). This is consistent with the problem, as \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} \) must be a root of \( z^n = 1 \), and \( z = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \) ensures \( z - \sqrt{3} = e^{2\pi i m / n} \), satisfying \( (z - \sqrt{3})^n = 1 \). The challenge is to find \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \) such that the magnitudes and angles align. Since the left-hand side has magnitude 1, we need:  
\[ |\sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n}| = 1. \]  
Compute the magnitude:  
\[ |\sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n}|^2 = (\sqrt{3} + \cos(2\pi m / n) + i \sin(2\pi m / n))(\sqrt{3} + \cos(2\pi m / n) - i \sin(2\pi m / n)). \]  
This gives:  
\[ |\sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n}|^2 = 3 + 1 + 2\sqrt{3} \cos(2\pi m / n) = 4 + 2\sqrt{3} \cos(2\pi m / n). \]  
Set this equal to 1:  
\[ 4 + 2\sqrt{3} \cos(2\pi m / n) = 1 \implies 2\sqrt{3} \cos(2\pi m / n) = -3 \implies \cos(2\pi m / n) = -\frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}}. \]  
Since \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we have \( \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{3}{2 \cdot 1.732} \approx 0.866 \), so:  
\[ \cos(2\pi m / n) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]  
This is valid since \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx -0.866 \) is within the range of the cosine function (\([-1, 1]\)).  
[/IMP]

### Step 7: Reach Goal
[PLANNING]
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Solve for \( n \) such that \( \cos(2\pi m / n) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), and find the smallest positive integer \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Determine the values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the cosine equation, ensuring \( z \) is a common root.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
We need:  
\[ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{n}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]  
The angle where \( \cos \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) is:  
\[ \theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi l \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2\pi l, \quad l \in \mathbb{Z}. \]  
Thus:  
\[ \frac{2\pi m}{n} = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi l \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{2\pi m}{n} = \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2\pi l. \]  
Simplify the first case:  
\[ \frac{2m}{n} = \frac{5}{6} + 2l \implies 12m = 5n + 12nl \implies 12m = n(5 + 12l). \]  
Thus, \( n \) must divide \( 12m \), and we need the smallest positive integer \( n \). Test the second case:  
\[ \frac{2m}{n} = \frac{7}{6} + 2l \implies 12m = 7n + 12nl \implies 12m = n(7 + 12l). \]  
Again, \( n \) divides \( 12m \). To find the smallest \( n \), assume \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} = \sqrt{3} + e^{2\pi i m / n} \), and test small \( n \). For simplicity, let’s try the magnitude condition and solve numerically later if needed. Since \( n \) divides \( 12m \), try \( n = 6 \) (as angles suggest periodicity related to 6):  
\[ \frac{2\pi m}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \implies \frac{\pi m}{3} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \implies m = \frac{5}{2}, \]  
which is not an integer. Try the second case:  
\[ \frac{2\pi m}{6} = \frac{7\pi}{6} \implies \frac{\pi m}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{6} \implies m = \frac{7}{2}, \]  
also not an integer. Try \( n = 12 \):  
\[ \frac{2\pi m}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \implies \frac{\pi m}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \implies m = 5. \]  
Check:  
\[ z - \sqrt{3} = e^{2\pi i \cdot 5 / 12} = e^{5\pi i / 6}, \quad z = \sqrt{3} + e^{5\pi i / 6}. \]  
Compute \( |z| \):  
\[ e^{5\pi i / 6} = \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2}, \]  
\[ z = \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2}, \]  
\[ |z|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1. \]  
Thus, \( z = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2} \) is a 12th root of unity:  
\[ z^{12} = \left( e^{2\pi i \cdot 1 / 12} \right)^{12} = e^{2\pi i} = 1. \]  
Check the other condition:  
\[ z - \sqrt{3} = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2} \right) - \sqrt{3} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \frac{1}{2} = e^{5\pi i / 6}, \]  
\[ (z - \sqrt{3})^{12} = \left( e^{5\pi i / 6} \right)^{12} = e^{10\pi i} = 1. \]  
This satisfies both equations. Now, check if a smaller \( n \) works (e.g., \( n = 6 \)):  
\[ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{6}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies \frac{\pi m}{3} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \text{ or } \frac{7\pi}{6}, \]  
which we found gives non-integer \( m \). Thus, \( n = 12 \) is likely the smallest.

**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Current Goal**: Confirm that \( n = 12 \) is the smallest positive integer by checking smaller \( n \).  
**How to Achieve**: Test values of \( n < 12 \) (e.g., \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 \)) to ensure no smaller \( n \) satisfies the condition.  
[/PLANNING]

[IMP]
Test smaller \( n \):  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( z = 1 \), then \( z - \sqrt{3} = 1 - \sqrt{3} \), and \( (1 - \sqrt{3})^1 = 1 - \sqrt{3} \neq 1 \). No common root.  
- For \( n = 2 \): Roots of \( z^2 = 1 \) are \( z = 1, -1 \). Check: \( (1 - \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 2\sqrt{3} \neq 1 \), \( (-1 - \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 2\sqrt{3} \neq 1 \). No common root.  
- For \( n = 3 \): Roots are \( e^{2\pi i k / 3} \), \( k = 0, 1, 2 \). Try \( z = e^{2\pi i / 3} \):  
  \[ z - \sqrt{3} = -\frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \sqrt{3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{3} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \]  
  \[ |z - \sqrt{3}|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{4} + \sqrt{3} + 3 + \frac{3}{4} \neq 1. \]  
  Not a root of unity. Similar checks for other roots fail.  
- For \( n = 6 \): From earlier, \( \cos(2\pi m / 6) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) gives non-integer \( m \).  
Since no smaller \( n \) works, \( n = 12 \) is the smallest.
