### Problem Statement
We need to find the probability that the last of six two-letter words, formed by randomly pairing twelve letters \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \), contains the letter \( G \). Each pair is arranged alphabetically (e.g., \( BA \) becomes \( AB \)), and the six resulting words are listed in alphabetical order. The probability is expressed as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to compute \( m + n \).

**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  
1. Determine the total number of ways to form six two-letter words from the twelve letters.  
2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the last word in the alphabetically ordered list contains \( G \).  
3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the total number of ways to form six two-letter words from the twelve letters \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \). This involves pairing the letters randomly into six pairs, arranging each pair alphabetically, and listing the six words in alphabetical order. We will calculate the number of ways to pair the letters, as the alphabetical ordering within pairs and among words is deterministic.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
To find the total number of ways to pair twelve letters into six pairs:  
- We have 12 letters to divide into 6 unordered pairs. The number of ways to choose 6 pairs is the number of perfect matchings of 12 items.  
- The number of ways to pair \( 2n \) items into \( n \) pairs is given by the double factorial:  
  \[
  \frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!}
  \]  
  For \( n = 6 \):  
  \[
  \frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6!}{2^6 \cdot 6!} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7}{64}
  \]  
  Compute:  
  \[
  12 \cdot 11 = 132, \quad 132 \cdot 10 = 1320, \quad 1320 \cdot 9 = 11880, \quad 11880 \cdot 8 = 95040, \quad 95040 \cdot 7 = 665280
  \]  
  \[
  \frac{665280}{64} = 10395
  \]  
Thus, the total number of ways to form the six pairs is 10395. Since each pair is arranged alphabetically (e.g., \( BA \to AB \)) and the six words are listed in alphabetical order, this does not affect the number of pairings, as the ordering is deterministic.

[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Track the hierarchy of goals and highlight the current goal.  
[/PLANNING]  
[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Find the probability that the last word contains \( G \), expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \), and compute \( m + n \).  
  - Subgoal 1: Determine the total number of ways to form six two-letter words (completed: 10395 ways).  
  - Subgoal 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the last word contains \( G \).  
  - Subgoal 3: Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
  - Subgoal 4: Express the probability as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) in simplest form and find \( m + n \).  
**Current Goal**: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the last word in the alphabetically ordered list contains \( G \).  
[/REVIEW]

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the subgoal of finding favorable outcomes where the last word contains \( G \).  
1. Identify the conditions for the last word in the alphabetical list to contain \( G \).  
2. Determine the possible letters that can be paired with \( G \) in the last word.  
3. Calculate the number of ways to form pairings where the last word contains \( G \).  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to identify the conditions for the last word in the alphabetically ordered list to contain \( G \). The last word is the lexicographically largest among the six two-letter words. We need to determine when \( G \) appears in this word, considering that each pair is arranged alphabetically (e.g., \( G \) with \( X \) becomes \( GX \) if \( X > G \), or \( XG \) if \( X < G \)).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
The six two-letter words are listed in alphabetical order, so the last word is the one with the largest first letter (since pairs are internally sorted, the first letter of a word \( XY \) is \( \min(X, Y) \)). For the last word to contain \( G \):  
- Suppose the last word is \( XY \), with \( X < Y \), so the first letter is \( X \).  
- For \( XY \) to be the last word, \( X \) must be the largest first letter among all six words.  
- The word \( XY \) contains \( G \), so either \( X = G \) or \( Y = G \).  
- **Case 1: \( X = G \), so the word is \( GY \), where \( Y > G \) (i.e., \( Y \in \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \))**.  
  - The first letter is \( G \). For \( GY \) to be the last word, no other word can have a first letter greater than \( G \). Since the first letter of a word is the minimum of its two letters, all other words must have their first letter \( \leq G \).  
  - This means all other pairs must be formed from letters \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, Y \} \), and their first letters (the minimum of each pair) must be \( \leq G \).  
- **Case 2: \( Y = G \), so the word is \( XG \), where \( X < G \) (i.e., \( X \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \))**.  
  - The first letter is \( X < G \). For \( XG \) to be the last word, all other words must have first letters \( \leq X \).  
We will compute the number of favorable outcomes in the next step by considering these cases.  
[/IMP]

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of ways to form pairings where the last word contains \( G \), focusing on Case 1 (\( G \) paired with \( Y \in \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \)) and Case 2 (\( X \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \) paired with \( G \)). For each case, we need to ensure the word containing \( G \) is the last in the alphabetical order.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
**Case 1: The last word is \( GY \), where \( Y \in \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \)**  
- There are 5 choices for \( Y \): \( \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \).  
- Pair \( G \) with \( Y \), forming the word \( GY \). The first letter is \( G \).  
- The remaining 10 letters are \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, Y' \} \), where \( Y' \) is the complement of \( Y \) in \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \) (e.g., if \( Y = H \), then \( Y' \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \)).  
- These 10 letters form 5 pairs. For \( GY \) to be the last word, the first letter of each of the other 5 words (i.e., the minimum of each pair) must be \( \leq G \). Since \( Y > G \), we need the 5 pairs to be formed such that their first letters are from \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \).  
- For each \( Y \), exclude \( Y \) from the 12 letters, leaving 11 letters. Pair \( G \) with \( Y \), leaving 10 letters to form 5 pairs.  
- Number of ways to pair 10 letters into 5 pairs:  
  \[
  \frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5!}{2^5 \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6}{32} = 945
  \]  
- Check if all pairs have first letters \( \leq G \): Since the remaining letters include at most one letter \( > G \) (i.e., \( Y' \)), we need to ensure that when \( Y' > G \), it is paired with a letter \( \leq G \). This is complex, so let’s try Case 2 first and revisit if needed.  

**Case 2: The last word is \( XG \), where \( X \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \)**  
- There are 6 choices for \( X \): \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \).  
- Pair \( X \) with \( G \), forming the word \( XG \). The first letter is \( X \).  
- The remaining 10 letters are \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L \} \setminus \{ X \} \), forming 5 pairs.  
- For \( XG \) to be the last word, the first letter of each of the other 5 words must be \( \leq X \).  
- For each \( X \), compute the number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters such that all 5 pairs have first letters \( \leq X \):  
  - If \( X = A \), letters available are \( \{ B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L \} \). We need 5 pairs with first letters \( \leq A \), but since all letters are \( > A \), no pairs are possible (0 ways).  
  - If \( X = B \), letters are \( \{ A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L \} \). Need first letters \( \leq B \). Possible first letters: \( \{ A, B \} \).  
  - If \( X = F \), letters are \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L \} \). Need first letters \( \leq F \). Possible first letters: \( \{ A, B, C, D, E \} \).  
- This suggests we need to compute for each \( X \). Let’s try a simpler approach by focusing on the last word’s first letter.  

**Revised Approach**: Compute favorable outcomes by fixing the last word’s first letter.  
- The last word has the largest first letter, say \( Z \), where \( Z \) is the minimum of the pair’s letters.  
- For the last word to contain \( G \), it is either \( GZ \) (where \( Z > G \)) or \( XG \) (where \( X < G \)).  
- Sum over possible first letters of the last word:  
  - **First letter \( Z = G \)**: Word is \( GY \), \( Y \in \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \).  
    - Choose \( Y \): 5 choices.  
    - Remaining 10 letters form 5 pairs, all with first letters \( \leq G \).  
    - Letters available depend on \( Y \). Assume \( Y = H \), remaining letters: \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, K, L \} \).  
    - Need 5 pairs with first letters in \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \). Compute ways to pair 10 letters: 945 ways.  
  - **First letter \( Z < G \)**: Word is \( ZG \), \( Z \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \).  
    - Choose \( Z \): 6 choices.  
    - For each \( Z \), remaining 10 letters form 5 pairs with first letters \( \leq Z \).  
    - For \( Z = F \), letters are \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L \} \), need first letters \( \leq F \).  

This is getting complex. Let’s try a combinatorial approach focusing on \( G \).  
- Pair \( G \) with each possible letter and check if the resulting word is the last.  
- Total favorable cases: For each pair containing \( G \), compute the number of valid configurations.  

[/IMP]

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Backtrack (Planning)**  
The current approach is becoming overly complex. Return to an earlier state and try a simpler method to calculate favorable outcomes, focusing on pairing \( G \) with each possible letter and determining when the resulting word is the last.  
[/PLANNING]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the last word contains \( G \). We will pair \( G \) with each possible letter and count configurations where the resulting word is lexicographically last.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
Consider \( G \) paired with another letter \( X \). The word is either \( GX \) (if \( X > G \)) or \( XG \) (if \( X < G \)). The last word has the largest first letter among all words.  
- **Total pairs**: 11 choices for \( X \): \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L \} \).  
- For each \( X \), form the pair \( \{ G, X \} \). Remaining 10 letters form 5 pairs.  
- Compute the number of ways the word containing \( G \) is the last:  
  - **Case 1: \( X > G \), word is \( GX \)** (\( X \in \{ H, I, J, K, L \} \), 5 choices).  
    - First letter is \( G \). Other 5 words must have first letters \( \leq G \).  
    - For \( X = H \), remaining letters: \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, K, L \} \).  
    - Need 5 pairs from these 10 letters, all with first letters in \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \).  
    - Choose 10 letters into 5 pairs:  
      \[
      \frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!} = 945
      \]  
    - Check first letters: Since \( I, J, K, L > G \), ensure they are paired with \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \).  
    - Number of ways to pair \( \{ I, J, K, L \} \) with \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \) (4 with 6):  
      \[
      \frac{6!}{2!} = 360
      \]  
    - Remaining 2 letters (e.g., \( E, F \)) form 1 pair: 1 way.  
    - Total for \( X = H \): \( 360 \cdot 1 = 360 \).  
    - Same for \( X = I, J, K, L \): \( 5 \cdot 360 = 1800 \).  
  - **Case 2: \( X < G \), word is \( XG \)** (\( X \in \{ A, B, C, D, E, F \} \), 6 choices).  
    - First letter is \( X \). Other 5 words must have first letters \( \leq X \).  
    - For \( X = F \), remaining letters: \( \{ A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L \} \).  
    - Need 5 pairs with first letters \( \leq F \). Possible first letters: \( \{ A, B, C, D, E \} \).  
    - Choose 5 letters from \( \{ A, B, C, D, E \} \): \( \binom{5}{5} = 1 \).  
    - Pair these 5 with the remaining 5 (\( H, I, J, K, L \)): \( 5! = 120 \).  
    - Total for \( X = F \): Netsky, Joseph; Combs, John (2013-01-01). Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. Cengage Learning. p. 120.  
    - For \( X = E \): First letters from \( \{ A, B, C, D \} \), 4 choices, similar logic yields 24 ways per choice.  
    - Total for \( X = A, B, C, D, E \): \( 5 \cdot 24 = 120 \).  

Total favorable outcomes: \( 1800 + 120 = 1920 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to compute the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes and express it as \( \frac{m}{n} \).  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- Total outcomes: 10395 (from Step 2).  
- Favorable outcomes: 1920 (from Step 8).  
- Probability:  
  \[
  \frac{1920}{10395} = \frac{1920 \div 15}{10395 \div 15} = \frac{128}{693}
  \]  
- Check if \( 128 \) and \( 693 \) are coprime:  
  - GCD(128, 693): \( 128 = 2^7 \), \( 693 = 3^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \), so GCD = 1.  
- Thus, \( m = 128 \), \( n = 693 \), and \( m + n = 128 + 693 = 821 \).  
[/IMP]

### Step 10
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the calculations of total and favorable outcomes to ensure correctness.  
[/PLANNING]  
[IMP]  
- **Total outcomes**:  
  \[
  \frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!} = \frac{479001600}{64 \cdot 720} = 10395
  \]  
  Confirmed correct.  
- **Favorable outcomes**:  
  - Case 1: \( 5 \cdot 360 = 1800 \).  
  - Case 2: \( 120 \).  
  - Total: \( 1800 + 120 = 1920 \).  
  - Probability: \( \frac{1920}{10395} = \frac{128}{693} \).  
  - GCD check confirms \( 128 \) and \( 693 \) are coprime.  
The calculations are consistent.  
[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The probability that the last word contains \( G \) is \( \frac{128}{693} \), where \( m = 128 \), \( n = 693 \), and \( m + n = 128 + 693 = 821 \).  
\[
\boxed{821}
\]
