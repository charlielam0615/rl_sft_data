### Problem Statement
Bruno and Brutus are running on a circular track with a 20-foot radius. Bruno completes 5 laps every hour, while Brutus completes 7 laps every hour. They start at the same point but run in opposite directions. We need to determine how far along the track's circumference (in feet) from the starting point they are when they meet for the sixth time, excluding the moment they start running as a meeting point.

### Step 1
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Forward Subgoaling (Planning)**  
Break down the problem into forward-looking intermediate subgoals to solve it systematically.  

1. Calculate the circumference of the track to understand the total distance of one lap.  
2. Determine the speeds of Bruno and Brutus in terms of distance per unit time.  
3. Find the relative speed of Bruno and Brutus since they run in opposite directions.  
4. Calculate the time intervals at which they meet on the circular track.  
5. Identify the time of the sixth meeting.  
6. Determine their positions on the track at the sixth meeting relative to the starting point.

### Step 2
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the circumference of the track. This can be achieved by using the formula for the circumference of a circle, \( C = 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
The radius of the track is 20 feet. The circumference is:  
\[ C = 2 \pi \times 20 = 40 \pi \text{ feet} \]  
This is the total distance of one lap around the track.  

[/IMP]

### Step 3
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine the speeds of Bruno and Brutus in terms of distance per unit time. This can be achieved by multiplying their lap rates (laps per hour) by the circumference of the track to get their speeds in feet per hour.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Bruno completes 5 laps per hour, and Brutus completes 7 laps per hour. Given the circumference is \( 40 \pi \) feet:  
- Bruno’s speed: \( 5 \times 40 \pi = 200 \pi \text{ feet per hour} \).  
- Brutus’s speed: \( 7 \times 40 \pi = 280 \pi \text{ feet per hour} \).  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 4
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to find the relative speed of Bruno and Brutus since they run in opposite directions. This can be achieved by adding their speeds, as their relative speed determines how quickly they close the distance between each other on the circular track.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Since Bruno and Brutus run in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:  
\[ 200 \pi + 280 \pi = 480 \pi \text{ feet per hour} \].  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 5
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to calculate the time intervals at which Bruno and Brutus meet. They meet when the distance they’ve collectively covered (based on their relative speed) is a multiple of the track’s circumference. We need the time for the sixth meeting.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
They meet when the relative distance covered is a multiple of the circumference \( 40 \pi \). The time to complete one lap relative to each other is:  
\[ t_1 = \frac{40 \pi}{480 \pi} = \frac{40}{480} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ hour} \].  
They meet every \( \frac{1}{12} \) hour. For the sixth meeting:  
\[ t_6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} \].  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 6
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the time of the sixth meeting by ensuring the calculation aligns with the problem’s conditions. We check if the relative distance covered at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour is consistent with six meetings.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
At \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour, the relative distance covered is:  
\[ 480 \pi \times \frac{1}{2} = 240 \pi \text{ feet} \].  
The number of meetings is the number of times they cover the circumference:  
\[ \frac{240 \pi}{40 \pi} = 6 \].  
This confirms they meet exactly 6 times at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour, validating the calculation.  

[/IMP]

---

### Step 7
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Reach Goal (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to determine Bruno’s position on the track at the sixth meeting relative to the starting point. Since they meet at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour, we calculate the distance Bruno runs and find his position modulo the circumference.  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Bruno’s speed is \( 200 \pi \text{ feet per hour} \). At \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour:  
\[ \text{Distance run by Bruno} = 200 \pi \times \frac{1}{2} = 100 \pi \text{ feet} \].  
The position on the track is the distance modulo the circumference:  
\[ 100 \pi \mod 40 \pi = 100 \pi - 2 \times 40 \pi = 100 \pi - 80 \pi = 20 \pi \text{ feet} \].  
Thus, Bruno is \( 20 \pi \approx 62.83 \text{ feet} \) from the starting point.  
Since they meet, Brutus is at the same position. The distance along the circumference from the starting point is \( 20 \pi \text{ feet} \).  

[/IMP]

### Step 8
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Track Goals (Review)**  
Maintain a goal-management system and list all goals, highlighting the current goal.  

[/PLANNING]  

[REVIEW]  
**Goal Hierarchy**:  
- Main Goal: Determine the distance along the track’s circumference from the starting point when Bruno and Brutus meet for the sixth time.  
  - Subgoal 1: Calculate the circumference of the track (Completed: \( 40 \pi \text{ feet} \)).  
  - Subgoal 2: Determine the speeds of Bruno and Brutus (Completed: \( 200 \pi \text{ feet/hour} \) and \( 280 \pi \text{ feet/hour} \)).  
  - Subgoal 3: Find the relative speed (Completed: \( 480 \pi \text{ feet/hour} \)).  
  - Subgoal 4: Calculate the time intervals for meetings (Completed: Every \( \frac{1}{12} \text{ hour} \)).  
  - Subgoal 5: Identify the time of the sixth meeting (Completed: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} \)).  
  - Subgoal 6: Validate the time of the sixth meeting (Completed).  
  - Subgoal 7: Determine the position at the sixth meeting (Completed: \( 20 \pi \text{ feet} \)).  
**Current Goal**: Review the goal hierarchy to ensure all steps are complete and consistent.  

All subgoals have been addressed, and the solution is consistent.

### Step 9
[PLANNING]  
**Action: Validation (Implementation)**  
**Meta-data**: The current goal is to validate the final answer by checking if Brutus’s position at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour matches Bruno’s, confirming they meet at \( 20 \pi \text{ feet} \).  

[/PLANNING]  

[IMP]  
Brutus’s speed is \( 280 \pi \text{ feet per hour} \). At \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) hour:  
\[ \text{Distance run by Brutus} = 280 \pi \times \frac{1}{2} = 140 \pi \text{ feet} \].  
Since they run in opposite directions, Brutus’s position relative to the starting point (clockwise, if Bruno runs counterclockwise) is:  
\[ 140 \pi \mod 40 \pi = 140 \pi - 3 \times 40 \pi = 140 \pi - 120 \pi = 20 \pi \text{ feet} \].  
Both are at \( 20 \pi \text{ feet} \) from the starting point, confirming they meet at this position.  

[/IMP]

### Final Answer
The distance along the track’s circumference from the starting point when Bruno and Brutus meet for the sixth time is \( 20 \pi \text{ feet} \), approximately 62.83 feet.
